0,2020/03/21,"Postpone Olympics, says Sharath Kamal","“As an athlete, I obviously want the Olympics to happen but it should not happen.”

India’s veteran table tennis player Sharath Kamal is in line to play his fourth Olympics in July-August but he wants the IOC to postpone the mega event due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“As an athlete, I obviously want the Olympics to happen but it should not happen.

“The epicentre of the virus will keep changing, first it was China, now it is Italy and Iran too is badly affected in Asia. I don’t see the scenario being safe for the Olympics to start on time,” the 37-year-old told PTI.

“Everyone is talking about social distancing but it is one thing which won’t be possible at the Olympics. Thousands of athletes would be staying in the same village,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/r9pcp1/article31130861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-SharathKamal,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/postpone-olympics-says-sharath-kamal/article31130854.ece
1,2020/03/21,How long until news if Olympics will open?,"IOC president Bach has repeatedly said it’s too early to announce a final decision

The Olympic flame has arrived in Japan from Greece. Next comes the torch relay around the country, which is scheduled to start on Thursday from Fukushima prefecture in northern Japan.

Organisers have asked crowds to be restrained, but have been imprecise about what that means. Greek officials last week stopped a relay there on the second day and did not resume because of crowd size.

In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, Japanese organisers and IOC president Thomas Bach say that the Games will open on July 24 at the $1.43 billion National Stadium in central Tokyo.

Bach has repeatedly said it’s too early to announce a final decision, saying he’s taking advice from a task force that includes the World Health Organisation.

But now there’s push back, mostly from athletes and former Olympians who are complaining: they can’t train, qualifying events have been cancelled, and the chaos is sure to favour some over others. Then there’s the question of bringing 11,000 athletes and staff together in the Olympic Village, and 4,400 Paralympians a month later.

Getting the flame to Japan represents a minor victory for both organisers and the IOC. Its symbolic presence could give the IOC space to postpone the Tokyo Olympics, leaving the symbol behind as a reminder of what’s still to come.

What is the deadline for making a final decision?

Bach surely knows, but he is not saying. In an interview with the New York Times Bach said cancellation is not on the agenda. That leaves only going ahead, or postponement, as the options. Empty venues seem to have been ruled out.

Who will make the final decision?

It will be made jointly with the IOC, the city of Tokyo, and the Japanese Olympic Committee. They are the three that signed the 81-page Host City Agreement, which spells out in enormous details all Games contingencies.

The IOC has all the leverage, though it will have to honour WHO suggestions and the interests of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The IOC has a reserve fund of about $2 billion and insurance to cover losses. The contract says termination can occur “... if the IOC has reasonable grounds to believe, in its sole discretion, that the safety of participants in the Games is seriously threatened or jeopardised for any reason, whatsoever.”

Tokyo is officially spending $12.6 billion to organise the Olympics, but a national audit says it’s at least twice that much.

How important is the torch relay to the IOC and local organisers?

It’s important symbolism for the Japanese government and Prime Minister Abe.

He is Japan’s longest-serving premier and hopes to use the Olympics to argue that the Fukushima area has recovered from the disaster nine years ago.

The government has dubbed these The Recovery Olympics. However, many residents are still living in temporary quarters after the earthquake, tsunami and meltdown of three nuclear reactors in 2011.

Getting the relay started from Fukushima also helps major IOC sponsors Coca-Cola and Toyota, who pay millions to give their brands exposure during the relay. Crowds are being asked to be restrained. This will not keep the images of the relay from being transmitted daily around the globe on television. Bach is expected to watch the relay when it reaches Hiroshima on May 18-19.

Any bookmaker taking odds?

An Irish bookmaker says 1-7 Games will not open as schedule on July 24.

A poll by Japanese news agency Kyodo this week showed 69.9% of Japanese questioned do not believe the Games will begin on time.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/c1o7zt/article31130747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22OLY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/how-long-until-news-if-olympics-will-open/article31130748.ece

3,2020/03/21,Indian tennis players work on future ventures,"Trying to make the most of the COVID-19-forced break

Swinging the racquet will not earn them money all their life, so a few Indian tennis players, forced out of Pro Tour due to the health crisis triggered by COVID-19, are utilising their time to work on career beyond tennis.

Almost all of them are restricted to doing fitness drills at home with courts and gyms out of bound.

Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan is spending time hitting at private courts and handling the marketing of their family resort in Puducherry.

“It obviously is unusual situation. We can hit at a few places where people have private space and obviously the gathering is small. A few players doing that. I am in Puducherry to help with my resort (K resort),” Jeevan told PTI.

The left-hander said he is working on developing a tennis facility at their family resort to host tournaments in future at a scenic location.

Mumbai-based Purav Raja has also busied himself in shaping up his business. “I am starting ‘Restrung India’, a racquet customising business. It’s about building your own racquet. I am spending some time on this now which was difficult being on road. This is fun, giving Indian players a chance to use best equipment,” he said.

“My wife is also helping me in this. But I still have to train and do my daily stuff. I am working on fitness and and getting stronger.”

Meanwhile, Prajnesh Gunneswraran said, “We are all having to sit around and wait. it’s not ideal. I hope this passes quickly. Everybody in the world is struggling.

Close to one billion people worldwide were confined to their homes on Saturday as the global COVID-19 death toll shot past 11,000 and U.S. States rolled out lockdown measures already imposed across swathes of Europe.

The pandemic has completely upended lives across the planet, restricting movement, shutting schools and forcing millions to work from home.

While President Donald Trump insisted the U.S. was “winning” the war against the virus, individual States dramatically ramped up restrictions, with New York and Illinois joining California in ordering residents to stay home.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The virus death toll surged past 11,000 worldwide, with 4,000 alone in worst-hit Italy where the daily number of fatalities has shot up relentlessly over the past week.

An estimated 900 million people are now confined to their homes in 35 countries around the world — including 600 million hemmed in by obligatory government lockdown orders — according to an AFP tally.

Message for the youth

While the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are the hardest hit by the virus, the World Health Organization warned that young people were also vulnerable.

“Today, I have a message for young people: you are not invincible. This virus could put you in hospital for weeks — or even kill you,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “Even if you don't get sick, the choices you make about where you go could be the difference between life and death for someone else.”

Italy reported its worst single day death toll on Friday, adding another 627 fatalities and taking its reported total to 4,032 despite efforts to stem the spread.

The nation of 60 million now accounts for 36% of the world's coronavirus deaths and its death rate of 8.6% among confirmed infections is significantly higher than in most other countries.

France, Italy, Spain and other European countries have ordered people to stay at home, threatening fines in some cases, while Bavaria became the first region in Germany to order a lockdown. Britain also announced restrictions, telling pubs, restaurants and theatres to close.

With virus fears gripping the U.S. , its largest state California — with over 1,000 cases and 19 deaths — told its 40 million residents to stay at home. New York state, which has reported over 7,000 cases and 39 deaths, followed suit on Friday, ordering its nearly 20 million residents to do the same from Sunday evening. Trump applauded the New York and California decisions, but said he did not think a nationwide lockdown was needed. “Those are really two hotbeds,” he said. “I don't think we'll ever find (a US-wide lockdown) necessary.”

Shortly after the President spoke, the Governor of Illinois ordered residents of the midwestern state to stay at home and the Connecticut governor did the same.

10,2020/03/21,COVID-19 | A range of factors are at play behind Italy’s coronavirus disaster,"From Italy’s relatively high age to its strained healthcare system to some old fashioned bad luck, experts list a range of factors.

Loads of people have been wondering why the beautiful Mediterranean country of Italy has become the new epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts list a range of reasons — from Italy’s relatively high age to its strained healthcare system to some old fashioned bad luck — that add up to a disaster not seen in generations.

None of the answers alone explain why the nation of 60 million accounts for over a third of the nearly 11,500 deaths officially reported across the 7.7-billion strong world.

Median age

One of the first factors almost everyone who looks at the figures points to is Italians’ average age. It is high.

Also read: Coronavirus | Vaccine was rapidly synthesised as novel coronavirus sequence was available, says virologist Gagandeep Kang

The median age of the overall population was 45.4 last year — greater than anywhere else in Europe. It is also seven years higher than the median age in China and slightly above that of South Korea. Figures released on Friday showed the age of Italians dying of COVID-19 averaging out at 78.5. Almost 99% of them were also suffering from at least one pre-existing condition or ailment. Italy’s mortality rate among those infected with the virus is thus a relatively high 8.6%. Yet, Japan’s median age of 47.3 makes it an even older nation than Italy — and it has just 35 officially registered deaths. So age is clearly not the only factor.

Some scientists think that it could really have been almost any other country after China. “I think the question of ‘Why Italy?’ is the most important question and it has a simple answer: No reason at all,” Yascha Mounk of Johns Hopkins University told Canada’s CBC television. “The only thing that makes Italy different is that the first couple of (locally-transmitted) cases arrived in Italy about 10 days before they arrived in Germany, the United States or Canada.”

Also read: Your COVID-19 queries answered

The grim reality learned across Italy’s devastated north is that diseases start spreading much faster once the healthcare system reaches its saturation point.

Old and frail patients who are turned away are extremely contagious.

More testing needed

The world has suddenly realised that it does not have enough test kits to screen for COVID-19. Nations such as Italy dealt with this problem by only testing those who already exhibited symptoms such as a fever and a dry cough. South Korea had the kits and the means to conduct more than 10,000 tests a day. Germany followed a similar model and its death rate began to drop once even the mild COVID-19 infections began being counted. This partially explains both why Italy’s mortality rate is so high and why COVID-19 was contained faster in some other countries.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4dyhao/article31131043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22-ITALY-TESTINGOFPEOPLE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-a-range-of-reasons-are-at-play-behind-italys-coronavirus-disaster/article31131044.ece
11,2020/03/21,"Iran, France carry out prisoner swap","Iranian authorities have released French academic Roland Marchal, who has been imprisoned in Iran since June 2019, a French presidency official said on Saturday.

Mr. Marchal is due to arrive in France around midday on Saturday, the official said.

French President Emmanuel Macron urged Iran to also release French citizen Fariba Adelkhah, who is still imprisoned, the official added.

Violation of sanctions

Iran and France have agreed to swap Mr. Marchal, held on security charges, and an Iranian detained by Paris over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions against Tehran, Iranian state media reported on Friday. France has released Jalal Ruhollahnejad, an Iranian engineer wanted by U.S. authorities over sanctions charges, state broadcaster IRIB has reported.

France had demanded that Iran release Mr. Marchal, a senior researcher at Sciences Po university whose arrest was reported by Paris in mid-October.

In May, a French court approved the extradition of Mr. Rouhollahnejad to the United States to face charges of attempting to illegally import U.S. technology for military purposes on behalf of an Iranian company which U.S. officials said was linked to the elite Revolutionary Guards. The detentions have complicated ties between the two countries during a period when Macron was seeking to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran.

Iran Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges.

The detentions have coincided with a protracted stand-off with Western powers prompted by a U.S. decision to withdraw from an international agreement to curb Iranian nuclear activities.

The Iranian judiciary’s news agency Mizan Online reported that Mr. Rohollahnejad had been freed by France on Friday.

12,2020/03/21,Chronicle of an arrest foretold,"The arrest of an editor has triggered an outcry against Pakistan’s handling of media freedom

On March 12, Pakistan’s anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), arrested Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman (in picture) the editor-in-chief of Jang Group, the largest media group in the country. The group owns the largest Urdu newspaper Jang and English daily The News, besides Geo News and other television channels.

Mr. Rehman was arrested on charges pertaining to a 34-year-old property transaction. Many in the media and Opposition parties see the arrest as the government’s way of muzzling the media. The Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists and many other national and international human rights and media groups have condemned the arrest. “We noted with concern the arrest of Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman. Press freedom, due process, and the rule of law are pillars of every democracy,” tweeted the official account of the U.S. Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs (SCA), signed by Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Alice Wells.

Firdous Ashiq Awan, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting, held a press conference on the matter, distancing the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government of Imran Khan from the arrest. Ms. Awan said the NAB is an independent institution and the arrest was not an attack on media freedom.

The NAB has been criticised by Opposition politicians for its one-sided functioning in the past. Right after Ms. Awan’s press conference, cable operators were told to either shut down Geo TV’s broadcast or move the channel to the last numbers on their respective cables. Geo staffers say the directives came from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) but its chairman denied this. It has been reported that in meetings with journalists, Prime Minister Khan criticised the Jang Group and Dawn. “Prime Minister Imran Khan can’t tolerate the voice of dissent. He has recently expressed his displeasure against Jang/Geo and daily Dawn. Arrest of Mir Shakeel ur Rehman is the first step. Dawn can be the next,” tweeted senior journalist Mazhar Abbas.

Selectivity and arbitrariness

Harris Khalique, a poet and secretary-general of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, said the arrest of Mr. Rehman is yet another example of selectivity and arbitrariness in the NAB’s conduct. “The regime is blatantly going after individuals it dislikes in the name of curbing corruption. I share the view of the wider journalist community and civil society in Pakistan that it is an attempt towards silencing any critical opinion expressed over the government's weak political and economic policies,” he told The Hindu.

Imran Aslam, President of Jang Group and Geo TV Network, told The Hindu that anybody who has been watching Pakistan’s media over the years would know that “this was an arrest foretold”. The Jang/Geo group has been facing intimidation, pressure and various kinds of threats for a long time now, he said. “Not just the management but our reporters and staff members have been harassed. There is a long litany that goes on and on.”

The arrest is a “body blow to all of us — those who have worked with him and those of us who have known him in a personal capacity as well”, Mr. Aslam added. “This is a direct attack on the freedom of the press. This isn’t just another case of accountability. This is probably because we were holding the NAB accountable. We have felt our space being encroached upon — for which we have fought for a long period of time. We have seen how these shadows had been lengthening.”

Senator Sherry Rehman said the arrest is open harassment of media. “First it was Dawn and other assorted journalists, and now The News. This government just wants megaphones that sing its praises and nothing else on air. The message to the media and the Opposition is clear: don’t be telling any truth to power, we will dig up old cases and put the NAB on your trail,” Ms. Rehman told The Hindu.

Opposition parties — including the PML-N and PPP — filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court against Mr. Rahman’s arrest, arguing it was part of a crackdown on the media by the government and an attack on freedom of expression.

On Wednesday, the High Court asked PEMRA to restore Geo to its original numbers on TV. Geo has now been restored to its original position but journalists remain concerned. According to a report in The News, “After failing to implicate Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman in a 34-year old land case, now efforts are afoot to fabricate new cases.”

As of Saturday, confirmed cases from three boxing stadiums in Bangkok totalled 104, just over a quarter of the national toll of 411. An actor, a major-general, a politician, a boxing trainer and a slew of ordinary fans are among the cases from the March 6 event.

On March 13, local celebrity Matthew Deane Chanthavanij posted a message on his Instagram account, claiming that he has the virus.

14,2020/03/21,Bangladesh readies itself for the COVID-19 battle,"Authorities have shut down an area, set up isolation units and kept a graveyard ready

Bangladeshis have begun to shut themselves down. A sub-district, about 125 km from Dhaka, has become the first potential hotspot for COVID-19 cases to come under partial lockdown. The local administration has shut public transport and shops, except grocery and drug stores, as at least 613 people have returned home to the area from European nations, mostly from Italy and Spain. The area, known as Shibchar in central Bangladesh, has sent about 10,000 people to Europe as migrant workers. “They are now coming back, turning the area into a risk zone,” said Shamsuddin Khan, chairman of the sub-district. “May God save us,” he said.

Mr. Khan is part of a team assigned to warn the residents against the growing risks of infections and order the migrant workers to stay indoors or in self-isolation.

Shibchar, home to 4,27,913 people, is just the first leg of the government’s unfolding war against the virus. It also sheds light on how COVID-19 has confined people to their homes in a remote corner of the world. The area is now a hotbed of frustration over how lives are being upended by the disease that was first detected in China’s Wuhan.

On the afternoon of March 18, Bangladesh announced the first death from COVID-19 — the 70-year-old patient was also suffering from a combination of diabetes, hypertension, and kidney and lung ailments. As the news broke, people started to leave Dhaka streets and hurry home. Many crowded shops to hoard basic household items to tide through days or weeks, in signs of panic buying. Santona, a sales clerk at an outlet of chain superstore Agora in Segunbagicha neighbourhood, said she went home late after work due to a sudden rush of customers.

People going inward

In times of crisis, fear gives way to a profound sense of solidarity. The virus is having an opposite effect, sending people inward and unmooring families from communities.

Like many Dhaka residents, Muhammad Hasan untethered himself from routines and activities: no weekend outings, no dining out with his children and wife. His employer, Bangladesh’s largest telecom company Grameenphone, has allowed him and many others to work from home.

Not just Grameenphone, but also other telecom companies, including Robi, are letting their employees work remotely as the country is beginning to retreat from public life. While he is busy at home working, Mr. Hasan has a different challenge of how to beat the boredom for his children. He renewed his Netflix subscription to binge-watch TV series.

The most obvious impact is on garment exports that account for 84% of Bangladesh’s total overseas sales. European and American retailers are cancelling clothing orders almost every day, costing the local manufacturers more than $100 million in lost business, as consumer spirits in the Western world are depressed, according to Rubana Huq, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. “We are facing a grave situation with the coronavirus,” Ms. Huq said, adding that the business drought would lead to financial disruption at the manufacturing companies.

There was initial confusion over how to respond to the outbreak. With infections on the rise and two septuagenarians dead, it appears that the administration’s efforts to limit the spread of the virus have accelerated. The celebrations of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s birth centenary have been scaled down. Amid mounting criticism, the government eventually shut schools across the country. The Army has been assigned to operate two quarantine camps, not far from the Dhaka airport. In addition, several hospitals have been designated for suspected virus cases. The Department of Archeology closed sites and museums to visitors. Dhaka University asked its students to vacate dormitories, days after it suspended classes. In a sad reminder of growing vulnerability to the virus, city corporation authorities in Dhaka have designated a graveyard for the dead. Local administrations in districts have ratcheted up surveillance. In the port city of Chittagong, another high-risk zone, the police banned social events in restaurants and community centres.

An uneasy quiet seems to have settled across the country, but some people like Ms. Santona and her co-workers choose to carry on, more concerned about their livelihoods. For them, social distancing is far from an option. The weekend means busy hours for them as more customers line up to stock up for a period of quarantine.

15,2020/03/21,The call for collective action,"A gathering in Colombo of feminists from S. Asia called for solidarity among rights activists

It was in the early 1980s that one of Sri Lanka’s foremost feminist scholars Kumari Jayawardena (in picture) wrote Feminism and Nationalism in the Third World, considered a classic in the academic and activist worlds.

About 30 years later, the London-based Verso books republished it, proving the book’s enduring relevance. Writing in The Guardian about it in 2017, noted British socialist feminist Sheila Rowbotham said: “More than three decades after it first came out, the book remains the best introduction to the history of women’s movements in Turkey, Egypt, Iran, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Korea and Japan.”

“There was a gap about our part of the world,” Ms. Jayawardena told The Hindu in an interview that year, on her motivations for writing it. “To discuss the knowledge and status of women today, it is important to know what they have gained and how,” she said. It was in that spirit that a group of feminists from the region decided to meet in Colombo in early March. They may have got their timing just right, convening barely days before COVID-19 brought South Asia, like much of the rest of the world, to a halt.

The reason that the feminist scholars and activists gathered at a seminar, supported by UN Women, was to brainstorm and come up with a declaration. Their inputs will feed into deliberations at a forum in Mexico scheduled later this summer, to mark 25 years since the Fourth World Conference on Women and adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995), which called for global action for ‘Equality, Development and Peace’.

The participants at the Colombo seminar were from Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. They represented different generations of women’s movements in the Global South and at times, very different perspectives too. That diversity was precisely what the organisers had hoped for. It wasn’t that one generation did not appreciate the work of the other, but they all felt there were serious gaps that demanded more collective thinking and action.

Human rights approach

They decided to avoid familiar ‘UN speak’ of Sustainable Development Goals, or the often-cited law and order approach, and instead focused on a human rights approach to women’s rights. The declaration is a feminist take on global concerns, ranging from climate change, violence against women, disappearance and extra-judicial killings, majoritarianism and authoritarianism to extremism. Apart from the document, the meeting also offered a chance for some introspection.

Speaking of a shift in women’s activism along the years, Radhika Coomaraswamy, a senior activist and former UN Under-Secretary-General who was involved in organising the seminar, noted that the subsequent generation of feminists were more focused on issues and at times, did not frame them holistically. “Also, South Asian feminist solidarity has weakened since the 1990s. There is perhaps solidarity nationally and even globally, but not regionally,” she told The Hindu. But the more worrying political reality facing women’s movements, she said, is the manner in which right-wing groups are “hijacking” feminist movements.

Subha Wijesiriwardena, a women’s rights activist in her 30s, agreed that regional solidarity could certainly be strengthened, but also pointed to other broader shifts in women’s rights activism that had now become way more “NGO-ised” and “donor-driven”. “At a micro level, each of our countries have become more insular with this idea of a nation being imposed by those governing us. Moreover, our generation grew up during the civil war in Sri Lanka, so that too has shaped our activism significantly,” she said.

The feminists also found out that the differences in perspective and positions were not merely generational. Some of the arguments in the discussions in Colombo were very political. For instance, on whether and how to include questions of identity based on sexuality, and rights tied to technology in the ambit of women’s rights.

According to participants, some resisted the idea of including sexuality and instead emphasised a framework centred on economic and social rights of women. It brought back a very fundamental question that the late Sri Lankan feminist Sunila Abeysekara raised in her famous essay ‘Sexuality: A feminist issue?’ almost 30 years ago.

While the discussions showed the differences even among “like-minded” feminists, for younger participants like Ms. Wijesiriwardena, it “re-ignited” the faith in the value of a gathering like this that allowed for such conversations. More than the seminar’s regional dimension, it was the inter-generational character that many found enriching. “It was an opportunity for us to be with that history while we confront emerging issues,” Ms. Wijesiriwardena said. It was on only fitting that participants invited Ms. Jayawardena and honoured her. The breadth and depth of her work, they know, will remain crucial to their struggles and the future of feminist history across the world.

16,2020/03/21,Brazil bangs pots and pans to protest,"A survey showed that 64% of Brazilians rejected the way Bolsonaro handled COVID-19 crisis

At 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, the city erupted in protest: cars honked on avenues, women banged pots and pans on their balconies, boys beat drums, and thousands shouted “Fora Bolsonaro!” (Bolsonaro out) from the windows. With people blinking the lights of their homes, the banging of utensils — a South American way of protesting against the government — rippled through posh condominiums and middle-class towers for 30 minutes.

Jair Bolsonaro, the President who has behaved erratically since the outbreak of COVID-19, has angered many Brazilians. Even after 23 government officials, who travelled with him to Florida recently, tested positive, Mr. Bolsonaro said on Friday he was not worried about a “little cold”. Earlier, he had said he would do another test to see if he was infected (he has already been tested thrice). Then, he launched a tirade against State Governors for “creating a hysteria” about the virus.

With more than 900 confirmed cases, 11 deaths and many suspected fatalities, Brazil is shivering with fear but Mr. Bolsonaro continues to send out confusing signals, upsetting the vast majority of middle class, which voted for him in 2018. A survey released on Thursday showed that 64% of Brazilians rejected the way Mr. Bolsonaro has handled the COVID-19 crisis, and 45% of people want him impeached. “People are feeling abandoned by the President. He has been talking about his birthday plans and calling out his supporters to the streets. There is no leadership,” says a top-level official in the Ministry of Health, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We are not prepared to handle this pandemic.” Brazilian healthcare workers are in panic: top private hospitals have run out of beds, doctors do not have enough tests kits, and public hospitals are reporting a shortage of sanitisers, masks and gloves. According to the Unified Healthcare System (SUS) data, the country has 61,219 respirators, but most of the equipment is concentrated in the southern States.

As horror stories of deaths because of the lack of ventilators in Italy come in, the people dependent on SUS, which is free and spread across the country, are worried sick. Outside a metro station just off Clinicas, a cluster of massive hospitals, Rodrigo Filho, 27, eagerly waits for his mother, who has gone inside to get a test. “We live far away and spent two hours in crowded trains and buses to get here. I am not sure if my mother will get tested. She is in a bad shape,” says Mr. Filho, who works as a carpenter. “As there are no testing centres near our house, I have to skip work to bring my mother here. If I lose my job, we are sunk.”

With many offices shut, many middle-class Brazilians are in self-isolation. But as pubs, restaurants, malls and factories are still open, the working class have to choose between working or sitting at home. For 40% of the people who are in the informal sector, falling sick is not an option. As the virus is now transmitting locally in all 29 States, SUS is under a great stress.

Awaiting disaster

In a shocking statement on Friday, federal Health Minister Luiz Mandetta spelled out the disaster that awaits the country. “The virus here is following the growth graph in European countries. The COVID-19 cases will peak here in mid-April and our healthcare system will collapse,” said Mr. Mandetta. “The graph will start falling quickly only in September.”

Till a few years ago, Brazil had one of the best healthcare systems in the developing world. During the Workers Party government between 2003 and 2016, the country spent 8% of GDP on health, created a network of emergency units and invited thousands of Cuban doctors to work in remote areas. “The last time there was a global pandemic, AIDS, Brazil contained the transmission much effectively than the U.S. and many European countries,” said Brian Mier, the co-editor of Brasil Wire news portal.

The system suffered a setback in 2017 when the Michel Temer government put a spending cap on healthcare for 20 years and cut the minimum health budget guaranteed by the Constitution by $210 million. In 2019, Mr. Bolsonaro asked the Cuban doctors to leave Brazil, and cut the health budget by $250 million.

But in this difficult time, ordinary Brazilians have not lost faith in their doctors and nurses. On Friday evening, people across the country — from the slums of Rio de Janeiro to shiny buildings in Sao Paulo’s leafy neighbourhoods — stood on their balconies to applaud the healthcare professionals fighting the virus. After several rounds of clapping, many began to beat their pans and pots amid loud shouts of “Bolsonaro out!”

17,2020/03/21,"COVID-19 | Mauritius records first death, confirmed cases touch 14","There were just three confirmed cases in the island nation on March 19 when Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth appealed to the country’s 1.3 million citizens to stay indoors for 14 days.

Mauritius has recorded its first death from coronavirus, the Health Minister said Saturday, just the third in sub-Saharan Africa, as the archipelago nation imposed a lockdown to contain the outbreak.

“There have been 14 confirmed cases so far, one of which died on Thursday evening,” Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal said, without providing details about the deceased patient. Mauritius, some 1,800 km (1,100 miles) off the eastern coast of Africa, went into lockdown Friday, with the country’s citizens told to stay indoors for 14 days.

There were just three confirmed cases in Mauritius on Thursday when Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth appealed to the country’s 1.3 million citizens to obey the order. “I ask the people of Mauritius to stay inside their home,” he said in a televised evening address to the nation.

Flights into the Indian Ocean nation of four volcanic islands had already been severely curtailed to curb the spread of the virus, with passengers from the EU — a major market for tourists — among those barred. Mauritius has evolved from a poor, agriculture-based economy to a relatively wealthy financial services hub and tourist beacon that prides itself as a stable democracy in a sometimes volatile neighbourhood.

Just two other deaths from coronavirus have been recorded in sub-Saharan Africa: one in Burkina Faso and the second in Gabon. The total of known cases across all of Africa, compiled by AFP, stands at over 900 and is rising fast, after lagging other continents.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-mauritius-records-first-death-confirmed-cases-rise/article31129573.ece
18,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | No new local COVID-19 cases for third day straight in China; sharp rise in cases from abroad,"The country’s National Health Commission said that on March 20, seven deaths and 36 new suspected cases were reported on the mainland, with all the deaths reported from Hubei province and its capital Wuhan.

China has not reported any local coronavirus (COVID-19) cases for the third consecutive day but the country is facing a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases from abroad, a health official said on Saturday.

Seven more fatalities reported from the coronavirus’ epicentre of Hubei province, taking the death toll in the country to 3,255, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday.

The coronavirus death toll has gone up to 11,397 with more than 275,427 cases reported in over 160 countries and territories, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Italy has overtaken China as the worst-hit with over 4,000 deaths reported so far.

The NHC said on Saturday that no new domestically transmitted cases of COVID-19 were reported on the Chinese mainland for the third day in a row on Friday.

On Friday, seven deaths and 36 new suspected cases were reported on the mainland, with all the deaths reported from the virus’ epicentre Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, it said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland have reached 81,008 by the end of Friday, which included 3,255 deaths, 6,013 patients still undergoing treatment, 71,740 patients who have been discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

Facing a sharp increase of COVID-19 cases from abroad, China will take strict measures to prevent imported cases, spokesman of the NHC Mi Feng told media in Beijing on Saturday.

He said the total number of imported cases to the Chinese mainland increased by 216% to 269 from March 11 to 20.

He also noted that the mainland reported no new domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases for the third day in a row on Friday, and provincial-level regions except the hard-hit Hubei province had been clear of indigenous cases for nine days.

He called for unswerving efforts in preventing the COVID-19 epidemic from rebounding. The NHC said 41 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland on Friday from the people arriving from abroad, taking the total number of imported cases to 269.

While reporting about a steady increase in imported cases, the NHC did not specify whether the infected persons were foreigners or Chinese nationals returning from abroad.

China has imposed strict quarantine measures for all those returning from other countries.

Hong Kong reported 17 additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 20 preliminary positive cases on Saturday. With the 17 newly confirmed cases, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong has risen to 273.

Meanwhile Wuhan, which is under lockdown since January 23 as part of attempts by the government to isolate the COVID-19 epidemic, will reopen commercial outlets to residents in an orderly manner, local authorities said.

Commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases can resume business, state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Wuhan municipal bureau of commerce as saying.

Those outlets mainly include supermarkets, convenience stores, fresh food shops, fruit and vegetable shops and others that supply daily necessities.

Each household can send one person a day to go shopping with a one-time pass certificate or an electronic health code. Each shopping trip will be limited to within two hours, it said.

China is speeding up construction on major infrastructure projects to mitigate the economic impact of the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The country, which came to a grinding halt since January third week due to the coronavirus scare, has resumed the construction in nearly 90% of 11,000 key projects from March 20, Ou Hong, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), told media in Beijing.

In a breakdown, 97.8% of the 533 key transportation projects supervised by the NDRC have been under construction, with all the major railway projects resuming operation, said Zheng Jian, another official with the NDRC.

The construction on some 97% of major highway and waterway projects, 87% of airport projects, and 86% of water conservancy projects also resumed, Ou Hong added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dcyerd/article31129523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21IN-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-no-new-local-covid-19-cases-for-third-day-straight-in-china-sharp-rise-in-cases-from-abroad/article31129524.ece
19,2020/03/21,"In a first, India, France conduct joint patrols from Reunion Island","Defence sources confirmed that the exercise was conducted by a P-8I aircraft with French Navy personnel onboard.

India and France, For the first time, have conducted joint patrols from the Reunion Island, signalling New Delhi's intent to engage with friendly foreign partners in expanding its footprint in the Indian Ocean, focusing on the stretch between the East African coastline and the Malacca straits.

India has so far carried out Coordinated Patrols (CORPAT) only with maritime neighbours and had rejected a similar offer by the US.

“The Indian Navy conducted a joint patrol with with the French Navy last month from the Reunion Island. The patrol was conducted by a P-8I aircraft with French Navy personnel onboard,” two defence sources independently confirmed to The Hindu.

“We have robust engagement with the French”, one of them said. The surveillance was done in Southern Indian Ocean off Mauritius. “The P-8I was there for a week,” he stated.

There was greater understanding between India and France on each others concerns, especially in the maritime domain, the source said. “They also have capacity constraints there and we can share responsibilities. The patrols will be periodical. There is no set pattern,” the source added

As reported by The Hindu last November, visiting French Navy Chief Admiral Christophe Prazuck had stated that they were “looking forward to organising joint patrols with the Indian Navy” in 2020 and working on the precise objectives. Speaking at an event, he said the region of the patrols could be North Western Indian Ocean or Southern Indian Ocean “around the islands that are part of France.”

“France is a safe country for us, there will be no concerns in conducting joint patrols with them,” a third official stated on why France was the first country selected to conduct joint patrols. France is also the first country to deploy a Liaison Officer at the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre (IFC-IOR) as part of efforts to improve Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA).

Major strategic partner

France has steadily emerged as a major strategic partner for India with big ticket defence deals and increased military to military engagement. The Indian navy is currently inducting French Scorpene conventional submarines, being built in India under technology transfer, and the Indian Air Force will soon get the first batch of its 36 Rafale fighter jets.

Currently, under the ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy and broader maritime cooperation, the Indian Navy undertakes joint EEZ surveillance with Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius and CORPATs with Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia.

In early 2016, then U.S. Pacific Commander (now Indo-Pacific Command) Adm Harry Harris proposed the prospect of Indian and US navies conducting joint patrols, which was also advocated by other visiting senior U.S. military officers. However, this was rejected by India, and in 2018, then Navy Chief Adm Sunil Lanba stated that while India was looking at cooperative frameworks in the region to deal with common threats, efforts such as coordinated patrols and joint patrols would be done only with maritime neighbours.

The joint patrols, along with other activities, are part of the Navy’s increasing engagement in the Indian Ocean Region through capacity-building and joint activities for improving MDA and interoperability.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wru77h/article31130992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/India-France,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/in-a-first-india-france-conduct-joint-patrols-from-reunion-island/article31129323.ece

Anyone caught violating the curfew faces up to one year in prison.

Air raid sirens echoed across Jordan’s capital on Saturday to mark the start of a three-day curfew, the latest mass lockdown in the Middle East aimed at containing the coronavirus (COVID-19), which has claimed another 123 lives in Iran, home to the region’s worst outbreak.

The latest deaths bring Iran’s overall toll to 1,556 amid 20,610 confirmed cases, according to figures released by the country’s Health Ministry. Iran has faced widespread criticism for its lagging response to coronavirus outbreak, which has even infected and killed some senior officials.

In one of the strictest measures yet, Jordan has ordered all shops to close and all people to stay off the streets until at least Tuesday, when it plans to announce specific times for shopping. Anyone caught violating the curfew faces up to one year in prison.

Iran has been much slower to take action against coronavirus. It has urged people not to travel during the Persian New Year, a major national holiday, but many appear to be ignoring the guidance. Health Ministry spokesperson Kianoush Jahanpour said the number of cases has increased in many popular tourist destinations.

Iran has not ordered businesses to close, though many have done so on their own. Authorities only began closing popular religious pilgrimage sites earlier this week, long after the first virus cases were detected. There are concerns the country’s health-care infrastructure, weakened by severe U.S. sanctions, could be overwhelmed.

Most people only experience minor flu-like symptoms from the coronavirus and recover within a few weeks, but the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by those who appear well. It can cause severe illness, including pneumonia, in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health problems.

More than 2,75,000 people have been infected worldwide. The virus has killed more than 11,000 people, while more than 88,000 have recovered.

Several countries in the Middle East have closed schools, universities and non-essential businesses. Many are threatening fines or jail time to those caught violating the decrees.

Saturday is Mother’s Day in the Middle East, and many took to social media to lament the fact that they would not be able to visit family members. Iraq, which has reported 193 cases and 14 deaths, has struggled to maintain a week-long curfew in Baghdad as religious pilgrims have continued to try to visit a major Shiite Muslim shrine in the capital.

The tiny, energy-rich nation of Qatar is warning citizens and residents to honour home-quarantine rules. The state-run Qatar News Agency said authorities captured 10 people who broke the rules. It said those who disobey the orders could face prosecution.

In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian security forces arrested 20 Muslim preachers for allegedly violating a ban on holding Friday prayers, the Voice of Palestine reported. The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the West Bank, has closed mosques and barred all group prayers.

Abdallah Kmail, the governor of Salfit, said a village in the northern West Bank was locked down after a man who returned from Pakistan and tested positive for the virus participated in prayers held in violation of the ban. The man was an adherent of Salafism, an ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam, Mr. Kmail told the Voice of Palestine.

The governor said 250 people from the village of Qarawa Bani Hassan will be tested on Saturday.

The Palestinian Authority has reported 52 confirmed cases, including 17 who recovered. Jordan has reported 85 infections, including one who recovered. Qatar has reported 460 cases, including 10 who recovered.

In Egypt, which has reported 285 cases and eight deaths, there are growing calls for a more general lockdown.

Health Minister Hala Zayed urged the public to stay at home and practice social distancing after large crowds gathered for Friday prayers in different parts of the country.

21,2020/03/21,"Coronavirus | U.K. goes into shutdown as pubs, cinemas, leisure centres close doors","PM Boris Johnson was joined by his Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, at his daily Downing Street briefing during which the Indian-origin minister unveiled an unprecedented wage boost for people who find themselves facing hardship.

The UK began going into complete shutdown on Saturday after the government called on bars, pubs, cinemas, theatres and all other social venues to close their doors indefinitely to the public in response to the rapidly-spreading novel coronavirus pandemic.

The decision, that would be reviewed on a month-by-month basis, came a day after England registered its biggest jump in death toll of 39 to hit 177.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said all the venues usually used to bring people together must now close their doors to keep people physically apart.

Mr. Johnson said that after talks with all parts of the UK’s devolved governments, the collective decision was for cafes, pubs, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, theatres, cinemas, gyms and leisure centres to stop trading, though an option for a takeaway version for the food industry remains available.

These are places where people come together, and indeed the whole purpose of these businesses is to bring people together. But the sad thing is that today for now, at least physically, we need to keep people apart, he said.

Chief constables in every police force across the UK will begin engaging civil contingencies designed to respond to events such as rioting and terrorism to enforce the shutdown.

Scotland Yard warned staff that every available officer would be working 12-hour shifts and that they would be expected to use licensing laws to enforce the closure of venues that refused to comply with the guidelines.

The announcement has come as a massive blow to these businesses, which were already struggling with lower numbers of customers as increasingly people began working from home to follow the government’s advice on social distancing to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

Wage boost

Mr. Johnson was joined by his Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, at his daily Downing Street briefing during which the Indian-origin minister unveiled an unprecedented wage boost for people who find themselves facing hardship.

In a first-ever intervention, Mr. Sunak said that 80% of wages for those unable to work due to the crisis will be covered by the government.

“We are going to help workers of all kinds to get through this crisis. Supporting you directly in a way that government has never been done before, in addition to the package we have already set out for business,” said Mr. Johnson.

“The more effectively we follow the advice we are given, the faster this country will stage both a medical and an economic recovery in full,” he added.

He admitted that the new stringent social distancing measures were tough on the freedom-loving instincts of the British people but stressed that the country would collectively beat the virus.

The UK has already been under semi-lockdown measures but there were fears that many people were not taking the advice seriously enough, resulting in the forced closure of establishments as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases mounted to 3,983.

England’s deputy chief medical officer, Dr. Jenny Harries, reiterated that the government was not advising people against going outside but more about keeping a safe distance.

“We are saying, if you are going to go outside, go in a way that reduces your social contact,” she said.

Meanwhile, schools also closed their gates indefinitely to the majority of pupils across the country on Friday, with some remaining open with a skeleton staff to allow children of key workers such as healthcare workers and those in the food delivery industry so that their parents can carry on their crucial tasks through the crisis.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/657i5y/article31127693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LONDONKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-uk-goes-into-shutdown-as-pubs-cinemas-leisure-centres-close-doors/article31127696.ece

Two persons, including a woman, became the first fatalities of the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore, the country’s Health Ministry said on Saturday as the country announced a slew of measures to prevent the spread of the deadly disease that has infected 385 people in the island nation.

Singapore on Friday confirmed 40 new COVID-19 cases, including 30 imported infections, taking the total number to 385 in the country.

The two fatalities included a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man who died on Saturday, the Health Ministry said.

The woman was linked to the cluster at the Life Church and Missions Singapore and had a history of chronic heart disease and hypertension, reported Channel News Asia.

She showed COVID-19 symptoms on February 9 and was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on February 23 for pneumonia and tested positive for the disease the same day.

She developed serious complications and died at about 7.50 a.m.

The man, who had a history of heart disease, was admitted in a critical condition at NCID on March 13, after arriving in Singapore from Indonesia and passed away at 10.15 a.m.

Prior to his arrival in Singapore, he had been hospitalised in Indonesia for pneumonia.

While we all know that there will be fatalities in COVID-19 patients, we are deeply saddened by their passing,” Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said.

“I know Singaporeans will be worried and anxious. We must take courage and not give in to our fears. We have announced a series of safe distancing measures yesterday and we must all take the necessary precautions to keep ourselves and our families safe,” he said.

Out of the 385 cases in Singapore, a total of 131 have fully recovered from the infection. Of the 254 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, most are stable or improving.

To reduce the risk of local transmissions, authorities on Friday ordered all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants to be suspended.

New safe distancing measures were introduced for public venues such as retail shops and restaurants to ensure separation of at least 1 metre between customers.

A new TraceTogether mobile app was also launched to help with contact tracing efforts.

25,2020/03/21,Australia’s Bondi Beach closed after crowds defy coronavirus rules,"Health Minister Greg Hunt said the crowds on the country's most famous strip of sand were “unacceptable” as he reported the number of infections across Australia had risen sharply.

Australian officials closed Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach on Saturday after thousands of people flocked there in recent days, defying social distancing orders to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, amid an unusually warm autumn spell.

Health Minister Greg Hunt said the crowds on the country's most famous strip of sand were “unacceptable” as he reported the number of infections across Australia had risen sharply.

Mr. Hunt confirmed 874 cases, but Australian media later reported the tally exceeded 1,000 when updates from several states were taken into account. The death toll was seven, unchanged from a day earlier.

New South Wales state police minister David Elliott announced Bondi's closure, warning “this is going to become the new norm” if people did not comply with regulations that prohibit more than 500 people gathering at a non-essential event.

“This is not something we are doing because we are the fun police,” Mr. Elliott said in a televised news conference. “This is about saving lives.”

“We will be closing down the type of iconic activities that unfortunately we've come ... to love and adore about our lifestyle.”

Mr. Elliott said lifeguards who patrol the state's many beaches will conduct head counts and, if there are more than 500 people at any one location, the beach will be closed and people ordered to move on.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced stricter rules on socialising on Friday, requiring indoor venues such as bars and restaurants to maintain a density of no more than one person per four square metres (43 sq f) of floor space. The overall limits of 100 people gathered indoors and 500 outdoors remained in force.

In Victoria, the state government responded to public pressure and revoked an exemption given to Crown Resort Ltd's Melbourne casino from those tougher rules.

“We are practicing what we were told to do,” a Crown representative told Reuters by telephone.

Crown and Sydney rival Star Entertainment Group Ltd are licensed to operate a total of more than gaming 4,000 machines. Both introduced social distancing measures last week, including switching off every second electronic gaming machine and table, but their shares have tumbled on concerns about their future revenue.

The Australian response to the coronavirus pandemic, while unprecedented, has been less severe than in parts of Europe and North America where higher rates of infection have led to more sweeping public lock downs.

Schools in Australia remain open, with Morrison citing medical advice despite some criticism of that tactic.

However, Victoria state partially broke that national agreement on Saturday when it ordered public schools in the state to close for two days next week to trial the viability of online education for pupils.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zgd7hp/article31126201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSAUSTRALIA-BEACH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australias-bondi-beach-closed-after-crowds-defy-coronavirus-rules/article31126203.ece

“We welcome PM @narendramodi’s initiative to create an COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund and its pledge of USD 10million. Government of Maldives joins the initiative and pledge USD 200,000 to address issues emanating from COVID-19,” Mr. Shahid said in a tweet.

Nepal and Bhutan on Friday pledged nearly $1 million and $100,000 respectively to the SAARC Corona Emergency Fund.

Mr. Modi, later, took to Twitter to thank leaders of the two countries for their contribution.

“Gratitude to @PMBhutan Dr Lotay Tshering for his decision to contribute $100,000 to the COVID-19 Emergency Fund on behalf of the Bhutanese Government.” he tweeted.

“Deeply appreciate PM @kpsharmaoli’s announcement of contribution of NPR 10 crores to the COVID-19 Emergency Fund. It reflects Oli Ji’s commitment and support to the collective fight of SAARC countries against the pandemic,” he said.

Mr. Modi said it was wonderful to see SAARC leaders taking initiatives that are adding strength to the collective fight against coronavirus.

In a video conference on forming a joint strategy to fight COVID-19 in the SAARC region, Prime Minister Modi on March 15 proposed the emergency fund with an initial offer of USD 10 million from India and asserted that the best way to deal with the coronavirus pandemic was by coming together, and not growing apart.

27,2020/03/21,Kickboxing match in Bangkok leads to spike in coronavirus infections,"Confirmed cases of coronavirus infections from three boxing stadiums in Bangkok totaled 72, more than a fifth of the national toll of 322

Kickboxing aficionados came from all over Thailand to attend a major Muay Thai match at Bangkok’s indoor Lumpini Stadium on March 6. Dozens or more went home unknowingly carrying the coronavirus.

The wayward boxing fans led an inevitable rise in infections this month that forced the government to abandon its less than sturdy approach to combating COVID-19 that has failed to inspire public confidence.

As of Friday, confirmed cases from three boxing stadiums in Bangkok totaled 72, more than a fifth of the national toll of 322. An actor, a major-general, a politician, a boxing trainer and a slew of ordinary fans are among the coronavirus cases from the March 6 event.

It’s feared hundreds more in all corners of the country could be viral time bombs. Health officials take the threat seriously.

“The more people who report themselves, the easier it is for us to track down others with the virus before it’s too late.” said Dr. Thaveesin Visanuyothin, a spokesman for the Public Health Ministry.

But even as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha this past week announced measures to fight the spread of COVID-19 including postponing a major three-day holiday, shutting down schools and allowing provincial governors to close any gathering spaces he insisted the country was not going into shutdown.

Even a crackdown implemented this week on arrivals sends a mixed message. Instead of banning international flights, as several nations have done, foreign visitors must have health certificates affirming they are free of the virus. The requirement is impractical, because in many if not most countries, it’s hard to even get tested without showing symptoms of the illness.

Any illusion that Thailand would somehow avoid a spike in infections was dispelled this month with the discovery of a cluster case from a single discrete source. The infected people were a group of millennials who were reported to have been partying at an upmarket Bangkok nightspot with a visitor from Hong Kong. Health authorities scolded the partygoers for sharing drinks and cigarettes.

Just days later, a local celebrity in Muay Thai circles posted a message on his Instagram account. Muay Thai is the national sport, with a devoted fan base nationwide spanning social classes.

“This is NOT a joke, for those that have been in close contact with me the last few days please take precautions. I have the Covid-19 virus,” said the March 13 message from Matthew Deane Chanthavanij, next to a video of him wearing a black surgical mask.

Some people initially derided his post as a publicity stunt, for which he could be criminally prosecuted. It also exposed a second, potentially more dangerous cluster the Lumpini Stadium boxing crowd.

Matthew Deane, as he is usually called, is an actor, model, singer and athlete. The 41-year-old Australian-born is also a serious devotee of Muay Thai, and even owns a boxing gym.

The air-conditioned hall was hosting the first big Muay Thai event of the season. Eleven bouts started at 6 p.m and ended just after midnight. The crowd of about 5,000 roared every time punches and kicks were exchanged.

“We were squeezed against each other. Normally the place isn’t that crowded,” said Suwan Jitpinit, who traveled from his hometown in Sukhothai province, a 420-km (260-mile) drive.

“At other regular events, there would be about 1,500 to 2,000 people in the stadium but because this was a special match, there were many more people,” recalled the 37-year-old boxing critic. He stayed in Bangkok for a match at another stadium before going home on March 10.

On the drive home, he began to feel feverish and was shivering so much he had to ask someone else to drive. When he arrived that evening, he went to a local hospital and was diagnosed with tonsillitis. Not feeling any better three days later, he sought help from a bigger hospital in nearby Phitsanulok.

After hearing the news about Matthew Deane, he asked to be tested for coronavirus. The result came back positive. His wife was infected too, and their village in Sukhothai is now under quarantine.

Ordinary boxing fans from other provinces, both near Bangkok and in the north, the northeast and the south, have also tested positive for the disease.

Among them a local politician who is especially diligent in attending to his constituents in a province east of Bangkok.

According to reports in the Thai media, between the time he attended the Lumpini match and when he tested positive, Kitti Paopiamsap, head of the Chachoengsao provincial administration organisation, attended six weddings, six funerals, three community meetings (two of them with the elderly), three Buddhist ordinations, three fairs and at least four other public meetings.

“It is sad that the boxing event has aggravated the situation,” said Pinit Polkhan, who shared announcing duties with Matthew Deane and like him caught the virus. “Certainly, the boxing industry is taking a hard hit, and the whole country as well.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kwz586/article31126110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKTHAILAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kickboxing-match-in-bangkok-leads-to-spike-in-infections/article31126111.ece
28,2020/03/21,"Coronavirus | Panic buying, lockdowns may drive world food inflation: FAO, analysts","With over 270,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with periods such as World War Two and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

Lockdowns and panic food buying due to the coronavirus pandemic could ignite world food inflation even though there are ample supplies of staple grains and oilseeds in key exporting nations, a senior economist at FAO and agricultural analysts said.

The world's richest nations poured unprecedented aid into the global economy as coronavirus cases ballooned across Europe and the United States, with the number of deaths in Italy outstripping those in mainland China, where the virus originated.

With over 270,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with periods such as World War Two and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.

“All you need is panic buying from big importers such as millers or governments to create a crisis,” said Abdolreza Abbassian, chief economist at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).

“It is not a supply issue, but it is a behavioural change over food security,” he told Reuters by phone from Rome, the FAO headquarters. “What if bulk buyers think they can't get wheat or rice shipments in May or June? That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis.”

Consumers across the world from Singapore to the United States have queued at super markets in recent weeks to stock up on items ranging from rice and hand sanitizers to toilet paper.

The global benchmark Chicago wheat futures rose more than 6% this week, the biggest weekly gain in nine months, while rice prices in Thailand, the world's 2nd largest exporter of the grain, have climbed to the highest since August 2013.

France's grain industry is scrambling to find enough trucks and staff to keep factories and ports running as the panic buying of pasta and flour coincides with a surge in wheat exports.

Restrictions imposed by some European Union countries at their borders with other member states in response to the pandemic are also disrupting food supplies, representatives of the industry and farmers said.

However, global wheat stocks at the end of the crop marketing year in June are projected to rise to 287.14 million tonnes, up from 277.57 million tonnes a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates.

World rice stocks are projected at 182.3 million tonnes as compared with 175.3 million tonnes a year ago.

Food in the right place

Logistics are likely to be a major global issue, analysts said.

“There is about 140 million tonnes of corn that goes in ethanol in the United States and some of that can used for food as it won't be needed for fuel, given the drop in oil prices,” said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities

“The concern is having food at the right time in the right place.”

Asian buyers were inactive this week with uncertainty looming in the market.

“We are not sure about the demand. What it is going to look like in June or July?” said one Singapore-based purchasing manager at a flour milling company that has operations across Southeast Asia. “Restaurant business is down, and as a result demand is a bit soft right now.”

Asian wheat importers, including the region's top importer Indonesia, have been taking a bulk of the cargoes from the Black Sea region amid a global oversupply.

Oil exporting nations in the Middle East, which are also net grain importers, are likely to feel more financial pain with crude losing more than 60% of its value this year .

“Net oil exporters' capacity to buy grains has dropped given the fall in oil prices and depreciation in currencies,” said FAO's Abbassian.

“There will be less capacity to take policy actions to boost economies.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/rfzzc9/article24394033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-ISBS-FAO-NEWGO34B7L083jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-panic-buying-lockdowns-may-drive-world-food-inflation-fao-analysts/article31126079.ece
29,2020/03/21,U.S. seeks comments on tariff cuts for Chinese imports to aid coronavirus battle,"The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office said it would allow members of the public, businesses and government agencies ”to submit comments if they believe further modifications to the (Section) 301 tariffs may be necessary”

The Trump administration on Friday said it was soliciting public comments on lifting additional tariffs on Chinese imports that could help the United States battle the coronavirus pandemic, showing some flexibility in its trade war against Beijing.

The U.S. Trade Representative's (USTR) office said it would allow members of the public, businesses and government agencies ”to submit comments if they believe further modifications to the (Section) 301 tariffs may be necessary”

It said the move was part of an effort “to keep current on developments in our national fight against the coronavirus pandemic.”

The USTR has in recent weeks granted “Section 301” tariff exclusions for certain medical products from China, including medical masks, examination gloves and antiseptic wipes.

But as it battles to try to keep the U.S. economy from collapsing amid quarantine orders and halted commerce, the Trump administration so far has been resistant to broader removals of tariffs imposed over the past 20 months on some $370 billion worth of Chinese imports annually, despite calls from industry that this would be an instant tax cut worth tens of billions of dollars.

Trump considers his trade pressure on China among the biggest achievements of his presidency and a top argument for re-election in November.

The trade war has hit a vast range of Chinese goods with tariffs, from machinery and chemical feedstocks to semiconductors, printed circuit board and consumer goods.

In return, China has hit U.S. farm and other products with retaliatory tariffs, but has pledged to vastly increase purchases of these goods under a “Phase 1” trade deal that took effect Feb. 15.

USTR did not specify a deadline for submitting comments to a federal website https://www.regulations.gov/docket?D=USTR-2020-0014.

“This comment process does not replace the current exclusion process and supplements that process,” USTR said. “Submissions are limited to comments on products subject to the tariff actions and relevant to the medical response to the coronavirus.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ufwfc2/article30444933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP-XI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-seeks-comments-on-tariff-cuts-for-chinese-imports-to-aid-coronavirus-battle/article31125738.ece

Legendary Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne has turned his hand from making gin to making hand-sanitizer as shortages frustrate attempts to control the coronavirus outbreak.

Warne, who retired from test cricket in 2007 with a record 708 wickets, is a part-owner of the award-winning SevenZeroEight gin distillery.

The co-founders of the company include two prominent West Australian surgeons and Warne said the company would turn its production from gin to alcohol hand rubs which would be provided to two hospitals in the western state.

“This is a challenging time for Australians and we all need to do what we can to help our health care system combat this disease and save lives,” Warne said. “I am happy SevenZeroEight has the ability to make this shift and encourage others to do the same.”

China reported a record rise in imported coronavirus cases on Friday as expatriates returned home from the United States and Europe, sparking fears of a second wave of infections just as the country recovers from the initial outbreak.

All 41 of the new confirmed cases in China were imported from abroad, the country's National Health Commission said on Saturday, bringing the total number of such cases to 269.

Beijing and Shanghai were the main entry points for the returnees, many of whom are students who were studying abroad, according to official reports. They have come back after many campuses in the United States and Europe shut down to stem rapidly rising infection rates there.

Also returning in a flight to safety were China-based expats, as businesses begin to reopen.

The pivot to stemming imported cases has led to a tightening of quarantine restrictions in the country.

Guangdong's health commission said on Saturday travellers who enter Guangdong province from abroad will be subject to a 14-day quarantine on arrival either in personal residences or at a centralised quarantine centre at the expense of the traveller.

The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China stood at 81,008 at the end of Friday, the health authority said. The death toll was 3,255, up by seven, a much slower rate than at the height of the crisis.

The lack of locally transmitted cases for the third day running underscored a recovery that has prompted officials to relax restrictions, even in the virus epicentre of Wuhan, which was responsible for all seven new deaths.

City officials said last week that residents could walk around their compounds, loosening restrictions that had kept them to their personal living areas.

On Saturday, the official Xinhua news agency said commercial outlets in residential communities and villages without existing cases of virus can resume business, citing the municipal bureau of commerce.

As well as Beijing and Shanghai, the major transport hub of Shenzen, near Hong Kong, has facilitated infected returnees. The southern provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the eastern provinces of Shandong and Zhejiang, as well as Shaanxi and Sichuan have also all reported cases.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vjbwea/article31093303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinas-imported-coronavirus-cases-jump-as-students-expats-flock-home/article31125606.ece

Two influential Republican lawmakers on Friday urged Twitter to ban the Chinese Communist Party from using its platform for spreading “propaganda and whitewash” the entire history of its alleged coronavirus cover-up.

“While the coronavirus pandemic is afflicting families, governments, and markets around the world, the Chinese Communist Party is waging a massive propaganda campaign to rewrite the history of COVID-19 and whitewash the Party’s lies to the Chinese people and the world,” wrote Senators Ben Sasse and Congressman Mike Gallagher in a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorse.

The widespread use of Twitter by communist officials of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) during this crisis emphasises the contradiction in officials from governments that deny their citizens access to social media platforms like Twitter having access to those same platforms, oftentimes to spread disinformation, they alleged.

“By banning Twitter in China, the Chinese Communist Party is keeping its citizens in the dark,” the two lawmakers said.

“By putting propaganda on Twitter, the Chinese Communist Party is lying to the rest of the world,” the Senators wrote.

“We believe that the propaganda campaign Chinese government officials are currently waging on Twitter -- especially during the current global crisis -- merits the removal of these individual accounts from the platform,” the letter said.

In an accompanying statement, Sasse and Gallagher said that it is clear that the Chinese Communist Party officials are using Twitter to “disseminate propaganda” in the midst of a dangerous global crisis.

“Even worse, this propaganda obscures and confuses users over the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic and potentially undermines efforts to contain and control the outbreak. We believe this behaviour more than warrants their removal from the platform,” they said.

33,2020/03/21,"North Korea fires suspected short-range missiles, S.Korea says, amid coronavirus","The launch follows two earlier this month, when North Korea launched short-range missiles and multiple projectiles, according to South Korea's military, drawing U.S. and Chinese appeals for Pyongyang to return to talks on ending its nuclear and missile programmes.

North Korea fired two projectiles that appeared to be short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off the east coast of the Korean peninsula, South Korea's military said on Saturday, after what analysts said was a show of confidence during the coronavirus epidemic by announcing an April legislature session.

The launch follows two earlier this month, when North Korea launched short-range missiles and multiple projectiles, according to South Korea's military, drawing U.S. and Chinese appeals for Pyongyang to return to talks on ending its nuclear and missile programmes.

The suspected missiles were fired from North Pyongan province, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said. The province is above Pyongyang on the northwest corner of the Korean peninsula, bordering China.

Japan's coast guard said on Saturday that North Korea appeared to have fired a missile, which landed outside Japan's exclusive economic zone waters.

Earlier on Saturday, North Korea announced it will hold in April a session of the Supreme People's Assembly, its rubber-stamp legislature, in Pyongyang, which analysts had said would involve gathering almost 700 of the country's leaders in one spot as the coronavirus spreads worldwide.

“If it goes ahead, it would be the ultimate show of [North Korea's] confidence in managing the coronavirus situation,” Rachel Minyoung Lee, of the North Korea monitoring website NK News, said on Twitter this week.

North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the new coronavirus that was first detected in China late last year, though a top U.S. military official said last week he is “fairly certain” there were infections in North Korea.

State media KCNA also said on Saturday North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guided an artillery fire competition between combined units of the North Korean army on Friday, displaying photos of him watching with high-ranking military officers, all unmasked.

A staffer in the team of US Vice President Mike Pence has tested positive for the coronavirus, making him the first White House personnel to have been infected by the deadly disease that has so far claimed the lives of 230 people in the country.

“This evening we were notified that a member of the office of the Vice President tested positive for the coronavirus,” Katie Miller, Press Secretary to Vice President, said in a statement.

Neither President Donald Trump nor Vice President Pence had close contact with the individual, she said.

“Further contact tracing is being conducted in accordance with CDC guidelines,” Miller said.

This is the first case of a White House staffer being tested positive for the deadly virus. Last week, Trump had tested for the coronavirus but the result was negative.

The White House has instituted strict provisions for entry of individuals within its premises. Members of the presidential physicians’ team and secret service take temperature of every individual who enter the premises.

The United Arab Emirates on Friday reported the first two deaths from coronavirus in the country.

Abu Dhabi has reported 140 infections so far, of whom 31 have recovered, but no deaths.

“The Ministry of Health and Prevention has announced the first two deaths caused by the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in the country,” the Emirates News Agency reported.

One of the individuals was a 78-year old Arab national who had arrived in the country from Europe.

“The cause of death was a heart attack, coinciding with complications from the coronavirus disease,” the news agency quoted the ministry as saying.

The other individual, a 58-year-old Asian national and resident of the UAE, had prior chronic illnesses, heart disease and kidney failure.

Italy reported a record 627 new coronavirus deaths on March 20 and saw its world-topping toll surpass 4,000, despite government efforts to stem the pandemic’s spread.

The Mediterranean country’s daily rate of fatalities is now higher than that officially reported by China at the peak of its outbreak around Wuhan’s Hubei Province.

But Matteo Bassetti of Italy’s prestigious San Martino clinic in Genoa said the government probably had no idea how many people really had the new disease.

“There are so many people walking around who have the virus and who are at risk of infecting others,” Dr. Bassetti told Italy’s AGI news agency. “The 40,000 cases we are talking about (in Italy) could actually be 100 times higher.”

Worse than Wuhan?

Italy is rapidly notching up one grim record after the next as it becomes the new global epicentre of COVID-19.

In less than four weeks, it has recorded more deaths than China officially registered since reporting its first infection to the World Health Organisation in late December 2019.

Italy has seen more than 1,500 deaths from COVID-19 in the past three days alone. Italy’s total number of deaths now stands at 4,032.

Infections rose on March 20 by nearly 6,000 — another international record — to 47,021.

The nation of 60 million accounted for around 36.2% of the world’s coronavirus deaths at 12.30 a.m. IST on March 21.

Coronavirus | Global toll crosses 10,000

The Italian government already plans to extend a ban on public gatherings and the shutdown of almost all businesses beyond a March 25 deadline.

But worried regional leaders are pushing the national government to adopt even tougher restrictions, such as a ban on outdoor exercise and the closure of all stores on Sundays.

Some city authorities are taking matters into their own hands.

Milan on March 20 deployed more than 100 soldiers to help police the streets and ensure no one is found outdoors without a legitimate reason, such as buying food.

Old and sick

The government took the additional step on March 20 of closing all parks. Joggers are being encouraged to run around the block and stay close to their homes.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 12 and had been hoping to see the first results after two weeks.

But civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli said March 20 it was premature to think about when infections might begin to plateau. “There are reasons to think that it could be next week or the week after,” Mr. Borrelli told reporters. “But it is not a scientific fact.”

Italy’s death rate of 8.6% among those registered with infections is significantly higher than in most other countries.

Data | Coronavirus is deadliest for the elderly

Medical experts attribute this to Italy’s average age of 45.4 — seven years higher than in China.

The overwhelming majority of Italy’s fatal cases involved elderly people with at least one pre-existing condition.

The National Health Institute (ISS) said March 20 that the average age of Italy first 3,200 victims was 78.5. Almost 49% of them had three or more pre-existing conditions.

37,2020/03/21,OTT platforms are seeing a slew of East Asian historical dramas,"The Korean and Chinese shows are a heady mix of fictionalised historicals, often garnished with magic, sci-fi and impossible feats

With a future that is not foreseeable, the past appears like a welcome revisitation. Even as the coronavirus has a whiplash effect on the hardening of borders across Asia, the OTT space is proliferating with entertainment of an imaginary Asia — with Korea, China and India in the lead — streaming a slew of narratives of nationhood, past heroisms, and fabled spectacle. India’s shows are broadly limited to Ramayana, Jhansi Ki Rani and Baahubali, but the Korean and Chinese shows are a heady mix of fictionalised historicals, often garnished with magic, sci-fi and impossible feats.

The founding of national history is a big inspiration: the massively staged Mandarin serial Qin Empire Alliance is a virtual history of the conflicts between the Wei, Qi, Chu, Song, Xue, Lu and other warring states and the hard-fought domination of the Qin, the first dynasty of imperial China. The Qin, despite its short rule, set up a system of imperial administration that lasted from 221 BC till 1912 AD.

Almost in tandem, there is the series The King’s War, which describes the peasant uprising that overthrew Qin rule and led to the founding of the Han dynasty, under the mercurial peasant leader Liu Bang. An extraordinary character in Chinese history, described by Mao Zedong as the most powerful of the feudal emperors, Liu Bang is even today regarded as a folk hero. He rose from a village police official chasing chicken thieves to become the leader of a guerilla army. Shrewd and gritty, he led them to victory and established himself as Emperor Gaozu, going on to set up the Han dynasty for 400 years.

Brave queens

In close tandem are narratives of the charismatic Chinese empresses such as Empress Ki, sold in slavery from Korea to China under the Mongol Yuan dynasty, where she rises to become empress in a court beset by intrigue. Played by the extraordinary Korean actress Ha Ji-won, Empress Ki is a highly emotive tale of how she singlehandedly seeks to avenge the tiny kingdom of Goryeo against the mighty Mongols.

The narrative of female slavery resonates even in the 20th century with the memory of Korea’s comfort women under Japanese occupation. In similar vein is another historical figure, Wei Young, who in the 6th century is assigned as a maid to the royal palace of the Northern Wei kingdom. She survives intrigue and machinations to marry the emperor Tuoba Jun, and then finally rules as regent during the reigns of her son and grandson.

The courtly systems in play, in Korea and China, the dominant influence of Confucianism, the intrigue and manipulations of favourites within the harem and the role of eunuchs as confidants and advisers, together allow for multiple subplots and the visualisation of cultural norms. Common to both histories is the figure of the historian, such as Sima Qian, the father of Chinese historiography, who appears in several serials.

The Korean narratives portray life in the early Silla kingdom, and the medieval kingdoms that followed, Goryeo and Joseon; the latter survived until the Japanese occupation, which lasted from 1910 till 1945. Archivists and history enthusiasts have pointed out that the much vaunted tradition of the kisaeng or Korean courtesan may have had a chequered history. As celebrated entertainers — such as the 16th-century poet Hwang Jin-i — the kisaeng had proximity to officials and nobility. Seen as purveyors of art, the kisaeng house in Korean serials is also the centre of intrigue, romance and intense drama.

K-pop history

What is of enormous interest — and contemporary relevance — is the line drawn between ancient and present day cultural fads. K-pop male fashions, of men wearing make-up even with a masculine appearance, find an echo in hwarang, the elite “poet warrior youth” of the Silla period. Depicted in 7th-century Korean paintings, they appear in the eponymous series Hwarang as a cross between protectors of the faith and a boy band.

But perhaps the most interesting aspect of Korean serials lies in their secondary characters — the scholars and intellectuals, who negotiated with the Ming and Qing dynasties, sought to resist Japanese naval invasions, and in their powerful factions of the Soron and Noron during the Joseon period, fought each other for imperial favour. The Korean nobility, inspired by Confucianism and administrative protocol, are frequently caught in periods of intense transition. The finest work that demonstrates this tension is the somewhat cheesily titled Mr. Sunshine, a beautifully crafted story of a poor Korean émigré to the US, who returns as an official and uncovers a plot to attack Korea.

In these days of lockdown, perhaps this is one way of crossing borders.

38,2020/03/21,"I look for trouble: Naveen Richard on his new stand-up special, ‘Relatively Relatable’","The comedian’s new special is chock-full of the silly, with outlandish tales he insists are all true

Try as he might, Naveen Richard cannot escape Hindi. As a South Indian born in Tamil Nadu and bred in Bengaluru, the comedian was forced to learn the language in school and even fared well when it came to scoring in the subject. Conversations, unfortunately, are a different matter altogether. “Hindi as a compulsory second language is not going to work. The words just don’t flow,” says the 29-year-old, who first shed light on his linguistic impediments in the web series Star Boyz (2016). In it, three South Indians in outer space miserably, albeit hilariously, fail to communicate in Jat (pronounced ‘Jaaat’ by the Boyz) with an alien of the Raj Kachori species.

Now the former lawyer revisits his shortcomings in a new comedy special, Relatively Relatable,that premièred on March 20. “I feel like I belong in Bengaluru and it has got the right mix of everybody,” says Richard about the location of his special. “I did not want to go too Bengaluru with my jokes or viewers would feel disconnected, but something like me not being able to speak in Hindi would land especially large there.”

Personal tones

The special comes after a year-and-a-half of meticulous writing and countless trial shows. With comedy specials aplenty floating about on streaming platforms, making his stand out was essential. “I cannot sit through a whole special and you have to be a huge comedy fan to sit through one,” laughs the comedian, adding that he has tried really hard to incorporate changes in the tone of comedy. Like a humorous journey, the set traverses observational jokes, silly stories and a surprise in the middle of the show. “It has not been done before and I hope it is taken well,” pauses Richard, then admitting after a beat, “It is weird and strange, something that will take away from the monotony of a long special.”

Guaranteed to be family-friendly, Relatively Relatable is chock-full of anecdotes — some bizarre and others downright outlandish. But Richard vehemently insists that they are all true incidents. Like when he was being harassed by a non-profit whose sales strategies for a sick baby were obviously too far out. Digging for the truth made him do some serious sleuthing, even resulting in a visit to their office with a face-to-face inquisition. “I had to do the joke in clear conscience; if it did not exist, I could write a great ending,” he says.

But as luck would have it, Richard has always attracted misadventures, and the NGO was a legitimate institution. “I felt terrible but now I am really involved in helping them get donations,” he chuckles, adding that they even invited him to be the chief guest for the inauguration of five new public toilets. A situation eerily similar to the plot of his show, Better Life Foundation. “I look for trouble and most people would run away from the things that I walk into. But I have survived so far,” he says. “[In the show] I say some pretty outlandish things like learning kung fu as a child, but I am not lying. There is very little that is made up.”

Keeping it light

In the last few years, the comic has transcended the stand-up stage and paved the way for scripted comedy when it comes to original Indian content. He has played a benign NGO founder on Better Life Foundation; a South Indian space adventurer; an angry profane librarian; and a host of crazy characters in his sketches — case in point an annoying child in the special Go Straight Take Left.

But in real life, Richard is the antithesis of what we have seen. “I relate to Rowan Atkinson who is quite dull in real life.” Though he admits that channelling whimsy and the silly comes naturally during the creative process. “I do not have to try too hard,” he says. That is Richard’s signature brand of humour: light-hearted, warm and fuzzy, just like he promises Relatively Relatablewill be. “I wanted to talk about things that would carry people away in a hot air balloon for a little while and make them forget everything,” he concludes.

Relatively Relatable is now on Amazon Prime Video.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/x97iyz/article31126556.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Naveen2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/i-look-for-trouble-naveen-richard-on-his-new-stand-up-special-relatively-relatable/article31126557.ece
39,2020/03/21,"Kenny Rogers, country music icon and actor, dead at 81","The Houston-born performer won three Grammys and was the star of TV movies based on ‘The Gambler’

Actor-singer Kenny Rogers, the smooth, Grammy-winning balladeer who spanned jazz, folk, country and pop with such hits as “Lucille,” “Lady” and “Islands in the Stream” and embraced his persona as “The Gambler” on record and on TV died Friday night. He was 81.

The Houston-born performer with the husky voice and silver beard sold tens of millions of records, won three Grammys and was the star of TV movies based on “The Gambler” and other songs, making him a superstar in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Rogers thrived for some 60 years before retired from touring in 2017 at age 79. Despite his crossover success, he always preferred to be thought of as a country singer.

“You either do what everyone else is doing and you do it better, or you do what no one else is doing and you don’t invite comparison,” Rogers told in 2015. “And I chose that way because I could never be better than Johnny Cash or Willie or Waylon at what they did. So I found something that I could do that didn’t invite comparison to them. And I think people thought it was my desire to change country music. But that was never my issue.”

A true rags-to-riches story, Rogers was raised in public housing in Houston Heights with seven siblings. As a 20-year-old, he had a gold single called “That Crazy Feeling,” under the name Kenneth Rogers, but when that early success stalled, he joined a jazz group, the Bobby Doyle Trio, as a standup bass player.

But his breakthrough came when he was asked to join the New Christy Minstrels, a folk group, in 1966. The band reformed as First Edition and scored a pop hit with the psychedelic song, “Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In).” Rogers and First Edition mixed country-rock and folk on songs like “Ruby, Don’t Take Your Love To Town,” a story of a Vietnam veteran begging his girlfriend to stay.

After the group broke up in 1974, Rogers started his solo career and found a big hit with the sad country ballad “Lucille,” in 1977, which crossed over to the pop charts and earned Rogers his first Grammy. Suddenly the star, Rogers added hit after hit for more than a decade.

“The Gambler,” the Grammy-winning story song penned by Don Schlitz, came out in 1978 and became his signature song with a signature refrain- “You gotta know when to hold ‘em, know when to fold ‘em.” The song spawned a hit TV movie of the same name and several more sequels featuring Rogers as professional gambler Brady Hawkes, and led to a lengthy side career for Rogers as a TV actor and host of several TV specials.

Other hits included “You Decorated My Life,” “Every Time Two Fools Collide” with Dottie West, “Don’t Fall In Love with a Dreamer” with Kim Carnes, and “Coward of the County.” One of his biggest successes was “Lady,” written by Lionel Richie, a chart topper for six weeks straight in 1980. Richie said in a 2017 interview with the AP that he often didn’t finish songs until he had already pitched them, which was the case for “Lady.”

“In the beginning, the song was called, ‘Baby,’” Richie said. “And because when I first sat with him, for the first 30 minutes, all he talked about was he just got married to a real lady. A country guy like him is married to a lady. So, he said, ‘By the way, what’s the name of the song?’” Richie replies, “Lady.”

Over the years, Rogers worked often with female duet partners, most memorably, Dolly Parton. The two were paired at the suggestion of the Bee Gees’ Barry Gibb, who wrote “Islands in the Stream.”

“Barry was producing an album on me and he gave me this song,” Rogers told the AP in 2017. “And I went and learned it and went into the studio and sang it for four days. And I finally looked at him and said, ‘Barry, I don’t even like this song anymore.’ And he said, ‘You know what we need? We need Dolly Parton.’ I thought, ‘Man, that guy is a visionary.’”

Coincidentally, Parton was actually in the same recording studio in Los Angeles when the idea came up.

“From the moment she marched into that room, that song never sounded the same,” Rogers said. “It took on a whole new spirit.”

The two singers toured together, including in Australia and New Zealand in 1984 and 1987, and were featured in a HBO concert special. Over the years the two would continue to record together, including their last duet, “You Can’t Make Old Friends,” which was released in 2013. Parton reprised “Islands in the Stream” with Rogers during his all-star retirement concert held in Nashville in October 2017.

Rogers invested his time and money in a lot of other endeavors over his career, including a passion for photography that led to several books, as well as an autobiography, “Making It With Music.” He had a chain of restaurants called “Kenny Rogers Roasters,” and was a partner behind a riverboat in Branson, Missouri. He was also involved in numerous charitable causes, among them the Red Cross and MusicCares, and was part of the all-star “We are the World” recording for famine relief.

By the ‘90s, his ability to chart hits had waned, although he still remained a popular live entertainer with regular touring. Still he was an inventive businessman and never stopped trying to find his way back onto the charts.

At the age of 61, Rogers had a brief comeback on the country charts in 2000 with a hit song “Buy Me A Rose,” thanks to his other favorite medium, television. Producers of the series “Touched By An Angel” wanted him to appear in an episode, and one of his managers suggested the episode be based on his latest single. That cross-promotional event earned him his first No. 1 country song in 13 years.

Rogers’ family is planning a private service “out of concern for the national COVID-19 emergency,” a statement posted early Saturday read. A public memorial will be held at a later date.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ttj1e8/article31126395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITKENNYROGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/kenny-rogers-country-music-icon-and-actor-dead-at-81/article31126396.ece
40,2020/03/21,How restaurants in Coimbatore are coping with the Coronavirus outbreak,"Order of the day: What happens to restaurants that are seeing fewer walk in diners? Some wait and watch, while others use the time to plan new menus, upskill staff and hope for a return to normal

For Chippikul Muthu, who sells dosas at his roadside stall, it was business as usual till the authorities asked him to shut down. He hopes he can reopen as soon as he gets permission, as there are enough people who, he says, will return to eat his food. Till he shut down, “we did brisk business.” Muthu is praying fervently that things will get better. “I cannot afford to close it down for long. I have loans to repay.”

Coimbatore’s favourite haunt is facing the Coronavirus brunt too. “Our business has come down drastically over the weeks,” says Executive Director, Jegan Srinivasan of Annapoorna. RHR’s group’s M Sivakumar agrees that walk-ins have seen a drastic drop of 30-40%. “We have cut down on production for two weeks. Our employees are at work but they are idle most of the time.” Sivakumar is optimistic “We haven’t thought about any other activity to engage them, as this is a temporary issue. Soon, hopefully, things will improve.”

But both point out that hygiene has always been priority and they are taking extra precautions now to ensure the staff and the equipment in the kitchens are in good health and condition. Sivakumar adds that the employees have health insurance.

These are trying times. Uncertain ones for restaurant owners and their staff. As customers peter out, there is the very real worry of what to do with the employees. Some have done the best they can and are hoping their regular clients will now order through food aggregators. “We are urging out customers to order online. We are doing everything we can to reassure them that the food is being prepared in the most safe and hygienic way,” says Shreeya Adka of the fine-dine restaurant The French Door.

Speaking of her three restaurants (On The Go, That’s Y Food and Café Totaram), Ranjana Singhal says, “Even online business is not doing that well. But, of the three, Totaram is doing a little better.”

Arun Viswanathan of Infusions Café prefers to be more upbeat as he says, “While there is a 15% decrease in the number of people walking in, sales through apps have increased by 30%.”

Neel Chhabria, who runs Kailash Parbat (Brookefields Mall) and The Noodle Theory (RS Puram), repeatedly uses the phrase, ‘need of the hour’. “If it had been anything else, we would have felt bad about shutting down. But given the magnitude of what’s happening, no complaints,” he says. Both restaurants are not allowing any dine-in. “The need of the hour is prevention, so we decided to close down.”

Shreeya, Ranjana, Neel and Arun are using the extra time as productively as they possibly can. Neel laughs. “I am telling them to go play in the open area. There is no one round and they’ll never get a chance like this,” he says before adding more seriously, “We can’t send them away. What will they do? So we’re bleeding doubly but I believe our loss is fractional compared to what’s happening around the world.”

Ranjana is ensuring that her team’s morale does not go down. “We are using the time to upskill the staff. We are working on a new lunch combo menu, the logistics for that, picking out new crockery and constantly talking to the staff about customer relations, soft skills... all this is keeping us occupied. I can’t clutch my head in despair and give up. I prefer to stay active, mentally at least. I am hopeful that, sometime in April, I will be well prepared with the new menu and we can have a trial run.” Of course, all dependent on the situation, as “once I launch the menu, I cannot roll back.”

The staff of Infusions Café is also following suit with having trials for new goodies to be introduced in the future. Says Arun, “We will use the time productively and concentrate on delivery service. While I have no immediate plans of shutting the café, I will do so if things do not improve.”

How you can help By not getting offended if the staff remind you to wash your hands (It is nothing personal and it is for your safety and theirs)

Ordering online from them (if they remain open). This ensures less possibility of contagion and keeps the restaurants going

By not demanding hand sanitisers. Restaurants provide handwashes and you might want to leave your table, go to wash your hands. Or bring your own hand sanitisers

Shreeya is a combination of resignation and positivity. “Things are not good at all with a drop of nearly 50 per cent in our guests. It is tough. But someone told me that the pollution is coming down and what is happening is Nature’s way of giving herself time to rest and recuperate. This break has given us more time to focus on a new menu. All of us are involved in it, so that is good. We had set aside many small projects, and we can work on them now. So that when all this down, the tedious back-end work will be over and we can concentrate on our guests.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/fd4nhg/article31127734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/restaurant,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-restaurants-in-coimbatore-are-coping-with-the-coronavirus-outbreak/article31127735.ece

42,2020/03/21,Panic buying: Much ado about toilet paper,"One would imagine they would buy rice, flour and pasta. Or soap. Maybe wine. But no, they didn’t

So, you’re living in a so-called developed country and an epidemic starts spreading like wildfire. The world is falling apart. You realise your best chance is to stay at home, minimise contact with other people, and try and survive the best you can.

But before you batten down the hatches, you must make a run to the nearest supermarket to capture whatever essential supplies you can for yourself and your family. Now, watching from this corner of the planet, one would imagine you would try and pick up long-lasting food supplies such as rice, flour, pasta, cous-cous, canned food, meat and veg that you can freeze and defrost later, a fair bit of alcohol perhaps, and soap, hand sanitisers and disinfectants. As everybody else also rushes into panic buying, one can imagine fights breaking out as people reach for the last packets of sugar or UHT long-life milk cartons.

But none of this happens — the brawls break out over packets of toilet rolls; you actually try to claw out some fellow shopper’s eyes as you wrestle with them over a 36-pack of ‘double-ply, extra soft’; somebody puts somebody else in hospital over a carton of ‘unscented, re-cycled’; shoppers are seen stumbling out into the parking lots with teetering towers of toilet paper and stuffing them into their cars as though they’re pulling off a heist of gold ingots from Fort Knox — if only I can get these 96 rolls home safely, everything I’ve always dreamt of will be mine!

Absurd product

Sitting where we are, one could be forgiven for thinking — what’s wrong with these people, has someone told them the water supply is going to be turned off?

The next bit of thinking could take the following route: What a wasteful culture the West has created! If only someone had taught them during toilet training how to wash themselves properly with water, and how that was much cleaner and healthier, there would not be this billion-dollar industry cutting down country-sized swathes of trees every year to manufacture this absurd product. Just a simple lota or mug in each toilet would take away this unseemly panic about the most simple act of daily hygiene.

After the brawls and semi-riots come the jokes on social media. A middle-eastern man posts a picture on Twitter of a lota with a spout and the comment: ‘Perhaps use this while others are killing each other over toilet-paper?’ To which an irate Englishwoman replies: ‘This is NOT the time for a cup of tea!’ Then there is a video from Australia where a man wearing a suit and a traditional bush hat sits in a bar and recites a poem that imagines looking at this moment from the future and examining why exactly toilet paper became such an issue. Talking about a moment when ‘the nation s***t itself’, the poem describes the hoarding of toilet paper : ‘…while other rocked on the verandah, their shotgun fully manned/ to protect their precious stock — they’d rather die than use their hand!’

After a while, the humour subsides and the seriousness kicks in. A few years ago, I was witness to a public transport strike in London that stretched over two or three days during which most of the underground rail network was shut down and very few buses were running.

On the first day, people stayed in queues, more or less observing the daily civic courtesies for which Britain is known. On the second day, with buses on each route becoming more and more rare, tempers began to flare, and I began to notice increased pushing and shoving. By the evening rush hour on the third day, central London’s bus stops began to resemble Bombay’s Churchgate of yore, or Delhi’s Connaught Place or Calcutta’s Dharmatala, with people surrounding bus doors in feral swirls, shouting, clawing and body-slamming their way into each infrequent bus. It was startling to observe the thin cladding of the first world fall apart so quickly in the face of a little scarcity.

Herd logic

By now, there are articles on the Net about the run on toilet paper and how panic sets off ‘herd’ behaviour in people even in developed societies. When people feel things spiralling out of control, they strive to grab some agency in their daily lives and often this comes through the act of over-purchasing necessities; when people see others stock-piling some item, everyone starts reaching to corner ‘enough’ of the same product, leaving aside logic.

In India, we’ve often seen this kind of behaviour during crises and the repercussions of anticipated scarcity. Historically, we saw it before the famine of 1943; and recently we witnessed it during the demonetisation disaster.

We may see it yet again in the near future as the actual virus and the panic virus beset us in tandem.

43,2020/03/21,Goren Bridge by Bob Jones,"No one made a bad bid, but the obstructive East-West bidding jockeyed North-South into a game contract that was far from cold. The opening club lead was covered by the queen and king and ducked by South. East shifted to the king of hearts, won by dummy’s ace. Declarer led a spade to his queen and West’s king. West led his remaining heart — low, eight, ruff. South led a diamond to dummy’s ace and led a spade. There was nothing East could do to defeat the contract at this point. He won and led a club to South’s ace. Declarer drew the last trump and then took the marked diamond finesse for his contract.

East could have defeated the contract by shifting to his singleton diamond at trick two. Leading into dummy’s ace-king-jack might seem like a dangerous play, but we don’t think so. On the auction, South didn’t need much help in playing the diamond suit. Also, didn’t West rate to have a spade entry? Did West really open the bidding with just one queen and one jack?

South could have made it more difficult by winning the opening lead and leading the queen of spades from his hand.

44,2020/03/21,Fighting fear,"Those predisposed to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or anxiety are at a higher risk of being affected by the fear caused by the spread of the virus

Even in times of social distancing, isolation, and quarantine, a lot of us are keeping our spirits up by singing, dancing, cooking, and making up hilarious Corona memes. However, there is a small, yet significant section of people that is not laughing. The spread of the pandemic has meant something very different to them.

“These are troubling times for people who live with contamination obsessions,” says Dr C J John, chief psychiatrist of Medical Trust Hospital. Since the Corona outbreak, he has seen a couple of people who were in a state of panic. The viral outbreak could trigger irrational fears in those who have mild to severe contamination obsessions and washing compulsions. “It may exacerbate the condition in a few patients,” says Dr John.

Those who are predisposed to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) or have illness anxiety are at a higher risk of being affected by the fear caused by the spread of the virus. OCD is defined as a mental disorder in which a person has recurring, unwanted thoughts, ideas or sensations (obsessions) that make him or her feel driven to do something repetitively (compulsions). The repetitive behaviour, such as hand washing, checking on things, or cleaning, can significantly interfere with the person’s daily activities and social interactions, according to the DSM 5 (Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) of the American Psychiatric Association.

While awareness and information are vital, there is a literal “infodemic” (an information pandemic) that is adversely affecting people with anxiety disorders, says Dr John. “A lot of the information passed around on social media may be authentic, however, this information overload could prove distressing to patients who keep tracking news compulsively, worsening their condition.”

Mental health experts suggest that those with pre-existing emotional disorders such as health anxiety and depression, those being treated for OCD or anxiety, and those who are experiencing distress, seek medical help. If you have a family member who has OCD, help them by regulating the flow of information at home, and by avoiding real-time tracking of the news.

However, the situation, says Dr John, is also an opportunity to trace signs of obsessive disorders in a loved one. “Even to remove contamination by a deadly virus such as Corona, you need to wash your hands only for 20 seconds.” If you or someone close to you is doing this more than necessary, do check in with a psychologist.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/spz4n4/article31126124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPOCD-2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/fighting-fear/article31126125.ece
45,2020/03/21,Centre releases local body grants to States,"Almost ₹1,630 crore has been released for urban local bodies, with Tamil Nadu receiving the lion’s share of ₹988 crore.

The Centre has released ₹2,570 crore in the 14th Finance Commission grants that had been withheld from the States for not conducting elections to the local bodies, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.

Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are the biggest beneficiaries from the decision taken to ensure that basic civic services are not affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. “Due to #COVID2019, the local bodies have to especially focus on providing basic civic services and ensure cleanliness,” said a tweet by Ms. Sitharaman.

Almost ₹1,630 crore has been released for urban local bodies, with Tamil Nadu receiving the lion’s share of ₹988 crore, followed by Andhra Pradesh with ₹431 crore, both as the first instalment for 2019-20. Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Meghalaya also received funds for the earlier years. For rural local bodies, Andhra Pradesh received ₹870 crore in the second instalment for 2018-19. Arunachal got more than ₹70 crore in the second instalment for 2017-18.

46,2020/03/21,Chicken and maize prices crash as COVID-19 takes a toll,"Chicken prices have crashed from ₹90 a kg last month to ₹20 in Mumbai as people are staying away from consuming poultry in fearing COVID-19.

Despite several awareness campaigns to demolish misconceptions that poultry had something to do with the dreaded virus, people are still staying away.

Listed poultry companies such as Pune-based Venky’s (India) Ltd. and Indore-based Simran Firms Ltd. (SFL) are likely to report lower revenues in this quarter as business has suffered enormously.

Despite several attempts a senior official from Venky’s was not available for comment.

“The poultry prices are all time low. Ex-farm broiler price is ₹10-₹15 per kg (cost of production ₹75 per kg ) and egg prices are ₹1.5 per egg ex farm ( cost of production is ₹3.5 per egg). Due to reduction in chicken and egg production , feed demand and prices are coming down on daily basis. The price of main raw material , like corn and soya bean meal , have dropped more than 10% in last 2 weeks,” said a Godrej Agrovet Ltd. spokesperson.

As per a previous estimate, the poultry trade in Maharashtra was losing over ₹10 crore a day due to lack of appetite for chicken.

“Though there is no direct link between chicken and COVID-19, people will stay away from poultry as long as the fear is there. So it will impact the poultry companies like Venky’s and SFL and any other company that is linked to this business. In this quarter, their revenues will be lower and the trend has been reflected in their share prices on account of this direct impact,” said Ambareesh Baliga, independent equity analyst.

Poultry farmers are bearing the maximum brunt due to the price crash and there has been no compensation from the government.

“The business has totally collapsed. Prices have crashed to ₹20 a kg and there has been no demand. Earlier, I used to sell 150 birds a day, now it has come down to a dozen,” said Salim Momin, a poultry dealer from Lalbaug, Mumbai.

Similarly, prices of maize which goes into making poultry feed has reduced to a great extent.

Grain merchant Devendra Vora, proprietor, Friendship Brokers, APMC Market, New Mumbai, said maize prices had slumped since last two to three months when COVID-19 started spreading around the world.

“Maize prices have slumped because there is no global demand. Since demand for poultry feed has come down, maize prices have suffered. Due to COVID-19 effect, prices have reduced to ₹1,500 to ₹1,600 per 100 kg from ₹1,900 in January.”

“Farmers are the worst suffers,” he added.

In Maharashtra, the minimum support price for maize has come down to less than ₹1,300 per 100 kg from ₹1,700 last year.

This indicates the lower income for farmers.

“Demand for maize, a crucial component for the poultry industry is hit and there has been an dip in prices as well. This is owing to the food processing industry facing issues such as shortage of staff owing to COVID-19. However, we believe that if we as a society are able to control the spread of Corona virus in the next couple of weeks, we would witness the prices will springing back to normal. The graph of food grains prices will rebound quickly as demand from food processing industry will rise in order to upsurge capacity utilizations from the low levels of operations presently,” said Amith Aggarwal, CEO, Agribazaar.

“We believe that this is the right time for government agencies to collaborate with private companies like us and plan for greater MSP procurement to protect the interest of our farmers. Any current stress to farmers may spill over and adversely impact sowing in the Kharif season,” Mr. Aggarwal said.

49,2020/03/21,City Union Bank to open 200 branches in 4 years,"Eyes ₹40-cr. investment for expansion

Private sector lender City Union Bank Ltd. (CUB) is proposing to open 200 more branches over the next three to four years, with an investment of ₹40 crore, said a top official.

“For the last few years, we have been opening 50 branches during the last quarter of a given fiscal,” said N. Kamakodi, MD and CEO, CUB. “This month itself, we have opened 40 out of 50 branches [as also] the 700th branch at Chinna Kancheepuram on Friday.”

CUB will end the current fiscal with a total of 700 branches. It had invested about ₹10 crore in opening 50 branches this fiscal. Over the next three to four years, the bank plans to invest ₹40 crore for the proposed expansion activities, taking the total to 900 branches. About 25% of new branches would be in un-banked rural areas.

“At the given run-rate, we might be opening 200 branches over the next three to four years. The investment per branch works out to ₹15-20 lakh in fixed cost. Each branch would hire about six people, including one manager and one officer,” he said.

According to him, the bank had enough staff. Every year, the probable candidates are selected through campus recruitment during June-August and provided training. That is why new branches are opened during the fourth quarter, he said.

Asserting that all the that 600 branches were profit-making, he added that it took at least two years for a branch to attain break even.

50,2020/03/21,"Cabinet okays ₹48,000-cr. plan for electronics manufacturing","Three schemes for manufacturing, supply chain, infra to help create over 20 lakh jobs

In a bid to boost large-scale electronics manufacturing in India, the Union Cabinet approved three schemes, including a production-linked incentive scheme, with a total outlay of almost ₹48,000 crore.

“The three schemes together will enable large-scale electronics manufacturing, a domestic supply chain ecosystem of components and a state-of-the-art infrastructure and common facilities for large anchor units and their supply chain partners,” Minister of Electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Saturday.

The schemes are expected to attract new investments worth at least ₹50,000 crore in the sector, while generating more than five lakh direct and 15 lakh indirect jobs.

The production-linked incentive scheme aims to attract large investments in mobile phone manufacturing and specified electronic components, including assembly, testing, marking and packaging (ATMP) units, at a budgetary outlay of ₹40,995 crore for five years.

The scheme will offer an incentive of 4-6% on incremental sales of goods manufactured in India and is expected to create a total of 8 lakh jobs.

The government needs to outline measures to help people whose livelihoods have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, the Opposition parties said on Saturday.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in a statement, said COVID-19, which followed demonetisation and the slowing down of the economy, had been a huge setback to millions of daily wage earners, MGNREGA workers, ad hoc and temporary workers, labourers, farmers and those in the unorganised sector.

“The government has to put in place broad-based social protection measures, including direct cash financial help to these sections,” she said. Calling for a comprehensive sector-wise relief package, Ms. Gandhi said: “The Congress is demanding necessary tax breaks, interest subvention and deferment of liabilities. For the salaried class, the government and the RBI must consider deferment of EMIs,”

“As the entire nation stands united in our joint fight, I would urge the Prime Minister and the government to take action on some key issues. There is uncertainty and lack of information about the number of beds, isolation chambers, ventilators, medical supplies and dedicated medical teams. This information, including location of each hospital and their emergency phone line numbers, should be publicly shared. A dedicated portal for sharing these and all other necessary information is one way forward. Special budgetary allocation is an equally important factor,” Ms. Gandhi said.

Former party president Rahul Gandhi said the virus was a strong assault on our already fragile economy. “Small, medium businessmen and daily wage workers are the worst affected. Clapping won’t help them!” he tweeted. Asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi government to act quickly, Mr. Gandhi said the country needs a wholesome financial package with cash hand outs, tax breaks and delayed debt repayment plans.

The BJP is likely to hold a meeting of its legislature party in Madhya Pradesh on March 23, with Shivraj Singh Chouhan tipped to return as Chief Minister.

Senior party sources told The Hindu that the delay after Congress leader Kamal Nath’s resignation as Chief Minister on March 20 was because of the “janata curfew” announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for March 22.

“The Janata Curfew is an important part of trying to get the country to take the threat of the novel coronavirus seriously, and we want no public meetings, etc. Also, the 22 MLAs arrived in Delhi from Bengaluru today [Saturday] and met BJP president J.P. Nadda along with former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia. They need to be reassured with regard to their future,” said a senior central leader of the BJP.

Later, BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said the 22 rebel Congress MLAs had joined the BJP.

Mr. Chouhan, after much speculation, is considered the front runner for the post of Chief Minister.

“There are 25 bypolls to be fought going ahead, as there were already two seats vacant in the Assembly and the resignation of BJP MLA Sharad Kol along with the 22 Congress rebel MLAs. Shivraj [Singh Chouhan] is the man most capable of steering us through that challenge,” the source said.

57,2020/03/21,COVID-19 | Supreme Court lawyers urge CJI Bobde to close court,"Associations cite crowds at premises, specially for high profile cases.

Lawyers’ associations in the Supreme Court on Saturday made an urgent and simultaneous appeal to Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde to close the court till further notice on account of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), at an executive committee meeting, passed a resolution that the court should be closed for at least four weeks from March 23.

In another request, the prestigious Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAoRA) , composed of apex court lawyers whose authorisation is necessary to file petitions, urged the CJI and the judges to keep the general health and well-being of the court staff, lawyers, registry employees and general public in mind and shut down the court from Monday for two weeks.

Cursory measures

The past week had seen at least four to six Benches sitting after the court re-opened following the Holi break on March 16. Though cursory measures have been taken like temperature guns, shutting of canteens and distribution of COVID self-declaration forms at entry points, the court premises witnessed crowds outside courtrooms, corridors, mentioning offices, entry points, lawyers’ chambers, etc.

The previous week had seen the court urgently take up the Madhya Pradesh political controversy case on a daily basis. The courtroom which took up the case was crowded and the judges heard the arguments even after normal court hours on Thursday.

Taking up of high-profile cases, like the Madhya Pradesh and the AGR cases, attracted mediapersons, which added to the crowd in the courtrooms. Entry to journalists has been, at best, erratic. A few journalists managed to attend or cover the sensitive cases, courtesy certain informal arrangements.

Even senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for BJP leaders including Shivraj Singh Chauhan in the Madhya Pradesh case, was heard requesting the judges to stop the court’s functioning and revert to the summer vacation mode by which only urgent matters like death penalty and bail or custody cases are heard.

On Friday, the court also held a midnight hearing in the Nirbhaya case.

Health of stakeholders

“CJI and judges should consider the feelings and well-being of all stakeholders and declare vacation in the Supreme Court for four weeks from March 23,” SCBA statement said.

SCAoRA suggested that the court could make up for the days lost to COVID by cutting short the summer vacation in May. Besides, Saturdays could also be used to hear cases once the virus scare was over, the lawyers said.

The Association, suggested that interim orders passed so far could continue till further notice.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c394ny/article31130796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THBOBDE-21march,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-supreme-court-lawyers-urge-cji-bobde-to-close-court/article31130777.ece

Also read: Is the global economy headed for recession?

An official order issued on Saturday said that in the wake of recent global developments and the serious impact of COVID-19, which has adversely impacted the aviation industry both in domestic as well international sectors, there is an insurmountable dip in the revenue, which calls for stringent measures to reduce costs. All airlines have taken drastic steps to survive the current crisis and an urgent need is felt to take steps to curtail costs to mitigate the current financial crisis.

The order said that at an emergency meeting of the executive management committee meeting held on March 18 it was decided that an exercise to review all agreements and renegotiate with lessors be undertaken.

In view of the suspension/reduction of various flights, especially international flights, the management asked the hotel committee to undertake a review of the existing agreements for reducing the rates to the extent possible.

“In case, there is any minimum guarantee clause, the same is to be immediately suspended for a period of three months, without impacting the rates once the situation normalises,” the order stated.

It was also decided that a special drive is to be undertaken to recover all pending dues from government departments in a time-bound manner. “Aggressive action is required by the concerned offices in the regions as well at the headquarters to collect the amount by the end of the current financial year,” the order said.

Reasonable wage reduction

The employees were further informed that during the meeting, there was general consensus in the committee meeting to undertake wage reduction of a reasonable amount. “lt was agreed to implement a deduction in allowances (excluding basic pay, house rent allowance and variable dearness allowance) in respect of all employees, except cabin crew, for a period of three months effective March 2020 salary,” the order said.

Among other measures to be adopted were implementing a quick turnaround of flights for cabin and cockpit crew; serving only packed food in flights; and immediately discontinuing magazines, newspapers, cold/wet towels and blankets. In view of the curtailed operations, and reduced requirement of aircraft and manpower, mandatory training for cockpit and cabin crew will be undertaken and completed during this period.

The Executive Director (Operations), under the guidance of Director (Commercial), will review flight schedules by clubbing and curtailing flights. Given the reduced work load and also the COVID-19 threat, Employees will be encouraged to avail their privilege leave.

Departmental heads have been told to formulate a detailed work-from-home plan with reduction in salary (where possible) and submit the same with work requirement and a cost-benefit analysis. The management also decided that there would be no fresh recruitment, induction, hiring and no extension/re-employment to retired officials (except for pilots and other critical categories).

“The numbers of positive cases are rising in India,” observed Mr. Patnaik. “ We have a very small window to take pre-emptive action. There is no cure for this virus. The only cure is prevention. It is only if you go out of your home that you may bring the virus to your home and your neighbourhood,” he said.

Giving examples of China and some other countries that had reversed the trend only through this strategy, the CM said, “in fact, Wuhan which was the nerve centre has no more infections today. Their hospitals are free. They made people stay at home and come out only for essential services.

64,2020/03/21,Cabinet approves promotion of domestic manufacturing of medical devices in country,"The government on Saturday approved a production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for promoting domestic manufacturing of medical devices, with financial implications of ₹3,420 crore.

The Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi also approved another promotion of medical device parks scheme worth ₹400 crore for financing common infrastructure facilities in four medical device parks, an official statement said.

The expenditure to be incurred for the said schemes will be for the next five years i.e. from 2020-21 to 2024-25, it added.

“The Union cabinet has approved a scheme on promotion of medical device parks for financing common infrastructure facilities in four medical device parks with financial implications of ₹400 crore, and approved the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for promoting domestic manufacturing of medical devices with financial implications of ₹3,420 crore,” it said.

Under the sub-scheme for promotion of medical device parks, common infrastructure facilities would be created in four medical device parks, which is expected to reduce manufacturing cost of medical devices in the country.

“The PLI scheme for promoting domestic manufacturing of medical devices would boost domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in the medical device sector, particularly in the identified target segments. It will lead to expected incremental production of Rs 68,437 crore over a period of five years,” the statement said.

The medical device sector suffers from a cost of manufacturing disability of around 12% to 15%, vis-a-vis competing economies, among other factors, on account of lack of adequate infrastructure, domestic supply chain and logistics, high cost of finance, inadequate availability of quality power, limited design capabilities and low focus on research and development activities (R&D) and skill development, etc.

There is, thus, a need for a mechanism to compensate for the manufacturing disability, it said.

It further said that the schemes have potential to generate an additional employment of 33,750 jobs over a period of five years and reduce import of target segments of medical devices.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article12052050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30-P4-COLS3.1+DE30-P4-COLS3.1.jpg.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cabinet-approves-promotion-of-domestic-manufacturing-of-medical-devices-in-country/article31129011.ece

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials for immediate release of payment to MNREGS workers in the State and to make foodgrains available to the poor in cities and villages, a statement issued by the U.P. government said.

“In view of the precautions being taken throughout the country to prevent the coronavirus outbreak, the State government is alert and cautious. With immediate effect, the State government will provide ₹1,000 per person for maintenance to 35 lakh labourers. This payment will be sent directly to their accounts through direct bank transfers,” said the statement issued on March 21.

It said Mr. Adityanath has instructed officials to provide one month free ration in April to over 1.65 crore construction workers and daily labourers registered under the Antyodaya Yojana and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Scheme (MNREGS) with the Labour Department.

Daily wage labourers in urban areas who do not have ration cards will get the document on priority basis, the statement said.

It said the Chief Minister has also directed officials that payment be immediately released to the MNREGS workers in the State.

“Orders have been issued to provide food grains to those working in rural and urban areas in the State, especially to labourers, cart pullers and others,” the statement said.

Mr. Adityanath appealed to the people of the State to stay indoors during Sunday’s ‘Janata’ curfew called for by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“A call for Janta curfew was given. Please stay in your homes. Metro trains, roadways buses and city buses will not operate on Sunday,” the statement said on behalf of the Chief Minister.

It said all metro services in U.P. will be closed March 22 and that bus services of Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and city bus services will be closed from 6.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m.

“Coronavirus is in the second stage all over the country. It will convey a big message to the entire world if we are successful in stopping this at this stage. To curb this infection, we are working on a war footing. Isolation wards have been set up in every district hospital and medical college. So far, 23 patients have been identified in the state, out of which nine have completely recovered. There is no need to panic, but prepare yourself to fight against this challenge,” the U.P. Chief Minister said in the statement.

He asked traders to not hoard essential items and people to purchase only necessary things, assuring people that the State has enough food grain. He urged people to not crowd or stand in queues at shops to prevent the infection from spreading.

The government needs to outline measures to help people whose livelihoods have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, the Opposition parties said on Saturday.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in a statement, said COVID-19, which followed demonetisation and the slowing down of the economy, had been a huge setback to millions of daily wage earners, MGNREGA workers, ad hoc and temporary workers, labourers, farmers and those in the unorganised sector.

“The government has to put in place broad-based social protection measures, including direct cash financial help to these sections,” she said. Calling for a comprehensive sector-wise relief package, she said: “The Congress is demanding necessary tax breaks, interest subvention and deferment of liabilities. For the salaried class, the government and the RBI must consider deferment of EMIs.”

As the entire nation stands united in our joint fight, I would urge the Prime Minister and the government to take action on some key issues. There is uncertainty and lack of information about the number of beds, isolation chambers, ventilators and dedicated medical teams. This information, including location of each hospital and their emergency phone line numbers, should be publicly shared. Special budgetary allocation is an equally important factor, Ms. Gandhi said.

71,2020/03/21,"CBI books Customs official, Delhi firm, others over alleged smuggling of gold from Dubai to India","The case is based on a probe by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence

The CBI has booked a Superintendent of Customs, then posted at the IGI Airport, a Delhi-based company and others for alleged smuggling of gold from Dubai to India in the garb of re-import of jewellery exported for exhibition purpose.

Among those named are Customs Superintendent Vikram Bhasin, Its My Name Private Limited, its director Rahul Gupta, Purnima Gupta, Amit Pal Singh, Gopal Gupta and Mohammed Nashruddin Khan.

The case is based on a probe by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, which seized jewellery weighing over 51 kg at the airport in the early hours of April 25, 2019. The agency had arrested Gopal Gupta, Amit Pal Singh and Nashruddin, all alleged employees of Its My Name.

The DRI probe revealed the alleged role of Vikram Bhasin, who was arrested on May 31, 2019.

It is alleged that Mr. Rahul Gupta, in connivance with Gopal Gupta, Amit Pal Singh and Nashruddin, who was the dummy director of United Arab Emirates-based MN Khan Jewelers FZE, besides Vikram Bhasin, allegedly misused the re-import provision by bringing in jewellery without getting the required clearance.

The FIR alleges that the company exported gold jewellery from India through two modes. In the first mode, it was sent abroad through personal hand carriage for the declared purpose of overseas exhibition.

The exhibitions were purportedly stated to be organised by United Arab Emirates-based MN Khan Jewellers FZE, a firm “effectively controlled” by Mr. Rahul Gupta.

The jewellery was exported through personal hand carriage by either Mr. Amit Pal Singh or Mr. Nashruddin, the “dummy proprietor of MN Khan Jewellers FZE”, based on fake exhibition invitation letters.

The Foreign Trade Policy, along with the related provisions, allows for duty free re-import of such exported jewellery, subject to Customs rules and regulations. The gold jewellery said to be exported for exhibition purpose used to be later shown as re-imported to India as unsold.

For this purpose, the Customs declaration for export of small-quantity gold jewellery, i.e., less than one kg, to India used to be filed at the Dubai airport in the names of Mr. Amit Pal Singh and Mr. Nashruddin.

The declaration for export of large-quantity consignments to Nepal, Thailand and Singapore, were filed in the name of Musthafa Kamal Ramalappa.

After completion of the emigration formalities at Dubai, Mr. Ramalappa would hand over the large-quantity consignments to Mr. Amit Pal Singh and Mr. Nashruddin for “illegal” re-import to India. Mr. Nashruddin would travel to Kathmandu, Thailand or Singapore empty handed, as alleged.

The FIR also alleges that the company imported gold bullion from Hussain Jewellery FZE, another entity allegedly controlled by Mr. Rahul Gupta, without payment of duty.

The cash payments realised from the grey market through sale of such foreign bullion was paid to Mr. Ramalappa in Dubai via the “hawala” channel.

They were then transferred back to the accounts of Its My Name by MN Khan Jewelers FZE through the banking channels, as alleged.

It is alleged that Mr. Nashruddin, at Mr. Rahul Gupta’s instance, would directly send a part of the jewellery to MN Khan Jewellers for re-melting, assaying and for refining to SAM Precious Metals FZLLC.

The gold bullion so obtained was sent to Hussain Jewellery, from where it was brought to India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lz73rc/article25319459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-cbi2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-books-customs-official-delhi-firm-others-over-alleged-smuggling-of-gold-from-dubai-to-india/article31127195.ece
72,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Couple with ‘home quarantine’ seal aboard Rajdhani Express deboarded at Kazipet,"The married couple got in at Secunderabad and were on their way to New Delhi when fellow passengers spotted the seal when the husband was washing his hands

Two passengers marked with ‘home quarantine’ stamps on their hands were deboarded on Saturday morning from a Rajdhani train between Bengaluru and Delhi on Saturday, the railways said.

The couple were travelling from Secunderabad by train number 22691 KSR Bengaluru City-Hazrat Nizamuddin Rajdhani Express, and were deboarded at Kazipet junction in Warangal district.

“2 passengers marked with mandatory quarantine were found to be travelling on Rajdhani train between Bengaluru & Delhi today. They were immediately deboarded and the entire coach was sanitised,” the Railway Ministry said in a tweet.

A railway official said the couple from Delhi have now been taken to a hospital, and the coach (B3, third AC), which was completely sanitised, was now locked. The ‘home quarantine’ seal was noticed by fellow travellers when the husband was washing his hands, the official added.

Also read: Coronavirus live updates: March 21, 2020

A fellow passenger travelling in the same coach too sent a WhatsApp message to the railway officials expressing concern about the two passengers.

As soon as the train reached Kazipet junction at around 10 a.m., the Railway Police, along with medical teams rushed to the compartment and deboarded the two passengers.

K. Jithender Reddy, RPF Sub Inspector at Kazipet, said the medical teams in full protective gear rushed the two passengers in a ambulance to MGM Hospital in Warangal. The couple were given full protective gear and then taken to the hospital.

Other passengers travelling in the same coach were shifted to other compartments as the train was not running full. The railway authorities sanitized the coach before the train began its onward journey after a delay of 90 minutes.

Railway sources told The Hindu that the couple had booked their tickets only this morning through current reservation. They boarded the train at Secunderabad Junction at 7.50 a.m.

Preliminary enquiries revealed that the newly married couple, hailing from Uttar Pradesh, had been to Indonesia for a holiday. They arrived at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Shamshabad on Friday evening and during the thermal screening were advised home quarantine. It is not known how they managed to leave the airport and board the Rajdhani Express this morning.

Other incidents

With an increasing number of such incidents taking place on trains, the Ministry appealed, “...Public is requested not to travel on passenger and long distance trains unless absolutely necessary. Be safe and keep others safe.”

The Ministry said four people travelling on the Godan Express (Train 11055) from Mumbai to Jabalpur on March 16 in B1 Coach tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday. “They came to India from Dubai last week. All concerned have been alerted to take necessary action.”

Eight passengers who travelled on AP Sampark Kranti Express from Delhi to Ramagundam on March 13, have also tested positive for COVID-19.

“Passengers are advised to avoid non-essential travel for the safety of fellow citizens,” the railways said.

73,2020/03/21,Coronavirus impact: CII urges PM for fiscal stimulus of ₹2 lakh cr. for needy people,"Suggests RBI to consider relaxing the NPA recognition norms from 90 days to 180 days till September 30, 2020.

Amidst the growing threat of Coronavirus, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president Vikram Kirloskar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting that a fiscal stimulus of ₹2 lakh crore be given in the hands of the needy citizens through Aadhar based Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)

Mr. Krloskar also suggested that RBI consider relaxing the NPA recognition norms from 90 days to 180 days till September 30, 2020 to provide relief to industry faced with payment issues as well as pressure on banks to classify loans as NPAs.

“The Government may consider a strong fiscal stimulus to the extent of 1% of GSP amounting to ₹2 lakh crore to be given in the hand of the needy citizens through Aadhar based Direct Benefit Transfer. An amount of ₹5,000 for each individual, especially the rural and urban poor and ₹10,000 for the most vulnerable section – the elderly. The PLFS data shows that there are about 20 crore casual labourers who could be the identified beneficiaries. This will help maintain the consumer demand,” wrote Mr. Kirloskar.

“Similarly, Special Mention Accounts (SMA) guidelines may be relaxed till September 30, 2020 in the form of SMA-1 category from 60 to 90 days and SMA-2 category from 90 to 180 days, beyond which the loan account may be considered NPA. These immediate measures will help industry and economy manage the economic impact and also help the banking sector tide over the stress of NPAs due to delayed debt servicing arising out of disruptions in business operations especially of SMEs,” said the letter.

To ease the cost of capital, which is currently under wide volatility, the industry body suggested that the government consider removing Long Term Capital Gains tax of 10% and fixing the total Dividend Distribution Tax at 25%.

The UN has called on all nations to stop the use of capital punishment or put a moratorium on it, a day after four men convicted of gang-raping and murdering a 23-year-old woman were hanged in India.

Seven years after the rape and murder of the young medical student, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’, sent shock waves across the country, the four convicts - Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) - were hanged to death on Friday at 5.30 a.m. in New Delhi’s Tihar Jail.

Responding to the hanging, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said the world organisation calls on all nations to stop the use of capital punishment or put a moratorium on it.

“Our position has been clear, is that we call on all States to halt the use of capital punishment or at least put a moratorium on this,” Mr. Dujarric said at the daily press briefing on Friday.

The Centre looks all set to postpone the house-listing Census and updating of the National Population Register (NPR), which was scheduled to kick off in certain States on April 1, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Two government sources confirmed to The Hindu that the Census and NPR exercises will not go ahead, given the Union Health Ministry’s own guidelines limiting mass contact on account of the coronavirus. A formal announcement from the Centre is, however, awaited.

In line with Odisha, the Delhi Government has also written to the Centre asking that the Census-NPR operations may be deferred by “at least one month” and the rescheduling of this exercise may be “reviewed in the last week of the deferment”.

President Ram Nath Kovind was supposed to be the first Indian to be enumerated in the census and NPR exercise, but the President’s schedule has been cleared and he is not meeting members of the public due to the growing threat of coronavirus.

In a letter to Vivek Joshi, Census Commissioner of India, the Delhi Government on March 18 pointed out that a “high state” of alert had been declared in the capital territory and the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, invoked.

The letter to Mr. Joshi also pointed out that since enumerators will have to go house-to-house to collect details for the Census-NPR, the “spread of COVID-19 may be exacerbated”.

Earlier in the week, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that mobilisation for the Census-NPR would pose a great risk for field functionaries and a decision to postpone the two exercises be taken immediately.

Multiple efforts to contact Mr. Joshi about the Census Commissioner’s response to the Odisha and Delhi Government letters were to no avail. He did not respond to either text or telephone calls on the issue.

In December 2019, the Union Cabinet chaired by Mr. Modi, had approved over ₹3,941.35 crore for updating the NPR across the country, barring Assam, and ₹8,754.23 crore for conducting the Census of India, 2021.

As The Hindu reported recently, at least 13 States, and Delhi, covering nearly 60 percent of the total population of India, are opposed to the updating of the NPR in the format being prepared by the Centre. Many State Assemblies have passed resolutions against the NPR and the NRC.

78,2020/03/21,Special aircraft to bring 100 Indians home from Amsterdam,"A senior official says issue was due to gaps in interpreting advisory.

After a harrowing 10 hours aboard a flight from Amsterdam to Delhi, more than 100 Indian passengers, who were not allowed to land in Delhi on Saturday due to worries over the Coronavirus pandemic, are expected to be brought to Delhi on Sunday by a special flight.

The decision to allow the passengers and a plane was taken by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which had earlier disallowed the KLM flight to land, making it turn around somewhere over Russia and return to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport.

Among the passengers, who were kept waiting at the Amsterdam airport for a total of 3 days, was a pregnant woman who developed complications as a result of the tense situation on board, and had to be hospitalised on landing in Amsterdam. One passenger, who gave up waiting to return to India, caught a flight to Canada instead, taking the final number of passengers to 102.

“[There were] some gaps in interpreting the advisory, which led to this problem,” a senior Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) official told The Hindu, indicating that the interpretation by the DGCA of an advisory dated March 16 that prohibited “travel of passengers from” Europe was wrong, as these were passengers transiting from North America.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

An official of the Ministry of Civil Aviation too explained that the aircraft was forced to return because of “inter-ministry confusion”.

KLM-871 was one hour from landing in Delhi around 1 a.m. on Saturday but was “redirected” to Amsterdam on the instructions of the aviation ministry. It was carrying passengers in transit at the Schiphol Airport who had flown in from the U.S., Canada and Mexico to catch a connecting flight. Also, it was being operated to Delhi in order to evacuate Dutch nationals before a complete ban on commercial flights kicks in on Sunday.

Hours after the flight took off from Amsterdam at 12.40 p.m. local time, officials in the Ministry of Civil Aviation got into a huddle to look at a request from the MEA to allow the flight from Amsterdam to land in India. After a hard look at the March 16 advisory, it was concluded that all passengers from Europe were barred from entering India, regardless of what their port of origin was, said officials in the know.

This couple is from the same flight. https://t.co/SL2ZZYfPTu pic.twitter.com/KISQvuAip1 — Ashoke Pandit (@ashokepandit) March 21, 2020

“The flight was forced to return despite [civil aviation authorities] being told that the flight was bringing transit passengers from North America,” an MEA official said, adding that the DGCA was also informed that elderly people and children were on board.

The husband and sister-in-law of the pregnant woman from Mumbai tweeted a number of appeals to the government as the flight spent more than 15 harrowing hours in the air. “My wife is six months pregnant and requires special assistance,” wrote her husband, Tejas Deepak Vispute. He thanked the Indian Embassy staff who assisted when the long flight led to his wife developing contractions and needing to be hospitalised at Amsterdam’s University Hospital.

Officials said a flight from Amsterdam would be allowed to land on Sunday. Although the government had put into place a ban on commercial planes, KLM would be allowed to fly a special flight, bringing the stranded Indian passengers and taking back Dutch nationals.

79,2020/03/21,"Analysis | Congress may see more defections in Madhya Pradesh, say observers","“When a new government comes in, there will be a natural attraction towards it,” they say

The fall of a seemingly stable Kamal Nath government effected by at least 22 Jyotiraditya Scindia loyalists and factional bickering points to a widening chasm between the Congress and voters in Madhya Pradesh, who are pining for the BJP, whose 15-year-long rule, though marred by scams, at least gave them a sturdy regime.

Far from being viewed as a villain amid Congress accusations of horse-trading, the BJP has instead bounced back in popularity, from caving in to anti-incumbency during the 2018 Vidhan Sabha election, yet securing a marginal vote percentage more than the Congress. “There is no sympathy left for Mr. Nath,” said Yatindra Singh Sisodia, director, Madhya Pradesh Institute of Social Science Research. “The prevailing sentiment is he couldn’t even run a smooth government and stave off offensives.”

Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Congress’s popularity was on the wane within just three-four months of coming to power. “Voters cited failure to keep loan waiver promise to farmers within 10 days and frequent power cuts as the major reasons,” said Mr. Sisodia, part of the CSDS-Lokniti survey team then.

Yet, the party nurses hope of retaining at least more than half of its 23 seats, let alone the BJP’s two erstwhile seats, that will go to byelection soon. “Mr. Scindia, along with his flock, will lend the BJP weight in the Gwalior-Chambal region where the Congress is bound to confront a political vacuum there post-defection,” he explained. And the BJP cadre locally will adjust to their former political rivals, he added, once the top leadership directs. In the region, the Congress had won 26 out of 34 seats in 2018.

Meanwhile, going by the law of averages, said Rasheed Kidwai, visiting fellow, Observer Research Foundation, the best the Congress could hope for is to retain half of the seats. “Although the rebels have not joined the BJP yet, by quitting the government, their Congress chapter is closed for now at least,” he explained. “The BJP in any case boasts a vibrant lot in the region. Fearing loss of relevance, BJP workers there will not abandon a strong bastion to switch over.”

Mr. Kidwai hinted at a mass exodus from the Congress, however, after the BJP government was sworn in. “When a new government comes in, there will be a natural attraction towards it. Other factions, including social groups, may move towards the BJP. It will be more difficult for the Congress to keep the house in order,” he said. During the recent crisis, independent MLA and Minister Pradeep Jaiswal had said he would side with whichever party remained in power, while Mr. Scindia’s spokesman Pankaj Chaturvedi had insinuated that 40 Congress MLAs would eventually switch over.

The backing of two BSP and an SP MLA to the Congress was on a shaky footing too, as they were not bound by individual commitments, Mr. Sisodia pointed out.

During the Vidhan Sabha election, the Congress emerged victor due to the BJP’s election mismanagement and not because of its virtue and the anti-incumbency factor, said Girija Shanker, Bhopal-based political analyst. “With the BJP in power, it would have an edge in the byelection as well.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dftktg/article31125698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-may-see-more-defections-in-madhya-pradesh-say-observers/article31125699.ece

The case pertains to Payal Tradelink and others. The assets attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act include the balance in bank accounts and an immovable property measuring 20.75 decimal in Jharkhand’s Ranchi.

There were huge cash deposits in the account of Payal Tradelink with the United Bank of India during the demonetisation period. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case in this regard, following which the ED initiated the money laundering probe.

The ED detected 10 other accounts linked to the company, in which the demonetised notes were deposited. The agency alleges that Abhay Sultaniya of Payal Tradelink, in collusion with others, illegally collected the trashed notes from the beneficiaries from different parts of the country.

The cash, converted into legal currency by making deposits in the accounts of 23 shell firms, was later transferred back to the beneficiaries and invoices issued to project them as legitimate payments, it is alleged.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/ps908g/article30666081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-Enforcement-Directorate-ED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-attaches-assets-worth-666-crore-in-demonetisation-linked-case/article31123994.ece
81,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Narendra Modi holds meeting with CMs; number of cases crosses 230,"Several States have imposed prohibitory orders to deal with the pandemic, more trains were cancelled as the country went into a semi-lock down mode.

With as many as 75 fresh cases being reported on Friday, the number of COVID-19 positive persons in the country stood at 236, the ICMR said.

Of these 32 are foreigners and 23 persons had been discharged after treatment. Previously, the Government had informed the Lok Sabha that 276 Indians had tested positive for the deadly disease abroad.

Coronavirus | Singer Kanika Kapoor’s COVID-19 status has politicians worried

Several States have imposed prohibitory orders to deal with the pandemic, more trains were cancelled as the country went into a semi-lock down mode.

In an advisory to hospitals and medical institutions, the Union Health Ministry said all pneumonia patients must be notified to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme so that they can be tested for COVID-19. It added that no suspected COVID-19 patient should be turned away from any hospital, and the admission of any such patient should be notified immediately. Senior Health Ministry officials also noted that they may now soon rope-in private labs for COVID-19 testing with a capping price for testing at ₹5000, which is subjected to review.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video-conference with Chief Ministers and said the COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force would devise a suitable approach to effectively tackling the economic challenge.

He advised Chief Ministers to ensure that all steps are taken and all advisories are adhered to in order to ensure the safety of citizens.

“No stone should be left unturned in our common endeavors to fight COVID-19,” an official release quoted Mr. Modi as saying. As the number of cases in Maharashtra rose to 52, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray called for more testing laboratories during the meeting with the Prime Minister.

The new cases were in Mumbai, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.

In Kerala 12 new cases, including five Britishers, were reported, taking the total number of cases to 37 even as more than 44,000 persons are under observation, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.

Continuing with its precautionary measures, Tamil Nadu imposed restrictions on vehicular traffic from neighbouring Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Only vehicles carrying essential supplies people travelling for inevitable reasons would be allowed. The State has also suspended bus and Metro Rail services on Sunday next as the Prime Minister has called for a ‘Janata Curfew’.

Monitoring of contacts

The Health Ministry said 6,700 contacts of the 223 positive cases were being monitored and that the average age of the five deceased was 64 years. Four Indians have died in the country and one in Iran.

Friday also saw the death of a 69-year-old Italian tourist who had “recovered” from the novel coronavirus at a private hospital in Jaipur. The man died after suffering a massive cardiac arrest late on Thursday night, SMS Medical College principal Sudhir Bhandari said.

Data | COVID-19 is deadliest for the elderly | India's coronavirus testing rates are among the lowest in the world

The Health Ministry said the death of the tourist was not due to COVID-19 as he had been discharged after he recovered.

The Ministry refused to call the death of the 70-year-old Italian as a COVID-death in Jaipur stating that the deceased had been discharged after he recovered and had died of cardiac arrest. “He was a chain smoker and died while getting treatment of other ailments in another hospital,'' said Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Health Ministry. Globally, there have been over 244,000 cases reported and the death toll breached the 10,000 mark.

According to a release issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a total of 206 individuals had been found positive among suspected cases and contacts of known positive cases.

At the press briefing, ICMR officials reiterated that they had no plans to increase surveillance and that the government was sticking to its approach of sampling 20 patients with symptoms of respiratory diseases across the 60-odd labs to ascertain if there was evidence of community transmission.

Coronavirus | Your COVID-19 queries answered | Helpline numbers

Scaling up testing too rapidly, ICMR’s Raman Gangakhedkar said, would strain resources as well increase costs to the government and as individuals. “If out of 100, only 1 tests positive then that is not an optimum utilisation of resources. We are approaching this according to a strategy and based on the cases confirmed will scale up as required,"" he said in response to questions from reporters.

While the number of cases from India had nearly doubled in three days, Mr. Lav Agarwal said that instructions had been given to states to increase ventilator capacity, that would be needed to care for those with severe pulmonary disease. However no numbers on such infrastructure were made available.

Mr. Agarwal asked people to use the toll free number 1075 for any query and said that the government is working on preventive approach.

“Our PM has called for Janta curfew, people have to remember that our one-day cooperation will help delay and break the chain of transmission,”Agarwal said.

Army guidelines

To prevent the spread of Coronavirus, the Army issued a fresh set of guidelines on Friday -- the number of staffers at Army Headqurters in the capital have been reduced with effect from March 23 by introducing work from home in batches.

82,2020/03/21,Centre should monitor A.P. preparedness on COVID-19: Lokesh,"TDP leader tweets that he will participate in ‘Janata Curfew’

Telugu Desam Party national general secretary Nara Lokesh on Saturday criticised the YSR Congress Party government for ‘trying to downplay the seriousness of the dreaded coronavirus pandemic’.

In a statement, the TDP leader said the claims of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government on the virus impact did not match with the health bulletins. He said the Centre should intervene and monitor the situation in the State in view of the dubious claims of the government.

Mr. Lokesh, in a tweet, said he would participate in the ‘Janata Curfew’ on Sunday as he saw social distancing and extreme hygiene as the only two ways to fight the pandemic. “I hope tomorrow will be a good start for doing that,” he said.

‘TDP leader harassed’

Mr. Lokesh accused the YSRCP MLA from Vinukonda Brahma Naidu of causing mental agony to the TDP ZPTC candidate at Savalyapuram that led to his death due to heart failure. He said the ruling party MLA had harassed many other TDP candidates in the local body elections.

Referring to the YSRCP claims that it had the support of the voters, he said the threats and intimidatory tactics used by the party in the elections was a proof that it was afraid of facing the voters.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centre-should-monitor-ap-preparedness-on-covid-19-lokesh/article31132115.ece
83,2020/03/21,Seema leaders ‘unhappy’ with HC stay on relocation of offices,"‘YSRCP will take steps to vacate the stay’

YSRCP and TDP leaders in the district have expressed unhappiness over the High Court orders staying the relocation of the Vigilance Commissionerate and the Commissionerate of Inquiries offices to Kurnool.

YSRCP Kurnool parliament constituency in charge B.Y. Ramaiah said that the party would take steps to get the stay vacated. “These are only minor hurdles. We will contest the stay in the court, and make sure that the offices will be set up in Kurnool,” he said.

“Kurnool will become the Judicial capital as promised by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” Mr. Ramaiah said.

TDP district president Somisetty Venkateswarlu also expressed regret over the stay order. “Opportunities for our (Rayalaseema) people will not come if the High Court does not shift to Kurnool,” he said.

Mr. Venkateswarlu added that the party had always been in favour of setting up a High Court bench in Kurnool. “Not just the High Court, it also must be made the capital city along with Visakhapatnam with all the offices,” he added. Development would not happen with the setting up of High Court alone.

‘Jagan acted in haste’

CPI(M) district secretary K. Prabhakar Reddy claimed that the hastiness of Mr. Jagan gave the High Court space to give a stay order. “If the Chief Minister was not so hasty, both the commissionerates would have been relocated to Kurnool,” he added.

The Kurnool Bar Association declined to comment on the matter.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/seema-leaders-unhappy-with-hc-stay-on-relocation-of-offices/article31132109.ece

The Department of Health has over 12,000 persons who travelled abroad recently under observation at various levels across the State as of Saturday and the situation is being effectively handled, said Special Chief Secretary (Health, Medicine and Family Welfare) K.S. Jawahar Reddy.

At a press conference here on Saturday, along with Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Health Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas, Mr. Jawahar Reddy said that so far 13,168 foreign returnees since February have been identified and 12,953 of them have been tracked and put under observation at various levels. He said that there could be some duplicate entries in the final list of returnees.

“The Central government gave us a list of 7,147 foreign returnees since March 1 and through the household-level survey in which 1.33 lakh houses were covered 6,162 returnees were traced. Of the returnees, 2,052 have completed 28 days of isolation and 10,859 are under home isolation,” Mr. Jawahar said.

The authorities have sent samples of a 42-year-old dead person for COVID-19 tests from Guntur to clear apprehensions even though it was primarily a non-COVID case, Mr. Jawahar said.

As per the latest health bulletin, the test results of seven samples were awaited.

Meanwhile, the State has constituted a technical committee with physicians and pulmonologists for containment, control and prevention of the spread of COVID-19.

85,2020/03/21,Vehicles under surveillance at border check-posts,"T.N. officials restrict entry of vehicles from A.P.

On the eve of ‘janata curfew’, uneasy moments prevailed at the check-posts on the Chittoor-Tamil Nadu border, with the police and road transport officials intensifying surveillance.

While vehicles were entering the Chittoor district from Tamil Nadu on half a dozen routes without any screening at the check-posts, the officials on the T.N. side were sending back vehicles in case of unconvincing answers from the passengers, apart from sanitising the vehicles being allowed into their State.

The T.N. officials mounted surveillance at the border check-posts on the State and national highways from Kuppam towards Krishnagiri, Barguru, Tirupattur and Vaniyambadi.

According to information, APSRTC buses were not allowed at the Barguru check-post in the morning, forcing the commuters to take alternative routes in share autorickshaws through rural roads.

Passenger rush

In view of the reports that public transport would come to a standstill from Saturday midnight, passengers from both States were seen moving frantically in whatever facility that was available. The cancellation of several trains passing through the Kuppam railway station also had its effect, with a gush of passengers moving in buses and private vehicles.

The flower merchants who regularly book consignments to various T.N. towns had to convince the officials at the check-posts in view of the perishable nature of the goods.

The traffic on the busy national highways towards Chennai from Uttukottai (T.N.) and Nagari has also been put under surveillance.

Sanitisation

Circle inspector (Nagari Urban) K. Maddaiahchari said there was no problem on the border check-posts. “As the T.N. officials stopped the vehicles for the purpose of sanitisation, it was mistaken by some for questioning. In view of the COVID-19 scare, there was a drop in the number of private vehicles hitting the highways,” he said.

Meanwhile, with reduction in the number of services of the APSRTC, share autorickshaws had a field day with packed crowds on the Narayanavanam and Nagari routes.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/93do2x/article31132082.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22VJCOVIDVEHICLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vehicles-under-surveillance-at-border-check-posts/article31132083.ece

The police department has swung into action to fight the coronavirus which has already created panic in Srikakulam district. Two special task force teams consisting of more than 50 trained personnel have been drafted to handle emergency situation.

Superintendent of Police R.N. Ammi Reddy told The Hindu that the teams would function round the clock in association with the Medical and Health Department in taking up preventive steps.

“As many as 359 persons have returned from foreign countries in the last couple of weeks. We are identifying others who had failed to inform about their arrival to the police department. They are supposed to provide all the details and should be in isolation wards or home quarantine since they might be potential carriers of the virus,” he said.

“We directed all the station house officers to gather information about foreign returnees and register cases immediately if they are moving freely without following the guidelines of the government,” said Mr. Ammi Reddy.

Inspects ward

Along with medical officials, he visited the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences where 20 beds were kept in an isolation ward.

He said the pace at which the virus was spreading was causing serious concern and ‘janata curfew’ from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi would go a long way in checking the spread of the virus.

The arterial roads in the South coastal Andhra cities of Nellore and Ongole wore a deserted look on Saturday on the eve of nation-wide Janata Curfew.

There was not much movement of vehicles at the usually busy VRC Centre and other places in Nellore as panic-stricken people remained indoors in the wake of the city reporting the first COVID-19 case in the State. The usually busy bus station was deserted as only a small number of passengers travelled while others confined themselves to their homes. Long distance buses were withdrawn later in the day.

Most of the shops and commercial establishments in the city downed the shutters by evening. Places of worship in the city, including the famous Rajarajeswari temple, closed early after performing the daily rituals. Those who had to come out were seen wearing masks or covering their mouth and nose with hand kerchief.

Reviewing the health situation with SPSR Nellore district officials, State Irrigation Minister P.Anil Kumar Yadav underscored the need for people to avoid visit to crowded places.

Collector J.Nivas on Saturday said that an exclusive quarantine home had been set up at Etcherla, on the outskirts of Srikakulam to keep symptomatic persons, adding that keeping them here would be safer than asking them to self-quarantine at home in which case their family members would be at risk too.

Screening at Etcherla

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr.Nivas said the district administration was working in concert with the Union government to identify foreign returnees hailing from Srikakulam. He said they would be screened at Etcherla itself. “We are also keeping a tab on the number of fishermen landing at Visakhapatnam port. Fisheries department has been advised to raise awareness over the issue among the communities,” he added.

Drug stores under scanner

The Collector made it clear that that the district administration would take stern action on medical shops which were found to be selling masks and sanitisers at exorbitant rates. “We have formed special teams with Srikakulam Revenue Divisional Officer M.V. Ramana to inspect pharmacies randomly. Action will be initiated against anyone who is flouting the rules,” said Mr. Nivas.

He appreciated Srikakulam Lions Club president N. Mohan and Sri Navyandhra Sondikula Samskshema Sangham State president N. Koteswara Chowdary for distributing masks at free of cost to people on behalf of their organisations.

TDP Polit Bureau member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has said that the YSRCP government is trapped in a legislative, administrative and constitutional crisis of its own making as it took “unlawful and arrogant decisions” in violation of established laws and conventions.

“This is evident from the government bluffing even the courts,” he said, referring to the High Court suspending the G.O. relocating the offices of Vigilance Commissioner and the Commissinerate of Inquiries from Amaravati to Kurnool.

Mr. Ramakrishnudu also stated in a release that lack of security to the State Election Commissioner and his family exposed the fragile law and order situation.

He accused the YSRCP government of crippling all institutions in the State, especially the police and constitutional bodies such as the State Election Commission and the A.P. Public Service Commission.

The TDP leader further alleged that the government had not announced any package that would help in fighting COVID-19 pandemic while Kerala earmarked ₹20,000 crore for taking emergency measures and Haryana imposed Section 144 in all the districts.

In a bid to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Brandix India Apparel City (BIAC), India’s largest apparel park located at Atchutapuram, about 50-km from here, has closed down all its units for a week.

We took the step to close down all factories from the early hours of Saturday considering the directives issued by the Ministry of Health and the State Government, BIAC India partner P. Doraswamy told The Hindu.

Brandix has developed India’s largest apparel park at one place in an area of 1,000 acres. The apparel park, which came up in the A.P. Special Economic Zone, has the largest workforce of 22,000, of which 18,000 are women. Major clients of the BIAC, which makes undergarments for men and women, are from the U.S.

Mr. Doraswamy said they would take a call after taking stock of the situation on March 25. He clarified that during the week-long period, the workforce would be paid salaries as usual.

Advisory to employees

“Closing down the factories was decided solely to ensure the safety and well-being of our associates amidst the spread of COVID-19 world-wide. During the period of closure, all associates are advised to remain at home and drastically restrict their movement out of home. They should go out only for essential / unavoidable needs,” the company said in a circular.

93,2020/03/21,Garment units pose a worry for locals,"Over 5,000 women are employed at the factories, which are yet to suspend operations

While Chittoor district is ramping up its preparedness to fight the COVID-19 outbreak, uninterrupted operations at two garment factories at the Kuppam industrial estate are causing disquiet among locals.

The garment factories employ over 5,000 women, who work in two shifts. The factories begin operations at dawn and close late in the evening. Women from nearby villages of Kuppam, Gudupalle and Shantipuram mandals are employed here. Hundreds of women from the rural side come to work in auto-rickshaws and local buses.

Prior to the COVID-19 scare, there was wide appreciation for the garment units as they were seen as an example of women empowerment. However, the tables have turned, and these same units are now being treated with suspicion, and locals are apprehensive of coming into contact with the women workers.

Police personnel at Kuppam said that the locals did not really consider the garment units to be a threat until a fortnight ago.

“The current situation looks really serious. The women, hailing from impoverished rural sectors, eke out their livelihood working hard in shifts to support their families. But the situation is looking grim now and it is better that the units shut down temporarily,” a constable said.

Batches of women from several villages travel in auto-rickshaws to the garment factories and back. Auto-rickshaws crammed with 12-15 women passengers is a regular sight in these parts. While availing their leave or weekly offs, the women along with their families would go to visit their relatives at neighboring villages along the Tamil Nadu and Karnataka borders.

It is observed that though the garment units provide all the workers with sterilised masks at the workstations, the women leave the masks there while signing off for the day, putting themselves at risk of contracting the virus.

Srinivasulu, who lives close to a garment industry on the Tirupattur-Kuppam road, said that the post of the constituency-level official of the labour department had been vacant for the last couple of years in Kuppam. “There is absolutely no official machinery to monitor the prevailing conditions in Kuppam as far as the garment units are concerned,” he said.

Women workers said that it would be not possible for them to miss work for more than a day or two, as they are totally dependent on the job to support their families. “We do follow safety measures, but we cannot avoid travelling in crowded vehicles. We agree that there is an urgent need to sanitise the vehicles that we travel in.

So far in the city, it is learnt that one doctor who was treating a COVID-19 positive case has gone into self-quarantine while two staff nurses who have developed symptoms are kept under observation.

This, however, will not deter the men and women in white coats from turning up at work every day to treat those affected by coronavirus.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the country to observe a ‘Janata Curfew’ as part of measures to clamp down on the spread of COVID-19. A pertinent point that the Prime Minister made in his televised address was an appeal to citizens to come out on to their balcony or doorstep at 5 p.m. on Sunday and applaud the medical fraternity, the police and the administrative machinery by clapping their hands or by clanging utensils continuously for five minutes as a show of gratitude for their selfless work in combating the spread of the coronavirus as well as treating those affected by it.

With the COVID-19 threat entering the third phase, it is time that people in the health sector and other frontline sectors deserve a round of applause for their dedicated work especially during this crucial juncture.

In Visakhapatnam, there are around 300 doctors, including specialists and young house surgeons and PG students, over 500 staff nurses, over 1,000 health workers drawn from ASHA and ANM sectors and another 1,000 sanitary workers, who are directly involved in the core area of service, right from checking, treating to sanitising.

“There is a risk, but we have taken the Hippocratic Oath to always serve our patients come what may,” said Dr. Rajesh, who is on the verge of completing his house surgeon-ship, and has been drafted into a team of doctors.

“This is the time that we have to live up to our oath. There is no backing out now,” said Dr. S. Lakshmi Sowjanya, member of the District Rapid Response Team and Trainer of Trainers.

She has been training doctors, staff nurses, sanitary workers, and health workers, relentlessly for the last few weeks on the precautions to be taken, how to wear protective gear and how to approach a case.

According to Dr. Lakshmi, despite wearing protective gear, doctors and nurses are exposed to varying degrees of risk.

“In the case of a suspect patient, the risk is mild to minimal. In the case of a positive patient, the risk can range from moderate to high. But that won’t deter us from going ahead with the job on hand,” she said.

Sreedevi (name changed), a senior staff nurse at KGH, also voiced similar thoughts. “We draw inspiration from Florence Nightingale, the Lady with the Lamp. The time has come for us to rise to the occasion,” she said.

Safety gear

According to P.V. Sudhakar, principal of Andhra Medical College (AMC), and in-charge of the quarantine facility at VIMS, adequate PPE (personal protective equipment) comprising headgear, gowns, shoe covers, gloves, masks and goggles have been acquired and distributed. “We have also trained the staff on how to wear, remove and dispose of the gear in keeping with guidelines,” Dr. Sudhakar said.

Former bureaucrat EAS Sarma said the protective gear should also be provided to sanitary workers. They should be provided masks and gloves, as they are engaged in cleaning the city on a daily basis, which includes removal of medical waste, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/j5suy9/article31130855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-VZ-POLICEMASKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/time-to-thank-those-on-the-frontlines-against-covid-19/article31130856.ece

96,2020/03/21,75 students stuck in Singapore reach India,"Indian High Commission was not forthcoming, alleges medico

A group of 75 students hailing from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, finally returned home from Singapore on Friday evening after a 72-hour ordeal.

The students were forced to spend heavily on last-minute flight tickets as Air India Express did not make travel arrangements for them from Singapore to Chennai.

K. Namratha Reddy, a medical student at a Phillippine university, hailing from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, told The Hindu on Saturday that the Singapore authorities came to their help, providing them food, even as the Indian High Commission there was not even forthcoming to help them leave the country and come back to India.

Students had booked their tickets from Manila to Singapore and Singapore to Chennai, but since the Air India Express did not operate its flights, they had to book their tickets to Mumbai by paying ₹37,000 per person, and again book domestic tickets separately to their individual hometowns.

The ordeal of the students did not end on Thursday late night, as they were stopped by the Maharashtra police at the Chhatrapathi Shivaji Airport in Mumbai, and were told that pasengers arriving from international destinations would not be allowed to fly on domestic routes.

“We were given a clean chit as far as our COVID-19 health status was concerned, but had to go through a lot of discussions with officials before we could fly out of Mumbai airport and reach our destinations by Friday evening,” Ms. Namratha said.

“Our parents are a happy lot and are relieved that we have come back home,” Ms. Namratha said, adding that it was unfortunate that there was a lack of communication from the Indian government on how to fly back home.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/75-students-stuck-in-singapore-reach-india/article31130724.ece

98,2020/03/21,"Bodies of woman, 3 children found floating in farm well","Police were unable to identify the bodies as they were decomposed beyond recognition

Decomposed bodies of a woman and three children were fished out of a well in a farm at Prasannagari Palle village under Punganur mandal headquarters on Saturday evening.

The four bodies were decomposed beyond recognition and hence could not be identified, police said, adding that the woman’s age was expected to be in the 30s while the children were below 10 years of age.

Some farmers who were returning home from their fields spotted the four bodies floating in an abandoned farm well along the Punganur-Ramasamudram road on Saturday evening. They immediately alerted the police, who rushed to the spot and fished out the bodies.

Police said that in all likelihood, the woman could be the mother of the three children.

“According to local information, the four persons are thought to have come from outside. We are also verifying with police stations in bordering areas of Karnataka and neighboring mandals in the district about any cases of missing persons,” a police officer said.

Police said that it is too early to say if it is a case of suicide or murder as the cause of death would be ascertained only after a post-mortem. “Due to heavy decomposition of the bodies, we are unable to identify them,” officers said. A case of suspicious death was registered.

99,2020/03/21,Campaign to sensitise tribal people on COVID-19 launched,"Kalajatha teams in local dialect to stress on safety measures

Kalajatha teams from Nature, an NGO, have launched an awareness campaign among tribal people on COVID-19 in six mandals in Paderu ITDA area.

The cultural troupes will spread the message on precautions and social distance required to prevent spread of the virus through street plays and songs with the support of village secretaries, line departments, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiative (APPI) with technical assistance from DKA, Austria, NEG-FIRE, Mothers for Credit and Childline Foundation.

The activists launched the campaign at Araku and Dumbriguda areas on Saturday through ‘Community Empowerment Education on Wheels,’ programme. The teams explained about the importance of observing people’s curfew on Sunday as per the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The tribal people were told to wash their hands regularly with sanitisers or soaps and contact nearest hospital/doctor if they come across symptoms like fever, cough and cold and maintain distance while interacting with visitors and others.

Taking part in the inauguration of the week-long awareness campaign, founder-director of Nature S.B. Balaraju said that after the virus was declared pandemic by WHO, the risk perceptions in India was rated as very high due to crowding at various places and migration of people from one place to another for work.

During the week-long programme, the tribal people will be sensitised in the local dialects on the underlying causes, symptoms and spreading of the virus.

100,2020/03/21,Buzzing Tirupati screeches to a halt,"Decision to stop darshan at Tirumala keeps the huge pilgrim crowds away from temple city

The COVID-19 scare has created enough ripples that the people across the country have been advised to stay indoors to avoid social gathering. When this in itself is enough to wreak havoc on small businesses, street vendors and hawkers, one can imagine the case of the ever-buzzing temple city of Tirupati, and the loss of business likely in store due to the absence of the tens of thousands of pilgrims that visit the city every day.

Tirupati has always been a haven for small-time business community. Every alternate shop in the core city area and on the hills makes brisk business by selling portraits, laminated photos and illuminated images of Lord Venkateswara. Caps are sold like hot cakes to those sporting tonsured heads, while the same outlets started selling dhotis too, after traditional dress was made compulsory at Tirumala. In a nutshell, there is business opportunity everywhere. However, the current crisis has hit every rung in this multi-layered business model, right from the hundreds of roadside eateries around the central bus station to the kumkum vendors at Alipiri trekking route and finally to the sacred yellow wristband makers of Patnool Street.

Big blow

Even as the message and scare spread on the virus, the pilgrim footfall started dwindling over a week. While the precautionary measures adopted by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) such as keeping the Pushkarini out of bounds for pilgrims and screening the trekking devotees with thermal scanners were indicative of a looming threat, the decision announced on Thursday to stop darshan at Tirumala for at least a week starting March 20 came as the proverbial last straw for the small traders.

Mastanaiah Mandadi, who sells puffed rice and samosas near SVIMS circle, was shell-shocked on finding the crowd on the road getting thinner by every passing day. ""I have heard of the virus spreading in China and elsewhere, but did not expect it to hit my samosa business in this town,"" he said wryly.

Migrant auto drivers

Similarly, Mohammad Rafi, an autorickshaw driver who migrated from Piler to Tirupati eyeing big business, is equally disillusioned.

For the last two decades, many unemployed youth from the western Chittoor mandals like Piler, Madanapalle and Palamaner and southern Kadapa areas like Kodur and Rayachoti migrated to Tirupati to work as autorickshaw drivers, to meet the needs of the huge floating population. The loss of business was too much to bear during the last two days. ""We witnessed a similar situation during the Samaikyandhra movement,"" recalls Areti Bayyanna, who recently upgraded to a new autorickshaw by taking a vehicle loan.

The situation is expected to turn only worse and not improve, till the deadline on travel is lifted.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/j7rlz6/article31129829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223608437col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/buzzing-tirupati-screeches-to-a-halt/article31129830.ece
101,2020/03/21,COVID-19: 56-bed isolationblock to be ready soon,"Collector advises people to maintain social distancing

The district administration is getting ready to deal with any situation in the wake of coronavirus outbreak in the country by opening a 56-bed isolation block at the new Government Super Speciality Hospital and an equal number of beds at the Government General Hospital and private hospitals.

In a couple of days, the new block with 34 ventilators, 56 beds, sufficient number of doctors and paramedical staff would be ready, said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu and District Medical and Health Officer K.V.N.S. Anil Kumar at a press conference on Saturday.

The District Collector made a fervent request to stay at homes unless it was a medical emergency.

Stressing the need for learning contrasting lessons from Italy and South Korea, Mr. Gandham Chandrudu said while Italy took the COVID-19 warning very lightly, the South Korean government implemented safety measures strictly with the cooperation of the people. “While there are more than 4,000 deaths in Italy, the number of cases in South Korea were very few, though geographically they were very closeby,” he observed.

‘No positive cases’

The Anantapur district has so far recorded no COVID-19 positive case despite the district getting 547 persons travelling from the countries where the corona virus spreads. “We have been testing patients as per the laid down protocol and out of three swabs sent to NIV, Pune, all the three turned out to be negative,” said Dr. Anil Kumar.

While every person cannot be and need not be tested, a COVID-19 testing lab that would be functional in a day or two would be handy, he said.

“While 419 persons are under home isolation at present, 36 persons could not be traced. While 90 of them have completed 28 days of observation, 93 suspects are in 14 to 28 day period and 326 below 14 days of observation,” said the District Collector, adding that home-to-home surveillance was being conducted for all the 12 lakh households in the district

Meanwhile, the district administration has sounded two private hospitals in the city to block 175 beds in case the number of suspected COVID-19 cases increases in the next fortnight. While KIMS Saveera will part with 100 beds, Chandra Hospital will spare 75 beds.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/g9zxhm/article31129629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22ONGCOLLECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-56-bed-isolationblock-to-be-ready-soon/article31129630.ece
102,2020/03/21,Guntur on high alert,"Three suspected cases under observation

Guntur, a trading and commercial hub and the land of Red Chilli, is known for export of commercial crops. For many years, the district has been frequented by many foreign nationals, including many from Asian countries, and thus the recent outbreak of novel coronavirus has generated a high alert from the district authorities.

Even though not even a single positive case of COVID-19 has been recorded in the district, Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar says that the district administration has begun taking precautions. All educational institutions, parks and stadiums have been asked to close down till further orders.

At least three persons suspected of showing symptoms of the virus infection have been kept under observation. As many as 875 persons who have returned from foreign countries have also been asked to follow self-quarantine.

The samples of two persons who have returned from East Asian countries have been sent to Vijayawada and they have been admitted at the isolation ward in the Fever Hospital at Gorantla.

GO on public safety

This follows the release of a government order, GO Ms No. 189, on public safety that advised all the foreign returnees isolation in their homes for a minimum period of 14 days. The family members should also inform the authorities about foreign returnees and restrict their travel. Any violation of the order would be viewed seriously and action would be taken against them under Section 188 of IPC. In extreme cases, their passports and visas could be impounded.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/guntur-on-high-alert/article31129621.ece
103,2020/03/21,Poultry sector in distress as chicken goes off menu,"Local favourite ‘chicken pakodi’ has no takers in Kurnool

As rumours on COVID-19 continue to do the rounds on social media, the consumption of poultry products is coming to a gradual halt. Many people are choosing not to consume chicken even after numerous advisories issued by the authorities that spread of coronavirus does not correlate with food habits.

Kurnool has hundreds of ‘chicken pakodi’ stalls spread across the city. The favourite snack of working-class people has taken a hit due to the fears around consuming chicken. Once thriving small businesses are now sporting an abandoned look as the panic around the spread of the virus is setting in.

""Earlier, I used to sell about 40 kg chicken a day. But in the past few weeks, it has come down to less than 5 kg,"" laments K. Madhu, a chicken pakodi stall owner. ""We generally hike the prices in summer due to shortage of chicken. However, we are now selling at a reduced price to make ends meet,"" he says.

Madhu is among hundreds of other stall owners who have become concerned about their livelihood. ""I have been doing this for a long time now. We are hoping that good times will return soon and we will be back in profits,"" remarks another such hawker.

Equally concerned are poultry farmers. K.B. Narasimha, who has been in this business for over 10 years now, says that March, April and May are generally downtimes for the farmers as people move away from consuming chicken due to various festivals and summer. The added COVID-19 fear has pushed the sales further down. ""A kg chicken is fetching the farmer just about ₹30,"" he bemoans. ""While the poultry farmers tied up with big businesses won’t be affected, smaller farmers are suffering massive losses,"" he says.

Bid to allay fears

Doctors, medical and health officials and even the district authorities have put out advisories that consuming poultry products is safe. Recently, Anantapur Collector G. Chandrudu held a press conference and ate chicken to allay fears among people on consumption of poultry products. ""COVID-19 spreads through diseased persons only, and has nothing to do with regular food habits,"" clarifies the principal of medical college Dr. P. Chandrasekhar, talking to The Hindu.

Some poultry farmers and retailers in the country have also taken up awareness campaigns on coronavirus in a bid to save their businesses.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cvd01r/article31129535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223608611col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/poultry-sector-in-distress-as-chicken-goes-off-menu/article31129536.ece
104,2020/03/21,Small businesses take a big hit,"Markets see thin crowds; even fruit, flower sellers start feeling the impact

The coronavirus, on which Prime Minister Narendra Modi has just declared an all-out war, has taken the sheen off the bustling shopping centres in Vijayawada as people have been staying off roads due to the fear the virus.

Ever since the alarm bells started ringing in the country, there has not been much rush in the markets. And, no sooner than the Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) government directed that social distancing measures be taken and malls, cinema theatres and other places of public gathering be shut down, people started feeling the heat. The unintended consequence of it is small businesses taking a hit because people have been confining themselves to the safety of their homes.

The mood is palpable as not only the people but also traders and hawkers restricted their movements. This is in the context of the State government (the Municipal Administration Department) making the closure of all malls and markets compulsory till the month-end as part of the COVID containment measures. This essential clampdown affected every section and the small business community is the worst-hit with their sales already seeing a dip and the near future looking bleak.

Traders desperate

K. Ranga Rao, a children’s garment trader on the Besant Road, is distraught as the footfalls have come down drastically even as the summer vacation is around. He observed that the few people seen on roads are wary of the lurking danger and even his fellow businessmen are fearing an outbreak of the coronavirus. ""If this situation continues, I have to reduce the prices

to attract a handful of customers lest my inventory should remain worthless,"" he told this correspondent.

The plight of the motley group of flower vendors at the PWD Grounds on M.G. Road is far worse as there are not many takers for the flowers during the day and as the darkness sets in, the flowers start perishing. Fruit sellers and juice-makers are also facing the impact of the thinning crowds.

Normally, the demand for fruits and juices shoots up this time of the year but COVID-19 has brought an unexpected misery. They are forced to play the waiting game and there is not much of hope for the coming days.

""We do good business every year in the run up to summer but that is not the case now. I think it is due to the COVID threat. Our business is hit but what can we do?"" averred Rajesh, a small fruit merchant near Pandit Nehru Bus Station while expecting a quick end to the crisis.

Pin hopes on govt.

One can see the Besant Road, Kaleswararao market, Eluru Road, Lenin Centre and other shopping areas pulling small crowds compared to the days before COVID spread to A.P. While cursing their fate, the traders are anticipating that the government comes to their rescue in one way or the other to enable them to recover from the shock.

Meanwhile, there is almost a frenzy for surgical masks as people believe that they will be 100% safe by wearing them whether or not they go through the grind of following the slew of health advisories issued by the government.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/39s0ih/article31129520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/223640417col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/small-businesses-take-a-big-hit/article31129522.ece

The TTD on Saturday fashioned out a novel design to dispose of its stock of unsold laddus.

A staggering 2.70 lakh unsold laddus were left with the TTD on Friday — the day it resolved not to allow pilgrims for the darshan of Lord Venkateswara as part of its efforts to contain the community spread of COVID-19.

The TTD on an average produces nearly three lakh laddus every day and sells it across the counters at ₹50 each to pilgrims. A buffer stock of laddus running into a couple of lakhs is also maintained daily to meet any sudden spurt in the demand.

Given the immense sentiments attached to the laddu prasadam, the TTD could neither let it go waste nor dispose it of to the public for want of devotees.

After brooding over the issue, the officials decided to provide 10 laddus to each employee free of cost as ‘Ugadi’ (Telugu New Year) gift. There are about 23,000-odd employees working in TTD including regular, contract and outsourced employees.

111,2020/03/21,Minister rubbishes rumours on closure of market yards,"‘They will be sanitised in the wake of COVID-19 alert and kept open’

Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu has stated that all agricultural market yards in the State will be open as usual, and farmers need not worry about the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their crops.

Mr. Kannababu’s statement comes in the wake of rumours that the government is contemplating closing down the markets.

Addressing the media here on Friday, the Minister rubbished the rumours and said, “All the markets will be cleaned/sanitised and will remain open. The government will take stringent action against the traders who try to take advantage of the situation.”

The poultry industry was witnessing heavy losses due to the fear in the wake of coronavirus alert. In view of a drop in the prices of maize and jowar, the government decided to purchase the produce from the farmers from April 1.

The government would provide MSP for various crops and ensure that no farmer incurred losses.

A joint meeting with the traders and farmers would be convened soon to analyse the market situation, he said.

In all, 4,000 Rythu Bharosa Centers are already functioning. Works are on to set up another 4,000 such centres. A total of 11,158 Rythu Bharosa Centers will be ready by May.

Booking on e-cropping is mandatory for every farmer to avail of the welfare schemes, the Minister said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/minister-rubbishes-rumours-on-closure-of-market-yards/article31123438.ece

113,2020/03/21,"New lease of life for 1,600 rare manuscripts","Experts hope to complete the delicate task by April 15

The State Department of Archaeology and Museums (DAM) is engaged in the chemical treatment of a treasure trove of 1,600 palm-leaf manuscripts, dated back to the 17th, 18th and 19th century, at the Andhra Sahitya Parishad Archaeology Museum and Research Institute here.

DAM Assistant Director K. Timma Raju told The Hindu that the text in the manuscripts belongs to the fields of ayurveda, mathematics, astrology, Telugu and Sanskrit literature and classical music.

“The text of the Hindu epics — Ramayana and Mahabharata — is also available in the manuscripts,” said Mr. Timma Raju.

AMD chemist K. Rambabu said the chemical treatment, applying lemon grass and other chemicals, began in February and would be completed by April 15. Each manuscript consists of nearly 500 pages. Much of the collection was in good condition and this had made their job easy, he added

Keeping pests at bay

Wooden wrappers are being added to the manuscripts to make handling easy during the chemical treatment exercise. The chemically-treated manuscripts are preserved by covering them with pure cotton fabric to protect from any pest attack in the future.

A crew of 15 experts led by Mr. Rambabu is involved in the conservation exercise.

In 2015, the government launched chemical treatment of 4,780 palm-leaf manuscripts housed at the Andhra Sahitya Parishad Archaeology Museum and Research Institute. As many as 3,060 manuscripts were chemically treated in that year.

In the 1970s, the Andhra Sahitya Parishad, a literary organisation, had handed over its collection of manuscripts to the AMD to run the museum and preserve the manuscripts in the city.

Taking a cue from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, Minister for Tourism Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said that it is time to show some discipline and self-restraint.

Assuring that the State government is geared up to handle any eventualities, he urged the people to stay away from public places and public gatherings.

“Keeping the present situation in mind, both the citizen and the government should work as a team, to beat the COVID-19 scare,” he said. Mr. Srinivas Rao went ahead to announce that from Saturday, public meetings from the government side and even press conferences will be avoided, as far as possible.

He asked the officials concerned to issue at least two health bulletins (morning and evening) on a daily basis to the media, so that right information would reach the people and rumours mongers in the social media can be kept at bay. “We have advised the Commissioner of Police to take appropriate action against all those who are indulging in spreading rumours through social media and also against those who are not following the home quarantine protocol,” he said.

115,2020/03/21,CPI terms Gogoi nomination to Rajya Sabha ‘unethical’,"‘It raises serious questions over independence of the Judiciary system’

Communist Party of India (CPI) national secretary K. Narayana has dubbed as ‘unethical’ the nomination of former Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha, saying this could raise questions over independence of Judiciary. He called upon the President of India to recall the appointment to ensure people’s confidence in the judicial system.

Addressing a media conference at the party office here on Friday, Mr. Narayana said the ‘separation of powers’ between Judiciary and Executive were especially significant in this case, since Mr. Gogoi had headed Benches in key cases in which the government had political stakes, including the Rafale, dismissal of CBI director Alok Verma and the Ayodhya dispute.

“Coincidentally, the government in January appointed the former CJI’s brother Air Marshall (Retd.) Anjan Kumar Gogoi as a full-time non-official member of the North Estern Council (NEC)”, Mr. Narayana pointed out, adding that Justice Gogoi’s tenure as CJI, which ended on November 17, 2019, was marked by controversies including allegations of sexual harassment.

‘Not the first’

Indicating that it was not a first of its kind, Dr. Narayana also pointed out that the Modi government had triggered a similar controversy in 2014 by appointing another former CJI Justice P. Sathasivam as Governor of Kerala.

“Justice Sathasivam had presided over a Bench that gave significant relief to the then Gujarat Home Minister Amit Shah in the custodial killing case of Tulsiram Prajapati. Shah is now the Union Home Minister,” he observed.

Sensing a ‘quid pro quo’ case, the CPI Secretary also said that Mr. Gogoi had already become the driving force behind updating the controversial National Registry of Citizens(NRC) in Assam.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/23wv4/article31123314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21VJGOGOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cpi-terms-gogoi-nomination-to-rajya-sabha-unethical/article31123315.ece

The Visakhapatnam Special Economic Zone (VSEZ) has so far issued approvals to 95 new units in the current financial year with an investment of ₹8,631 crore and exports to the tune of ₹59,111 crore.

The VSEZ located at the Duvvada near here has jurisdiction over the SEZs in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

“The investments have a projected employment generation of 69,077 in the next five years,” VSEZ Development Commissioner A. Rama Mohan Reddy said on Wednesday after attending the unit approval committee meeting in Hyderabad.

He said the enthusiasm for setting up IT units, or expanding the existing units, in Hyderabad SEZs did not diminish. The number of applications received and approved in the last 11 months for new units had increased manifold, setting a new record in the 30-year history of the VSEZ, he added.

Exports

Mr. Reddy said the VSEZ had set a new record in the growth of exports and secured first position in the country among all the seven zones by achieving the highest rate of 35.05% compared to the previous year.

“Despite global slowdown in the production sector, we have achieved 27.54% growth in exports of merchandise in SEZs. As on Tuesday, our consolidated export figures touched ₹94,126 crore for merchandise and services,” he said.

At this pace of growth, with a few more days to end the financial year, he hoped that the VSEZ would record a final growth of 31.8%.

Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday called on people to observe ‘janata curfew’ from 7 am to 9 pm on March 22 in response to the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

All sectors, with the exception of police, medical, fire services and those concerned with supply of essential commodities such as milk, should heed the call. People should stay indoors during that period, he said, adding, “also, as Mr. Modi said, stand in your balconies and clap appreciating the services of doctors, emergency services, etc, at 5 p.m. Sirens would be blown to alert the people.”

He asked the officials to be on high alert and closely monitor the situation. The Village Secretariat system can be used effectively in creating awareness about coronavirus.

Strict monitoring

Only three positive cases have been registered in the State. Those three have returned from Italy, the UK and Saudi Arabia (Mecca). All those who came from foreign countries were asked to stay isolated in their respective houses. The government had taken all the required measures and was strictly monitoring the foreign returnees.

Collectors should inspect district and teaching hospitals on a regular basis to ascertain the availability of medicines, protective coats, etc., he said.

The government would take action against those who flout rules and spread rumours, Mr. Jagan, adding said there was no need for panic buying as shops would remain open. The day-to-day life and availability of essential commodities would be as usual, he said.

123,2020/03/21,APSRTC foresees dip in travel demand,"Will curtail operations in phases, says official

On Thursday night, the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) officials rushed 16 buses to the campus of the IIIT Nuzvid to cater to the transport needs of the students who were asked to vacate hostels and go home after the institution declared holidays in view of the advisory on social distancing due to the coronavirus scare.

The officials say there is a sudden spurt in travel by people which they feel is a transition phase. Although there has not been any significant drop in the corporation’s earnings so far, it may scale down operations from Saturday.

The spurt in travel is because of people returning home from different directions to keep the virus at bay. With the shutdown of a large number of engineering colleges, the Intermediate students about to finish their final exams on March 23 and closing down of schools to safeguard students from the virus impact, there is bound to be a drop in the travel demand.

As many as 488 school buses have been stopped. “We’ll have to prune the operations in a phased way in the days to come. We are reviewing the situation every 12 hours and will take decisions accordingly,” said the corporation’s Executive Director (Operations) K. S. Brahmananda Reddy.

Clean-up act

Mr. Reddy said that the staff and workers had been instructed to take up sanitisation of the RTC buses and bus stations and disinfect the depots as well.

Responding to a query on the demand by the workers, especially the bus crew, on supply of masks and other equipment for safety as they come in contact with scores of people during their on-duty hours, the EO said the department had discussed the issue with the medical authorities. “They don’t insist on face masks. They have advocated only social distancing and frequent hand-washing,” he said.

Leaders of the RTC Employees’ Union (EU) have urged the management to supply masks to the drivers and conductors of the buses for their safety. They also want the management to temporarily put on hold the use of breathe analysers against the workers in view of the rapid spread of the virus.

Concession withdrawn

To discourage travelling by senior citizens, said to be the most vulnerable section to spread of the virus, the corporation has withdrawn the 25% concession offered to them in RTC buses, from Friday. “This will remain in effect till further orders,” said Mr. Reddy.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apsrtc-foresees-dip-in-travel-demand/article31123112.ece

The HC issued an interim order on Friday against the shifting of the offices of Commissioner of Vigilance (CoV) and Chairman and member(s) of the Commissionerate of Inquiries (CoI) to Kurnool by suspending the operation of G.O. Ms. No 13.

A three-judge Bench headed by Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari and comprising Justices A.V. Sesha Sai and M. Satyanarayana Murthy ordered that the shifting of the above offices be stalled and accepted the contention of petitioners that the impugned G.O. was vitiated by bad faith. Advocate-General S. Sriram represented the government.

It may be recalled that the government proposed to shift the offices of CoV and chairman of CoI from the Interim Government Complex at Velagapudi in Guntur district to Kurnool, for which Chief Secretary (CS) Nilam Sawhney issued the said G.O. on January 31 citing administrative grounds.

Petitioners’ take

The Engineer-in-Chief of the Roads & Buildings Department and the Kurnool district Collector were instructed to identify suitable buildings for relocating the offices. However, separate petitions, including one by the activists of Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti, were filed in the HC challenging the GO. They argued that the government’s decision was arbitrary.

127,2020/03/21,"No objection to distribution of pattas on Ugadi, says SEC","‘Sequel to Supreme Court ruling on local body elections and model code’

The State Election Commission (SEC) has stated that it has no objection to the continuation of various activities initiated by the government under the ‘Navaratnalu - Pedalandariki Illu’, a housing programme.

In a letter to Principal Secretary (Land-1) on Friday, SEC Secretary S. Ramsunder Reddy said that in the light of the Supreme Court ruling on March 18 and the government’s request, the SEC “conveys its no objection for the same.”

The SEC had earlier restrained the government from carrying out all housing-related activities, including the scheduled distribution of house-site pattas on Ugadi, till the completion of the process of elections to the local bodies keeping the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in view.

The SEC had stated that the code came into force on March 7, and announcement of new schemes, or implementation of the existing ones, in a manner that would have a bearing on the outcome of elections amounts to violating the code.

Subsequently, the SEC’s decision was challenged in the Supreme Court, which directed the election body to lift the MCC and reimpose it four weeks prior to the date when elections would be notified.

The apex court also said that activities that were suspended on account of the MCC shall not be interrupted further until the code was reimposed.

The State government has geared itself up to distribute 26.6 lakh house-site pattas to the poor on Ugadi, the Telugu new year. The government plans to construct houses for those who already own a house site. Houses will be constructed even for those who will be given pattas under the programme.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/no-objection-to-distribution-of-pattas-on-ugadi-says-sec/article31123029.ece

129,2020/03/21,Tada Falls on Chittoor-Nellore border closed over COVID fears,"The picnic spot is a popular retreat for visitors from neighbouring Tamil Nadu

The Tada Falls on the Chittoor-Nellore border was closed on Friday evening as part of a nationwide lockdown on public places to counter the spread of the dreaded coronavirus.

Also known as Ubbalamadugu, the waterfalls is a beloved picnic spot in the region.

Nestled in hillocks between Varadaiahpalem and B.N. Kandriga mandals, the waterfalls is a popular retreat for thousands of tourists from neighbouring Tamil Nadu. By virtue of its proximity to the Chennai national highway, the Ubbalamadugu attracts picnic lovers round the year. The highlight of the waterfalls is that it has a perennial source of water in the hillocks, while the monsoon rains add a dash of glamour of the cascading waters.

Administered by the Satyavedu range of the Forest Department, this picnic spot nets a monthly revenue of about ₹6 lakh only through the toll-gate and parking fee from vehicles. The falls attracts a crowd of about 500 persons on weekdays, while the number swells to about 5,000 on weekends. Picnic lovers throng the perennial stream with their families. As the visitors are allowed to enter the stream for over a distance of a couple of kilometers, they keep coming repeatedly in a year, also lured by the cleanliness of the water.

For the last couple of years, the Ubbalamadugu falls has turned into a hot destination for tourists visiting Chittoor district, apart from devotees on pilgrimage.

Forest Range Officer (Satyavedu) J. Prasada Rao said that the waterfalls is a star attraction in the region and is well-maintained by the department, providing safety to the visitors. “After our successful efforts in containing the menace of miscreants and alcoholics in the region, we are getting visitors from all walks of life, including women and children. Over years, the department has been able to provide some of the best recreational facilities to visitors,” he said.

Health is priority

The official said that following the COVID-19 threat and considering the closure of several tourist facilities in the district and elsewhere in the State, senior forest officials of the division prepared an action for closing down the Tada Falls, giving top priority to public health and to contribute to the government’s efforts to keep the dreaded virus at bay.

Meanwhile, the forest officials also mounted surveillance on the Bhupateswara Kona and Saddikulla Madugu water bodies in Nagalapuram mandal, which attracts several visitors from Tamil Nadu and Nellore district. “Our personnel are already posted there to prevent visitors from entering the zone,” the FRO said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tada-falls-on-chittoor-nellore-border-closed-over-covid-fears/article31122991.ece
130,2020/03/21,More foreign returnees in home quarantine,"Kin of student who tested positive for COVID-19 kept under observation

Most people remained indoors in the Zilla Parishad Colony and its surroundings as advised by the health officials to prevent the spread of COVID-19 after a student, a London returnee, tested positive for the disease.

A battery of health workers completed a survey, covering over 12,000 persons in the core zone as also in the peripheral areas as per protocol, after Prakasam district reported first coronovirus case.

The student’s father, mother and sister were kept under observation, Prakasam District Medical and Health Officer K. Padmavathi said.

Woman tests negative

Meanwhile, a 47-year-woman, who returned from the U.S. and admitted to the Government General Hospital’s COVID-19 isolation ward, tested negative for the disease.

Four persons with foreign travel history were identified during the survey conducted in the ZP Colony cluster, taking the number of persons put in home quarantine to 270 in the district.

As many as 30 persons with foreign travel history completed 27 days home isolation.

Long queues

Ahead of the ‘Janata curfew’ announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, people waited in long queues before supermarkets to get their quota of essential commodities.

Entry of customers into D-Mart and other supermarkets, after subjecting them to screening with thermal scanners, was restricted to ensure social distancing by shoppers.

“We have been instructed to allow only 20 persons at a time,” said a private security guard at a supermarket where people in hundreds do shopping at any given point of time.

Temples in the city, including the famous Lawyerpet Sai Baba temple, closed down early after completion of rituals to avoid crowding. Cinema theatres remained closed as also gymnasiums and swimming pools in the city.

Health officials advised people to clean their hands with alcohol-based hand rub, or with soap and water, to kill viruses. People were also asked not to touch their eyes, nose and mouth before cleaning their hands thoroughly and frequently. It is necessary to maintain a distance of at least one metre from each other to avoid contracting the disease.

‘Situation under control’

In Nellore district, a whopping 793 persons with foreign travel history were put in home quarantine.

“The health situation is well under control. An student who returned from Italy is responding well to treatment. Four other persons who have been admitted to the COVID-19 isolation ward tested negative for the disease, and no fresh case is reported from anywhere in the district,” Joint Collector V. Vinod Kumar said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/more-foreign-returnees-in-home-quarantine/article31122987.ece
131,2020/03/21,Balaji temple closed following health advisory,"There will no disruption in the conduct of daily rituals, says TTD

The ever bustling temple of Lord Venkateswara here on Friday wore a deserted look with the TTD resolving to keep it out of bounds to the pilgrims for about one week in the aftermath of the advisories issued by the Government of India and the State government to contain the community spread of coronavirus.

After clearing all the pilgrims who reached the town the previous day, the temple was officially closed for public from afternoon.

Shutters were also pulled down on the massive Nitya Annadanam Complex and no fresh allotment of cottages or guest houses was made.

The TTD categorically said that there would be no disruption in the conduct of daily rituals inside the temple.

Repair works

At a high-level meeting, TTD Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy urged senior officials to utilise the opportunity and take up required repair / pending works, and embark on a mass cleaning programme of all the TTD establishments.

As a safety measure, the Security and Vigilance staff were instructed to thoroughly check all the staff members, including archakas and paricharakas, coming out of the temple after their duties.

TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy promised to adopt a sympathetic approach in accommodating devotees who had already booked their darshan / sevas tickets during the days of the closure.

Meanwhile, devotees were forced to spend arduous time waiting at the bus stands in their quest to motor down to Tirupati. Non-availability of taxis and cabs only added to their misery.

‘Sudden decision’ rattles a few

On the other hand, the “sudden decision” to stop darshan came as a rude shock to the devotees who had reached Tirupati on Friday morning from far away destinations.

The famous Gunadala Mary Matha Shrine has been closed up to March 31 to prevent the spread of coronavirus, said temple rector Fr. Eleti William Jayaraju. He urged devotees and the general public to participate in the ‘janata curfew’ on March 22 (Sunday).

138,2020/03/21,Abide by decisions to contain COVID-19: Minister,"MP Nalin Kumar Kateel seeks curbs on movement of public passenger vehicles

Dakshina Kannada district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojary on Saturday urged the general public to cooperate with the administration when it takes some tough decisions to combat COVID-19. So far, no positive cases have been reported from Dakshina Kannada.

Chairing a high-level meeting of legislators and senior officials from the district here, Mr. Poojary said all the 89 samples sent for test turned out to be negative. Yet, the administration would have to take tough decisions in the coming days if positive cases are reported and hence people should abide by such decisions.

The Minister also said the administration’s proposal to have a laboratory to test COVID-19 disease in Mangaluru is likely to get the government’s nod soon. The administration has already ordered postponement of all programmes, functions and gatherings in the district and said strict action would be initiated against those violating the directive.

The Minister asked the public to inform the administration if they come across movement of unknown persons or COVID-19 affected persons in the district. If air-travellers, who have been stamped on their arrival at the Mangaluru International Airport, were found to be roaming around, they would be arrested. People also may intimate the administration by calling 104 or 1077, Mr. Poojary said.

Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, asked the administration to put curbs on movement of public passenger vehicles on important routes in the district for the time-being. Despite concern about the virus, movement of people in the district has not come down, which is alarming, he said.

Former Minister and MLA U.T. Khader suggested closure of outpatient department services in all hospitals for the time-being and allowing only emergency treatments. Action should be initiated against those violating government directives, he demanded.

140,2020/03/21,Hubballi-Ankola rail line: Experts fear destruction of biodiversity hotspot,"Up to 2.2 lakh trees to be felled, claims Railways; experts say figures underestimated

The State government, which cleared the proposed Hubballi-Ankola railway line, appears to have underestimated the total number of trees that would be felled in the process while ignoring the biodiversity of the region.

Railways claims that the project involves felling of 1.78 lakh to 2.2 lakh trees. But according to a report submitted by an expert committee, these figures are a gross underestimation given the high canopy density along the track alignment extending to 168 km.

The committee comprised Rajendra Garawad, Assistant Inspector General of Forests, NTCA Bengaluru Regional Office, R. Gopinath, Joint Director (Wildlife) and from MOEFCC, and Kaushik Banerjee from the Wildlife Institute of India. The report was submitted to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in August 2018.

The committee members conducted a site inspection to study the environmental ramifications of the project, which entails diversion of 595.64 hectares of forestland in Karwar, Yellapur and Dharwad divisions. It also pointed out that the total project cost when it was first announced in 1997 was pegged at ₹483.15 crore, which was later revised to ₹1,153.08 crore and further revised to ₹2,315.384 crore and stood at ₹3,750 crore as in 2018 but could escalate manifold as the gestation period of the project spans about 8 to 10 years.

The report pointed out that the alignment of the track passes through the Western Ghats forests and the region is part of the Bedthi Conservation Reserve (at Yellapur), closer to Dandeli Hornbill Conservation Reserve and located in the buffer region of Anshi-Dandeli Tiger Reserve, which is about 6.5 km from the track alignment.

The railway line passes through different types of forests, including evergreen, semi-evergreen, moist deciduous, and dry deciduous forests with a high canopy density. The overall floristic diversity comprises 43 families, 106 genera and 134 species of trees and 58 families, 128 genera and 146 species of woody ground flora of shrubs and regenerating tree stocks. Also, the highest percentage of evergreen trees were reported from Vajralli-Birgadde villages of Yellapur taluk, as per the authors of the report. They have pointed out that the forests along the proposed project zone is rich in fauna represented by 29 species of mammals, 256 species of birds, 8 species of reptiles, and 50 species of butterflies. “Majority of mammals belong to IUCN Red List and most of them are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972,” says the report.

The species identified in the project area include tiger, leopard, sloth bear, gaur, sambar, chital, mouse deer, common giant flying squirrel, malayan giant squirrel, Indian giant squirrel, striped hyena, jackal, common wolf, Indian fox, Indian porcupine, common mongoose, small Indian mongoose, hare, common langur, and Indian pangolin, among others. The committee feared that the railway line could be a leading cause of wildlife mortality as it intersects with the elephant movement corridor. Already, Dharwad, Haliyal, and Belagavi forest divisions are regularly witnessing wildlife deaths due to train hits and a similar situation may prevail in Yellapur and Karwar divisions, say the authors.

The other reasons for rejecting the project was the presence of an ADB-funded road that was underutilised and projected decline in mining activity in the region which will render the project redundant.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/zk095/article31130733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGDANDELI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hubballi-ankola-rail-line-experts-fear-destruction-of-biodiversity-hotspot/article31130734.ece

Ms. Reddy alleged that Chief Minister B.S.

142,2020/03/21,HC orders further probe into 19-year-old boy’s murder in 2010,"DG&IGP told to take action against IO

Pointing out a series of severe lapses by the Investigation Officer (IO), the High Court of Karnataka has directed the police to conduct further investigation into a 10-year-old murder case of a 19-year-old boy, while setting aside the trial court’s verdict of acquitting the accused.

The court also directed the DG&IGP to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the then IO S.T. Siddalingappa of Doddaballapur Town police station for defective investigation and take appropriate action against him.

A Division Bench comprising Justice S.N. Satyanarayana and Justice H.P. Sandesh issued the direction while setting aside the October 26, 2013 verdict of the Doddaballapur court in acquitting four accused persons. “In effect, the entire investigation appears to be more accused friendly than in securing relevant records to bring guilty to the book,” the Bench observed, while pointing out that from the beginning, the investigation was done totally in a “listless direction” leaving several loopholes.

Mahaveer Jain was found with at least 28 stab injuries on his body and the accused had made attempts to bury the body. The offence was allegedly committed by one of his neighbours, who had studied with him for 10 years in school, along with his associates for want of money. The victim, after receiving a phone call from his neighbour, went missing on August 29, 2010 and his dead body was found the next day.

The IO had not taken any interest to identify the place where the crime occurred and had not pressed into service dog squad to identify whether any evidence could be recovered from the spot where the body was found, the Bench said.

144,2020/03/21,Revised testing strategy: Can existing labs in Karnataka handle the load?,"Patients with severe acute respiratory illness can now be tested for COVID-19; private labs are yet to be identified in State to conduct test

With the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) having revised its testing strategy by offering testing to all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illness (fever and cough and/or shortness of breath), there is going to be an influx of samples to be tested for COVID-19. A major concern, however, is the limited number of COVID-19 testing laboratories in the State.

Late on Saturday night the ICMR issued guidelines for testing in private labs. However, it is yet to identify labs in Karnataka.

With private laboratories yet to be named, the question is whether the existing facilities are equipped to handle the likely increased load.

In Bengaluru, only two labs are currently conducting the tests. Apart from these, one Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory each in Hassan, Mysuru, and Shivamogga are also involved. Each of these facilities, however, are as of now testing not more than 25 samples a day.

“With the revision in testing strategy, the number of samples are definitely going to increase. We are not sure how we will be able to meet the increased demand. We have raised this concern with the ICMR,” said sources in the VRDL lab at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute.

Ashok M., officer in charge of the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Bengaluru Field Unit, said the lab had been testing 20 to 25 samples every day since February 2. “We can load 20 samples simultaneously on the PCR machine and the results take six hours. Moreover, if the result is positive, a confirmatory test is also done. Although our kits are depleting, we can indent as and when required,” he said.

NIMHANS, which was in the forefront of testing influenza A(H1N1) during the outbreak in 2009, has expressed its willingness to test if kits are provided. Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar had also announced that NIMHANS would soon start tests. Although NIMHANS is equipped and capable to test COVID-19 samples, the ICMR is yet to grant its approval.

“We are part of the network of influenza labs that come under the National Centre for Disease Control. Although a BSL II-level lab is enough to conduct COVID-19 tests, NIMHANS has a BSL III-level lab,” said V. Ravi, senior professor and head of Neurovirology in NIMHANS.

Although the State government has been repeatedly announcing that private labs will be roped in, the ICMR is yet to approve any private facility in the State, dispite announcing guidelines.

The labs at Narayana Nethralaya — which was the first private lab approved for testing A(H1N1) samples in the State during the 2009 outbreak — and Manipal Hospitals apart from Manipal Institute of Virology are equipped to take up the tests. “We are ready, but the ICMR has to take a call on that,” said K. Bhujang Shetty, chairman of Narayana Nethralaya.

Sudarshan Ballal, chairman of Manipal Hospitals, who asserted that the revised testing guidelines would help in further containment of the infection, said, “I am sure the ICMR will soon take a call on roping in private labs.”

90 samples a day

However, Rajni Kant, director, Regional Medical Research Centre and head of Research Management, Policy, Planning and Coordination at the ICMR, told The Hindu that the existing labs were capable of handling an influx of samples following the revised testing strategy.

“Each of the testing labs are equipped to test 90 samples a day. There is no dearth of kits and reagents as they are centrally supplied by the government to all the labs,” he said. Refusing to comment on the delay in roping in private labs, Dr. Rajni Kant said the ICMR was in a dialogue with private labs in this regard.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/revised-testing-strategy-can-existing-labs-in-karnataka-handle-the-load/article31129474.ece

146,2020/03/21,NWKRTC incurs loss of over ₹7 crore,"No ‘Chigari’ buses in Hubballi-Dharwad on Sunday

With restrictions on travel by various district administrations in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC), headquartered in Hubballi, has incurred loss to the tune of over ₹7 cores in 10 days and the losses are likely to mount further as the restrictions are set to remain in force for some more time.

According to information given by Chief Traffic Manager of NWKRTC Santosh Kumar, a total of 2,723 bus schedules have been cancelled between March 11 and 19.

NWKRTC operates buses from nine divisions in six districts of Bombay-Karnataka region and on Friday it cancelled 400 schedules because of the lack of passengers.

Ever since the COVID-19 scare spread, forcing people to scuttle their travel plans and stay indoors, the transport corporation has been cancelling an average of just over 300 buses daily owing to poor patronage.

As per the directions of Managing Director of NWKRTC Rajendra Cholan, the corporation has temporarily cancelled, till further orders, all bus services on the Mumbai and Kalaburagi routes and all buses going to Maharashtra via Vijayapura in the wake of more COVID-19 infections in those regions.

This apart, NWKRTC has cut by half services to Kolhapur, Pune and Goa routes. It has also reduced by 25% the ‘Vegadoot’ services to Bengaluru and other premier segment services to Benglauru by 50 %.

The revenue loss of the corporation is likely to go up in the next week as more schedules are likely to be cancelled in the wake of further clampdown as a precautionary measure.

Meanwhile, the corporation has also taken steps to create awareness on the pandemic and is getting its buses cleaned and sanitised regularly. The bus stations are also cleaned up and sanitised apart from making announcements on the measures needed to prevent the disease.

Meanwhile, because of the ‘Janta Curfew’ call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Santosh Kumar has said that NWKRTC will operate only a few services and long-distance buses will run after 9 p.m. based on the demand by passengers.

Meanwhile, the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HD-BRTS) has decided to suspend the ‘Chigari’ buses on the HDBRTS route on Sunday.

However it will operate city transport buses on the mixed lane traffic based on the demand by passengers, a release added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fgu8xo/article31133865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nwkrtc-incurs-loss-of-over-7-crore/article31128797.ece

148,2020/03/21,"Become a ‘Corona Warrior’, help spread credible info","Move aimed at combating fake news and rumours on COVID-19, especially on social media platforms

The Karnataka government has come up with the idea of roping in ‘Corona Warriors’ or a group of volunteers in a bid to contain the spread of fake news, false propaganda and rumours about COVID-19. This is in continuation of the elaborate measures being implemented by the government to contain the spread of the virus and bring down the number of cases.

It’s a joint initiative of the Department of Information and Public Relations, the Indian Red Cross Society and the Karnataka Labour Department which have urged the interested public in Mysuru to apply.

Their task is to ensure that accurate and credible information on the disease and the situation besides the steps and decisions taken by the government as and when required were passed on to the public to prevent rumour-mongering. The step is also expected to help the administration in getting information on the ground situation through the volunteers.

The applications to serve as “Corona Warriors” are available online and the same can be filled in and submitted for processing. The registered volunteers would get training at the information offices in district headquarters, and given a security kit and an identity card, a press release said here.

Four volunteers each have to work in four shifts in each taluk and the government plans to rope in about 3,000 such volunteers. Already, 400 applications had been submitted on day one in the State.

151,2020/03/21,Janata Curfew | Minimal public transport in Karnataka on March 22,"Some residents’ welfare associations and gated communities request occupants not to get deliveries from outside

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has appealed to citizens to voluntarily participate in the ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22. For the most part, Bengalureans are ready to follow the suggestions that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made when he addressed the nation on Thursday.

Public transport services in the city are likely to get disrupted. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has taken a decision to close operations while Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will operate minimal services.

In Bengaluru, only 20% of the buses – around 1,200 – will be operational on Sunday while on Saturday, BMTC will operate only 50% of its fleet. “We are an essential service in the city and we cannot completely stop it. However, minimum bus service will be provided on Sunday. A further decision on cancellation of services will be taken depending on the patronage we receive,” said a BMTC official.

BMTC, KSRTC incur loss

In the last couple days, the corporation has drastically reduced operations due to poor ridership. On Friday, more than 1,500 buses remained off the roads. BMTC’s revenue losses touched ₹6.1 crore since March 1.

On Friday, the KSRTC cancelled 1,385 services and incurred a revenue loss of ₹10.86 crore since March 1. More than 49,000 people have cancelled bus tickets that they had booked online.

Several Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) and gated communities have decided to practice ‘Janata Curfew’. Some have issued guidelines to observe self curfew, and have requested the occupants not to get deliveries from outside, including newspapers.

They have recommended that maids and helpers be allowed to take the day off. Some have taken it a step further and plan to lock the gates from morning to evening.

Vikram Rai, general secretary of Bangalore Apartments’ Federation (BAF), said, “Though the call for such a self curfew is symbolic, it is our responsibility to reinforce the importance of social distancing at such times and self isolation, if necessary,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dw1nwd/article31125913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMAJESTIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/janata-curfew-minimal-public-transport-in-karnataka-on-march-22/article31125915.ece

Bhavani Revanna, Hassan Zilla Panchayat member and chairperson of the standing committee on health and education, conducted a meeting on Friday to review the precautionary measures taken by the district administration on COVID-19. She directed officials to open check-posts and screen passengers at the district entry posts. When an officer pointed out that around 6,000 people, native to Hassan but settled in Mumbai, would be visiting the district to celebrate Ugadi next week, she told them to set up check-posts at Hirisave and Arsikere to screen them.

She also said the State government should provide sufficient funds for programmes to spread awareness onf the infection. She said she would speak to the Ministers concerned on the issue.

Ventilators

Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences director B.C. Ravi Kumar stressed the need for more ventilators to treat patients if any more positive cases are reported in the future. “We need to be prepared with extra ventilators. The government should provide ambulances with ventilators,” he said. District Health Officer K.M. Sathish Kumar said the administration had taken all measures to treat COVID-19 cases. Entry of visitors to tourist places and resorts and homestays has been stopped.

So far, the officer said, the throat swabs of 16 people have been tested in Hassan, and all results came back negative.

153,2020/03/21,COVID-19: Efforts on to trace contacts of infected Kodagu man,"Even as the Kodagu administration is making serious efforts to trace those who travelled with and came in contact with the man from the district who tested positive for COVID-19, the health authorities have been asked to closely monitor those who returned from foreign countries and are in quarantine at their homes.

Many are under home quarantine and the movement of such persons should be watched closely as a precaution to contain the spread of the viral disease, said Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy in Madikeri on Friday, putting the onus on health workers, including ASHAs and anganwadi assistants. The Deputy Commissioner directed the tahsildars, taluk health officers and taluk panchayat executive officers to give status reports on persons in home quarantine on a daily basis.

The 500-metre area around Mottimotte has been declared as the “containment zone” as the infected man had visited this village near Kondangeri, about 10 km from Murnad. Residents of the village are barred from venturing out of their homes and contacting others. Essential supplies or them for 14 days will be made available by the food department. The village has about 75 families, with over 300 members in total.

In the buffer zone of Mottimotte, there are about 247 families consisting of 1,054 people in Kondangeri. The residents from the buffer zone should be put under constant monitoring and they should be rushed to a hospital if they show any COVID-19 symptoms, said Ms. Joy.

Contact tracing

Teams have been formed to trace those with whom the 35-year-old man who tested positive had come in contact with while travelling from Dubai to Bengaluru and from Bengaluru to Murnad via Mysuru-Madikeri, besides his family members and others he contacted upon arrival. His fellow passengers in the KSRTC Rajahamsa bus in which he travelled from Bengaluru to Murnad are also being traced.

The auto driver who had dropped the infected man at his village has been put in an isolation ward and is under observation. His throat swab samples have been sent for lab tests.

So far, 98 people the infected man had contact with have been identified and home quarantined. And with six positive cases reported from Kasaragod in Kerala, the DC has banned traffic between Kodagu and Kasaragod via Karike check-post with immediate effect.

Second advisory

The Kodagu district administration, in its second advisory, issued on Friday, said the advisory issued by it on Thursday had stated that the KSRTC Rajahamsa bus in which P-15 (the COVID-19 positive case from Kodagu) travelled from Bengaluru to Murnad via Mysuru-Madikeri was mentioned as KA19 F-3170. But as per the information given by the man, the start time of the Rajahamsa bus was 12.05 a.m. on March 16. At this time, KA-21 F-0231 was the bus in which the infected man travelled from the satellite bus stand in Bengaluru to Murnad via Mysuru-Madikeri.

P-15 boarded the BMTC Vayu Vajra bus KA-57 F-0908 from Bengaluru airport to the satellite bus stand at 5.30 p.m. on March 15 and reached the bus stand at 6.45 p.m., the advisory said. Any person who was his co-passenger in these buses should contact the health helpline (104) at the earliest and follow the instructions given by the Health Department.

No curbs on students

Deputy Commissioner of Kodagu Annies Kanmani Joy has asked officials to identify the students from the village declared as a “containment zone” and the village in the buffer zone who are to appear for the II PU and SSLC examinations and to make transportation arrangements for them to the exam centres.

As a rule, no resident from the containment zone is permitted to leave the place. However, if there are any students writing exams, they will be allowed to sit for their papers. Mottimotte has been declared a containment zone with Kodagu reporting its first COVID-19 positive case on Thursday, while Kondangeri village has been declared as the buffer zone because of its proximity to Ketumotte.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-efforts-on-to-trace-contacts-of-infected-kodagu-man/article31123170.ece
154,2020/03/21,COVID-19: SWR directs a section of employees to stay home,"The battle against COVID-19 has forced the rail authorities to take unprecedented measures of curtailing the staff on duty.

Except for the staff required for core operations such as running the trains and maintenance, it has asked employees to stay at home, as unlike in the IT sector, working from home is not an option in most cases. As a result, the divisional railway headquarters in Mysuru now wears a deserted look, with some of the offices locked.

Sources told The Hindu that even the railway workshop at Ashokapuram was functioning with skeleton staff, and most officials and staff from the commercial branch, the personnel department and other administration-related departments had been instructed to stay at home.

The order came into effect on Friday and will be valid till next Wednesday, after which the authorities will evaluate the situation and take a call on either resuming normal duty or extending the restriction.

The Principal Chief Personnel Manager of South Western Railway issued a communiqué stating that restriction of staff movement was considered essential at this point, considering the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the increase in the number of affected persons in the SWR jurisdiction.

The communiqué directed all PHODs, CHODs, DRMs, CWMS and heads of field units to instruct their staff to work from home and to ensure that all administrative offices, workshops and store depots are kept closed. However, this order does not apply to offices of staff involved in train operations and in the maintenance of fixed and moving assets.

Being on call

However, it was pointed out to the employees that this measure was primarily to confine the staff to their homes and minimise the risk of catching infections. Hence, it is imperative that they be available at home and be reachable on mobile and other electronic means of communication at all times, and be prepared to attend office in the event of any exigency.

Sources said 3,000 to 5,000 employees across Mysuru division alone may be staying at home, and this is reckoned to be unprecedented in the annals of the Railways. “Apart from the administrative section, there is the open line section which deals with the operation of trains and maintenance of rolling stock and signal and communication, and about 50% of the staff will work on rotation,” a source said.

It was pointed out that some of the staff from the open line section drawn from electrical and mechanical branches too have been asked to stay at home, and this is not expected to burden the staff on duty as a large number of trains have been cancelled owing to poor patronage.

Mysuru division cancelled about 12 trains on Friday, and the number is expected to rise as passenger movement reduces to a trickle.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ab98rk/article31123147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMYSRAILCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-swr-directs-a-section-of-employees-to-stay-home/article31123148.ece

Registered users of Trin Trin received a message about the suspension of services on Friday. “We wish to inform you that Trin Trin operations will be temporarily shut down starting from March 20 till further notice to avoid community spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sorry for the inconvenience,” said the SMS.

Asha Kerakatty of Green Wheel Ride, which operates Trin Trin, told The Hindu that for now, the suspension of services is till March 31, following an order from Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar. “We have been asked to temporarily shut down services till March 31. We will review the situation and consider offering services again from April 1 if there is an improvement [in the situation],” she said.

She said it is not considered safe when the bicycles change hands from one user to another. “It will be impossible to clean them after every use.” Also, Trin Trin will not be able to trace the history of use.

Removed

Soon after announcing the shutdown of services, the Trin Trin bicycles were removed from the docking stations across the city. “We will get them cleaned and sanitised before we bring them back to the docking stations whenever the services resume,” Ms. Kerakatty said.

A total of 450 bicycles are usually available for rent across 50 docking stations in the city. Ever since Trin Trin was introduced in Mysuru in June 2017, more than 13,500 people have registered for the service.

On an average, 1,200 to 1,500 rides are recorded every day. “Most users are students going to schools and colleges, besides office-going employees. Ever since the government declared a holiday for schools and colleges, the ridership had declined by around 40%,” she said. The ridership has been in the range of 600 to 700 in the past few days, she said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sg873q/article31123120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMYSTRINTRIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/trin-trin-suspends-services-indefinitely-in-mysuru/article31123121.ece

However, in case of transfer of crushing licence, the licensee should apply to the licensing authority for transfer of licence and pay non-refundable fee of ₹25,000 as a processing fee. It aims at providing deemed extension of existing stone crushers licence up to 20 years from the date of sanction subject to payment of annual regulation fee.

The Bill also mentions about penalties and states that whoever contravenes the provisions of the law on conviction will be punished with imprisonment for a term which may be extended to two years or with fine which may be extended up to ₹2 lakh or both.

The Bill tabled by Minister for Mines and Geology C.C. Patil said that it provides deemed extension up to 20 years for the licence holders who have made application before expiry and pending for consideration.

Further, the Bill considered it necessary to repeal 96 amendment Acts from the year 2016 to 2019 and also laws which are redundant as suggested by the government of India, in particular the Sarais Act, 1867, the Laws Local Extent Act, 1874, and Dekkhan Agriculturists Relief Act, 1879, it added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bill-tabled-to-transfer-licence-in-stone-crushing-business/article31122874.ece
157,2020/03/21,Drop in demand forces SWR to cancel over 40 trains,"Ridership has come down by over 60%

COVID-19 spread has severally impacted train services of South Western Railway (SWR), which has cancelled more than 40 services connecting major destinations owing to poor response. A majority of the services have been cancelled till March 31.

Ashok Kumar Verma, Divisional Railway Manager of Bengaluru Division, said, “After positive cases of COVID-19 emerged, the number of people travelling by trains has come down by 60%. On certain routes, there is poor patronage owing to which the Railways has taken a decision to suspend services.”

Another SWR official said, “For several train services, we received bookings of up to 4%. It is not financially viable to operate such services.”

In the city, the footfall at railway stations has come down. A few days ago, the SWR increased the price of platform tickets from ₹10 to ₹50 to decongest railway stations.

A press release from the SWR stated that the Bengaluru Division has taken various measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, including maintaining safe social distance at all computerised passenger reservation (PRS) centres.

158,2020/03/21,Kasaragod on lockdown for two weeks,"Kerala invokes Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897 to regulate public life after new cases surface in district

The State government on Saturday night invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to regulate public life in Kasaragod after 12 new cases of COVID-19 had surfaced in the district in the past 48 hours.

The district administration feared that scores more would have run the risk of exposure to infected persons.

It is scrambling to complete the list of persons who had come into contact with the infected people to identify and isolate them.

The British government had framed the law to tackle the bubonic plague that ravaged Mumbai in the late 19th century.

Imprisonment

Any violation of the Act entails a punishment of up to six months of imprisonment and a fine of not less than ₹1,000. The government has invoked its provisions to order the closure of temples, mosques, churches and other centres of worship for the next two weeks.

It has ordered clubs, cinema halls, parks and public places to shut. Government offices will remain closed for one week. However, the District Collector has placed State employees on the standby for immediate deployment. He has ordered them to stay in the district.

The government has allowed commercial establishments to open for business only between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Only establishments that provide essential services, such as medical and provision stores, could remain open during usual business hours.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kasaragod-on-lockdown-for-two-weeks/article31131833.ece
159,2020/03/21,Malayali medicos in Moldova seek help,"400 medical students stranded in the landlocked East European country

Over 400 medical students from Kerala remain stranded in the landlocked East European country of the Republic of Moldova with little chance to fly back home even as the COVID-19 scare threatens to turn intense with 66 cases reporting in just a fortnight.

The country had bus services with Italy before the border was eventually closed as the situation in Italy deteriorated. “But till then there were frequent movements between the two countries and the chances of many people getting infected remain real,” K. Najab, a third year medical student from Kozhikode, told The Hindu over phone from his hostel.

Malayalis dominate the nearly 600 Indian students of the USMF, the State University of Medicine and Pharmacy, staying in university hostels and apartments outside the campus. Though food and other provisions are still available, an imminent shortage cannot be ruled out if the situation continues.

“People are in quarantine and there are no large-scale fatalities either at this moment. But with the continuing acute shortage of protective gear such as masks and sanitisers, which ran out of stock over a week back, the potential of large-scale infections cannot be ruled out,” said Najab.

Classes were shut more than a week back and are now being held online. With the border connecting Italy sealed, students have the only option to fly out of the Moscow, Istanbul or Frankfurt airports and if those airports also are shut at any point even that limited scope for returning home will be lost.

Direct flight

“Flights from these airports operate only to Delhi or Mumbai, which means that we will have to organise for another flight to reach home. The only solution is for a direct flight to Kerala.

Students from countries such as Israel, U.K. and the U.S. have already left after those countries arranged for their transportation, leaving behind only Indian students,” said Najab.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/92h02d/article31131699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv21moldavass,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/malayali-medicos-in-moldova-seek-help/article31131692.ece
160,2020/03/21,COVID upsets academic calendar of universities,"Synchronisation of reopening of schools, colleges

Showing early signs of severely impacting the higher education sector, the COVID-19 outbreak has all but put paid to the government’s target to commence next academic year’s undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) courses on June 1 to coincide with the reopening of schools in the State.

The looming uncertainty is feared to undo the efforts being undertaken during the last two years to synchronise the academic calendar of all universities.

Unlikely

With the spurt in COVID-19 cases forcing the government to suspend all examinations temporarily, it appears highly unlikely that most universities will be able to publish the results of UG examinations within the deadline of April 30.

While Kannur and Calicut Universities have already completed the conduct of the final-year degree examinations and commenced the valuation of the answer sheets, Mahatma Gandhi University launched the examinations only on March 16. The final-year examinations in colleges affiliated to the University of Kerala were set to get under way on March 23. Besides, the Higher Education Department has fixed a deadline of May 31 for publishing the results of the PG courses.

The completion of the process by April 30 would have provided ample time to commence the PG courses on June 1 after completing at least two rounds of allotment. Similarly, the expected delay in completing the Class XII CBSE, ISC and State board examinations will adversely impact the admission process for undergraduate courses.

The efforts to streamline the academic calender have largely remained on track owing to a rigid stance adopted by the government and universities to refrain from heeding to requests to defer examinations.

The steps that were being taken to strictly adhere to the schedule have also enabled universities to clear examination backlogs to a large extent. The measures had enabled the commencement of PG courses on June 17, a improvement considering that Kerala varsity could launch their classes only on November 24 in 2018.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-upsets-academic-calendar-of-universities/article31131661.ece
161,2020/03/21,Virus behaviour in Kerala and West needs deeper study,"While SARS-CoV-2 has ravaged communities in the West, its transmissibility has been milder than expected in Kerala so far, say health experts

As Kerala battles COVID-19, focussing on intensive surveillance and containment measures, it is investment in real science and evidence-based medicine which will have an impact on the course of the epidemic in the coming days.

SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, which is evolving and about which newer bits of information are emerging.

It is high time the State took a second look at the virus’s behaviour in Kerala against the backdrop of new scientific information and assimilated it into all control and containment strategies, public health experts say.

“When we compare what has been happening in the Western world, where the virus has ravaged communities, its behaviour has not been along the expected lines in Kerala so far. It is just a curious observation but the transmissibility of the virus and its infectiousness in our community has been much milder than we expected,” points out a public health scientist.

Cases so far

In the second wave of COVID-19, when the first positive cases of a family of three from Italy were announced in Pathanamthitta, the State was bracing for a public health crisis of explosive proportions.

However, only six immediate family members tested positive.

Though scores were quarantined, even those in the primary contact list did not contract COVID-19. In the case of the Wuhan-returned medical students too, even the parents of the students did not contract the infection.

Take the rest of the cases reported in Kerala – even where massive clustering was expected, as in the case of the group of foreign tourists camping at Munnar, only a few of the group contracted COVID-19 from the primary case. Is it the warm weather and tropical climate? Is there something inherent in the immune systems of the population here that helped resist the infection? Could it be that there are innumerable cases of mild, subclinical infection of COVID-19, but we are just picking up the ones that are coming to the surface?

Another possibility is that the virus has not yet begun to circulate amongst people who could potentially develop serious diseases, like those with hypertension, diabetes, or lung disease in whom it might exhibit more virulence. “It is way too early to float any theory and it could be a combination of factors. It is possible that we are missing widespread silent community transmission of COVID-19. Epidemiological studies which involve serological investigations (blood sample studies) to detect IgG or antibodies of the virus alone can tell us if the community has already been exposed to the virus,” a senior scientist at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) says. (The presence of IgG indicates an earlier infection by the particular pathogen and determines community prevalence.)

The RGCB is launching serological studies to detect IgG levels to coronavirus amongst health-care personnel in the State hospitals.

“In Kerala, very little information on patient profile, clinical course or patient recovery is in the public domain. This epidemic is a huge learning experience which should be exploited thoroughly,” he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fi7any/article31131631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tv-covidcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/virus-behaviour-in-state-and-west-needs-deeper-study/article31131612.ece

163,2020/03/21,Digital seismographs to be set up in Idukki,"District in Zone 3 of quake susceptibility

Scientists from the National Seismology Centre (NSC), who are in the district to study the recurring tremors, will install three digital seismographs in the district.

In the first phase, the team will study the cause of the recurring tremors and whether they posed any threat to the people and infrastructure. The team is of the primary opinion that though the district is on the seismographic map, the tremors of low intensity do not cause concern. The district comes in Zone 3 of earthquake susceptibility.

The seismographs will be set up at the Idukki dam, Alady, and Chottupara and it will be monitored from New Delhi for three months.

The team comprised Kulvir Singh and M.L.George from the NCS and State Disaster Management Authority hazard and risk analyst G.S.Pradeep.

As per the district disaster management plan prepared in 2015, Muttom, Alakkode, Kottakambur, Vattavada, Bisonvalley, Chinnakanal, Upputhodu, Thankamani, Vathikudy, Elappara, and Mlappara were identified as earthquake vulnerable.

3 major quakes

The three major earthquakes reported in the district since 1900 were on June 7, 1988 - magnitude of 4.5 on the Richter scale with the location at Kallar; December 12, 2000 - magnitude of 5 with the location in the Idukki-Kottayam area (also felt strongly in Alappuzha and Ernakulam); and January 7, 2001- magnitude of 4.8 with the location of Idukki-Kottayam (also felt in south Kerala and parts of Tamil Nadu).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qebg45/article31131576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvidukki,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/digital-seismographs-to-be-set-up-in-idukki/article31131578.ece
164,2020/03/21,Hotels heading for close-down,"Lack of occupancy drives owners to take drastic steps, including lay-offs

Hotels and restaurants across the State have started closing down their properties following a drop in occupancy and revenue following travel and visa restrictions owing to the COVID-19 scare.

Closure of the hotels and restaurants en masse owing to lack of poor occupancy and sales is unprecedented. Many hotel managements, including the classified ones, have started lay-offs as uncertainty prevails over reopening.

Some have given the choice of leave without salary to the hotel staff.

Migrant workers

Migrant workers, who constitute 15% to 20% of the workforce in the two lakh-odd hotels and restaurants in the State including the 497 classified hotels that have 13,906 rooms, have started returning to their native places.

“In 25 years, I did not have to close down the property even during off-seasons. We have to face the grim reality. I have closed down the 21 rooms and kept the bar open that has only 30% sales,” says G. Sudhiesh Kumar, who runs Hotel Seaface at Kovalam. In the five-star deluxe Raviz Kovalam, only 15 of the 184 keys were occupied on Friday.

“There are no tourists and all the occupants are the crew of Air India. We are not encouraging tourists,” sources said. The backwater resort Raviz Ashtamudi is to be closed down.

“The situation is the same across the State. Lay-offs have begun in properties with 20 rooms and above. Keeping them open is a liability,” adds Mr. Kumar, who is also patron, Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association.

All units closed today

The association has decided to keep all units closed on Sunday. “We will look into the possibility of keeping at least one hotel open in a locality,” he added.

In the government-owned Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) properties, the five-star Tea County at Munnar; Aranya Nivas, Periyar House, and Lake Palace, all in Thekkady; the Golden Peak resort at Ponmudi; Flotilla in Veli tourist village; and the Cafteria in Museum have been closed down.

Boating activities at Thekkady and Malampuzha have come to a halt. “No daily-wage and contract staff members in the KTDC have been laid off,” sources said.

Certificate must

Chaithram at Thampanoor, Samudra in Kovalam, and the flagship property Hotel Mascot in the capital city are open.

“But, reservations are not being encouraged. Foreigners are being accommodated in properties on the request of tourism help desks on the condition of isolation. They are allowed to leave only upon securing negative COVID-19 medical certificate from the health authorities,” sources in the KTDC added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xvgmhn/article31131532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVTVCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hotels-heading-for-close-down/article31131533.ece
165,2020/03/21,Fisheries sector struggles to stay afloat amid virus scare,"Mass cancellation of orders from markets and ban on shipments leave the sector in the doldrums

The State’s fisheries sector in likely to incur huge losses in the beginning of the new financial year with top export destinations closing their doors and nearly zero demand from high-end hotel chains and resorts.

Those working in the seafood industry say a number of factors, including the ban on shipments, newly imposed restrictions at fish landing centres, and logistical glitches have left the sector in total chaos.

Major markets

“China and Europe are our major markets and since both are in the grip of COVID-19, there has been a mass cancellation of orders. While the shipments to China stopped immediately after the Chinese New Year, Europe buyers started citing logistical issues at import hubs from March. Our plant, which can handle daily shipments, could only manage three shipments in the last 90 days. We are facing such a crisis for the first time. It will take two or three months for the sector to stabilise,” says Shajahan K.S., a Kochi-based exporter.

While some exporters are still stocking varieties such as vannamei shrimp, demand for the most-sought-after items such as squid, cuttle fish, octopus and ribbon fish has come down considerably.

Though there are still takers for tuna, its market is not very large and is mostly limited to Asian countries such as Thailand.

Though some exporters got enquiries from China this week, the prices quoted were very low, hinting that business will not be back to normal soon.

Dip in catch

“The sector was already struggling with a dip in catch and now with marine cargo movements coming to a standstill, we are finding it difficult to survive. Export companies are offering minimal prices due to the market fluctuations,” says Peter Mathias, president, All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association.

Another blow came when star hotels and resorts stopped their purchases, opting to keep a bare minimum inventory.

“They used to offer better prices for shrimp, crab and some other varieties. But with nearly nil tourist inflow, that door was also closed,” says Francis, fisher.

Guest labourers returning to their States due to COVID-19 scare is another crucial factor.

For the last few days trawlers are finding it difficult to ensure enough hands on board. The recent restrictions in conducting auctions at harbours and fish landing centres have added to the sector’s difficulties.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/eqmi05/article31131474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv22kolvads,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fisheries-sector-struggles-to-stay-afloat-amid-virus-scare/article31131475.ece

167,2020/03/21,Prohibitory orders at Kodungalloor,"2 held for rooster sacrifice at temple

With the Bharani festival at the Kodungalloor Sreekurumba Bhagavathy temple round the corner, the Thrissur District Collector has declared Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibits assembly of five or more people, at Kodungalloor taluk to avoid crowding.

The restriction is part of the preventive measures taken against the spread of COVID-19. It will come into effect on Sunday and continue till March 29. The Kodungalloor Bharani is on March 27. The Collector declared the prohibitory orders following a meeting convened by Minister for Local Self-Governments A.C. Moideen at Kodungalloor.

Just rituals

The Bharani celebrations of the temple will be restricted to rituals. The restrictions have been imposed with the consent of the Devaswom Board and Kodungalloor Kovilakam, he said.

The administration intensified the restrictions as people from various districts assembled at the temple as part of the ‘kozhikkallu moodal’ ritual on Friday, ignoring directives.

Three deputy collectors were given powers of executive magistrates to take necessary steps at Kodungalloor.

Complaint lodged

Meanwhile, the Kodungalloor police arrested two persons on charge of sacrificing two roosters, violating the Act that bans animal/bird sacrifice. The arrested were Adityan, 22, of Sreenarayanapuram and Sarath, 26, of Methala.

They conducted rooster sacrifice at the north gate of the temple and managed to escape in a car when security persons noticed the act. Later, both were arrested on a complaint lodged by temple manager.

Symbollic offering

The animal sacrifice during the Bharani festival at the temple was banned half a century ago. After the ban, the ritual ‘kozhikkallu moodal’ used to be held symbolically, by covering the ‘balikallu’ with a red cloth and offering roosters.

An organisation had recently called for restarting the ritual of rooster sacrifice during the Bharani festival on March 27.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prohibitory-orders-at-kodungalloor/article31131407.ece

The three major modes of transport in the State will come to a near-standstill on Sunday during the ‘janata curfew’ from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m..

The week-long ban on the entry of commercial international airlines into the country will come into effect at 5.30 a.m.

The Civil Aviation Ministry has given a 24-hour buffer time for foreign carriers to operate even after the ban comes into effect, considering issues pertaining to connecting flights.

Domestic flight operations to the four international airports, except Cochin where the runway will remain closed till 6 p.m. for recarpeting, will continue during the curfew, airport sources said.

Train service will be suspended with Railways cancelling 66 mail, express, passenger and MEMU trains for Sunday citing poor patronage, apart from precaution. The cancelled trains include those originating and departing from Kanyakumari, Nagercoil, Thiruvananthapuram Central, Kochuveli, Kollam, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kozhikode, Kannur, Nilambur Road, and Mangaluru.

Kochi Metro Rail Ltd. (KMRL) has scaled down operations by reducing the frequency of services from one train every six minutes to one every seven minutes during peak hours and every 10 minutes during off-peak hours.

Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses will be pulled off the road during the curfew period. Buses operating early in the morning will reach depots before 7 a.m. Instructions have been given to all unit officers in this regard, KSRTC sources said.

Inter-State services have already been hit following the restrictions imposed by Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. The KSRTC operated services from the State capital to Nagercoil and Kanyakumari till 2 p.m. The TNSRTC also withdrew services to Thiruvananthapuram from 2 p.m. The services of KSRTC and TNSRTC are confined to the border at Kalliyikkavila.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/for-a-day-transport-to-be-at-a-standstill/article31131396.ece

171,2020/03/21,Handling used masks and gloves,"Thiruvananthapuram Corporation puts up collection boxes

Post the COVID-19 outbreak, civic bodies world across have been saddled with one more kind of waste, especially in large quantities – single-use face masks and gloves, which are often found dumped in public places.

Anticipating the enormity of the problem, Thiruvananthapuram city Corporation has begun the necessary action early, by putting up collection boxes for used masks and gloves.

Tie-up

The civic body also held talks with the Indian Medical Association (IMA), following which the have decided to tie up for this purpose.

IMA will make available colour-coded bags, which will be placed near the 10 hand-washing counters set up by the Corporation across the city. Public can drop their used masks and gloves at these points, from where the IMA will collect it and carry it to the biomedical waste treatment plant.

‘Not aware’

“We have realised that used masks and gloves can be a huge threat, as improper disposal can lead to the further spread of viruses. A majority of the public have still not been made aware of how to dispose these. So, we held a discussion with IMA to address this issue, following which a decision was taken to put up colour-coded collection bags,” says a health wing official of the Corporation.

One-time use

Many are still not aware that the masks are for one-time use only, for a maximum of six hours. Masks which become wet or are stained before that time period should be disposed of earlier.

The shortage of masks are also making people reuse them. As per World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines, the front part of the masks should not be touched, while removing.

Countries which had experienced COVID-19 outbreaks before the rest of the world have already begun witnessing a huge pile up of used masks, made of materials including polypropylene, in public spaces.

Cities like Chengdu in China have put in place strict systems for disposal of masks, by cutting them into pieces to prevent reuse and disinfection at every step of the collection and disposal process.

The Vietnam government has announced a fine for disposal of medical masks in public places.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/handling-used-masks-and-gloves/article31131338.ece
172,2020/03/21,‘Zoo has to be ready for worse situation’,"Stringent disinfection protocols will have to be observed

The curb on visitors to the city zoo till March 31 as part of steps put in place to contain the COVID-19 pandemic has been welcomed by the zoo authorities, but apprehensions remain about the way forward if and when community spread happens.

Zoo officials say that visitors or no visitors, employees responsible for the food, care, and treatment of animals had to report for work. Zoo office and technical staff could stay away for a few days if the situation took a turn for the worse, but not animal keepers and some other employees.

Officials said food for the animals came from outside in vehicles and so did the keepers who fed the animals, took care of them, and kept an eye on their health. But for the zoo director and superintendent, none of the employees lived on the premises.

For many posts, including that of the zoo doctor, there was only one appointee.

All these led to an apprehension about what would happen in a case of a complete lockdown.

Bar on visitors helps

The bar on visitors had helped in this stage. Moreover, the staff had been provided with soaps, sanitisers, and masks and told to take every precaution against the disease.

Those coming into contact with animals had been supplied with handwash and gloves.

While there was nothing to do but continue their work at this stage, there was need to plan ahead in the event of a community spread of the disease.

The zoo will have to think about stricter measures then, officials say, adding that stringent disinfection protocols would need to be observed, and decisions such as discontinuing the ongoing constructions and keeping a register of those entering the zoo premises would have to be taken.

There is need to prepare for the worst, the authorities say.

As the virus is new, little is known about it, they say. There have been reports of human to animal transmission. Zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander says pandemics have been reported in animals, but once they acquire herd immunity, the virus dies.

For the moment, disinfectants are being applied in animal enclosures as a precaution. The animals are already being given supplements, he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zoo-has-to-be-ready-for-worse-situation/article31131247.ece
173,2020/03/21,Pesticide residue in fruits and veggies coming down,"KAU study finds residue in 15.67% samples collected from market

Though there is a decline in pesticide residue in vegetables and fruits available in the market, the State still has to work hard to make them free of harmful chemicals.

According to a report published by the Kerala Agriculture University (KAU) for the period between July 2019 and September 2019, pesticide residue was found in 15.67% samples collected from the market. In all, 531 random samples were collected from the market in the State and 83 samples contained pesticides. Pesticide residues were found in 14.99% vegetables and 29.16% fruits.

The report is based on a pesticide residue analysis conducted at the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)-accredited laboratory at College of Agriculture, Vellayani.

Four categories

Samples were collected from four categories of shops. Public Markets, farms, organic shops, and eco-shops by the Agriculture Department.

Of the 68 samples of 29 varieties of vegetables collected from public markets, pesticide residue was found in eight samples (11.76%). Most of the pesticides are yellow and blue labelled.

Of the 20 samples of 11 varieties of fruits collected from markets, pesticide residue was found in seven samples (35%). When there were pesticide residue in grapes, other fruits including pineapple, green apple , plantain, and pomegranate were safe.

From the samples collected from farms, pesticide residue was found in 20.37% of the vegetables. In all, 54 samples of 21 varieties of vegetables were taken for testing. Fruits such as pineapple and passion fruit produced in the State were free of pesticides.

175,2020/03/21,NSS reiterates call to shun wedding luxury,"Community members told not to splurge on festivals, fireworks, elephant craze, rituals

As the COVID-19 scare is leading the State into an unprecedented financial crisis, the Nair Service Society (NSS) has reiterated its call to shun all forms of extravagant spending in the name of weddings, funerals, and festivals.

In the latest editorial published in its mouthpiece Service, the NSS has termed wedding extravaganza as one of the major challenges being faced by each family in the Nair community. Reckless spending for weddings has put many families in financial crisis and debt trap. Parents should be careful spending money according to their capacity.

It further called up on the community members to overcome the tendency to splurge money in the name of festivals, competitive fireworks, elephant craze, and an increasing number of programmes such as Sapthaham-Sathram.

Loans

“We can see several examples of those who draw loans and mortgage their property to keep their status intact in this competition and eventually losing everything, including their houses, even being forced to end their life. Interestingly, this extravaganza begins right from the wedding invitations while the betrothals are as pompous as the weddings,” it noted.

Simple betrothals

It advised the community members to conduct betrothals as a simple function in the presence of closest relatives.

The number of invitees to weddings too should be limited, just as on jewellery, attire, and feasts.

The article also called upon the rich to take lead in reducing wedding extravaganza and set a model for the rest.

Need for change

“Some recent experience proved that the community has already changed a lot in this matter. However, more care should be given to end such tendency in toto, which is essential to ensure the financial stability of the community members. Its implementation is essential not only for the community but also for society at large,” the article stated.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nss-reiterates-call-to-shun-wedding-luxury/article31131216.ece

178,2020/03/21,Govt. will ensure free movement of goods across border: CM,"He flags issue of detention of trucks with Tamil Nadu government

The State government on Saturday initiated steps to ensure that inter-State border checks and restrictions on movement of vehicles brought about by the COVID-19 threat did not disrupt the supply of essential goods freighted to Kerala from other regions.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told journalists that the State was well supplied for now. There was no cause for panic buying. However, he said he was concerned that authorities of neighbouring State had stopped cargo lorr- ies bound for Kerala at some border locations. Such steps could precipitate a crisis.

T.N.’s promise

The Tamil Nadu government had assured Kerala that it would facilitate freight movement. Mr. Vijayan called a meeting of traders on Monday to ensure that the pandemic did not upend food and fuel supply chains.

Chief Secretary Tom Jose told The Hindu that his counterpart in Tamil Nadu had assured him that there would be no restriction on the movement of supplies, including perishable goods, to Kerala. He said some elements might try to create an artificial shortage to squeeze profits. The State would act forcefully against such entities, he said.

District Collector, Coimbatore, K. Rajamani said there was no restriction on the movement of freight to Kerala.

He had placed some reasonable limits on the inter-State movement of people and passenger vehicles.

District Collector, Kanyakumari, Prakash M. Wadanare said free movement of essential commodities to Kerala was a priority for his administration. The border checks were limited to citizens and passenger vehicles.

Pottivelu Subramaniam, the owner of one of the oldest trading houses in Kerala, said there could be a shortage of rice, wheat, edible oil, sugar, egg, poultry, pulses and vegetables if inter-State truckers feared to ferry goods to Kerala. The COVID-19-related border checks had detained trucks at inter-State borders for days. Ideally, the government should ensure a “green channel” for goods movement.

A. Paulraj, president of the Grain Merchants Association, said in a petition to Mr. Jose that the Tamil Nadu authorities were detaining lorries returning from Kerala in border localities.

The trucks were returning after unloading grains from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Telangana in Kerala.

Transporters across the country have suspended freight movement to Kerala. The government should resolve the issue at the earliest.

Chamber of Commerce and Industries president S.N. Reguchandran Nair said the business community foresaw a steep rise in commodity prices if the State did not restore truck traffic to pre-epidemic levels.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/38koak/article31131691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TVWALAYARCHECKPOINT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-steps-in-to-ensure-free-movement-of-goods/article31130217.ece
179,2020/03/21,12 more positive cases reported in State,"6 confirmed cases from Kasaragod, three each from Ernakulam and Kannur districts

Yet another dozen cases of COVID 19 surfaced in the State on Saturday, all of which could be traced to Gulf nations, taking the total number of positive cases reported in Kerala in the second wave to 49. This is the second consecutive day when cases in double digits were being reported in the State.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, briefing media on Saturday, said three patients were natives of Ernakulam, six from Kasaragod and three from Kannur. They have been isolated in Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam; General Hospital, Kasaragod; and General Hospital, Thalassery, and General Hospital, Kannur; respectively. The number of persons under surveillance in the Sate has swelled to 53,013, with 8,623 persons additionally being put in the surveillance network on Saturday. The number of persons in isolation wards in hospitals is 228.

Surveillance cases up

The number of persons being put on surveillance has seen a tremendous jump ever since universal screening was introduced in airports and anyone coming from abroad had to mandatorily undergo 14-day self-quarantine. Mr. Vijayan expressed his happiness and relief that the State government’s directives to religious denominations to avoid mass gatherings for prayers, festivals and rituals were being observed in letter and spirit. He said almost all Muslim and Christian religious leaders and the Travancore Devaswom Board had agreed to adopt crowd control measures in their institutions of worship and put on hold mass pilgrimages and festivals till March 31.

Restraints are also being introduced at Guruvayur Sreekrishna Temple, Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple. The Sabarimala temple would open on March 28, but pilgrims will not be allowed entry.

The Chief Minister said that at a time when the Sate was trying to tide over a health emergency, it was unfortunate that some persons were not taking the government directives seriously. They would have to face stringent legal action, he said.

He said the government was forced to adopt unprecedented measures in the interest of the State and society because even developed nations such as Italy had been ravaged by the virus. It was essential that people maintain social distancing to prevent transmission of COVID-19. He said the government would give more attention to surveillance and quarantine. Those persons whose domestic situation might not facilitate strict home isolation could opt to stay in a government facility till he/she completed the quarantine period.

Private labs

Mr. Vijayan said private laboratories in the State which had the facility to run RT-PCR tests would be included as testing centres.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lb57e3/article31131939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TVTV-SECRERARIAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/more-positive-cases-reported-in-state/article31130190.ece

191,2020/03/21,Plea for online liquor lands man in the soup,"HC slaps ₹50,000 for frivolous plea

A tippler who sought a directive to the Kerala State Beverages Corporation(Bevco) to sell liquor through its online portal in view of the COVID-19 outbreak has been slapped with costs of ₹50,000 by the Kerala High Court for his “reckless, insensitive, and insolent action” of filing a frivolous petition during the present trying times.

In his writ petition, Jyothish G. of Aluva said that the outbreak of COVID-19 had made it unsafe for him to visit a liquor outlet, which is often crowded, and buy liquor for his consumption. He, therefore, wrote to Bevco with a plea for selling liquor online.

Irked by the filing of the petition in the present atmosphere, Justice A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar observed that the pressing concern of the government was to prevent transmission of COVID-19 from person to person.

The High Court too had placed restrictions on the number of cases to be filed to the bare minimum to avoid crowded conditions.

Observing that the petitioner could not be let away lightly for his reckless and insolent action, the court directed him to pay the cost to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund in two weeks.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/plea-for-online-liquor-lands-man-in-the-soup/article31123149.ece
192,2020/03/21,Action plan to execute stimulus package,"State govt. to avail itself of at least 50% of the annual borrowing limits set for next fiscal by April itself

The State government seems to have charted out a course of action for executing without any hitches the ₹20,000-crore stimulus package drawn up for cushioning the impact of COVID-19 outbreak.

Since the government is battling a grave resource crunch, doubts have been raised about the options before the Finance Department to mobilise resources for the package. It is understood that the government would avail itself of at least 50% of the annual borrowing limits set for next financial year by April itself to source funds for the package. In a tweet on Friday, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac said, “We are front-loading borrowing and spending to the beginning of the new fiscal and redesigning some of the schemes. With a track record of 99% repayment, it should not be difficult to widen the credit window to Kudumbashree.” Earlier, he had urged Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman to give the go ahead for front-loading market borrowing for 2020-21 for wiping out the arrears and disbursing pensions to 55 lakh elderly beneficiaries. But the Centre has not heeded the request, sources said.

The accent of the plan is on providing basic amenities to the legions who are facing the threat of being expropriated of their spending capacity on becoming unemployed. The target group is mainly daily-wage earners and those who eke out a living doing odd jobs.

The first step would be advancing the Budget proposal to open food courts for distributing meals at ₹25 to April from September so that it would be a great relief to the unemployed and marginalised sections. It has been proposed to give free rations to the indigent and affected families.

Welfare pensions

Welfare pensions would either be given in full or at least a tranche would be disbursed in advance. A sum of ₹1,000 each would be given to those who are not drawing any pension or other benefits from the government.

The maximum number of mandays under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, charted for the entire year, would be created in April and May. Such proposals are expected to enhance people’s spending capacity and churn the economy that remains stagnant, the sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lm7mcb/article31123135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv21houseboatss-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/action-plan-to-execute-stimulus-package/article31123136.ece
193,2020/03/21,Sunnis attend Juma when Salafis stay away,"Salafi mosques under Wisdom Islamic Organisation to remain shut till March 31

Juma congregations took place at several mosques across Malappuram and Palakkad on Friday in spite of repeated warnings from the health authorities against assembling of people in view of COVID-19 scare.

When traditional Sunni mosques conducted Juma prayers, although in a curtailed fashion, several Mujahid mosques abandoned the congregation. A few Sunni mosques in Palakkad cancelled their congregation as there were confusions among people.

Some mosques, like the one on Arikkara Street in Palakkad town, held Juma in a nominal fashion soon after the Adan (prayer call) without waiting for people to turn up. Shutters of mosque halls were pulled down as part of imposing restrictions on people. When Juma at Meparamba, Mettupalayam Street, and the Civil Station mosques in Palakkad was cancelled, mosques at Narukutty and Kalmandapam witnessed a large gathering of people for prayers.

Most Sunni mosques in Malappuram witnessed normal gatherings for Juma prayers. Children and elderly people were dissuaded from attending the prayers. Mosques had kept soaps and sanitisers for the public. People reached for prayers after having had the mandatory wudu (ablutions) from home.

Mujahid mosques shut

But Mujahid mosques in Malappuram district, including the Salafi Masjid at Perinthalmanna where more than 2,000 people gather every Friday, were shut for Juma. All Salafi mosques under the Wisdom Islamic Organisation will remain closed for the public until March 31. Although prayer calls will be made from the mosques, no group prayers will be allowed inside, said Wisdom leadership in a circular in Malappuram on Friday.

The Kerala government has postponed all school, higher secondary education (HSE), and university examinations, given the COVID-19 threat, until further notice.

A high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan took the decision here on Friday morning.

An estimated 4.2 lakh students are in the middle of their preparations for the final phase of the Class X examination that commenced on March 10.

The tests were scheduled to conclude on March 26 if they had gone as per the timetable.

The government also cancelled the Plus One and Plus Two examinations, which had commenced alongside the SSLC examination and roughly followed the same calendar. As many as 8,91,577 students are appearing for the higher secondary examinations in Kerala with the maximum number of candidates 80,051 from Malappuram district.

197,2020/03/21,Govt grapples COVID-19 on dual fronts,"Seeks ₹2,000 cr. revival package from NABARD even as surveillance is scaled up

The State government on Friday sought a ₹2,000-crore special revival package from NABARD to alleviate the growing economic distress caused by the COVID-19 outbreak even as it tightened surveillance and scaled up enforcement of social distancing norms to retard the pace of the contagion.

In a letter, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan asked NABARD Chairman Harsh Kumar Bhanwala to release the special assistance as a low-interest loan from the bank’s Rural Infrastructure Development Fund. He asked for a 2% rate of interest instead of the customary 3.9% for such grants.

The partial lockdown imposed by the government had adversely impacted trade and commerce. Agriculture, tourism, IT, and entertainment sectors seemed to be hit the hardest, raising the spectre of layoffs, wage cuts, diminished public consumption, and economic recession.

The government was fighting on two fronts. It has outlawed crowds and gatherings that accelerate the people-to-people spread of the contagion.

On Friday, the police issued notices to three places of worship in northern Kerala for allowing large gatherings. Law enforcers also tracked down at least three persons who jumped quarantine and booked them on the charge of endangering public safety.

They also arrested a person for triggering panic buying of fuel and provisions by posting misleading information on social media. The State also moved to facilitate the rapid movement of freight, including perishables from neighbouring States, without loosening internal border disease surveillance.

On the economic front, the government was scrambling to raise resources to stabilise the State’s tottering economy.

Mr. Vijayan told NABARD that the government intended the banks to reduce the interest burden to give a leg up to the economy.

On March 17, Mr. Vijayan had told the State Level Banking Committee that he wanted banks to slash interest rates to rejuvenate the economy at the grassroots level.

Mr Vijayan said in his letter that NABARD could help the banks in Kerala reduce the cost of lending by “providing enhanced refinance at this time of need”.

He said NABARD needed to ease liquidity, and provide room for an additional cost adjustment to extend concessional loans to borrowers.

It should reduce the interest rate for refinancing loans that cover crop credit from 4.5% to 2%. The interest rate for refinanced loans to small enterprises, handlooms and artisans should be cut from 8.4% to 5%.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-grapples-covid-19-on-dual-fronts/article31122623.ece
198,2020/03/21,Two MLAs go on home quarantine in Kasaragod,"They came into contact with a person who tested positive for COVID-19

Two Indian Union Muslim League MLAs on Friday quarantined themselves at home on learning that a person who they came into contact with at a marriage function tested positive for COVID-19.

Kasaragod MLA N.A. Nellikunnu and Manjeswaram MLA M.C. Kamaruddin went into self-quarantine in the wake of stringent steps taken by the district administration to prevent the spread of the virus.

The samples of the 47-year-old Non-Resident Indian tested positive for the viral infection on Thursday. The patient had attended a marriage function and a football match. The MLAs are suspected to have come into contact with him during the marriage on March 15. “I attended a wedding function on March 15. As the result came out on Thursday, it was known he (the infected person) was also present at the wedding,” Mr. Nellikkunnu said. The MLA said he took the decision to keep himself confined to home to send out a message to the public about the importance of self-quarantine.

‘Not vacation’

“Some people who arrive from abroad consider it as a vacation but they need to understand that they are posing a threat of spreading the infection to the public. This self-quarantine is a message to the people to understand the gravity of the situation,” Mr. Nellikunnu said.

I am pursuing my M.Tech in mechanical engineering. I am not able to decide on what to do next. Moreover, I am not too interested in the field. Please guide me. — Saurav Sharma

Dear Saurav,

Broadly put, there are four categories that you can choose from, post your M.Tech:

1. Doing research (PhD)

2. Working across a public or a private sector across any of the following industries: automobiles, oil exploration and refineries, machine tools, mining, heavy machineries, space exploration, electronics firms, and so on.

3. Teach at an engineering college

4. Start your own organisation

If none of these excite you, you should meet a professional career counsellor who can help you with your personality and aptitude profiling.

I am a serving officer in the Indian Navy based at Visakhapatnam. I am a Short Service Commissioned Executive officer who is about to complete my mandatory 10 years of service in the Indian Navy by next June. I am 31 years old and for the past six years, I have been serving onboard the Indian Navy warships as NBCD specialist, which basically deals with fire fighting, damage control and nuclear radiation safety onboard ships. It would be of great help if you could suggest future prospects for me, apart from the option of joining the Merchant Navy. Also, please suggest a competent career counsellor who can guide me. — Lt. Cdr Arjun Sreekumar

Dear Lt Cdr Arjun,

Being from the executive branch, you might be better off obtaining some management qualification and focus on Training and Development (T&D), Human Resources (HR) or Business Development.

Naval NBCD experience, though brilliant, unfortunately, has limited professional application in the civilian world. There are a number of ex-naval officers groups/ forums on LinkedIn. Get actively involved with that, as it will give you a fair idea about the career choices other executive branch officers have chosen and the discussions will be insightful.

With respect to a competent career counsellor, you will need to find one in your own city who you can consult face-to-face.

“He decided not to come because of the coronavirus scare.”

“That’s so sad. You were really looking forward to his visit. That explains the long face, I guess.”

“Long face? Are you telling me that my face is long?”

“The expression ‘long face’ is frequently used in informal contexts to suggest that a person is looking rather sad — there’s a look of disappointment. For example, Jai has been walking around with a long face ever since he was dropped from the team.”

“By the end of the tenth over, there were some long faces in the room. We knew that our girls weren’t going to win the World Cup.”

“Good example. With the final exams around the corner, many students are walking around with a long face.”

“That’s not the case in Bengaluru. The virus has forced many schools to cancel the final exams. The children’s summer break has already begun.”

Happiness personified

“I heard about that. I am sure the students are like a dog with two tails.”

“Two tails? A dog usually wags its tail when it’s happy. So, when you say that someone is like a dog with two tails, are you suggesting he’s extremely happy?”

“That’s exactly what it means. The person is excited because something good has happened. Ever since Sunitha got engaged, she’s been like a dog with two tails.”

“How about this example? Ganesh has every reason to be like a dog with two tails. He won the lottery last week.”

“Sounds good. After her promotion, Vineeta was walking around like a dog with two tails.”

“Talking about promotion. Weren’t you planning to ask your boss for one?”

Too much tgo bite

“I’m scared that if I ask for a raise or a promotion now, he will bite my head off.”

“Bite your head off? Are you scared that he will say no to your request?”

“When someone bites your head off, what the person is doing is shouting angrily at you. He reacts rudely to something you have said.”

“And you feel that there was no reason for the person to react that way.”

“Exactly! I made some innocent comment about her favourite teacher, and Sunny bit my head off.”

“You need to be careful with her. She has a temper. How about this example? The next person who says that I have been walking around with a long face, I am going to bite his head off.”

“Sounds good. But I don’t think it’s a good idea to bite someone’s head off just because you are in a bad mood.”

202,2020/03/21,Cash-in on lockdowns,"While an unexpected break is a chance to unwind, it is also an opportunity to work on your profile and acquire skill sets

It is a party! When I was a student, any shutdowns due to national emergencies meant that great movies were telecast on television. Kids’ parties were thrown in the happy belief that the adults would figure things out and things would soon be back to normal. Among all the partying though, this long, unexpected break is also an opportunity to work on your profile — especially for those applying to college this year, and the next. Here are some simple strategies that would take upto an hour a day, over this break, and add considerably to your profile.

Do an online course

Most online courses are self-paced and require three-to-five hours per week. Pick beginner-level courses in an area you are likely to apply to in college, and choose well-known universities. Harvard, MIT, Wharton, Yale and Hong Kong University offer excellent courses across platforms such as Edx and Coursera. Here are five general courses that cater to almost anybody:

Digital marketing by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on Coursera

Consumer behaviour by IIM Bangalore on Edx

LaunchX Edx course by MIT- Becoming an entrepreneur

Creative thinking: Techniques and Tools for Success by Imperial College on Edx

Python for everybody from University of Michigan on Coursera

Work on a personal project

Most students are full of ideas of what they would love to do, and this is a great time to take the first few baby steps. Some suggestions:

Write poetry or start a blog. Explore platforms such as Medium, Wattpad, TeenInk, or Tumblr

Choose a theme or style to draw or paint in. Explore water colours, charcoal or other media you have been dying to explore. You could tell a personal story or take inspiration from the current lockdown, or from doctors fighting the virus, to tell a new story.

Prepare a curriculum for a workshop you may want to run. This seems bigger than it actually is. Some simple and useful workshops that almost any student could run, include offering senior citizens a five-day crash course on how to use newer social media such as Instagram and Five Fun, organising engaging games, or even teaching them five songs on the guitar or uekele.

Work on basic college essays

If you are applying to college this year, you could start working on college essays — the common app prompts are the same as last year, and almost everyone will need a statement of purpose. You could also work on essay prompts from liberal arts universities in India such as Ashoka University, Haryana, and Flame University, Pune, to get some practice and create a bank of ideas.

And of course, tank up on academics — choose one subject to deepen and strengthen in an hour a day over and above everything else.

But seriously, do tank up on fun and laughter as well. Schools will open soon and start catching up at breakneck speed. So really, now is the time to party.

203,2020/03/21,Prepping for the mainstream,"This certificate programme equips young adults with learning needs, with formal vocational training and skills

The London Learning Centre (LLC), Delhi, in collaboration with Ansal University, Gurugram, has announced the launch of India’s first-ever certificate programme for young adults aged between 18 and 32 years with mild to moderate learning needs. The one-year course will support them to learn and work towards achieving their ambitions.

Though all children and young adults learn in different ways and at different rates, the term ‘additional learning needs’ refers to those with specific learning, physical or sensory needs that make it harder for them to learn compared to their peers. This also includes individuals with a learning disability. “Based on in-depth cognitive assessments and screening during admissions, we identify individuals with ‘mild to moderate’ needs, in order to ensure that they are the best fit for the programme, since this course is specifically developed to be suitable for and match the abilities of such individuals,” explains Jackie Harland, Co-founder and Clinical Director of LLC.

Learning support

LLC was established by Harland along with Pooja Talwar to create a therapy centre of international standards in India. It provides expertise and consistent support for children and their families through its multidisciplinary team and its in-house early intervention screening mechanism and intervention programmes. The first cohort of the programme will admit five to six young adults with special needs, and will begin at Ansal University’s campus in Gurugram.

Harland elaborates, “This programme is aimed at preparing young adults for formal vocational training tutored by internationally trained psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and special educators. The course has been carefully curated, keeping in mind a certain set of skills required for independence, managing personal finances and acquiring soft skills to gain and maintain a job. Furthermore, students will have the flexibility to work at their own pace.”

Every student will go through a standardised assessment and a personal interview. This will help the centre in identifying their level of functioning and specific individual needs. Once the needs are identified, each professional in the multidisciplinary will work together to support the individual, based on the professional’s area of expertise. “For example, one of our students is a high functioning young adult with autism. We set up a series of workshops that were conducted by a psychologist from LLC, who provided him with one-on-one training to help him develop critical life skills, which include management of personal finances and independent travel,” explains Harland.

The faculty comprises a multidisciplinary team featuring psychologists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and special educators. “Our team is internationally trained and our psychologists hold licenses to practise from international regulatory bodies. This team brings together their expertise and skills to support each individual’s needs to enable them to overcome challenges they may face,” adds Harland.

At a glance

The course will run for a year and it includes four modules, with each module spanning over 10 weeks.

Module I:

Functional Social Communication and Language Skills: It will focus on developing students’ communication skills in terms of their functional language in understanding and expression, also in terms of their use of language for different communicative purposes.

Module II:

Independence and self-care: This will focus on enhancing functional numeracy, self-care, presentation skills and activities of daily living, such as managing one’s personal finances.

Module III: Employability: This will focus on developing vocational skills and enable individuals to apply for employment and teach them how to remain employed by learning to cope in the workplace environment and also appropriate behaviours at work.

Module IV: Student specialisation elective: Students will be encouraged to choose an area of specialisation at the end of the first year and opt for subjects such as Catering, Art and Design, Photography, Sports and Fitness, Hair and Beauty, and Information Technology. This is aimed at helping them identify their preferred field of employment.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/i2y7rh/article31126361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16EPBSJackieHarland-LLCjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/prepping-for-the-mainstream/article31126363.ece
204,2020/03/21,What History? Whose story?,"Children are being taught history in classrooms, but telling them untold stories other than war would be a step towards their holistic development

Winning is so deeply a part of our psyche that history is generally considered a chronicle of power; a list of who crushed whom and descriptions of rivalries amongst the strong. The destruction of Troy in 1193 BC. Alexander’s defeat of Raja Purushothaman in 326 BC. The Norman conquest of England in 1066. The fall of Constantinople in 1453. The first battle of Panipat in 1526. The siege of…the war of …the sacking of… After all the fiery wars came the Cold War.

Why isn’t the intellectual History of Mankind as important? Why does it come a poor second to the history of violence and death-struggles between countries and civilisations? The Calendar of Man’s artistic and technological ascent should be given more importance than it is. Given the academic atmosphere in classrooms, it could surely be both interesting and relevant.

Rewind

The history of war and conflict is a focus on the political trends and divisive forces of the world and has traditionally been a part of the political agenda of education. For a long time, it was also uppermost in peoples’ minds because hand-to-hand skirmishes and field battles were always imminent between countries, with the lives of whole populations under threat all the time. Today, governments may talk about making war on an adversary, but they all know that the weapons both sides have are so devastating that both groups could be reduced to dust in the space of hours.

On the other hand, look at just one example in the history of ideas:

When Islam and Christianity were locked in a fight to the death for the control of the Mediterranean, a community of European monks and scholars were in peaceful contact with their more advanced colleagues: scholars who were producing works of science and technology through translations into and out of Arabic. There are so many such instances which cannot be narrated in this column.

Can we not also bring the untold his and her stories of the “daily”ness of the human experience? What were peoples’ lives like away from the sites of war? The missing element in social awareness of the nature of the human experience in History is a vital image of the “daily”ness of life. The very language of teaching and the importance teachers give to research and human ingenuity would go a long way in shifting the school-goer’s mind away from the need for conflict. For instance, with the recent spread of interest in global cuisine, the history of food and habitats would be fascinating. Children raised with some emphasis on the positive side of human evolution would be less likely to develop prejudices about ‘foreigners’ or hostility towards people of different beliefs and social practices.

Ideally, History should be the history of our humanity and our children should receive the universal message from the Mundaka Upanishad — “Like a thousand sparks from a blazing fire are we…” of the same nature, the same origin.

205,2020/03/21,Happy classes,"March 20 is celebrated as International Day of Happiness. Questions about education being a joyful experience, the happiness quotient and prepping for exams continue to remain unanswered. So, what is the way forward?

The term ‘happiness curriculum’ has been in the news in the recent past,and almost everyone in Delhi is familiar with it. The First Lady of the United States (FLOTUS), Melania Trump, during her maiden visit to India, attended a ‘happiness class’ at a government school in Delhi and interacted with its teachers and students. While the FLOTUS and other guests were watching a cultural performance happening on the stage, a little boy in the audience started dancing and won their admiration. Witnessing the jolly kid’s impromptu dance, Mrs. Trump too smiled at the student, applauded and expressed her joy. It was an incident of joy in action.

The Aam Aadmi Party government’s ‘Happiness Curriculum’ scheme launched in 1,030 Delhi government schools in 2018, has been hailed as a major school education reform in the country. The scheme that targets students from kindergarten to class VIII is seen as a shift from exam-and-marks-oriented education to holistic education with the focus on cognition, literacy, numeracy, values, and learner well-being.

Is learning a joyful experience for learners in India? Do children really learn what they need to, in order to lead a happy life? What are the factors that affect effective learning and act as hurdles for joyful learning? Does our education system prepare students for life or for exams and career? These questions arise when we think of ‘happiness curriculum’ and ‘happy schooling’.

Why ‘happiness curriculum’?

The World Happiness Report 2019, published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which ranks countries on citizens’ well-being, ranked India 140 out of 156 countries. Finland topped the list for the second year in a row whereas India slipped from 133rd position in 2018 to 140th position in 2019. This gloomy picture makes us raise questions: Why are Indians not happy? Is there any link between our education system and our happiness quotient?

The purpose of education is to prepare students — to lead a joyful and purposeful life. To translate this vision into action, the system should have sound curriculum and educators. The moral responsibility of such educators is to produce happy individuals who find joy in what they learn and meaning in what they do. The purpose of such curriculum is to help students develop self-awareness, boost confidence, improve mental wellness, build character, and instil values in them in order to enable them to encounter problems boldly and face challenges confidently. To achieve this goal, moral/value education, self-awareness exercises, mental health activities, and social awareness programmes should be given more importance and incorporated into the curriculum. This should be done on a regular basis at the primary and secondary levels of education.

Education for happiness should be one of the aims of primary and secondary education. Learners who are happy will be able to develop a positive attitude towards life. One of the reasons given for Finland’s high level of happiness is the country’s high-quality education system which aims at improving learners’ well-being. Finns guided by the slogan “there is no bad weather, only bad clothes”, learn to do the right thing at a young age.

There are various factors that kill learners’ happiness and make them behave like machines. One of the factors is the hidden agenda of our education system: “education for exams and career”. In the book Creative Schools, Ken Robinson and Lou Aronica (2015) stress the need for shifting away from ‘exam-factory’ education to developing creativity among students. According to the authors, the eight core competencies (8C’s) that education should develop in students are: creativity, curiosity, criticism, communication, collaboration, compassion, composure and citizenship. The UNESCO Happy School Framework (2014-2015) also highlights the need for recognising values and competencies that contribute to enhancing happiness. In this context, it is good to look at two models of happiness curriculum: Delhi and Finland.

Delhi model

The Delhi government’s Happiness Curriculum was designed with an attempt to find answers to the question “What makes a good life?”

Forty teachers were chosen and trained in “co-existential thought” which is based on understanding spiritual, intellectual, behavioural and material aspects of life. Dream a Dream, an NGO, trained the teachers to become educators so that they can nurture empathy and develop their creative and critical thinking skills. The teachers were encouraged to undergo a paradigm shift and apply empathy-based pedagogy and a life skills approach in the classroom. These teachers, who later became mentors, were involved in designing the happiness curriculum that focused on addressing learners’ emotional and mental needs and developing their self-awareness, creativity, critical thinking and a few other life skills.

Finland model

Is happiness a skill? Can it be taught? The answer to these questions can be found in the motto of the Happiness School of Finland: “Finnish happiness is a skill — and it can be taught”. The Finnish education system encourages learner autonomy and creativity. It does not pressurise students by giving them meaningless homework and unproductive tests. Teachers too enjoy autonomy. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Finnish teachers are happier than teachers in other countries. In Finland, it is not easy to be certified as teachers. Only those who have the aptitude for teaching and teaching skills are certified to become teachers. Teachers in Finland are highly respected and trusted. They enjoy a great deal of autonomy to plan lessons and run classes. Granting autonomy to teachers results in producing happier teachers who, in turn, play a vital role in producing happier students.

Sue Palmer, literacy specialist and author of Toxic Childhood, in an interview to CNN says, “My admiration for the Finns is for their education in general and the trust they put in teachers...” She also attributes Finland’s success in education to the later starting age. In Finland, no parent expects their children to be reading and writing formally until they are seven.

Governments and educators

Education should enable the all-round development of individuals. It is possible only if joyful education is promoted and joyful environment is created in educational institutions.

Happiness curriculum is based on the belief that the emotional well-being of learners is linked to their successful life. It is a major shift from teacher-centredness to learner-centredness, teaching to learning, textbook-based learning to experiential learning, unhealthy competition to happy collaboration, teacher domination to learner participation, rote learning to activity-based learning. Happiness curriculum can enhance learner motivation and result in positive learning outcomes. It is high time our governments introduced ‘happiness curriculum’ in schools.

208,2020/03/21,Rajinikanth’s tweet taken down for ‘spreading misinformation’,"Actor said by staying indoors during ‘Janata Curfew’, COVID-19’s spread can be halted

Actor Rajinikanth's clip urging people to support “Janata Curfew” on Twitter was taken down for violating Twitter rules on Saturday.

In the video, Mr. Rajinikanth urged people to stay indoors during the “Janata Curfew” to contain the spread of virus and stop the COVID-19 outbreak going from Stage 2 to 3.

“India is currently in Stage 2. If people don't contract the virus which lives outside in public places frequented by people for 12-14 hours, we can stop it from going to stage 3,” he said.

He said the Italy warned its people when COVID-19 spread was in its second stage but the people did not heed the government’s instructions. It had resulted in thousands of deaths. “So, youths, adults should cooperate,” he said.

As soon as the video was posted from his handle, many started calling out the video for spreading fake news.

Many raised questions about how staying at home for 12-14 hours can prevent the pandemic from going into “Stage 3” in India.

As a result, the tweet was taken down.

Mr. Rajinikanth’s profile tweeted an image with the text similar to his speech and added the YouTube link of the video.

Some Twitter users had also tagged the YouTube alleging that the actor had been spreading misinformation.

209,2020/03/21,The particular susceptibility of old people to COVID-19,"In India, the first three deaths due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were among the elderly. There might be a number of reasons for the potency of such viral infections in old age, one being ageing itself as the immunity levels drop after the age of 50.

Secondly, multiple diseases – high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney diseases, strokes and cancer – are responsible for lowering the immunity. Thirdly, taking multiple drugs such as steroids and chemotherapy agents will definitely reduce the immunity. The fourth is the lack of proper nutrition. Elderly people, including in the rural areas, do not take a nutritive diet. So, more than one factor is responsible for lower immunity in elderly persons, putting them at high risk of infections.

Unlike earlier, we see that the immunity levels go down at the age of 50 as diseases start at the age of 40. This is why the older population picks up infections easily.

Normally, we see pneumonia that is commonly caused by bacterial infection. That is different. Coronavirus induces two major problems – chest infection and renal problems. Chest infection causes cough, breathing difficulty, and phlegm leading to respiratory failure. The lungs of a 20-year-old man are much better than the lungs of a 60-year-old. So, this is the reason for deterioration of health. Coronavirus affects the lung, causes pneumonia and when pneumonia is not treated properly or persons do not respond to treatment, they go for respiratory failure and should be put on ventilator. Approximately 30% of persons affected by COVID-19 died due to kidney failure.

How can we protect ourselves? Elderly persons should avoid going out. Stay indoors, no small walks, no visits to parks or shops. Within the house, it is important to take care as children can easily transmit the infection to the grandparents.

They should always use a tissue or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and wash hands on returning from outside. In case of mild temperature or sore throat, they should isolate themselves immediately, and consult the family physician. It is important to keep all existing diseases such as diabetes under control.

They can drink hot water, and take a diet that helps in improving immunity. Gooseberry that is an anti-oxidant and rich in vitamin C, citrus fruits such as orange and lemon, nuts such as almonds, bitter gourd, honey, curd and mushroom, could boost immunity.

If they start adding such food a little more to their diet, the immunity levels will start rising after two or three weeks. Many of them are house-bound and not exposed to sunlight. As a result, many of them have low vitamin-D levels.

So, they can try and sit just outside their homes or walk within the premises for 30 minutes in the morning and evening for exposure to sunlight.

If elderly persons take all these precautions, they can be safe.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ts6ntm/article31131611.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THEXPERT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-particular-susceptibility-of-old-people-to-covid-19/article31131596.ece
210,2020/03/21,Traffic snarls seen at Hosur,"The border blockade by the government to prevent non-essential movement of people, in a move to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infections, had a bumpy start, with traffic snarls being compounded by inadequate thermal scanners and the eleventh hour movement of people at the Zuzuvadi check post, at the inter-State border between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, in Hosur.

In the wake of the State government declaring closure of the inter-State borders, saving allowances for the essential movement of commodities and emergency travel by public, the district administration had deployed teams along the 16 points, where check posts were already existing along the shared border points of Tamil Nadu with Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

The Zuzuvadi check post, on the main inter-State border between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, however, was inadequately prepared for the steady stream of vehicles coming into Hosur from Bengaluru.

The late Friday night order of lockdown of the borders by the State government had not adequately trickled into Karnataka, it appeared, as a significant number of people came by buses.

The team of medical staff, police and revenue staff were compelled to make allowances for the public, claiming to travel back to their native places. Similarly, the Karnataka State Transport Corporation buses, that were refused entry into Tamil Nadu, dropped off passengers at the Athibelle toll plaza.

Scores of people who walked into the Zuzuvadi check post had to be allowed entry.

A random exercise

But the team of staff were equipped with only one thermal scanner. Soon, the thermal scanning turned into a random exercise, with a few being screened and others let off to avoid traffic snarls.

Similarly, the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation buses that already plied into Bengaluru were allowed to return.

Border closure is expected to be strictly enforced from Saturday midnight, with allowances for people who are already in the middle of travel.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/traffic-snarls-seen-at-hosur/article31131558.ece
211,2020/03/21,Death toll in fire accident goes up to 9,"Body of a worker was found near the accident spot

The death toll in Friday's fire accident on the Rajammal Fireworks premises in Chippiparai has risen to 9, after the body of a worker, identified as K. Gurusamy, 45, of Mukuttumalai in Thoothukudi district, was found near the accident spot on Saturday.

The police said he was thrown some 100 metres away in the impact of the explosion, and his body parts were found lying strewn on a field. With this, the accident has claimed the lives of seven women and two men.

Following post-mortem, the relatives of the deceased refused to collect the bodies and staged a demonstration. They said the employer had not given them compensation. Normally, in such circumstances, the employer would give ₹5.5 lakh to the kin of each victim, they said and urged officials to intervene.

₹1 lakh solatium

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Saturday announced a solatium of ₹1 lakh each to the family members of 9 persons who were killed in a fire accident at a cracker unit in Chippiparai village in Virudhunagar district on Friday.

Responding to DMK MLA Thangam Thennarasu’s claim that the accident had occurred because the unit had been manufacturing high-end crackers though its owners had obtained permission for manufacturing only ordinary ones, the Chief Minister said action would be taken if that was found to be true.

He said those who were severely injured in the accident would get ₹50,000 and those with ordinary injuries would get ₹25,000.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/death-toll-in-fire-accident-goes-up-to-9/article31131549.ece
212,2020/03/21,70% dip in traffic from Kerala,"Officials from various departments screen vehicles and passengers from Kerala

Vehicular movement from Kerala to Tamil Nadu, through Coimbatore, dropped by nearly 70% on Saturday due to restrictions imposed by Tamil Nadu on vehicular traffic from neighbouring States, as a vigil against COVID-19 spread came to effect late on Friday.

Officials from the police, health and revenue departments oversaw the screening of vehicles and passengers from Kerala, at nine check posts in Coimbatore — Walayar, Mulli, Melpaviyur, Velanthavalam, Veerapakoundanpudur, Gopalapuram, Meenakshipuram, Vazhukku parai, and Anaikatti.

Barricades were placed on roads at these check posts. Vehicles carrying essential commodities, goods carriers, those travelling to Coimbatore airport, vehicles handling medical and other emergencies were allowed. Commuters of private vehicles were permitted to enter Coimbatore only after they produced proof for an emergency situation. Several vehicles were sent back.

Commuters of vehicles permitted to enter Coimbatore were allowed only after screening by Health Department staff.

West Zone IG K. Periaiah and Coimbatore range DIG G. Karthikeyan on Friday night inspected the police arrangements at the Walayar check post, overseen by Coimbatore rural SP Sujit Kumar.

213,2020/03/21,Officials step up vigil along Andhra border,"Only essential commodities, emergency travellers, patients need hospitalisation to be allowed

District administrations have taken several steps to counter the spread of COVID-19.

Vellore Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram reviewed preventive measures undertaken by health, revenue and police officials, at the Bathalapalli check post.

Health officials screened the movement of goods and passengers at the RTO check post on the Katpadi-Chittoor Road on Saturday.

To monitor incoming vehicles and travellers, the Vellore district administration has set up 10 inter-departmental special squads, consisting of officials from the police, revenue, rural development, Corporation and health departments.

Each squad will have three officials from the police, two from health, four from revenue and six from local bodies. Each Squad will consist of 15 officials.

An official said, “We formed 30 squads to function in three shifts to safeguard 10 points — Serkadu in Katpadi taluk, Christianpet in Katpadi taluk and Ponnai (Mathandakuppam) in Katpadi taluk, Bathalapalli in Pernambut taluk, Paradharami and Synakunta in Gudiyatham taluk, Golden Temple, Katpadi railway station and Chittoor bus stand.

He added that, so far, all six COVID-19 patients in the State were “imported cases”, with a travel history, and did not involve community transmission.

Screening had been intensified at railway stations, at domestic and international terminals of airports and on the borders with States, he informed.

The Minister later told reporters that two of the new cases were tourists from Thailand, while the third person had arrived from New Zealand. The Health Department had begun tracing the contacts of all three persons. However, he refused to divulge details on where the three patients were admitted, citing “medical ethics”.

However, late on Saturday, officials said that the two Thai nationals were lodged at the isolation ward of Government IRT Perundurai Medical College. The third patient has been admitted to a private hospital in Chennai.

Home quarantine

The number of persons under home surveillance for COVID-19 in the State has doubled. From 4,253 persons on Friday, the number has gone up to 8,950. Chennai accounts for the highest number of persons in home quarantine, at 2,904.

Currently, 221 asymptomatic passengers from highly-affected countries are being quarantined in centres near the airport, according to a bulletin released by the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine.

The number of persons admitted to isolation wards increased from 32 to 54. The number of persons screened at airports crossed the two lakh mark. A total of 2,01,672 persons have been screened so far. The total number of samples taken for testing also went up to 412 from 333. Of this, 67 samples were under process.

The Minister urged people to stay at home and cooperate to prevent community spread of COVID-19. He added that they were following the guidelines issued for testing.

The number of beds in isolation wards in government medical college hospitals is all set to increase. Presently, there are a total of 1,120 beds in isolation wards in government medical college hospitals, headquarters hospitals and private hospitals.

As of now, government medical college hospitals have 20-bedded isolation wards. Now, all hospitals have been instructed to increase the number of beds for isolation wards up to 100 along with ventilators, step-down wards and observation wards. Private hospitals empanelled under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme have been roped in, he said.

The Minister held a meeting with deans and chiefs of medicine of private medical college hospitals and asked them to ready 100-bed isolation ward facilities in their institutions. The Minister said that the 24-hour control room of the DPH, which is manned in three shifts by 50 persons each, was also involved in contact tracing of COVID-19 patients.

Those under home quarantine — those with a travel history from affected countries or other States — were usually contacted on their phones to check on their health status every day, he said.

App launched

“Now, we have launched an app through which our doctors can provide medical advice to those under home quarantine through video calls. This app has a capacity to connect one lakh persons,” he said. Officials said that a video call facility would be provided on the portal.

The Tamil Nadu Ophthalmic Association, in a press release, advised its members to cancel all elective procedures.

218,2020/03/21,"COVID-19: Come out of holiday mood, Tamil Nadu Health Minister tells people","The Health Minister urged people to avoid unncessary travel

Calling upon the people of the State “to come out of holiday mood” and “get serious and avoid unnecessary travel”, health minister C. Vijayabaskar on Saturday said the government was keeping ready five dedicated mini buses at the International Airport for the benefit of passengers to go either to quarantine facilities or to hotels.

He told the Assembly that the buses were operated under the control of an IAS officer and all those who were coming from foreign countries were given personal protective equipment. He said government has also started the practice of stamping the quarantine period on the hands of persons in Madurai, and they were also offered counselling.

“We have so far quarantined 4,253 persons. The 20-bed isolation wards in medical college hospitals would be upgraded into 100-bed isolation wards,” he said.

Responding to Opposition leader M.K. Stalin who wanted to know about the preparedness of the government to counter COVID-19, the Minister said the government also had plans to rope in private hospitals and retired government doctors.

“We have asked the private hospitals, if they are interested in offering treatment, to give the details about beds and isolation wards. Government doctors are checking the facilities and we will issue notifications,” said.

He said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had allotted ₹60 crore in the first phase. As he was making the speech, the Chief Minister told the Minister that money would not be a constraint as funds could be released from the State Disaster Management Fund.

Mr. Vijayabaskar said the government was installing 560 new ventilators in addition to the 1,100 ventilators in the government hospitals and also at secondary-level hospitals. “We have set up three level of wards—Isolation ward, Step down ward and Observation ward,” he said.

Mr. Vijayabaskar said the government had taken efforts on a war-footing and purchased equipment without calling for tenders as time did not permit for the following of procedures. He said the government had decided to buy 1 lakh more masks and 10 lakh triple-layer masks for the health workers.

Mr .Vijaybaskar said a control room had been set up and 100 workers were responding to queries day and night. Control rooms have also been set up in districts.

Reiterating that the people’s cooperation was very important in combating the disease, the Minister said the flow of passengers from North India and other states was continuing and screening was being done at the 7 exit points at Central station. “Screening is done in Egmore and Tambaram.

219,2020/03/21,Can loss be beneficial: Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission tests the waters,"Experts weigh in on the losses and benefits that the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation may experience, if third-party sale of electricity is allowed

Loss can even be ‘beneficial.’ This is how some energy experts view the latest application filed by a private firm for intra-State trading of electricity with the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC).

These experts are talking about the ‘loss’ and the ‘benefit’ that the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) may experience, if a third-party sale of electricity is allowed.

Traditionally, the State power utility has been opposed to third-party sale of electricity on the ground that any such move will erode its revenue base. It has been holding on to the position, despite the 2003 Electricity Act allowing the implementation of the concept. Of a total of about 10,230 high-tension (HT) consumers, industrial establishments account for around 8,200.

If the applicant-firm -- Star Eco Energy, a Coimbatore-based company -- is given the licence for trading of 45 million units (MU) of power annually within Tamil Nadu, it is expected take away the some of the Corporation’s customers, which will invariably be HT industrial establishments. The “benefit” that the Tangedco stands to gain is that it can still earn higher revenue through cross subsidy surcharge.

At present, there is only one licensee (R.S. Yarns and Power, a Tiruppur-based private company) for power trading within Tamil Nadu. This operation has been on since November 2012. This company had sought the nod for 150 MU.

The TNERC has called upon stakeholders to provide feedback, till April 12, on the Coimbatore firm’s application. A couple of other similar applications are also being examined, says an official.

The experts, who say that the Tangedco stands to ‘gain’ through third party sale transactions, explain that a HT consumer-firm, ordinarily, has to pay to the Tangedco two charges - energy charges of ₹ 6.35 per unit and demand charges of ₹ 350 per KVA (Kilo Volt Ampere) per month or ₹1.65 per unit. As the latter belongs to the category of fixed charges, it has to be paid by the consumer, irrespective of whether power was drawn Tangedco’s system or not.

Under the given circumstances, clients of a licensee-firm can get electricity at ₹ 5.5 per unit. This rate includes the cost of cross subsidy surcharge of ₹1.67 per unit to be paid to the Corporation and the licensee’s commission of ₹ 0.07 per unit.

It is where the Tangedco, according to the experts, stands to ‘gain.’ Hypothetically, had the clients continued to draw power from the State utility, they would have paid energy charges (₹ 6.35 per unit). As per a thumb rule, the Tangedco’s average pooled cost of power is ₹ 5.5 per unit, which includes the cost of power produced or procured and the monetary value of line loss. This means that the power utility earns ₹ 0.85 additionally for every unit it sells to a HT consumer. But, when a third party sale transaction happens, its income goes up to ₹ 1.67 per unit, which it gets in the form of cross subsidy surcharge.

However, the experts hasten to emphasise that these calculations hold good till the present energy charges (₹ 6.35 per unit) are not hiked. Also, only up to a point, can third-party sale of power be entertained by the Tangedco, they add.

But, another section of experts is of the view that the Tangedco, which is suffering a loss of ₹2.2 per unit of power being sold, cannot afford to lose any customers, more so an industrial establishment. So, these calculations will be, for all practical purposes, of academic value only.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/can-loss-be-beneficial-tamil-nadu-electricity-regulatory-commission-tests-the-waters/article31127775.ece

Responding to DMK MLA Thangam Thennarasu who claimed that the accident took place because the owners of the unit who had permission to make only ordinary crackers manufactured high-end crackers, the Chief Minister said action would be taken if they were found to have manufactured without permission.

The Chief Minister said those who were severely injured would get ₹50,000 and those who sustained ordinary injuries would get ₹25,000.

224,2020/03/21,Tamil Nadu plans special reservation for government school students in medical colleges,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami made this announcement in the Assembly on Saturday

The Tamil Nadu government is planning to enact a law to create special reservation for students of government schools in medical colleges, even as it is waging a legal battle in the Supreme Court against the NEET (National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test), Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said.

Making a suo motu statement in the Legislative Assembly on Saturday, the Chief Minister said the reservation would be for students who study from class I to XII in government schools, corporation schools, municipal schools, Kallar reclamation schools and schools run by the Forest Department.

“Entry of government school students into medical colleges has come down drastically after the introduction of the NEET. The government of Amma wants to to stop this trend,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

The Chief Minister said the government would constitute a commission under the chairmanship of a retired High Court judge to collect details and make recommendations to the government. The commission will have secretaries of the Health and Law Departments as members. Besides, two educationists named by the School Education Department will be included in the commission. The Director of Medical Education will be the member-secretary of the commission.

“The commission will study the reason for the poor entry of government school students in medical colleges and asses their social conditions before making recommendations to rectify the trend,” he said. The commission will make its recommendations in one month.

Mr. Palaniswami said though the NEET was introduced in 2016-17, late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had obtained an exemption for a year. “We have been opposing NEET and adopted a resolution in the Assembly and sent it to the Centre. We have also approached the Supreme Court and explained how the examination had severely affected the poor and students from rural areas,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3lrjl0/article31126521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MARTH--MMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-plans-special-reservation-for-government-school-students-in-medical-colleges/article31126522.ece
225,2020/03/21,COVID-19: Indian tourists stranded at Kuala Lumpur airport,"A total of 54 tourists, mostly from Tamil Nadu, were scheduled to return on March 18, but are now stranded due to the suspension of flights

Indian tourists stranded at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport for the fourth day have appealed for the intervention of the Union government to facilitate their travel back home.

A total of 54 tourists, mostly from Tamil Nadu, were scheduled to return to India on March 18 but have been stranded due to the suspension of flights in view of the COVID-19 sitation.

A total of 54 tourists with over 30 hailing from Tamil Nadu have been stuck at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia with no means to return as all flights from the country to India have been cancelled.

The travellers, who were to return home on March 18 by a SriLankan Airlines flight via Colombo, had completed emigration and security checks and were seated at the waiting hall of the airport when the Centre announced the cancellation of flights, the passengers say.

Following the announcement, other passengers were allowed to board but those with Indian passports were left behind.

Usha Devi, a resident of Valayalkarar Street in Tiruchi who travelled along with four others from here complained of apathy on the part of the Indian government. Basic necessities such as food and a bed to sleep on are not being provided, she rued. “On March 18, our scheduled day of travel, we received no food or water. On March 19, SriLankan Airlines provided breakfast, lunch and dinner. On March 20, we were told that the Indian Embassy has been informed and that SriLankan Airlines was not responsible any more,” she said. Since food available at the airport is exorbitantly priced, they are unable to purchase proper meals, she added. Although the restrooms at the waiting hall were clean, the passengers had not been able to bathe in three days as all their clothes were in their checked-in baggage, she said.

Sharmila Abdul Lathief, a resident of Ashok Nagar in Chennai said that many senior citizens were also stuck with them. “They are struggling in the air-conditioned space with no place to sleep. We are all sleeping on the chairs at the waiting hall,” she said. “If we fall sick because of this, who will be responsible?” she asked. “There are so many other passengers travelling elsewhere waiting in this hall. What if we catch the coronavirus from someone here?” she asked.

When an Indian flight which arrived at the airport to airlift Indian students stuck in Malaysia on March 19 refused to board them, their hopes were shattered, Ms. Lathief said. “We begged to be taken home but the officials here said that the Indian government had not given them clearance to take us home yet,” she said.

An official of the Indian Embassy in Malaysia visited the passengers and said that measures to take them home are underway, Ms. Lathief said.

Sivarasu, Tiruchi District Collector who received a copy of the letter from the Indian Embassy in Malaysia to the Indian Government said that efforts to bring them back were on.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ad8wtc/article31126240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MARTH--KL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-indian-tourists-stranded-at-kuala-lumpur-airport/article31126242.ece

Members of Erode District Congress Committee (South) has urged the State government to convert the Institute of Road and Transport Technology (IRTT) at Chithode into a government college so that more students could be admitted in the first year.

In a petition to the Chief Minister, its president Makkal G. Rajan said that the college was established by former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran in 1984 for the benefit of wards of employees working at the Transport Department. He said that based on the public request, the State government had converted the I.R.T. Medical College at Perundurai into a government medical college. Likewise, the the engineering college could also be converted into a government college.

228,2020/03/21,Source of second patient’s infection remains untraced,"‘Orders placed for 500 ventilators’

The State Health department is yet to ascertain the source of infection for the 20-year-old youth, who had no travel history to an affected country but travelled from Delhi to Chennai and tested positive in the city on March 18. But the department has traced and quarantined 163 persons who had come in contact with him.

“We are yet to identify the source of infection. It is still a big challenge for us,” Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar told reporters on Friday. The youth, a resident of Uttar Pradesh, tested positive for COVID-19 while he was in the isolation ward of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH). Officials said that though he did not have travel history to an affected country, he was tested as he came from Delhi and had symptoms.

“We have traced and quarantined 163 of his contacts, and 94 contacts of the 21-year-old MBA student, who had travelled from Ireland to Chennai and tested positive for COVID-19. Tracing the contact history of these patients and quarantining them is definitely a challenging task for the department,” he said. These contacts included co-passengers, family, friends, neighbours, and people from the places they visited and stayed.

The Minister added that the department has shared the train details of the second patient and flight details of the third patient with other States. He added that they had readied flow charts on the movement of the two patients and this would be released for the public, if the need arises. “If we are unable to track all their contacts, we will definitely release the flow charts for the public,” he said.

Hundred ambulances have been earmarked to transport patients suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19, and those with travel history with symptoms of COVID-19. “These ambulances will not be utilised for other patients. These vehicles are making 22 to 25 trips per day. This shows that people who have travelled to affected countries are voluntarily reporting,” he said.

To a question on the State’s preparedness for the coming weeks including intensive care facilities, he said, “We have placed orders for 500 more ventilators, and are increasing the beds including in intensive care units, and have requested private hospitals too. We are strengthening facilities at the district headquarters hospitals.”

He said the department’s helpline 104 was receiving 400 to 500 calls per day asking for dos and don’ts for COVID-19.

The Minister appealed to the public to avoid unnecessary travel. “The Chief Minister has declared holiday for all educational institutions and ordered closure of large commercial establishments. But during my visit to the Central Railway Station and bus terminals we could see plenty of movement of people. This is worrying,” he said.

Noting that this was a serious issue, he urged people not to go into “holiday mood” but have a sense of fear. “There is no community spread till now in TN but we are worried. This is why we are taking many measures. It is time people practised social distancing,” he added. He said that persons arriving from affected countries have to cooperate with officials to be under a day’s quarantine and this was mandated by the Public Health Act.

3 more testing centres

The State has got three more testing centres for COVID-19. This takes the total number of laboratories to seven. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has approved the testing facilities at the government medical colleges in Coimbatore, Salem, and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital. As on date, 32 patients were under observation at isolation wards in government medical college hospitals and 4,253 persons under follow-up. Of the 333 samples lifted for testing, 27 were under process. The remaining 303 samples have returned negative and three tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 1,98,741 passengers were screened at airports across the State.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said that Tamil Nadu is all set to carry out “home quarantine” stamping on passengers. “We have obtained the approval for the stamping and the seal has been readied.” The stamp would mention that the person is under home quarantine and the date until he/she is supposed to be under home quarantine.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e2oaz8/article31123766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/image1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/source-of-second-patients-infection-remains-untraced/article31123767.ece
229,2020/03/21,T.N. puts curbs on traffic across borders till March 31,"Ambulances, essential services exempted

Continuing with its precautionary measures against COVID-19, the State government on Friday evening imposed restrictions on vehicular traffic from neighbouring States of Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The restrictions have been imposed on inter-State roads and will be in force till March 31.

However, it has exempted ambulances and vehicles carrying essential supplies such as milk, petrol, diesel, vegetables, medicines and gas cylinders, an official release stated.

“Minimum bus services will be allowed for persons travelling due to unavoidable reasons,” it clarified. Vehicles carrying other supplies and light motor vehicles carrying passengers travelling due to emergency purposes such as death and related incidents will be allowed. “All those travelling by these vehicles will be subjected to screening. Vehicles too will be inspected and screened,” it stated. The government has appealed to the people to cooperate in the larger interest of the country.

Coimbatore District Collector K. Rajamani issued orders stopping vehicle movement between the district and Kerala by closing all nine check posts on Coimbatore-Kerala border.

Buses not allowed

The check posts were closed to buses and private vehicles from Friday evening.

The Collector said in a press release that the Tamil Nadu check posts at Walayar, Mulli, Melpaviyur, Velanthavalam, Veerapakoundanpudur, Gopalapuram, Meenatchipuram, Vazhukku parai, and Annaikatti were closed as a precautionary measure. Disinfectants were being used to clean omni, tourist, government buses, cars and lorries at these nine check posts so far. On Friday, it was decided to suspend all vehicular movement on the border.

Screening of vehicles

Mr. Rajamani told The Hindu that officials would be posted in other areas along the border — Valparai, Pollachi, Anaikatti, Coimbatore — that do not have check posts. Movement of essential commodities such as LPG cylinders, eggs, and vegetables will be permitted. These vehicles returning from Kerala will be screened. There are a few trains that are still operated from Kerala and screening of train passengers here will be strengthened here.

The government will take up conservation and restoration of heritage buildings at the District Munsif-cum-Judicial Magistrate Court at Vandavasi in Tiruvannamalai district and District Munsif Court in Coimbatore, at a cost of ₹ 10 crore, Mr. Shanmugam said.

The Minister announced that the government would provide young lawyers a monthly stipend of ₹3,000 for two years.

Additional district courts would be constituted at Tiruchengode in Namakkal district, Harur in Dharmapuri district and Arakkonam in Ranipet district; additional sub courts will be set up at Thirukoilur in Kallakurichi district, Nilakottai in Dindigul district, Keeranur in Pudukottai district and Tiruvottiyur in Tiruvallur district, he said.

Mr. Shanmugam said the government would upgrade the existing sub jail in Tiruvallur into a district jail. An additional block for 100 prisoners at the district jail in Chengalpet would be constructed, library facilities would be upgraded in all Central prisons and special prisons for women, jailor quarters would be built in Central prisons in Madurai and Palayamkottai, 50 body worn cameras would be procured for prison officials to monitor the movement of prisoners and to prevent any untoward incidents, he said.

Tamil in court

The State government has been taking steps to urge the Centre to make Tamil the official language in Madras High Court, even though the plea was rejected twice by the Supreme Court, Mr. Shanmugam said.

In his reply to P. Sivakumar alias Thayagam Kavi (DMK), who raised the issue in the House, Mr. Shanmugam said the Chief Minister had written to the Centre on March 3 in this regard.

Countering Mr. Sivakumar’s question on the delay in adopting Tamil as official language in the Madras High Court, Mr. Shanmugam questioned why the DMK was unable to ensure this when in power between 2006 and 2011, although it was a partner in the coalition government at the Centre then. The plea for adopting Tamil as official language in the Madras High Court was rejected twice in 2012 and 2015, he said.

S. Semmalai (AIADMK) urged the State government to take action on adopting Tamil as official language in the High Court. “When the courts in four States can have Hindi as official language in respective States, why not Tamil,” he asked.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-judges-will-be-given-ipad-pro-says-minister/article31123468.ece

The Tamil Nadu Governor will take a decision on the release of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case once the CBI-led Multi-Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) submits its report, State Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam said on Friday.

The MDMA was set up to probe the larger conspiracy behind the assassination of the former Prime Minister.

He was replying to MLA U. Thaniyarasu, who raised the issue during the debate on the demand for grants for the Law Department. Mr. Thaniyarasu also raised the issue of granting parole to the convicts in the case, who have been in prison for 28 years. Mr. Shanmugam replied that the government had in fact given parole to Perarivalan twice based on rules and would go by the guidelines in granting parole to others.

Mr. Thaniyarasu also sought better facilities and food for prisoners and prison reforms.

232,2020/03/21,Eight killed in blast at cracker unit,"Factory was making fireworks in violation of norms

In one of the worst accidents in the fireworks industry, eight workers were killed and seven out of the nine injured were critical after an explosion at Rajammal Fireworks in Chippiparai near here on Friday afternoon.

The majority of the deceased as well as injured were women. Most of the victims were from neighbouring Tenkasi and Thoothukudi districts.

The unit’s owner, R. Ganesan, 37, of Vellaiyapuram near Sivakasi, had a licence only to make small crackers, and had violated norms by attempting to manufacture “fancy” (aerial) crackers, Collector R. Kannan, who rushed to the spot, told The Hindu.

Stating that the workers lacked knowledge about handling certain chemicals, he said that mishandling could have led to the accident. The exact cause of the fire that sparked the explosion around 3.10 p.m. was under investigation, he added.

The Collector said that the licence of the unit was suspended in 2018 after officials discovered violations of safety norms. “The suspension was revoked in 2019 with a warning and the licensee gave an undertaking to comply with conditions,” Mr. Kannan said.

Following the explosion, a ball of flame engulfed the workers and all the deceased workers had died after they were charred.

Fire and Rescue Services personnel had to struggle for hours to put out the flames, as the chemicals at the accident site kept exploding till 8 p.m. All five work sheds were gutted.

Inspector General of Police (South Zone) K.P. Shanmuga Rajeswaran inspected the accident site along with the Superintendent of Police P. Perumal.

“Luckily, a godown on the fireworks premises where the raw chemicals were stocked in huge quantities escaped the flames. Otherwise, it could have caused havoc,” Revenue Divisional Officer, Sattur, A. Kalimuthu, said.

233,2020/03/21,Palaniswami backs ‘Janata Curfew’,"There will be no services of State Transport Corporations

In view of the call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday announced that bus services by various transport corporations will be suspended between 7 a.m. and 9 p.m. that day. He appealed to operators of private buses and mini buses to extend their cooperation to the State government’s announcement.

The Chief Minister called upon the general public to express their gratitude to those in service of the nation as well as those attending to COVID-19 patients by clapping their hands at 5 p.m. on Sunday as requested by Mr. Modi.

Besides, he announced that all government-run and private libraries would remain closed from March 21 to 31. “Heeding to the request of the PM, the general public should extend their cooperation to the efforts taken by this government,” Mr. Palaniswami added. Citizens avoiding unnecessary visits out of their houses, elders above 60 staying put in their residences, not hoarding and paying employees on time, were among the nine pointers in the Prime Minister’s appeal to the people.

Mr. Palaniswami attended a meeting via video conferencing with Mr. Modi along with other Chief Ministers on the precautionary measures taken and to be taken in the State.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qpv0uk/article31123452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THCMVIDEOCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/palaniswami-backs-janata-curfew/article31123454.ece
234,2020/03/21,CM stands ground on Assembly session,"Stalin demands adjournment to help MLAs visit their constituencies

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday reiterated his stand against adjourning the Assembly session because of the outbreak of COVID-19, although DMK president M.K. Stalin wanted the House proceedings to be adjourned, contending that MLAs had to be in their respective constituencies for coordinating efforts against the pandemic. Subsequently, at a Business Advisory Committee meeting of the House convened by Speaker P. Dhanapal there was no consensus among ruling and Opposition party members on suspending the session.

“Only if the Assembly session is on, we can discuss issues facing the general public. Only if the Assembly session is on, the apprehensions of the public will be allayed,” Mr. Palaniswami said replying to concerns raised by Opposition leaders in the House.

He referred to the four meetings he chaired to review precautionary measures against COVID-19.

Mr. Palaniswami said the small-scale industries in the State had not been closed due to the pandemic and claimed that the spread of the virus was only from those coming from abroad and not from those within the State.

Earlier, Mr. Stalin raised the issue during the Zero Hour and referred to the call by the Prime Minister insisting people to remain at home on Sunday next. “Would it be appropriate for us to gather in the Assembly and discuss after advising people to self quarantine and against them gathering in public places,” Mr. Stalin asked.

He referred to a Minister in Tamil Nadu government who has advised the general public against meeting him both in his native place as well as in Chennai. “When a Minister has such fears, we are sitting here to debate in the Assembly. I am not criticising anyone,” Mr. Stalin said.

The DMK leader added that the government had taken several precautionary steps and people across the State expected their elected representatives to be in their respective Assembly constituencies to coordinate the fight against coronavirus.

Congress MLA K.R. Ramasamy (Karaikudi) echoed Mr. Stalin's statement and pointed out that the Chief Minister, the Deputy Chief Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, besides him were over 60, while the central advisory was against elders stepping out of home. He said DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan, who had recently undergone a surgery, was attending the House, even though the advisory was against such persons stepping out of homes.

Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) MLA K.A.M. Muhammed Abubacker (Kadayanallur) too made the same request.

No consensus at BAC

At the Assembly’s Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting convened in the afternoon to discuss the demand for adjourning the House proceedings, there was no consensus.

While the DMK and the Congress members reiterated their stand seeking adjournment of the Assembly session, the ruling AIADMK stood by the Chief Minister’s stand.

Speaker P. Dhanapal chaired the meeting. DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan and party whip R. Sakkarapani represented the principal Opposition while the Congress Legislative Party leader K.R. Ramasamy and Congress whip S. Vijayadharani represented their party. The meeting lasted 30 minutes.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nfvq24/article31123436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THASSEMBLYSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-stands-ground-on-assembly-session/article31123437.ece
235,2020/03/21,"State is free of COVID-19, government assures High Court","‘1.89 lakh passengers screened across four airports’

The Health and Family Welfare department on Friday presented before the Madras High Court a comprehensive report on steps taken by it so far to contain the spread of the pandemic COVID-19 and claimed that because of preventive steps taken by the government, “the State is free of coronavirus infection.”

In the status report filed before a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said that till Thursday 1,89,750 international air passengers were screened in the airports at Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore and 2,984 of them were kept under home quarantine for 28 days.

Quarantine facilities had been created in all those four cities for passengers arriving from severely affected countries, the Secretary said and added that till now 222 samples had been taken from the passengers and 166 of them had tested negative. Only two had tested positive so far and testing of the rest of 54 samples was under process. The report filed in response to a public interest litigation petition went on to state that all government medical college hospitals and district headquarters hospitals spread widely across the State had been designated as hospitals for management of suspected patients of coronavirus with dedicated isolation wards.

Totally, 1,120 beds were available in such isolation wards, including those in private hospitals, with all necessary facilities to treat the patients. The laboratory testing facilities had been established at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research in Guindy, Chennai, and at the Government Medical Colleges in Theni, Tirunelveli and Tiruvarur, Ms. Rajesh told the court.

Protective gear

On availability of personal protective equipment, she said, N95 masks and triple layer masks were made available in all airports, ambulances and medical college hospitals to handle emergencies. As on date, 3.31 lakh three-layer masks and around 56,000 N-95 masks were available and orders had been placed to procure more.

The government will be procuring 15 lakh three-layer masks, 1.5 lakh N-95 masks and 40,000 personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. It had shared technical documents on screening, laboratory diagnosis, clinical management, infection control and home quarantine with all district health officials and paramedical staff.

“Medical screening is being carried out in all the inter-State borders of the 16 districts. The vehicles are checked and people screened for any suspected symptoms… A 24X7 control room with telephone numbers 044 29510400, 044 295100500, 9444340496, 8754448477 and 104 are equipped to answer any queries and guide the general public. Orders have been issued to advertise coronavirus message on three FM channels and All India Radio from March 19 to March 29 for more than 1,000 slots and 70 lakh information, education and communication (IEC) materials have been distributed throughout the State. The health status of all passengers under observation at home and in hospitals is stable,” the report concluded.

After taking the report on file, the judges adjourned the PIL petition filed by advocate G. Rajesh, complaining about non-availability of hand sanitizers and masks, to Monday since the petitioner’s advocate P.V.S. Giridhar said the State government was yet to issue a notification on including masks and hand sanitizers under the Essential Commodities Act of 1955.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lnff68/article31123405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THMADURAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-is-free-of-covid-19-government-assures-high-court/article31123406.ece
236,2020/03/21,Staff in automobile sector continue to work despite COVID-19 scare,"Despite the COVID-19 scare everywhere, the conveyor belts are still running at the auto hub of Chennai, popularly called the ‘Detroit of Asia’. “It’s work as usual for us, the only difference is the mask on my face and I'm washing my hands every half an hour as per the advice of my company officials,” said Prakash who works in one of the automobile firms in the Srirperambudur belt.

He added, “We cannot assemble body parts cars from home. We need to be present at the plant. And also we have already suffered a lot in the last six months because of no production days. If we don't work now we will not be able to meet our expenses in the coming months,” he said.

Like Prakash thousands of workers in the auto industry are pushing themselves to go to work. “One big challenge and scare is we are all picked up in the company bus. There are 50 plus people in the bus and we have to be extra cautious,” said Raja, who travels 30 minutes in the bus to reach the plant where he is working.

Eight employees from five different firms which makes cars and bikes said that it would be good if they are given leave every alternate day until March 31 like companies in other sectors. “We are worried about the virus but we know how tough it was when we had no production days and business slowdown,” said another employee from a plant which makes two-wheelers. “My daughter is getting married in few days and I need money for that. If I stay away from work I will have to take a pay cut,” he lamented.

S. Kannan, President of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), Kancheepuram district, said that most auto companies are headed by officials from other countries so workers should be taken care of properly. “We don't know where these officials are travelling or coming from,” he said adding that there should be no compromise in taking care of workers.

When contacted most of the firms said they are working and have taken precautionary measures. The spokesperson of Ford India said, “We are not exploring options such as adjustments in production or rearrangement of non-production days, as of now.” “There is no cut down in production at Ford plant in Chennai and employees are working under strict safety and hygiene guidelines,” the spokesperson added.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd said that it has put in place various measures for the safety and well-being of employees. “With the help of our employees, we are currently well on track as per the business plan for the year. We are also actively monitoring the ongoing situation, and will be taking specific action as and when necessary,” Hyundai said in a statement.

238,2020/03/21,Semmalai lashes out at Centre,"‘T.N. given step-motherly treatment in Atal Bhujal Yojana’

S. Semmalai (AIADMK) on Friday criticised the “big brother attitude” of the Centre saying central legislations were overriding legislation passed by the State.

Speaking on the debate on the demand for grants for Law Department in the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Semmalai, who represents Mettur, said the Centre sought to hold sway even on subjects in which the State had legislative powers.

Referring to the Atal Bhujal Yojana, a scheme implemented by the Centre with financial support from the World Bank, Mr. Semmalai claimed the Centre had shown “step-motherly attitude” towards Tamil Nadu since none of the districts were included in it.

Recalling an incident during his term as MP in the 14th Parliament, Mr. Semmalai said the Centre attempted to pass the Lokpal Bill as well as Lokayukta Bill, even though the latter was within the State government’s domain. “I was the only member to give a dissent note with the permission of Amma [Jayalalithaa],” he said.

Mr. Semmalai claimed that when he had checked with DMK MPs then, “They said though they were against it, they did not oppose it because of alliance dharma.” Only an MP from Trinamool Congress from West Bengal “supported my stand.”

Although there were specific subjects in the Central List, State List and the Concurrent List, legislations enacted by the Centre prevailed over that of the State if they were in Concurrent List, he said. “Even legislations passed by the States will have to get the President’s assent,” he pointed out.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cx2qwy/article31123276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THTNSEMMALAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/semmalai-lashes-out-at-centre/article31123277.ece
239,2020/03/21,COVID-19: Solar developer wants project completion date extended,"Raasi Group has sought for extension of completion date for its 100 MW solar project in the State, in the wake of COVID- 19, which has impacted module procurement.

In 2017, the company signed an agreement with Tangedco, the State utility for procurement of the said capacity at ₹3.47 per unit for 25 years. The project was to come up in Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu. Tangedco had signed the agreement with a slew of other companies for procurement of 1,500 MW.

The plant was to be completed by September this year, otherwise penalties would be imposed as per the agreement. “We seek extension till December. Module procurement has been hit due to the situation in China. It will take at least five months for the situation to ease. This should be considered as a force majeure situation, which is provided for in the agreement ,” C. Narasimhan, chairman, Raasi Group, told The Hindu.

A force majeure (FM) clause is included to provide for extraordinary events like those beyond human control such as wars, riots, crimes, or natural calamities, among others.

Mr. Narasimhan pointed out there was already an issue relating to safeguard duty which was delaying the project and COVID-19 has complicated the situation.

In July 2018, the Centre had imposed safeguard duty on solar panels and modules. As a result, the industry wanted to pass on the additional cost to the customers.

“Tamil Nadu has not agreed to the pass through of the duty. We have moved Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission over the issue. Three other companies have also moved the power regulator,” Mr. Narasimhan said.

He pointed out that the government wants to re-negotiate tariff. “We are ready to accept a tariff of ₹3.33 per unit provided duty pass through and payment guarantee is provided along with extension of date,” Mr. Narasimhan said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-solar-developer-wants-project-completion-date-extended/article31123265.ece

With the districts of Vellore, Tirupattur and Ranipet facing high demand for face masks in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the district administration has asked suppliers to step up supply.

The Vellore district administration has decided to handover the job of manufacturing masks and hand sanitisers to self-help groups (SHGs) and 18 women, who underwent training in making masks during last week.

Vellore Collector Shanmuga Sundaram, after visiting the manufacturing centre in VELMA (Vellore Mahalir) office on Officers Line, Vellore, on Friday, said that since there were reports that the demand for masks had surged in the market, it was decided to entrust the job to women.

They will be producing 9,000 masks a day and 300 bottles of hand sanitisers. The masks and sanitisers will be made available thorough VELMA retail shops and fair price shops.

The masks will be supplied at ₹10 each and sanitisers at ₹120 for a 200 ml bottle, which is much less than their market rates, he said. Issuing a stern warning to those hoarding essential commodities, he said that those found stocking them up for profit would be charged under the law.

Training in tailoring

An organiser said the women had undergone training in tailoring and they had sharpened their skills through the crash course. They are expected to produce around 500 pieces a day, she said.

248,2020/03/21,"The best Tamil ‘comfort films’ to watch, while self-isolating","All we need is some nostalgia, a laugh or two, and a big dollop of feel-good: These classics (some modern, some not so much) are exactly what the doctor prescribed to get through our social-distancing woes

Yes, we are tired too of seeing Friends and Breaking Bad on every recommended binge-watch list to get through days (and possibly weeks) of social distancing and self-isolation to weather the coronavirus scare. With films being our easiest escape from these worrying times, doesn’t it make sense to fall back upon regional movies we have grown up watching, fallen in love with multiple times over, and most importantly, view along with everyone at home?

So what does define a ‘comfort list’ then? It could mean different things for different people: maybe it’s something that takes you back to your high-school memories, or the first time you fell in love with a movie theatre or your favourite star, or heck, even bond with your family... after all, you are stuck with them now.

Without further ado then, here’s our list of ultimate Tamil comfort watches.. sentiment, love, action, family, class and mass all thrown in together for good measure.

Gautam Sunder’s picks:

Kushi

Long before Vijay cared too much about empowering farmers, women, the country, vegetable prices... he cared most about himself and the girl he liked. Ah simpler times, which resulted in one of the the best rom-coms of the 2000s. Kushi had it all: in SJ Suryah, a director hungry for success, two incredibly popular leads who sizzled with chemistry, a smash-hit soundtrack from Thenisai Thendral Deva that complimented the witty repartee in the film, Vivek at the peak of his powers, and the mother of all item songs in Kattipudi Kattipudida which catapulted Mumtaj to magazine front-cover fame. What’s not to love?

PS: The almost fleeting banter/ bromance between Vijayakumar and Vijay in the car is one for the ages.

Padayappa

Nope, we are not going to make this about Rajinikanth at all for a change. Of course you’ve seen the viral Neelambari meme already: she literally invented social distancing —and how! If she could do it for 18 years, we really shouldn’t be complaining about two weeks.

But we digress; like any quintessentially great Superstar offering, Padayappa plays out its winning formulaic tropes in immaculate form — and style — aided by a surprisingly effective supporting cast, led by an outstanding Ramya Krishnan.

After watching it a 100 times over the years, you know every scene by the book, yet it’s as charming, cheerful and comforting as ever. As Abbas says, What a man.. indeed.

Minnale

I was conflicted for the third choice: Vikraman’s masterful Suryavamsam which is the movie equivalent of thaachi mammam (it also gave us the best olive branch dialogue in movie history with Payasam saapdunga friend) vs Gautham Menon’s winsome, almost-before-he-came-of-age debut in Minnale that further heightened Madhavan’s Alaipayuthey stardom towards making him the chocolate boy for an entire generation.

In the end, the latter wins for three reasons: It’s endearing to see GVM’s quirks in a flat-out silly script before he became the master of romance dramas/ redefined cop portrayals; the legendary album by Harris Jayaraj in his debut that inspired nostalgic comparisons with Rahman and Raaja; and finally, Madhavan himself as Aminjikarai Rajesh wooing Reema Sen: I mean, Abbas, go back to fanboying over Rajinikanth’s biceps.

Srivatsan S’s picks:

Kadhalika Neramillai (1964)

What’s there to say/write about Kadhalika Neramillai that has not been said/written already? With two (metrosexual?) men at the centre, CV Sridhar made what could possibly be one of the best urban, madly funny, musical drama Tamil cinema has ever produced. Yes, the plot might seem silly, even dated today. But Kadhalika.. is one of those silly-good movies that was quite self-aware about its absurdness. Will this generation (yes, the ‘90s kids) ever get the greatness of Baliah? Another common factor you’d find in my ‘comfort’ list is Nagesh. His omnipresence shall continue in every listicle I write. At least I owe him this much for his contribution to Tamil comedy. There will be theses written about how to set up a great comedy stretch, like the one with Nagesh and Balaiah’s.

P. S: What great songs by the great MSV? Naalaam Naalaam is my go-to song. What’s yours?

Moondru Deivangal (1971)

Is there a more comforting watch than Moondru Deivangal, the criminally-underrated movie in Sivaji Ganesan’s oeuvre? It had everything in its premise — from Crime and Punishment to Sense and Sensibility. It tracks the lives of three morally-ambiguous characters (Sivaji Ganesan, Nagesh and Muthuraman), who are forced to take refuge in a family, which forms the moral epicentre of the film’s universe. What captivated me when I first watched the film, apart from the maligai kadai track, is the chiffon shirts worn by the characters. It might seem out of fashion now, but I’m assuming it was cool back then. The title, basically, is an allegory on our acting Deivangal — Sivaji, Nagesh and Muthuraman.

Utharavindri Ulle Vaa (1971)

Wasn’t Utharavindri Ulle Vaa far ahead of its time? I’ll tell you why. It’s a movie that escapes from Tamil cinema’s conventions. It’s a movie that doesn’t judge a woman for seeking comfort in a house, filled with (urbane?) men. Of course, the men never miss a chance to flirt with her. Their approach, however, doesn’t come across as intrusive or vulgar, and was handled with great sensitivity. In other words, it was Modern Love. Plus, it had a terrific ensemble starting with thalaivan Ravichandran and Kanchana (I had a massive crush on her, I admit). Let me not get started on Rama Prabha’s phenomenal ‘naadha’ act with Nagesh. Four men take a vacation and sh*t happens. Doesn’t it read like the synopsis of The Hangover directed by Todd Phillips? Utharavindri Ulle Vaa could have been our very own Hangover franchise.

Pradeep Kumar’s picks:

Annaamalai

Sure, the Coronavirus has put us humans on the back foot. It is forcing us to step up to the challenge it poses, and it seems like the virus would want us to prove a point at the end of it all. Who is that one man I could think of, who, when faced with similar odds, rose to the challenge and leapt up high just to prove a point? Who indeed! And cue Deva’s inspired lift off the James Bond theme music... When Rajinikanth thunders: “Assshooook” at Sarath Babu’s character, we know things were about to change. We just didn’t know it would happen over the course of a song.

Soon enough, when a vaccine is developed, it would be us (as Annaamalai) making the Coronavirus (sorry Sarath Babu) get off the chair, and I believe we will have the last laugh at the virus when we say, “Malai da... Annaamalai!” Cue Deva again for added comfort.

Kaathala Kaathala

“Lingam?” “Yes... I’m Ramalingam, he is Sundaralingam” And Nagesh goes: “I’m Chokkalingam”. One of the finest comedies to date in Tamil cinema, Kaathala Kaathala is a laugh riot, and with an absolute riot of a song like Kaasumela Kaasu Vanthu thrown in the mix for good measure. A film which brought to light the underrated actor in the late MS Viswanathan. The ‘Appane Muruga’ gags, the impersonations, an effervescent Vadivelu and some clever dialogues make Kaathala.. the perfect antidote for a gloomy day at home.

Winner

How do you better Kaathala Kaathala? Winner is the answer. The meme king of Tamil cinema, Vadivelu runs away with the film, our hearts and our laughs in this Sundar C film, which is, for all purposes and reasons, less of a film and more a 150 minute comedy marathon. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Vadivelu was the one to introduce the concept of social distancing long before it became a trend forced down on us? Hey Coronavirus! Remember: “Intha kotta thaandi neeyum vara koodathu, naanum vara maaten!”

Srinivasa Ramanujam’s picks:

Panchanthanthiram

This one is right up there in the Kamal Haasan-Crazy Mohan combination series. It tells the story of Ramachandramurthy alias Ram all right, but also gives us a peek into the lives of his four best friends and how they bring the roof down by getting themselves into all sorts of trouble. Along with rib-ticking performances, the film also packs adequate doses of sentiment and songs. Watch out for the funny one-liners...a note of caution though: if you laugh too much for a joke, you will actually miss the next.

So yes, if you want to smile, watch Panchanthanthiram. If you want to laugh, watch Panchanthanthiram. If you want to roll on the floor laughing, watch Panchanthanthiram.

Aanandham

What better to do in these troubled times that to watch a film whose title translates to ‘happiness’?

This Lingusamy-directed flick has every element that you would associate with a ‘rural family subject’: the ones in which a doting family just can’t live without each other. Watch out for that one special sequence in which actor Abbas, away from home, telephones his family... every one, including the household help, must speak to him. With sappy music and emotional sequences, this film will make you long for a similar family — one that’s filled with happiness and smiles.

Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai

Those young fans of Superstar Rajinikanth who are used to his ‘mass moments’ ought to watch this charming-yet-sad 1979 film to celebrate the performer in him. Rajinikanth raises a family with much love and concern, but they all leave him, one by one, in pursuit of opportunities and better lives.

This isn’t a happy film by any stretch of imagination, but the sheer way in which it communicated a point would put many message-drive films of today to shame.

In the end, we are all alone.

The Office has always been one of Netflix’s most-loved shows since it was acquired by the streaming platform, and now it seems like people are turning towards the mockumentary and Michael Scott for reassurance, more than ever before!

As reported by Variety, the former NBC hit is the most-watched ‘acquired’ show on the platform during the week of March 2 to 8, when the news of the coronavirus outbreak started hitting home for viewers worldwide, and social distancing and self-isolation began. A recent Nielsen streaming report, gives more insight into viewer streaming habits, such as stats for original and acquired programs, as well as movies/specials at Netflix.

The report indicates that during the week beginning March 2, The Office garnered over 189,000 viewers during the week, followed by Schitt's Creek, which had 112,000 viewers. Other shows like Good Girls and Parks and Recreation earned over 100,000 viewers as well.

These are the top 10 most-watched acquired shows on Netflix for the week:

1) The Office (US)

2) Schitt’s Creek

3) Good Girls

4) Parks and Recreation

5) Better Call Saul

6) American Horror Story: Apocalypse

7) Outlander

8) The Good Place

9) Lucifer

10) That 70’s Show

Meanwhile, among the most-watched Netflix original shows are The Trials of Gabriel Fernandez, Love Is Blind, and I Am Not Okay With This. The list of movies/ specials that are most streamed include Mark Wahlberg’s Spenser Confidential, The Angry Birds Movie 2 and Pete Davidson: Alive from New York.

However, the bad news for Netflix users is that The Office is leaving the platform at the end of the year to new streaming platform NBC’s Peacock.

Netflix had earlier released a statment to fans that the show was still available until January 2021. “We're sad that NBC has decided to take The Office back for its own streaming platform — but members can binge watch the show to their hearts' content ad-free on Netflix until January 2021.”

250,2020/03/21,Sachin Pilgaonkar’s love for Urdu,"Actor-director Sachin Pilgaonkar reveals how he came to love Urdu

Pehle naam se jis shaksh ki pehchaan ho, unki tarreef bahut lambi hoti hai; Tendulkar to haal hi mein aaya (Hyderabad mein jaisa parson bolte hain) — Pehle ek hi Sachin tha,” exclaims Elahe Hiptoola at Lamakaan as she introduces actor, director and singer Sachin Pilgaonkar.

He was at Lamakaan’s 10th anniversary celebrations and on the occasion, spoke of his love for Urdu and shared many anecdotes from his formative years. He recalled how he overcame problems in Urdu diction because of two people — Meena Kumari and renowned lyricist (late) Majrooh Sultanpuri. He mesmerised the audience with his poems in Urdu.

On the sidelines of the event, the actor recalls his visit to Hyderabad in 1980 to shoot for T Rama Rao’s Judaai but has known about the city because of his blockbuster movie Geeta Gaat Chal that ran for a long time at Ramakrishna Theatre in Abids. “I have many fond memories of Hyderabad; I have nawabi tastes and love Urdu. I do not treat Urdu as a language, it is part of my mind and body,” he says.

Sachin recalls his shoots in Annapurna Studios. “I had the privilege of meeting Akkineni Nageswara Rao ji in his studio. Judaai set was erected at Annapurna Studio.” Sachin decodes his journey and says his ability to adapt and be versatile helped him survive in the entertainment field. “I started my acting career when I was four-and-half. I also got fascinated with direction; Music became a part of my life and I started singing. My command over Urdu was useful as an actor and anchor. I began directing films and also writing.”

With wife Supriya Pilgaonkar and daughter Shriya also in films, Sachin admits it is impossible not to discuss movies at home but they are not obsessed with films. He credits Supriya for imparting values to their daughter. “Supriya’s parents are from the education background — her father was a principal of a college and mother, a retired school teacher. There is a lot of importance of education at home. The kind of upbringing Supriya got from her parents, she has passed it on to our children.”

Calling himself a romantic person, Sachin says he romanticises food also. He plays badminton two hours, five days a week which keeps him fit. “I play with youngsters. Though I cannot match their energy, I try.”

In the interactive two-hour session, a member in the audience wanted to know if he ever failed in life. Presenting a realistic view on stardom and success, Sachin recalled the train journey he had to Kolhapur for an audition but returned disheartened as he was not selected.

Md. Abdul Nayeem, a faculty at IBS, (ICFAI Business School) Hyderabad said, “It was a special session. Seeing Sachin, from a Maharashtrian-Goan background, speak in Urdu and also convince us that if he can do it, we can also do it. It is just a matter of one’s dedication and love for the language undoubtedly.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mz3xif/article31127902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM19SACHIN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-director-sachin-pilgaonkar-reveals-his-love-for-urdu/article31127904.ece
251,2020/03/21,"Rajinikanth urges citizens to participate in Janata curfew, not make same mistakes that Italy did","Actor-politician posted a video message supporting PM Narendra Modi’s request, and asked the public to keep the medical community in mind

Actor-politician Rajinikanth has put out a video message in which he urges citizens across the country to heed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s advise to participate fully in the Janata curfew on Sunday, March 22.

In a video message that he posted on social media, Rajinikanth says, “Right now, India is in the second stage of battling the coronavirus and we can’t let it go to the next level. If we can prevent the spread of the COVD-19 in public spaces for 12 to 14 hours, that itself is enough to stop it from progressing to the third stage.”

“This is why our PM Narendra Modi has advised everyone to stay indoors and practise social distancing all day on March 22. In fact, in Italy, the government asked citizens to follow the same practise, but they didn’t take it seriously. Hence, thousands of lives were lost and we can see how they are suffering due to the pandemic. Let the same not happen in India,” he added.

Rajinikanth also asked people to spare a minute to remember the selfless doctors, nurses and medical workers who are risking their lives on the line to fight the coronavirus. “Let’s praise them, pray for them and their families and support them wholeheartedly by cooperating with the government’s request.”

252,2020/03/21,Reality show ‘Big Brother’ contestants in Germany and Canada informed about coronavirus on live TV,"The housemates have decided to stay on the show, after they found out about the COVD-19 pandemic sweeping the world

Contestants of the German reality show Big Brother were informed about the COVID-19 pandemic on camera during the show.

The contestants entered the Big Brother house over a month ago, and the first cases of COVID-19 were barely being reported from Wuhan in China when they walked in. They had no idea that the disease had acquired pandemic proportions over the past weeks.

At the last count, over 6,000 cases of coronavirus and 13 deaths have been reported in Germany, reports bbc.com.

Some housemates broke into tears when they were shown a video that made them aware of the situation outside. They were then allowed to ask questions to the show’s resident doctor. The housemates also watched video messages from their relatives. One contestant started crying, and worried about her mother who has a lung condition.

The relatives of the contestants tried to lighten up the atmosphere. Some of them joked that the Big Brother contestants were probably in the safest place in Germany right now, and asked if they could bring some toilet rolls back. There has been a shortage of the product in many western countries.

The makers decided to inform the contestants about the pandemic after facing severe criticism from viewers for keeping the 14 men and women locked inside the house in Cologne in the dark. Four contestants who joined the show on March 9 had been told not to talk about the coronavirus.

Standard rules of the game lay down that housemates would be informed about happenings in the outside world only in the case of the death of a close relative or friend, the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported.

However, the broadcasting channel SAT. 1 decided to update the rulebook after “consultation with relatives” of the contestants.

German contestants were not the only ones who were not aware about the crisis.

Contestants of the Canadian Big Brother had been wondering for a while why they weren’t hearing a live audience outside during a recent eviction. While one of the contestants felt the house might be soundproof, they were not aware that live audience had been stopped from attending the show since March 12.

The housemates have since been updated “on the domestic and international status of COVID-19”, and informed that all their family members are doing fine.

The Canadian show’s resident doctor also “determined that no houseguests have exhibited any signs or symptoms related to COVID-19”.

Upon being informed, the housemates have decided to stay on the show.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6sxva3/article31126543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/big,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/reality-show-big-brother-contestants-in-germany-and-canada-informed-about-coronavirus-on-live-tv/article31126544.ece
253,2020/03/21,"There is a trend to put politics over aesthetics, says 'Midsommar' director Ari Aster","The 'Hereditary' and 'Midsommar' filmmaker discusses Hollywood horror’s moment under the sun and its political undertones

In 2018, Ari Aster’s Hereditary both spooked and impressed critics — a rare feat for a debut filmmaker. With the supernatural horror, starring Toni Collete, the 33-year-old American writer-director carved out a space for himself in the already cluttered genre film universe, mostly occupied by big studios and franchises. His second indie feature, Midsommar, a folk horror, took him around the world on a festival run, but the film generated a divided house. Inspired by his own break-up, the film follows a group of ignorant American students who go to a remote Swedish village and are caught in the workings of a bizarre cult. While some applauded the attempt to set a horror in broad daylight, others found it hollow and gimmicky. But irrespective, Aster has enjoyed both critical and audience attention. In an interview with The Hindu in Mumbai, Aster discusses what it means to have Hollywood horror under the festival spotlight and the politics of genre films. Excerpts from an edited interview…

As a genre filmmaker who has received critical accolades, do you see horror films experiencing a revival of sorts at recent film festivals?

It does seem that “elevated horror” is having a moment now. [But] if you go through the last 70 years, you will find exceptions to the rule. Psycho (1960) was an exception to the bad B-horror movie. Even, Rosemary’s Baby (1968), The Exorcist (1973) and Alien (1979). It is still happening now, where people react with shock [when] a horror film [is] made artfully. There’s arguably a thin, but a clear line, between horror movies that are made cynically — these franchise horror films, which you can tell are made by a committee — and films that are coming from a more personal place. There’s a long tradition of both these kind of horror films, so for me it’s a new point in the same cycle. But there are a lot of really wonderful films coming out in the genre space today.

What do you think has triggered the appreciation of horror and genre films at festivals?

The Exorcist and Rosemary’s Baby were nominated for a bunch of Oscars. The Shinning was nominated for a bunch of [Golden] Raspberry Awards, and now people don’t agree with that assessment either. It’s all kinda silly to me. Ultimately, genre films are art and of course, some aren’t. I don’t think art is an elastic term. It seems like [horror films] are being taken more seriously now than they used to be. It seems [that] there are a large number of exceptional horror movies being made now.

But in the end, David Cronenberg started in the late 70s and worked in the 80s and 90s. He’s another example of what people are saying is happening right now, so it’s not a bubble. It’s an urge people have to put things in bubbles.

Thrills and chills: A still from Hereditary; (below) director Ari Aster.

What’s also interesting is that a lot of contemporary horror films have political undertones, for instance, Jordon Peele’s movies. How do you view this trend, where horror films in America are becoming allegorical and not just about jump scares?

You have film like Get Out (2017), which is more satire than horror, and it’s great satire but it’s obviously drawn from the school of Ira Levin [American novelist and playwright], and people like him. But movies and TV in general, not just the horror genre, is becoming extremely political, which I think in some ways is extremely exciting and in some ways, it can be a handicap. Because there is a trend in some corners to put politics over aesthetics, so what makes a film like Get Out so exciting that it feels sincere. You have the aesthetic, brilliantly made socio-political satire, that is not like a product of strategy but it is coming from an authentic place, which makes a film like that more valuable than maybe others. I also feel that it’s a trend to survey a bunch of films coming out at a time and say that this is a movement. Ultimately most filmmakers, or the ones that I like, are in their own little bubbles, making what they want to make and reacting to the world around them, rather than films being made by a committee and to answer the call of one agenda or another.

Speaking of the politics of Midsommar -- the film is folk horror, but there’s been a long-standing criticism of the sub-genre as exoticising a certain culture. How did you ensure not to exoticise or appear as ignorant Americans, like the characters in your film?

Firstly, by engaging with the culture, doing a lot of research and working closely with the Swedes who are on my team. We had a Swedish production designer, producer and a lot of Swedish actors. Ultimately, exoticising them is sort of the point, and it’s part of the comedy of the film. It’s hard to say that we were doggedly avoiding one thing and pursuing another. It’s a matter of instinct, and trying to let any sort of political correctness get in the way of telling the story in the right way.

But also trying to be politically minded and layering the film with political ideas and nods to certain things in Sweden’s history. Where to be serious and where to be cheeky? That was the question.

So where does the politics of Midsommar lie?

I’m going to be cryptic and say that there are things in Sweden’s recent history that are suggested in the film.

They are a little bit overt in the director’s cut and hopefully, the film gets some things that are inherent in Swedish culture that is by turns funny, charming, disturbing, strange and at the same time, the film takes a lot of liberties. I’ve heard from the Swedes who have seen the film, [that] they find it very funny and that for me is the best outcome. Of course, some not everyone is happy and they can't be. But ultimately, it is a dark comedy.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/h6todl/article31126387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ari-Aster,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/there-is-a-trend-to-put-politics-over-aesthetics-says-midsommar-director-ari-aster/article31126390.ece
254,2020/03/21,‘Maa Bhoomi’ memories: Telugu actor Saichand completes 40 years in the industry,"One of the first progressive outings in Telugu, the 1979 film also introduced Saichand to the industry

He made a mark with his debut starrer, Maa Bhoomi a movie that defied conventional norms till then existent in Telugu cinema and, with its huge box office success paved the way for the genre of progressive movies. After a successful stint in that genre for close to 15 years, Tripuraneni Saichand opted out voluntarily from facing the arc lights to wield the megaphone for short films tracing the history of Telugu cinema. Twenty five years hence he had returned to acting with a pivotal role in Fida and played a significant cameo in Syra Narasimha Reddy, with his signature hallmark — the son of the soil.

It is celebration time for Saichand as he completes 40 years of acting this March 23. Mention this to him, he says in all humility, “No sir... Maa Bhoomi completes 40 years of its release.” Saichand reminisce his experiences during the making of Maa Bhoomi.

“G Ravindranath and B Narasinga Rao founded Chaitanya Chitra International and at the suggestion of Mrinal Sen, signed Goutam Ghosh to direct Maa Bhoomi, based on Krishan Chander’s Urdu novel Jab Khet Jage (translated into Telugu as Jaithra Yathra). Ravindranath’s brother Narayana Rao who had played the lead in Oka Oori Katha was their natural choice for the protagonist’s role.

A miracle

“Quite unexpectedly one day B Narasinga Rao sent word for me to come and meet him at their office. It was also my first meeting with Goutam Ghosh. While I was talking to Narsinga Rao, he kept on observing me from various angles. Then he and Narsinga Rao held discussions in another room. After a while, Goutam Ghosh asked me to remove my shirt. I was aghast and looked at Narsinga Rao. He smiled and said, “do as he said, I will tell you the reason later.” Still looking baffled, I removed my shirt, wondering why. Goutam Ghosh and Narsinga Rao were closeted once again. Emerged after a few minutes Ghosh smiled and said, ‘you are my hero.” I couldn’t understand a wee bit what he was saying. Then Narsinga Rao explained to me that Narayana Rao who had gone to Karlovy Vary Film Festival as part of Oka Oori Katha unit lost his passport and his return was delayed. Since they cannot afford to postpone the shooting, they were on the lookout for another actor and decided on me. I was in a dilemma. I just turned 22. I was unsure whether I can pull off such a strong character. Narsinga Rao assured me, ‘”believe in yourself, the rest we will take care.” It all happened like a miracle.

The first shot

“Since the story is set in 1940s, we needed a remote village without electric poles. Mangalaparthi in Medak district was chosen as the location. Goutam Ghosh asked me whether I smoke cigarettes. When I replied in the negative, he told me to learn to smoke beedi as the character requires it but also advised me not to make it a habit.

The first shot taken on me was as I walk with the heroine (Hansa Warnekar), I meet the newly married couple Ramulu (Yadagiri) and his wife (Samudrala Rajeswari). As soon as I saw Ramulu I have to run towards him. After the shot was over, Goutam Ghosh shouted ‘fantastic.’ However, after finishing the scene, Ghosh said ‘let’s do the first shot one more time.’ Then I understood that the first shot has not come out well but he complimented me to instil confidence in me.”

Dirty clothes

I was given used, smelly and dirty clothes to wear. I was wondering whether one needs to wear such clothes for realism’s sake. Later, Goutam Ghosh’s wife and the movie’s costume designer Nilanjana Ghosh told me since the costumes were not ready they have to borrow clothes from a local and assured me that my costumes will be ready in a couple of days.

Memorable scene

“From an oppressed rustic, Ramaiah rises to become a leader of the oppressed class. One night he visits his father (Kakarala). Worrying about his son, the father says, “Yemora Ramaiah... appudappudu nee sangati naaku bayamouthaadi. Naa okkagaanokka koduku. Aa nalugurunnaaru okadu pothe yemaithadi anukunenduku lekapaaye”(Ramaiah, at times I am worried about you. You are my only son, there is no way for me to think that I have four sons and what if, if one of them is gone). And I reply: “Prajala kosam paatubade daani kanna manchi bathukemuntadayya” (what better life is there than to work for the good of the people). It was shot in a tiny hut and I still wonder how cinematographer Kamal Nayak had done such amazing lighting in that small dwelling. After the scene was over, Goutam Ghosh’s assistant Munna ran towards me and said “you have performed like a seasoned actor, not a debutant.” Then I realised that Ramaiah has entered into me.

And the best compliment I cherish was the one from Narsinga Rao. After we shot the factory scene in Hyderabad, he told me, “With this movie, you will earn the name that your grandfather (Tripuraneni Ramaswamy) and father (Tripuraneni Gopichand) have earned.” Narsinga Rao and Pran Rao wrote the dialogues which were a live force for the movie.

“Maa Bhoomi was released on March 23, 1980 and created a historic box office success. I am proud to be part of that history.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/t2mfwm/article31126054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf20saichand-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/as-saichand-completes-40-years-in-the-industry-he-reminisces-the-making-of-maa-bhoomi/article31126055.ece
255,2020/03/21,Character artiste Jayaprakash Reddy’s dream Telugu film project,"The actor's ‘Alexander’ is ready and he’s waiting for the right platform to take it to the audience

Character artiste Jayaprakash Reddy aka JP Reddy held a screening of the film Alexander a few days ago to a select few and he hopes it gets appreciated. JP Reddy has made this stage play popular by portraying the central character. He says he is aware that since there are no commercial elements and no hero or heroine to sell it, it might find place in the digital media if not a theatre. It has him play a retired major who establishes a helpline on his name ‘Alexander Helpline’ and counsels people who are in problems and suggests solutions to them.

The play Alexander, written by the late Poosala, has been staged 66 times times in the Telugu states. The writer believed the content will help future generations. It has been directed by Davala Satyam.

The movie takes place in a penthouse. We see Alexander living alone, waking up and wearing his military dress and singing the National Anthem and saluting the flag on his terrace every day. He loves his drink as much as he loves cutting vegetables and cooking them. He is mostly on the phone and the conversations with various people gives us an insight into their problems. Alexander has people from various walks of life, of all ages calling him and discussing their issues and he has an instant solution. They call him again later to tell him that his suggestions worked and they are thankful to him.

There is a hitch here, the people who JP speaks to are only heard and those who watch Telugu cinema can immediately guess who these people are. Sadly none of their voices match the age of the characters they play and the intensity with which they speak is very shallow. For instance, a couple who are in their 20s, about to kill themselves on a railway track, call him and ask him for a solution which seems highly improbable and incredulous. The voices belong to popular comedians who have worked with him in many of the films and have obliged to be a part of it. Some of them have passed away years back which obviously means the film had taken time to come this far and has stripped the content of its emotion.

These days too, we do have helplines for people with suicidal tendencies and help is offered in terms of advice and a patient listening. Here too in retirement, JP as Alexander encourages people to treat life like a battlefield and not give up. The concept is good but perhaps a new director with fresh thoughts might have dealt it differently. The high drama in the climax notwithstanding, the advice to the people in need is nice and sensible.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/h1n9at/article31126010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JP-Reddy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jayaprakash-reddys-dream-telugu-film-project-alexander/article31126011.ece
256,2020/03/21,"Netflix announces $100 million coronavirus relief fund, to help workers in the creative community","Chief content officer Ted Sarandos releases statement, adding that company was working with industry organisations to bolster relief efforts in Europe, Latin America and Asia

Streaming giant Netflix has come up with a $100 million relief fund that will be used to support members of the entertainment and creative community, who are struggling for employment in the wake of all television and film productions shut down due to the impact of the COVD-19.

Beyond helping workers on Netflix’s own productions, the company also wants to support the broader film and television industry, stated Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos.

“The COVID-19 crisis is devastating for many industries, including the creative community. Almost all television and film production has now ceased globally — leaving hundreds of thousands of crew and cast without jobs. These include electricians, carpenters and drivers, many of whom are paid hourly wages and work on a project-to-project basis. This community has supported Netflix through the good times, and we want to help them through these hard times, especially while governments are still figuring out what economic support they will provide,” he said, in a statement.

With the entertainment industry at a standstill across countries, jobs are hard to come by, especially for daily-wage earners. The Producers Guild of India had announced earlier in the week that it would be setting up a relief fund for daily-wage earners most affected by the shutdown of film, television and over-the-top productions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most of the fund will go towards support for the hardest-hit workers on Netflix’s own productions around the world. “We’re in the process of working out exactly what this means, production by production. This is in addition to the two weeks pay we’ve already committed to the crew and cast on productions we were forced to suspend last week,” continues Sarandos.

“$15 million of the fund will go to third parties and non-profits providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast in the countries where we have a large production base,” he added.

Of that, the company will donate $1 million each to the SAG-AFTRA COVID-19 Disaster Fund, the Motion Picture & Television Fund, and the Actors Fund Emergency Assistance in the U.S., as well as $1 million between the AFC and Fondation des Artistes. Sarandos also said that Netflix was working closely with industry organisations to bolster relief efforts in Europe, Latin America and Asia, where they have a big production presence. The details of donations to groups in other countries will be announced next week.

“What’s happening is unprecedented. We are only as strong as the people we work with and Netflix is fortunate to be able to help those hardest hit in our industry through this challenging time,” Sarandos concluded.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7ifqrt/article31123753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TELEVISION-BINGE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflix-announces-100-million-coronavirus-relief-fund-to-help-workers-in-the-creative-community/article31123754.ece

Railway sources told The Hindu that the couple had booked their tickets only on Saturday morning through current reservation. They boarded the train at Secunderabad Junction at 7.50 a.m.

260,2020/03/21,First case of local transmission of COVID-19 in TS,"Two more COVID-19 cases confirmed; total touches 21

The local transmission of coronavirus has started in Telangana. A 35-year-old man, a close contact of a COVID-19 patient was confirmed positive for the virus on Saturday. The close contact does not have any travel history to foreign country. This is the first such case in the State. Senior officials from the State Health department who said it is a case of local transmission, have also stressed in the same breath the importance of social distancing to contain spread of the virus.

While 19 cases were reported till Friday, two new cases were reported on Saturday. The 20th patient (P20) is the 35-year-old man and 21st patient (P21) is a 33-year-old man works on a cruiser. He came from Dubai.

The 20th patient is son and close contact of P14 (age over 60 years) who travelled from Dubai to Hyderabad on March 14. On developing symptoms on March 17, he was isolated and tested positive for coronavirus on March 18. His close contacts, including his family members, driver and maid were identified. Of them, his son tested positive on Saturday. The test results of the other close contacts are awaited.

Close contacts are those who were at a distance of less than two metres from the patient or family members who spent hours or days with the patient under same roof.

“P14 has a travel history to Dubai, but P20 does not have any travel history. Yet, he tested positive. Technically, we can call it local transmission. Our teams are already on the job to contain further spread of the disease in that particular locality, or where he travelled,” Dr Rao said. Primary contacts of P20 are also being traced.

As part of further containment, the residence of the P14 will be termed as epicentre. All households, schools, health facilities, government offices within a km radius of the epicentre will be identified. During the fever or COVID-19 surveillance, entire area will be closed with the help of police, GHMC and others. Health department staff will take a questionnaire to each home to find if anyone has symptoms such as cold, cough, fever, difficulty in breathing, body pains.

“At the end of the day, we will analyse and do risk assessment. If anyone has symptoms, they will be sent to designated hospital for evaluation or testing. We will also find if any of them came in contact with P14 or P20 as there is no other local transmission in that area,” Dr Rao said.

Asked what precautions people of the locality can take, Dr Rao said that social distancing is a precaution that should be followed not only by people in the locality, but in entire Telangana .",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/first-case-of-local-transmission-of-covid-19-in-telangana/article31130964.ece

262,2020/03/21,KCR calls for 24-hour curfew in Telangana,"CM urges people to bring State to a standstill

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has given a call urging people to bring life to a standstill on Sunday when the nation-wide Janata Curfew will be observed in the fight against coronavirus as the State government had decided to make the curfew a success.

Though the curfew to see that people did not take to roads was scheduled from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. at the national level, Telangana will be one step ahead implementing the same from 6 a.m on Sunday to 6 a.m. on Monday, he said at a press conference here.

“There will be 100% closure of buses by the State government. It was already decided at the national level that all metro rail services will be withdrawn”, he said and advised people to observe self-restraint and not come out on roads. They will be sent back if they did not heed.

He appealed for closure of shops, malls and all commercial establishments voluntarily. However, essential services like milk, vegetables, drinking water, power, petrol bunks and ambulances will be spared from the curfew.

He asked people to express solidarity with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who gave the call for the programme as many countries which did not take such steps against coronavirus suffered. It was unfortunate that some people made fun of the initiative of Mr. Modi on social media and asked Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy who was present to take action on them.

Mr. Rao also urged people to come out of their homes at 5 p.m. and clap their hands as advised by Mr. Modi. Sirens will be sounded in all neighbourhoods at the stroke of 5p.m for this purpose.

If needed, he warned that the State government will resort to total shut down in future in a bid to confine people to their homes for safety from coronavirus. The government will deliver essentials at the doorsteps .

He asked people above 60 years of age and children below 10 years not to come out of houses for two to three weeks.

264,2020/03/21,HC sets aside suspension of NIT students,"Two NRI students told to do social service

Setting aside suspension for one whole academic year (2019-20) of two NRI first-year B.Tech. students of National Institute of Technology-Warangal , Telanagana High Court ordered that the two students found possessing ganja should do social service during weekends for two months.

Justice T. Vinod Kumar of the HC, who delivered judgment in two writ petitions filed by the students challenging the ‘one-year suspension’ awarded by the NIT-Warangal senate, modified the suspension ‘to the end of first semester’. Observing that the punishment was being modified “in order to bring about reformation among the students”, the judge said there was no change in aspects of the punishment.

Ganja was seized from the possession of the students staying in the college hostel on October 26, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the two students appeared before a disciplinary committee admitting to their guilt. A week later, the committee suspended them from college for one year and barred them from appearing for first-year exam along with a penalty of ₹ 1 lakh each.

The judge opined that institutions like NIT should adopt a long-term rehabilitative and retributive approach towards students falling prey to drug abuse. The two students were in their teens and would emerge skilled professionals if moulded in the right path, the verdict said.

The judgement said the contentions of the students that the punishment was biased and vitiated proceedings cannot be accepted as they had already admitted to their guilt and there was evidence against them. However, the findings of the disciplinary committee were contradictory. On one hand it said that one student expressed regret and sought forgiveness and on the other it also recorded that he didn’t show any remorse, the verdict said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-sets-aside-suspension-of-nit-students/article31129922.ece
265,2020/03/21,Konappa begins his 14-day home quarantine,"Kagaznagar MLA had violated norms by mingling with public after return from the USA

Legislator of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) representing Sirpur constituency Koneru Konappa, who was supposed to undergo home quarantine for 14 days, has begun the isolated sojourn at his Kagaznagar town residence on Friday itself.

Though he was not seen even by his supporters, he is said to be spending time in his residence along with his wife Rama Devi after failing to observe the COVID-19 protocol for two days.

Mr. Konappa and his wife Rama Devi had landed at Shamshabad airport in Hyderabad from the USA where they are reported to have given a self-declaration assuring the authorities to stay in home quarantine. They later travelled in Telangana Express train to their residence in Kagaznagar town of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district on March 18 and started meeting and mixing with locals the same day on which they arrived.

The MLA and his spouse were received by a handful of followers at the railway station around 10.30 a.m. according to sources. Mr. Konappa later attended the Kagaznagar Municipal Council meeting after which he attended a Satyanarayana vratam function at Gangapur temple in Rebbena mandal in the same district before retiring for the day.

On March 19, the MLA attended the wedding of the daughter of his supporter at Balaji Ankoda village in Chintalamanepalli village. During all his interactions at these events he came in contact with several people from his constituency and others related to him politically.

Meanwhile, he went out of public gaze on Thursday afternoon as the social media went into a tizzy on his contravening the COVID-19 protocol laid down by the government itself and officials started calling him to stay away from public. On Friday, District Collector Sandeep Kumar Jha asked the District Medical and Health Officer Kumram Balu to take necessary steps to give the couple, and others who came into contact with them, a medical check up followed with sending them into home quarantine for 14 days.

A team was formed to serve a letter, which carried details of COVID-19 protocol, on the MLA which could not be delivered as he was not available at his residence. On Saturday, the letter was handed over to his brother Krishna who claimed that Mr. Konappa was asleep.

It is not known if Ms. Rama Devi is at home observing the quarantine or she has accompanied him to wherever he is believed to have gone. Meanwhile officials are tightlipped over further action that can be initiated against the MLA.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/qzgnua/article31130374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22KONAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/konappa-begins-quarantine/article31129787.ece

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that over 700 persons were suspected to be having symptoms of COVID-19 in Telangana and 21 others had tested positive for coronavirus infection.

Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Mr. Rao said the spread of coronavirus in the State was solely by foreign returnees. Over 20,000 people had arrived at Hyderabad airport or elsewhere in the country and travelled to different destinations in Telangana since March 1. About 1,500 persons landed at Hyderabad airport on Friday but it was not possible to track down people coming into the State by other routes.

The surveillance teams formed by State government had traced 11,000 persons and were under the care of State health department for 14 days. Of them, about 700 plus were suspected to be having symptoms and 21 persons who tested positive were all foreign returnees.

As many as 5,274 surveillance teams were formed to track down suspected cases. A close watch was maintained on people coming from abroad, he said and appealed to them to volunteer to furnish their travel history to local authorities. They will not be locked up in hospitals but teams will visit them every day in the morning and evening to check up their status.

There was no way they could escape the widespread network of surveillance teams as established by one person who was nabbed at Alair and another at Kazipet while trying to give a slip to officials.

Mr. Rao assured that the government will bear the entire expenditure of their treatment, food and other facilities if people with cough, cold, respiratory problems and fever reported to the teams. More than 1,000 beds were kept ready to provide them isolation facility. As many as 63,000 people were deployed by government to fight the disease. There were 52 check posts on inter-State borders and 78 joint teams of various departments.

A five member expert team will work under the supervision of Health Minister, Chief Minister’s Office, Chief Secretary and Director General of Police to study national and international developments on the virus.

Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar has advised religious leaders to shut down all places of worship for at least two weeks in Karimnagar town to avoid the spread of COVID-19.

At a meeting with religious leaders on Friday, the Minister asked them to ensure that people perform prayers at their houses only. Reminding them that eight Indonesians, who visited the town, had tested positive, he said that the authorities were in the process of identifying all those who took part in prayers conducted by the Indonesian preachers at various mosques in Karimnagar and then screening them for medical tests.

They were also screening residents around the mosques. Stating that there was every possibility of a spurt in cases in the town, he appealed to people to confine themselves in their houses and not move around.

At another meeting with municipal corporators, he asked them to make sure that people who had returned from foreign countries from March 1 onwards undergo tests for COVID-19. He said that out of a total of 371 persons, who had returned from foreign countries, 79 are from Karimnagar town.

Mayor Y. Sunil Rao, Municipal Commissioner Valluru Kranthi and others were also present.

283,2020/03/21,Godavari water reaches Kotchaguttapally outskirts,"Oustees yet to vacate the village

Gaddam Narasaiah is in late 60s.

He prepared food for himself and is serving himself as there is no one to look after him.

His house already is in dilapidated condition. This is one of the several houses in the village that would submerge in Godavari waters that would reach here in a few days. Everyone in the village know this and they were informed a few weeks ago that they have to vacate the village as Annapurna reservoir, located on the border of both Sircilla and Siddipet districts, is being filled with Godavari water from Kaleshwaram.

Water was already released to Annapurna reservoir from Mid-Manair on March 11 and it was hardly 100 meters away from the houses on Friday.

Almost six months ago, some of the oustees were handed over keys at Lingareddypally, part of Siddipet town.

The 130 numbered housing colony was constructed on about 14 acres and Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, instrumental in convincing the villagers to sell lands and houses for the construction of Annapurna reservoir, participated in the house warming ceremony. About 80 families performed house warming ceremony and some of them are yet to shift to the new colony.

About 40 families from the village have approached the High Court seeking justice under the Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act – 2013 (LA Act – 2013). Their case is still pending in court.

“We feel that we were denied payment of right compensation and hence approached the court. We are confident that we will get justice. We have also not taken double bedroom houses,” A Yella Reddy, U Tirupati Reddy and E Malla Reddy, outees of the village, told The Hindu.

“Some of the villager are yet to get full compensation amount and they are not ready to vacate the village. They fear that officials may not take care of them once they leave the village,” Ch. Kartik Reddy, president of the village, told The Hindu adding that several promises made to the villagers were not fulfilled and it was not possible to convince the villagers to vacate the villagers till they were met.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4jcefn/article31122601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21SIDDIPET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/godavari-water-reaches-kotchaguttapally-outskirts/article31122602.ece
284,2020/03/21,"Kashmir’s sacred architecture combines Hindu, Buddhist and Islamic influences","The 14th century, in particular, is considered a watershed in Kashmir’s history, when different traditions of art and architecture came together

Talking of Kashmir, everyone heaps praise on its postcard-worthy scenery, its houseboats and apple trees, but not much is known about its syncretic traditions of sacred architecture. The region has long been a melting pot of cultural practices that include Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam. The 14th century, in particular, is considered a watershed in Kashmir’s history, when different traditions of art and architecture came together — this can be seen, for example, in the ubiquitous pagoda-style construction of mosques such as Khanqah-i-Maulla (Great Khanqah) or Madin Sahab.

A recent exhibition in New Delhi, put together by M. Saleem Beg, convener of INTACH’s J&K chapter and the former director-general of J&K’s Department of Tourism, tried to bring out these aspects. The khanqah, for instance, is one of the best examples of traditional Kashmiri wooden architectural forms. INTACH literature describes it as being made entirely of solid wooden blocks used as headers and stretchers with brick infill. The central space on the ground floor of this 14th-century shrine has a double-height hall with a series of seven small cloisters on both sides, meant for spiritual retreats.

The layout resembles a Buddhist chaitya hall, while the ceiling of the central chamber is supported by four wooden columns — also seen in the temples of medieval Kashmir. The whole structure is surmounted by a multi-tiered pyramidal roof with an open square pavilion (brangh) in the centre. The brangh is crowned by a spire, formally establishing the continuity of the Hindu and Buddhist building traditions. This architectural style can be seen in all the Sufi/ Reshi shrines that dot Kashmir’s cultural landscape.

Unique features

Or take the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar. While it was originally built in 1402, the mosque was damaged by fires in 1479, 1620 and 1674. The mosque, says INTACH, does not visually “resemble any of the great mosques of the larger Islamic world”. This is because the domes have been replaced by multi-tiered pyramidal roofs with a central pavilion and spire, a uniquely Kashmiri addition.

The mausoleum-shrine complex of Shaikh Hamza Makhdum, who was a leading Suharwardi saint of Kashmir during the 16th century, is considered a unique combination of vernacular design with Mughal elements. It was commissioned during the reign of Akbar in 1600 and was renovated in 1703. The shrine incorporates building techniques like taq and ornamental devices like naqashi, and the main chamber is surmounted by a three-tiered pyramidal roof. However, in a clear Mughal borrowing, the roof is topped by a chhatri surmounted by a small open wooden dome. .

Former professor of history Narayani Gupta points out that art and architecture are expression of human creativity, and as such a creative enterprise. “Classifications such as Hindu architecture, Rajput architecture and Muslim architecture do not exist,” she says.

History of amalgamation

Beg talks of how the three-decade-long conflict in Kashmir has overshadowed everything else about the region, including its culture, heritage, art and architecture. Beg points to Kashmir’s long heritage of syncretic architecture that uses amalgamation and assimilation.

Beg stresses the need to build on these traditions and practices so that the essence of this rich cultural past can be retained. “The continuity of the built form by each successive faith has been a way of appropriating the sacred space,” he says. And this provides a historical narrative away from textual readings, and preserves the unique identity of Kashmir.

Beg also underlines the need to look at geography, and oral and literary traditions beyond the political contestations, and refers to the Sanskrit texts Nilamata Purana and Rajatarangini, in which Kashmir is imagined as a sacred space created by divine intervention. As he points out, this philosophical setting was carried forward in Persian by Muslim historians and poets in historical texts and literary works, in which they continued the idea of the Valley’s sacredness by describing the land as jannat (paradise) on earth. Which is what Amir Khusrau recalled when he famously wrote: Gar firdaus bar roo-e zameen ast, hameen ast-o, hameen ast-o, hameen ast. (If there is a paradise on earth, it is here, it is here, it is here.)

285,2020/03/21,‘We’re suffering because rich people brought virus with them’,"Daily wagers, weavers, traders worst-hit as pandemic keeps customers away, want govt. to provide relief

The clientele at Montu Nag’s stationery and tea shop in Guwahati’s Ulubari area began thinning when social distancing became the buzzword a week ago.

He sold three cups of tea by noon on Saturday. The total sale on Friday was ₹134 while people, driven by panic to stock up essentials, crowded the shop of the adjoining grocer.

“We are suffering because rich people who went abroad brought the virus with them. They should be made to pay for our loss of business. This situation is as good as being ordered not to trade,” Mr. Nag said.

For Santosh Kumar from Bihar’s Madhubani, things were never so bad in the last 10 years, not even during the three days of shutdown due to violent protests against the CAA in December 2019. The owner of his rickshaw, Lucky Ali, spared him the daily rent of ₹80 during those three days.

He hopes for a similar relief because there is hardly anyone to ride his rickshaw although he sanitises it with a liquid antiseptic.“First came the battery-operated three-wheelers, then the agitation and now this dangerous disease. I earned only ₹20 from one passenger against an average ₹300 by noon on normal days. I hope I can make at least ₹80 to pay the maalik (owner),” said the rickshaw-puller.

No travelling

Ajay Thakur thought of going home to eastern Assam’s Sarupathar after the government ordered all barber shops shut on March 15. But his folks advised him to stay put as travelling could be risky.

“No one will feed us if we don’t work. I have started visiting the houses of some clients but there’s a huge difference in providing the service to many at one place,” he said, adding that his income has fallen by 70%.

Labu Pator of Bonda near Guwahati has switched over from selling chicken to fish. “Chicken prices halved because of the fear that meat increases the possibility of catching the virus,” he said.

Fish retailer Ganesh Gupta said there’s hardly anything to sell. “The wholesalers have cut down imports and the local fish, available more in the countryside, are too costly for the few buyers who come,” he said.

Businesses suffer

Bigger businesses have suffered too. “Things are coming to a standstill. We might be able to pay the employees for a month from our reserves. But if the situation does not improve, we might have to request them to forego their salaries until we are back in shape, since money has to be set aside for bank loan repayment and provident fund,” said Bhaskar Dutta Baruah, who runs a book store and a resort.

Few have had it worse than Assam’s weavers and silk traders whom the COVID-19 crisis has struck during peak sale season ahead of Bohag or Rongali Bihu. “We received the first blow when raw yarn from China stopped coming after the Wuhan outbreak. Now the buyers have vanished. We may take a year to recover,” said Nihar Ranjan Kalita, secretary of a weavers’ association. He admitted that the “issue is bigger than business”, but said the government should come up with a package for weavers – and workers in other sectors too – like France has done to absorb the impact on the local economy.

Some like Mehboob Hussain, a construction worker engaged in a drainage project, prefer the quietness around. “What is the guarantee that we will not die at home in Dhubri? We cannot afford to miss a day’s work and with the streets almost empty, we can work in peace and with less fear of contamination,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/r9y23w/article31132072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22RICHMAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/were-suffering-because-rich-people-brought-virus-with-them/article31132073.ece

287,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Mumbai records 8 cases in single day,"Maharashtra tally stands at 64

The possibility of much-dreaded community transmission of the novel coronavirus in Maharashtra cannot be ruled out as health officials grapple with one case without any international travel history or link to high-risk contacts of patients.

On Saturday, Mumbai recorded the highest number of eight cases in a single day of which six have a history of international travel. The two other patients include a staff of Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport and a man who had travelled to Gujarat.

Of the two new cases recorded in Pune, a 41-year-old woman has no travel history or link with any contacts of positive patients. The number of patients who have tested positive in Maharashtra now stands at 64.

Dr. Anup Yadav who heads the State’s Directorate of Health Services told The Hindu that the history of contacts of the Mumbai man who had travelled to Gujarat and the Pune woman is still being probed. “There could be a possibility that one of these cases is of community transmission but we will only ascertain the same after the patients recall every possible movement. We are still in the process of establishing the linkages,” said Dr. Yadav. “As of now, we have not found any direct link of the Pune woman with a positive patient or a high-risk contact of a patient,” he said.

Health officials said that an in-depth epidemiological investigation was being carried out.

Meanwhile, Mumbai’s deputy executive health officer Dr. Daksha Shah said that they are still refraining from terming the Gujarat man as a case of community transmission. “There is no reason to panic so far. We had an expert coming down from Delhi who has also assured that we have not entered the community transmission stage so far,” said Dr. Shah adding that the patient with Gujarat travel history tested positive on Saturday afternoon and doctors were still in the process of probing his history thoroughly. Among the other patients who tested positive was one person from Yavatmal who had a travel history to Congo. While the patient has been admitted in Mumbai, he had been counted as a case from Yavatmal.

The campaign, called Combat COVID-19, is aimed at teaching the dos and don’ts to the poorer sections of society through wall graffiti and hamlets workshops. It is being conducted by health minders — youth aged between 15 and 25 — who are drawn from the communities.

“The youth first did an extensive study on the virus to understand its symptoms and precautionary measures and how it’s affecting the world at large. They conducted sessions with homemakers sharing the information,” Mili Roy, director (communications) of Prayasam, told The Hindu.

“Now they are painting graffiti at strategic walls of their own communities with messages related to precautionary measures, the dos and don’ts and breaking myths and misinformation,” she said.

The woman, presently on ventilator support at the city’s Bharti Hospital, tested positive for COVID-19 after her throat swabs were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) to check for the possibility of H1N1 (swine flu) infection, said an official.

“Although she tested positive for COVID-19, she does not have a history of travel abroad. It appears that she had travelled to Vashi (in Navi Mumbai) to attend a wedding on March 3. It is possible that she came into contact with a person with a history of foreign travel,” said Pune District Collector Naval Kishore Ram, informing that details of the woman’s cab journey to Mumbai are being investigated.

This is perhaps the first case in the district with no history of foreign travel to test positive, as the persons who tested positive in other cases had either travelled abroad or had infected their kin or fellow travellers.

Remarking that there were separate guidelines to deal with such cases, he said the woman’s case had been referred to higher authorities for further probe. The second case in the city to test positive is that of a 25-year-old youth who had recently travelled to England and Ireland.

Officials of the State’s Education Departments said the step was taken after an assessment that the pandemic-dictated shutdown could lead to children dropping out of school. Learning gaps also needed to be plugged, they said.

The department has asked the teachers to either extend the phone-based academic support from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. or from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.

“The Education Department has felt that the closure period of schools may create learning gaps among children and there may be possibility of dropout of children from schools...

Following the government’s order of odd-even formula for public transport system in urban areas to reduce movement of passengers, roads are wearing a deserted look. District administrations have also started to adopt odd-even formula to discourage people to come out.

Moreover, all shops except vegetables, groceries, meat, chicken and fish-vending outlets have been asked to remain shut. People employed in hotels, small businesses and construction sectors have no other option but to return to villages.

“Without any job, it will be hard to sustain oneself in the towns. Moreover, eateries are closed. The daily commuters to offices and other business establishment cannot do their normal work if they don’t get any food,” said Nikunj Moharana, who is employed in a printing press at Mancheswar Industrial Estate in the city.

“Although hiring a private taxi for travelling back to village is expensive, people prefer it in order to avoid ‘risky’ public transport. We don’t know if public vehicles are sanitised properly,” said Prabodh Rout, who, along with his family, left for Jagatsinghpur on Saturday.

In another attempt to enforce social distancing, the government has cancelled all official meetings except regarding COVID-19. Secretaries can opt for video-conferencing facilities for conducting essential meetings. All official functions including commemorations and garlanding of statues are suspended until further orders.

The government has decided to pay advance three months of pre-matric stipend to 5.5 lakh Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students staying in different hostels and hand them over to their parents. These hotels will remain closed between March 25 and June 15.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-people-in-odisha-move-out-of-urban-areas-after-govt-order-against-public-gatherings/article31126318.ece

304,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Arunachal VIPs may be named and shamed for evading screening,"VIPs and senior officials in Arunachal Pradesh could be named and shamed on social media, if they evade screening at checkpoints for the COVID-19 pandemic.

Arunachal Pradesh, unscathed by the virus, has temporarily banned the entry of outsiders. But geography often forces its inhabitants to travel from one part of the frontier State to the other through Assam, where some 80,000 people have undergone screening for suspected infection, while 41 are in isolation wards.

According to police officials in Arunachal Pradesh, many VIPs and senior officers have not stopped their cars or convoys for voluntary screening by medical teams stationed at highway checkpoints on the border with Assam.

“We have directed police teams at checkgates to take photos of such VIPs and senior officers who do not cooperate with the police or medical teams and escape scanning or screening. The photos will be uploaded on social media,” said Tumme Amo, Superintendent of Police of the Capital Complex, comprising Itanagar and Nagarlagun towns 13 km apart.

Health officials in Arunachal Pradesh said more than 32,600 people had been screened at the four entry points to Itanagar. None of them was found to have unusually high body temperature.

Forcible quarantine

A 130-year-old law enacted to tackle bubonic plague in the erstwhile Bombay state has inspired the Mizoram government to come up with the Mizoram Epidemic (COVID-19) Regulations, 2020. It facilitates the use of force to quarantine and isolate people.

Home Minister R. Lalthangliana said it was necessary to invoke the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to minimise the risk the pandemic poses. He said 156 people who returned from abroad had been put under home quarantine, though they did not show any symptom.

The Mizoram police have said 42 entry points along the State’s international and inter-State borders have been closed, while 15 people, most of them women, have been arrested for spreading fake news on social media.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ooyte1/article31123986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THERMALSCREENING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-arunachal-vips-may-be-named-and-shamed-for-evading-screening/article31123987.ece
305,2020/03/21,"More homeguards to be recruited to discourage assembly, says Ajit Pawar","Appeals to all to show collective responsibility, stay indoors and curtail travel

The next 15 days would be extremely crucial in tackling the spread of the nove coronaviru (COVID-19) pandemic, said Deputy Chief Minister and Pune Guardian Minister Ajit Pawar and added that more Home Guards would be recruited to discourage assembly across Pune district where the number of positive cases rose to 21 on Friday.

Despite Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announcing near-lockdown measures for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur, dense crowds were witnessed at the Pune railway station as well as the Swargate bus stop, with several anxious groups of students and migrant labourers scrambling to rush back to their hometowns in ‘lesser’ afflicted districts.

Mr. Pawar warned that if this trend of crowding continued, the government and the district administration would have no option but to restrict bus and train services only for those personnel engaged in dispensing essential services.

“Admittedly, large numbers of people are still found at the Swargate bus stop and the Pune Railway station. These crowds comprise of students whose anxious parents are recalling them back to their home towns given that the district has registered 21 positive cases or migrant labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh trying to get home. I appeal to people not to panic and fulfil their collective responsibility by staying indoors and curtailing travel,” he said.

Mr. Pawar said if traffic was not dramatically reduced in the coming days the authorities would be compelled to consider plying only smaller buses to ferry personnel engaged in providing essential services in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.

“We are keeping a modicum of bus services in Pune to service the class of cleaners, electricity board staff and others who are providing public services. I again urge people not to crowd near bus stations and indulge in travel when it is not really required. Do not panic, but remember at the same time that this is no holiday,” Mr. Pawar said.

He said the State government was well-equipped to deal with the pandemic and there was no pressing need as yet to seek funds from the Centre.

He called for humane behaviour to be shown to daily wage labourers and urged employers not to cut their salaries.

“The State government would also be making arrangements to provide essential goods for daily wage earners at nominal prices to ease the burden on them in this hour of crisis,” Mr. Pawar said.

The Guardian Minister reassured people in the State’s rural hinterland that adequate facilities were provided for them in the event of the spread of the virus in rural parts of Maharashtra.

Mr. Pawar also urged private companies, and IT firms, to adhere to the directives of the District Collector and permit as many employees as possible to work from home.

Meanwhile, the Pune Market Yard at Gultekdi, the city’s largest market for vegetables and fruits will remain shut for the next three days. in a bid to check the spread of the virus and avoid large congregations of people.

“This will not lead to increase in vegetable prices. The Yard will resume functioning on Monday, March 23 as usual,” said Babasaheb Bhebhane, an agricultural produce dealer.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/88vmpt/article31123903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMAJITPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/more-homeguards-to-be-recruited-to-discourage-assembly-says-ajit-pawar/article31123904.ece
306,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Maharashtra takes lead to put fliers from U.S. on home quarantine list,"Complete contact tracing led to better understanding of the spread from this cluster, says NHM commissioner

In its fight against COVID-19, Maharashtra is the only affected State to have included passengers arriving from the United States on its home quarantine list. The government of India list, updated multiple times since the exercise began on January 17, has listed 22 countries on the current list before a week-long curfew on international flights comes its force on March 22.

The U.S. was put on the Mumbai airport’s Airport Health Organisation (APHO) list after Health Minister Rajesh Tope issued instructions following his visit to the airport, where staff are grappling with multiple directives, also being frequently updated, from State, Centre, APHO etc. This would also essentially mean that direct passengers from the U.S. landing anywhere other than Mumbai are not being quarantined. Besides, Mumbai and Bengaluru. other airports are yet to introduce a hand stamping system for those who have been asked to be in home quarantine.

In a late night development, the Union Health Ministry on Friday decided to expand universal screening for all passengers coming from the United States, U.K. and Australia. “They will be either quarantined or isolated depending on their risk profile,” the Ministry said in a tweet.

On Friday, the number of patients who tested positive in the State rose to 53, who included two foreigners and 49 Indians.

Dr. Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner, National Health Mission, said it was after the health department did a complete contract tracing of all the 40 people who had been on a Dubai trip, which in fact led to an understanding of the spread from this cluster. This in-turn prompted the State to request the Centre to include the UAE and U.S. in the list of countries under surveillance.

In his press conference, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said he had told the Centre about the need to extend the home quarantine to those arriving from the U.S. and Dubai, as the virus had made it to Maharashtra through these two points initially. Dubai was later included in the list for making a 14-day home quarantine mandatory for even those passengers who used the airport to transit. This list also includes the entire UAE, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait.

Other countries on the list are Iran, Italy, Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Spain, France, Afghanistan and Philippines. Flights from European Union, United Kingdom and Turkey have been temporarily prohibited.

Agreeing that a common list for the entire country would be the best thing to fight COVID-19, Mr. Tope said the government has been requesting the authorities to thoroughly check travel itineraries of people arriving from international flights to Mumbai for the past one full month. “This check is very important since people have already arrived in the country. We have also observed a trend of some people diverting their travel to a country which is not listed by the Union government and included the U.S. and the European Union, which has since been prohibited to operate flights to India. The flight curfew next week will ease things,” Mr. Tope said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/iw3zv5/article31123886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMEMPTYAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-takes-lead-to-put-fliers-from-us-on-home-quarantine-list/article31123887.ece
307,2020/03/21,"Coronavirus | Stop panic buying, reserve food stocks will last seven months: Bhujbal","Maharashtra government has already provided grain stocks for April and May to fair price shops, says Food Minister

Maharashtra’s food security is not under threat with reserve stocks lasting up to seven months, senior officials said on Friday, hours after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced a lockdown of the State.

Senior Home Department officials put in place an emergency plan, including meeting large traders and wholesale sellers in markets in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. At any given time, the government is prepared to provide two months’ grain stocks to fair price shops, while the reserves can last up to seven months if the lockdown persists, said officials who participated in a meeting to discuss possibilities of hoarding and black marketing in the wake of the coronavirus-related lockdown.

“We are prepared at all levels and have already provided stocks in advance for April and May to fair price shops. In order to curb the spread of coronavirus, which could also infect the beneficiaries of the public distribution system (PDS), we have directed shopkeepers to not carry out the beneficiaries’ biometric verification,” said Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, Chhagan Bhujbal.

Senior Home Department officials said the police was directed to search large godowns and ensure no hoarding was carried out in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Several godowns were searched for the possibility of stockpiles.

“We searched two such facilities today and found nothing suspicious. We are closely monitoring all the vehicles moving in and out of markets as part of the preventive measures,” according to the Inspector General of Police (Konkan Range) Niket Kaushik.

Senior officials of the state Food and Civil Supplies Department said advisories have been issued orders to warn people against indulging in panic buying.

“The PDS facility is being made available on e-POS equipment for the period of the shutdown. This will not require the beneficiaries to put a finger or thumb on the e-POS equipment. There is no need to rush to shops to buy for now. We have goods that will last for the next seven months,” said a government official.

Until then, the official said, the government was “not taking into account a scenario where we may have to enforce the Essential Commodities Act against the traders found hoarding.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8kw7sy/article31123835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMPUNEVEGETABLEMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/stop-panic-buying-reserve-food-stocks-will-last-seven-months-bhujbal/article31123836.ece
308,2020/03/21,Uddhav Thackeray orders complete lockdown till March 31,"Staff in government offices cut to 25%; banks, chemists, shops selling essentials will be exempt

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday said that all shops, private establishments and offices from Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nagpur will be closed from midnight till March 31, with the exception of banks, essential services and shops selling essential commodities.

Mr. Thackeray also announced reduction in the number of government employees attending offices from the existing 50% to 25%.

In an address to the people of the State through social media, Mr. Thackeray said local trains and buses in Mumbai cannot be stopped amidst the deadly coronavirus pandemic as lower-income groups and those working in the health and other important sectors use them for travel. “The crowd on road and in trains has reduced considerably. But if does not reduce further then we will have to shut down public transport,” he said.

The establishments which will remain open include banks, and shops selling medicines, food items, milk, and vegetables. “Apart from banks, stock exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, stock brokers and SEBI registered participants operating through these institutions will be exempted,” said Mr. Thackeray, adding that the financial institutions need to run to ensure citizens do not face financial difficulties in this hour of need. He appealed to the owners of shops and private offices to not stop the daily wages of labourers. “Don’t forget humanity in these times,” Mr. Thackeray.

The Chief Minister said, “The next 15 days are extremely crucial. If work from home is not possible for private companies then it is better to shut down the offices for the time being. District collectors have been given full responsibilities to enact strict measures.”

Mr .Thackeray informed of the patients who have tested positive in the State five have recovered but will remain in isolation for the next 14 days.

309,2020/03/21,Eight-year-old female leopard rescued in Shirur,"Joint team of Wildlife SOS, forest officers bring her safely to Junnar

An adult leopard, which had caused a panic among local residents, was rescued by the Maharashtra Forest Department and Wildlife SOS from a farmhouse in Shirur in Pune district on Thursday.

The leopard was spotted earlier in the week in Apati Gaon in Shirur wandering outside a farmhouse located next to a sugarcane field. This was immediately reported to the Forest Department and Junnar-based NGO Wildlife SOS who were requested to deploy a rapid response unit at the location to avert a human-wildlife conflict situation.

A press release from Wildlife SOS said that its five-member team accompanied by forest officers and the police rushed to the location with safety nets, restraining equipment and a trap cage. Since operations of this level can be quite nerve-wracking, the team had to exercise caution while approaching the large and powerful feline. A more careful approach was used by using a food bait to lure it into a trap cage.

The rescue team with safety net, restraining equipment and trap cage at Apati Gaon in Shirur.

The rescue mission lasted several hours after which the leopard was carefully transported to the Manikdoh Leopard Rescue Centre in Junnar. The facility provides a transit home for leopards in peril or caught in conflict situations and currently houses over 30 leopards who cannot be released back into the wild. The leopard has been identified as an eight-year-old female, and is under temporary observation by Wildlife SOS veterinarians.

Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, said, “We are keeping the leopard under close observation while she recuperates from this stressful experience. The area surrounding Shirur and Junnar is right in the middle of leopard territory as the large swathes of sugarcane fields provide ideal hiding grounds for the big cat. During the harvest season, conflict situations tend to escalate as the leopards get displaced from their sheltered homes.”

Mahendra Dhore, Wildlife SOS veterinary assistant, said that rescue operations involving leopards can be dangerous and need careful planning to ensure the safety of the animal and the people. “It is crucial that we spread awareness among the public on issues of conflict mitigation, sensitise people and encourage them to be more tolerant of wild animals,” Mr. Dhore said.

Manohar Ramdev Mhasekar, RFO, Shirur, said that awareness boards had been put up across villages. They have a team of 25 trained officers on standby to respond to such situations. The Indian leopard (Panthera pardus fusca) is a Schedule I species, protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and is listed as ‘Vulnerable’ under the IUCN Red Data List.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1wur6s/article31123744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BM-female-Leopard,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/eight-year-old-female-leopard-rescued-in-shirur/article31123745.ece
310,2020/03/21,"Chaos at Mumbai railway stations as people leave for North, East","Daily-wage workers, students, educational institute staffers head back home as city shuts down

Daily-wage labourers, students and staff at the city’s educational institutions are making a beeline for the first train home, with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announcing the closure of all non-essential workplaces in Mumbai, Pune, Pimpri Chinchwad and Nagpur from March 20 to March 31.

Railway stations in the city, as a result, witnessed an unprecedented rush. Most of the passengers are boarding trains headed for the North and East.

Daily-wage labourers said with the city under lockdown, their economic prospects looked bleak. Nitika Chaari and her husband Pradeep, an autorikshaw driver in Kandivali, were among the hundreds who boarded the LTT-Agra Lashkar Express. “My husband has been struggling to get passengers for the past three to four days, and the income has reduced. We decided to leave for my brother’s place in Morena, Madhya Pradesh, so that he can earn something there. We will return to Mumbai once the situation improves,” she said.Central Railway on Friday rolled out 12 special long-distance trains from Mumbai and Pune to various destinations such as Patna and Danapur in Bihar, Howrah in West Bengal, Gorakhpur and Manduadih in Uttar Pradesh, and even Balharshah in Maharashtra.

“There has been a sudden surge of passengers from Mumbai and Pune to destinations in the East and North in the wake of COVID-19. We are monitoring the situation closely and will add more trains if the situation demands it,” said Shivaji Sutar, Chief Public Relations Officer, CR.

At Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Bakul Kumar and his brother Devesh, both fish sellers, were among those travelling in eight unreserved compartments of the special train to Howrah. “Much of our catch went waste as no one was buying. We went to the extent of selling it to passengers in local trains. We are going to Kharagpur with the hope of getting a job to sustain our families,” Mr. Kumar said.

The special trains have a high proportion of unreserved and sleeper class compartments. Railway officials, however, said air conditioned coaches had few takers and many of reserved compartments were running empty.

Since March 17, CR has cancelled nearly 59 long distance and passenger trains across its five divisions as most were running with under 20% occupancy.

Apart from the daily wage labourers, students and staff from various educational institutions were also returning home. Nitin Jo Verghese, who works at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, said the institute had asked everyone leave as all the departments, including the canteen, had temporarily closed.

Many students said the increase in the number of cases had their parents worried, and they were promptly asked to return home.

Swati Narayan, a Ranchi-based researcher, said there was chaos on Friday morning at Dadar as the Howrah-bound Gitanjali Express arrived. “There was a large crowd when the train arrived with people practically jumping into every coach possible. There were nearly 50 to 100 people trying to get through each door. As a result of the rush, I couldn’t get in,” she said.

Ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar, which is due in October-November this year, cracks in the mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) appeared imminent as alliance partner Congress on Friday said it was not in favour of the domicile policy advocated by the Rashtriya Janata Dal of 90% reservation for the local youths in State government jobs and educational institutions.

“The Congress is not in favour of the domicile policy of the RJD to give 90% reservation for the State’s youth in government jobs. If it’s done here, the other States will do the same and discrimination will happen with the youths from Bihar there… giving jobs to local youths in the State could be a priority but not a policy,” senior State Congress leader and party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said on Friday.

Not feasible: RLSP

Under the mahagathbandhan in Bihar, the Congress is a major alliance partner of the RJD along with other parties. Similarly, the other ally, Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) leader Madhav Anand, too said the proposed domicile policy of the RJD would not be feasible.

Earlier, during his ongoing Berojagari hatao, Bihar bachao (Remove unemployment, save Bihar) yatra across the State, Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly Tejaswhi Yadav had been reiterating at every public meetings that if his party was voted to power in the upcoming Assembly elections “it will implement the domicile policy by giving 90% reservation to local youths in government jobs and educational institutions”.

The NDA leaders, meanwhile, have termed Mr. Tejashwi Yadav domicile policy plan as a “political gimmick” in view of the upcoming Assembly polls.

‘Election stunt’

“All this domicile policy declaration is nothing but an election stunt by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav… do you think it is possible and feasible in a federal set-up of the country… what will happen if other States too start following this?... where would youths from Bihar go?”, asked State BJP leader Nawal Kishore Yadav.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cong-not-to-support-ally-rjds-domicile-policy/article31123444.ece

Lucknow has so far reported eight positive cases.

Meanwhile, the administration's order triggered panic buying in some parts of the city, even as traders said they were reporting falling business over the last few days due to the outbreak of the disease.

Many vendors expressed anxiety and said they were planning to return to their native villages as they expected business to be hit.

Raj Kishor Dwivedi, who runs a vegetarian restaurant in the prominent Lalbagh area, said he had purchased a mask for himself as well as his nine staff members. “If this doesn't stop soon, the way it is spreading, it will take a big form,” said a worried Mr. Dwivedi.

His sales have been halved over the past week, he said.

316,2020/03/21,Display of wisdom through Kuchipudi,"Hari Priya Pranesh’s ability to tap into the deeper layers of human emotion got her much appreciation

Artistic maturity isn’t an aspect often bound by age, but it’s a rather accepted notion that real-life experiences go a long way in enriching a dancer’s understanding of sahitya in the form one chooses. The 14-year-old Rajahmundry-based Kuchipudi dancer Hari Priya Pranesh proved one could be wiser beyond their years in channelising their innermost layers of emotion and devotion in a recent performance organised at Bhageerathi Gana Sabha in Hyderabad. Making the most of her abhinaya and dazzling nritta, the brief performance showed the vulnerability and sensitivity an artiste ought to have to reach the hearts of the audiences. Not a soul in the mini hall was left unmoved by her four-piece act on a weekend morning.

The disciple of Chinta Ravi Balakrishna opened her performance with the Ganesha stuti in Vasantha ragam, written by Dandibhotla Vaikunta Narayana Murthy. Sans any element of exaggeration, while also not losing the essence of the bhakti rasa, Hari Priya made good use of the number’s rich descriptions to portray the salient features of the elephant-headed God. The key element behind the strong impact of the performance was her ability to make the piece her own with a deep sense of involvement.

Shifting between the roles of Yashoda and Krishna through Krishna Nee Begane, Hari Priya effortlessly portrayed the selflessness of motherhood, where she efficiently used the stage space to explore a series of swift yet delicate movements. She set the tone for the piece with a sloka from the Sri Krishna Karnamritam and took the piece forward with expressive body language, bringing to life the anxiety of the protagonist to find the apple of her eye. Hari Priya’s hint of exaggeration was visible and yet effective in her portrayal of Yashoda while her depiction of Krishna was more instinctive and free-flowing.

Offering a riveting twist to Narayana Theertha’s Jaya Jaya Durge in Shanmukhapriya ragam, it was only natural that the outpour of divinity and rhythm in the vocals gave more impetus to Hari Priya’s performance. The metaphoric comparisons of the various features of Goddess Durga with the motifs of nature brought out Hari Priya’s pleasing sanchari-bhava. The piece also included the customary brass plate-dance, which she had performed with greater joy. She gave the climactic segment of the tarangam a definitive flourish while highlighting the ferociousness of the Goddess.

A Namdev abhang, Bhakta Jana Vatsale, was her final item and one that had the crowd in raptures for the sheer spiritual joy it provided. There was a sense of liberation in her performance owing to the fast-paced nature of the composition. The lack of inhibition certainly helped her in expressing the sincere devotion of the poet with alacrity, especially while ending the item with repeated chants of ‘Panduranga’ that the audiences enthusiastically clapped to. The lokadharmi aspect in her recital brought a larger appeal to the event and one was surely left wanting for more.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/d3563g/article31125774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf20dancejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/kuchipudi-dancer-hari-priya-praneshs-ability-to-tap-into-the-deeper-layers-of-human-emotion-got-her-much-appreciation/article31125775.ece

320,2020/03/21,Industry demands financial support,"K.V. Srinivasan, chairman of Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council, said, in a press statement, that spread of COVID-19 had disrupted the cotton yarn sector.

With trade and industry feeling the impact of COVID-19 spread, the industrial associations here have appealed to the Union and State governments for financial support and exemption from taxes.

K.V. Srinivasan, chairman of Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council, said, in a press statement, that spread of COVID-19 had disrupted the cotton yarn sector.

“Exports of cotton yarn that had shown signs of some revival in January have virtually collapsed as not only the importers, but leading garment producers and retailers in India are also deferring or cancelling orders,” he said. A large inventory of unsold stock is thus building up leading to curtailment of production. Companies are running out of funds to pay wages and government dues and service bank loans. Mr. Srinivasan appealed to the government to instruct banks to provide access to funds at concessional rate of interest and to extend statutory deadlines for payments by six months. He also sought interest subvention scheme for cotton yarn. Apparel Export Promotion Council chairman A. Sakthivel said major buyers and brands in the US and the EU were postponing orders and shipments and there was uncertainty in the market.

Hence, the validity for unused entitled value under export promotion schemes should be extended by another six months.

In an effort to mitigate the working capital crisis, there should be temporary relaxation of lending norms and extension of credit repayment periods.

Federation of Indian Export Organisations, Southern Region, sought immediate payment of ITC and IGST refunds, payment of ESI should be deferred for three months, and banks should facilitate faster clearance of credit applications.

According to the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, the small and medium-scale enterprises are affected badly and are reeling under cash crunch. Hence, the government should revoke GST fines and penalties for 2017-18 and beyond. Taxes, especially Property Tax, should be waived for the second half of this financial year. The local bodies should not collect Professional Tax from the businesses.

The Dyers Association of Tirupur said, in a press release, that the units were seeing drop in fabric sent for processing and those who did job works were not getting the payments on time. Hence, the banks should extend six months moratorium to repay loans and there should not be classification of accounts as non-performing assets till March next year.

The Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association demanded extension of time to repay GST amount and bank loans. The government should not levy penalties on small and micro pumpset manufacturers who were unable to pay GST on time, according to Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association.

The Kongunadu Makkal Desiya Katchi said the government should ensure that exporting units get 25 % increase in working capital and should provide relaxations in mandatory payments as the exporters face delay in getting the payments for their shipments.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/7ziqry/article29471935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA21KMDK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/industry-demands-financial-support/article31131424.ece
321,2020/03/21,Corporation’s tax collection down by 50%,"Majority of the tax payers visit its 47 tax collection centres to pay by cash or card. With widespread awareness of COVID-19 and the need to maintain social distancing, the number of visitors is few and far between.

The impact of COVID-19 on Coimbatore Corporation’s tax collection appears significant in the last few days as money flowing into the coffers has come down.

Senior Corporation officials indicate that the impact has almost halved the money the Corporation receives from property tax during this time of the year – towards the closure of the financial year. From about ₹ 1 crore a day it has come down to around ₹ 50 lakh. The Corporation’s tax demand for the current financial year is a little over ₹ 160 crore and its collection stands at around 85%.

Majority of the tax payers visit its 47 tax collection centres to pay by cash or card. With widespread awareness of COVID-19 and the need to maintain social distancing, the number of visitors is few and far between.

A few of the centres have seen fewer than five visitors in the last two days, says an officer.

Another reason for the dip in collection is the Corporation restricting its bill collectors from collecting tax at door steps using the newly launched hand-held devices. The civic body has also asked its bill collectors to go slow as a step towards following social distancing, officials say.

Since launching the machines, the Corporation has collected over ₹ 60 lakh.

The officials say that on Sunday, the Corporation will shut down its tax collection centres due ‘Janata Curfew’. During this time of the year, the Corporation keeps its centres open on Saturdays and Sundays to boost collection.

At the centres, though, it is a different story. The Corporation that has been advocating washing hands and other precautionary measures has not placed hand sanitisers at many centres. A few centres stand out as an exception, though. But they are initiatives at the local level by sanitary inspectors or zonal sanitary officers.

Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath says at present the civic body is not much concerned about tax collection but towards fighting the spread of COVID-19 and encouraging people to maintain social distancing.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hp6jqy/article31088110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB17PARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporations-tax-collection-down-by-50/article31131099.ece

Non-essential traffic into and out of the Nilgiris has almost completely been stopped from Friday, with vehicles from neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka being turned away at border check-posts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 into the district.

Officials said that all non-essential vehicles, including tourists are being turned away. From Friday, all Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation buses too were stopped from entering the Nilgiris, while TNSTC buses had stopped plying to Kerala and Karnataka from Wednesday onwards.

Ban on poultry items

Vegetable loads and supplies from neighbouring States were still being allowed into the district through the check-posts, though the ban on poultry items was still in force due to reported cases of bird flu in Kerala and Karnataka. Due to the closure of the check-posts, many students as well as tourists trying to leave the Nilgiris were affected, with their journeys being delayed before police stepped in and allowed them to leave the district.

A few vehicles from neighbouring states were also being allowed inside as the parents of students studying in residential schools in the Nilgiris were travelling to the district to pick up their children.

The district administration was also in talks with neighbouring districts of Wayanad, Malappuram and Chamarajanagar to stop all traffic into the Nilgiris on Sunday during the ‘Janata curfew’.

Innocent Divya, also said that Pandalur taluk has a very high number of residents who travel to Kerala for daily wage work in the estates there. “Similarly, people from Kerala also travel to Pandalur for daily wage work,” said Ms. Divya, adding that teams have been formed to go door-to-door and check on the health of local residents living in the taluk.

“A health camp is also being conducted in the taluk, to check if anyone in the region is exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection,” said Ms. Divya, adding that health camps will be held regularly starting from Friday to ensure that no new infections go undetected.

“As most of the people who live in Pandalur are daily wage workers, whose livelihood depend on finding work in the neighbouring estates in the Nilgiris and in Kerala, we have not imposed a ban on people travelling for work, but have issued an advisory to avoid travelling to Kerala as much as possible,” said the Collector.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/the-nilgiris-closes-border-check-posts-with-kerala-and-karnataka/article31122694.ece

332,2020/03/21,Tiruppur knitwear exporters suffer loss as buyers defer orders,"Goods worth ₹2,500 crore are exported from the district every month

Garments worth ₹5,000 crore shipped by exporters in Tiruppur are stranded in the seas or ports as these have not been lifted by the buyers in the US, Canada, and the EU.

Raja Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, told The Hindu on Friday that buyers in the western countries are not encouraging new shipments. With complete shutdown in several western countries, exporters are receiving information from the buyers of either cancelling or deferring orders. The goods already shipped have to be at the port as there are no clearances and warehouses are closed down in these countries because of the spread of COVID-19. For the garments shipped in January and February, the exporters will receive the payment in March.

Approximately, goods worth ₹2,500 crore are exported from Tiruppur every month.

“Goods worth ₹5,000 crore are stranded and garments worth another ₹2,500 crore are with the exporters. We need to wait and see what the situation will be next month,” he said.

In the domestic market too, retail sales have dropped and local brands have adopted a wait and watch approach. So, manufacturers in Tiruppur supplying to the domestic market are also hit. Their payments will get delayed too.

“The Government should come to the aid of the exporters with immediate announcements. It should advise banks not to insist on repayments for some time,” he said.

At a joint meeting of all the industrial associations held in Tiruppur, it was decided to continue production to the extent possible.

“But, we have limitations. What we are facing now is unfortunate and unforeseen. So, the Government should act immediately,” he reiterated.

340,2020/03/21,Restaurants in Krishnagiri see a steep decline in footfall,"Food production and occupancy in hotels take a hit

“If I can talk to you during the lunch hour, supposedly the busiest time of the day, you can very well see the state of our business,” says Krishnamoorthy of RKV Annapurna Residency, a premier dining and lodging hotel in Krishnagiri town.

For a small town with very few recreational avenues, and fewer eat-outs, COVID-19 has dropped the hammer on the hotel and restaurant business.

A favourite spot for the locals and a stopover for those heading for Bengaluru, RKV Residency has seen a fall in business by 70%. The restaurant also cut down its food production progressively. From a cut to 75 per cent of its usual production on Tuesday, it dropped to 50% on Friday.

First, the bookings for the reception hall were cancelled once a cap on the number of guests was put at the behest of the district administration as a safety measure. Soon, the bookings got cancelled on their own, says Mr. Krishnamoorthy, whose 55-room hotel has less than 10 rooms occupied now.

The restaurant sterilised all vessels in hot water to ensure safety and gave day off for sick staff. However, the customers have stopped eating out completely, he says.

Satish Kumar, the manager of Hotel Mangalam, a premier restaurant for non-vegetarian fare, says he has not seen such a grim slowdown ever since he got into food business.

Mangalam has seen a steep 60 % decline in footfall, and is reducing food production. “Soon, we will have to cut down staff strength, since there are no customers, says Mr. Kumar.

The impact of GST and demonetisation pales in comparison with that of COVID-19, he says. “There was no fall in footfall then, people kept coming. But this is a totally different blow altogether,” he says.

Now, with the hotels associations sending out a circular asking all restaurants to shut down in the wake of the Prime Minister’s call for “People’s curfew” on March 22, it is going to be another day of loss. “There is no point keeping the hotel open, when people are going to stay indoors,” says Mr. Krishnamoorthy.

Orders through food aggregators have also fallen. Home delivery orders have dropped by half for RKV Residency, which has tied up with Swiggy March-April usually sees good business due to school vacation.

Mr. Kejriwal said that free ration would be provided to 72 lakh beneficiaries in addition to government arrangements for free food at night shelters across the city.

Speaking at his first “digital-only” press conference, Mr. Kejriwal appealed to people to practice social distancing.

The AAP government, he said, had not imposed a lockdown in Delhi for now but would have to do so if the need arose in the future. He announced that the number of people allowed at social, religious and cultural gatherings have been brought down to five from 20.

""The Delhi government is taking all possible measures to tackle coronavirus in close coordination and cooperation with the Central government and the people of Delhi. The city has witnessed 26 corona cases to date, along with one unfortunate death,” he said.

The restrictions that have been imposed in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, he said, are causing a financial burden on the poor and daily wage labourers.

""We have decided to provide 7.5 kg free ration to 72 lakh beneficiaries attached to our ration scheme for one month. Earlier, wheat was available at ₹2/kg, rice at ₹3/kg and sugar at ₹13/kg,” he said.

The Delhi government, he said, has also decided to double the pension under the widow pension scheme for 2.5 lakh beneficiaries, old-age pension scheme for 5 lakh beneficiaries, and disability pension scheme for 1 lakh beneficiaries. The beneficiaries will get the respective pension amount for March and April by April 7, he said.

""We hope that all these measures will bring a little relief to these people and their families. In addition to this, we are also arranging free lunch and dinner facilities in 220 night shelters for every person,"" he said.

Mr. Kejriwal also announced that 50% of government-run buses would not ply on Sunday in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a ‘janata curfew’.

A passer-by recorded her video as well and shared with us,” said a senior police officer, adding that her medical exam also stated that no sexual assault had taken place.

353,2020/03/21,Delhi budget session curtailed to one day due to COVID-19 outbreak,"The budget will be tabled and passed by the House tomorrow

The upcoming five-day Budget session of the Delhi Legislative Assembly, has been truncated to one day in the wake of a the outbreak of COVID-19.

The Hindu had on Saturday morning, first reported the possibility of the truncation of the Session, scheduled to begin, and now also to conclude, on Monday.

A decision to this effect, Delhi Legislative Assembly Speaker Ram Niwas Goel had told The Hindu, rested on the Delhi government.

Economic Survey

According to the List of Business issued by the Delhi Assembly on Saturday evening, the Budget will now be tabled by Finance Minister Manish Sisodia, and passed, by the Delhi Assembly on Monday. Mr. Sisodia is scheduled to table the Economic Survey and the Outcome Budget before the Annual Budget.

Scheduled from March 23 to 28, according to sources privy to developments in this regard, it was gradually decided to shorten the session to a “maximum of two and a minimum of one day(s)” instead of five, as initially scheduled.

In addition to prohibiting social, religious and political gatherings of more than 20 individuals, the Delhi government has also directed employees engaged in “non-essential” services to work from home or go on leave. This number was reduced to five at a press conference on Saturday evening.

“Gatherings of more than 20 people have been prohibited by the Delhi government. The Delhi Assembly has 70 members and needs at least one-third of that number, that is 24 MLAs, for a sitting,” a source had said.

Staff at half strength

“The duration of the session may be brought down to one or two days from five... half of the total staff is currently at work, given the government’s directions to practise social distancing to contain the possible spread of COVID-19,” another source had said.

When asked for comment, the Speaker had said, “The Assembly has made provisions for the five-day session as per schedule. Any change regarding this is the prerogative of the Delhi government.”

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, however, termed the move “wrongful” and against the established legislative norms.

“Is the Parliament not functioning despite the COVID-19 epidemic? First the non-provision of a Question Hour in the five-day session and now just a one-day session? This is just wrongful on multiple levels,” Mr. Bidhuri alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-budget-session-curtailed-to-one-day-due-to-covid-19-outbreak/article31131890.ece

356,2020/03/21,Will protest NPR from balconies: rights group,"‘Centre should focus on fighting virus’

Civil society group United Against Hate on Saturday urged people to protest against the National Register of Citizens, the National Population Register and the amended citizenship law during the ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday, from their balconies, windows and gates.

On Sunday, when people will thank healthcare providers and emergency responders, many in the national capital will clap, ring bells, and raise slogans from their homes demanding that the government rescind its decision to update the NPR in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“First, we will thank our sisters and brothers who are at ground zero taking care of the infected, supplying essentials... and then, we will hold anti-NRC, anti-CAA placards in our balconies and windows and demand the government to roll back its decision to start the NPR exercise from April 1,” Nadeem Khan from United Against Hate said.

Mr. Khan said the government’s priority should be countering the virus threat and “we are all in this together”.

He said, “While the PM has urged people to remain inside their homes from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday, we urge him to rehabilitate people who have lost their homes in the riots in North-East Delhi and are putting up in relief camps”.

Irkan Chaudhary, who will also be a part of the protest, complained that around 1,200 people who lost their homes in the riots have been living in unhygienic conditions at a shelter in Mustafabad.

“The Prime Minister has asked people to remain inside their homes. What about those whose houses have been burnt and looted? They have no option but to live in cramped, unhygienic relief camps where social distancing goes for a toss and the risk of infection is high,” he said.

357,2020/03/21,Long queues outside grocery stores ahead of ‘janata curfew’,"Fearing further lockdowns due to COVID-19 outbreak, people stock up essentials

Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘janata curfew’, people across the city said they were stocking up on essentials due to uncertainty over further lockdowns in the Capital amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

Soon after the PM’s announcement on Thursday, people lined up outside supermarkets and local grocery stores to ensure they have enough “basic essentials” at home “before the shops run out of stock”.

Geetika Sengupta, a south Delhi resident, working in the private sector, said: “The Kendriya Bhandar was like a fish market. People were buying five-six bags of wheat, and groceries to last for at least three months. Looking at the huge stream of people and the high demand, even I stocked up on essentials that will last for around a week.”

Tempers running high

Bhavya D.N., a resident of Vasundhra Enclave who works in the public health sector, said: “Tempers are running high in markets with residents scrambling to stock up on non-perishable goods... grocers are working overtime to meet the demand. The other day, one shopkeeper snapped at a customer asked him to be patient.”

For Green Park resident Surveen Chopra, the need to “hoard” was slightly different. “I have three dogs and I regularly give them rotis as part of their diet. Now, with people panicking, I too had to hoard on flour, not as much for me but for my pets. We, as humans, can still vary our diet but what about our pets?” said Ms. Chopra.

Even as authorities maintain and continue to assure people that ration and essential items are available in the market, some people said that rumours of “stocks running out” were making the public go into a panic.

Sushila Kumari, a resident of Madanpur Khadar, said: “People are saying that markets will soon shutdown and we will not be able to buy basic items like rice and wheat. We are a huge family, we have stocked up enough food to last us 10 days.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ei5pjh/article31131756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21DELPRIYAPANICBUYING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/long-queues-outside-grocery-stores-ahead-of-janata-curfew/article31131758.ece

New Delhi: In his first ‘digital’ press conference held in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday reduced the number of people allowed to assemble in the national capital to five, down from 20.

Noting that the problems being faced by the poor due to the COVID-19 are immense, he also increased the amount of ration from the earlier 4 kg to 7.5 kg, as well as waived off the nominal rate of ₹2 per kg. “There are 72 lakh people who get ration... this will be free now,” he said.

Kejriwal was flanked by Deputy CM Manish Sisodia and Health Minister Satyendar Jain at about a 1 metre distance from each other.

He said the government has also decided to double the pension benefits of widows and the economically backward to help alleviate some effect of the coronavirus epidemic. For the poor who sleep on the streets, lunch and dinner will be provided at the night shelters. “We have also decided to do away with the GST charge that those seeking to quarantine themselves at hotels need to pay,” he said.

Kejriwal reiterated his appeal to senior citizens and those aged above 60 years to not step out of their homes. “I request you please suspend your morning walks; it’s just a matter of a few days. Do yoga at home and try to isolate yourself at home also,” he added.

About the Janata Curfew on Sunday, he said the option to suspend public transport was discussed, “but realised that may affect people needing to travel for emergencies. So, half the number of public buses will be on the roads tomorrow.”

“Only you can save yourself from coronavirus, no one else. You must give up shaking hands and must wash your hands multiple times, maintain distance from others and stay at home as much as possible; this is how we can save ourselves and our families from COVID-19,” he said.

360,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Flyers stuck at Delhi airport for as long as 11 hours,"People complained that flyers from different COVID-19 affected countries were put in one waiting area, that “defeats the purpose of isolation”

People travelling to India from abroad on Saturday complained of crowded waiting areas inside the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi where those travelling from different countries had to wait together for as long as 11 hours before they could leave the airport.

People said there could be COVID-19 transmissions under such conditions and that there was “chaos” at the airport.

“My daughter landed at 2.45 a.m. from Canada and she is still inside the airport. She told me that it is overcrowded inside and there are people from affected countries, such as England and Dubai, waiting along with them. This defeats the purpose of isolation,” a person who was waiting for his 20-year-old daughter at the airport here told The Hindu at 1.45 p.m.

He said that his daughter was waiting at the airport along with some 30 other students from her university in Canada.

“As per the latest govt advisory, all international arriving passengers have to undergo compulsory health screening and quarantine procedure by Airport Health Organisation [APHO]. This may lead to a longer wait time at T3 international arrival. We continue to support all our stakeholders to minimize inconvenience to the passengers [sic.],” Delhi International Airport Limited said in a tweet.

“I landed the airport at 11.30 last night [Friday] from San Francisco and was released from the airport only around 10.30 a.m. today [Saturday],” Neha Thapa, 36, a senior director of technology, who lives in Gurugram said.

“I had cancelled my flight via Dubai as it was an infected country and booked a direct flight to Delhi. But there were about 2,000 people from Thailand, South Korea, Middle East and all around the world in a single large hall here,” she said.

“It is pretty dangerous. If one person has the disease, then others will get it too. It is a perfect petri dish for any spreading. I heard that the same thing happened two or three days back,” she added. Ms. Thapa said the crowd management became a “huge problem” in the intervening night of Friday and Saturday.

“The authorities were trying really hard, but there were a lot of people. People got really angry and started shouting and started thumping at the immigration counter,” she said, adding: “Overall, it was very painful.”

There was no social distancing at the airport, she pointed out. “I don’t think the police understand it. At one point, they were asking us to come closer for some announcement,” she said.

People coming from abroad have to undergo two different medical checks at the airport.

The first test is done by the airport authorities for visible symptoms, where after an initial thermal screening, symptomatic passengers are isolated and moved to designated hospitals. Others move to the second screening point, where they are either advised home quarantine or sent to a government-run quarantine facility.

“International flights are banned from tomorrow [Sunday] and therefore we saw a large number of poeple at the airport today [Saturday],” an airport official said while commenting on the delay.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/36ib06/article31127449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-03-21-at-143012,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coronavirus-flyers-stuck-at-delhi-airport-for-as-long-as-11-hours/article31127450.ece

Medical Superintendent, Civil Hospital, Maneesh Rathee, told The Hindu that the diseases related to ENT and general medicine went up due to change in weather conditions, but the rush of patients with flu was far more this year due to the panic situation arising out of COVID-19 threat.

Patients ask for virus test

“The patients with running nose, sore throat and cough are inundating hospital seeking test for COVID-19. We try to educate them that the COVID-19 test is conducted only in case of a travel history to the affected countries, close contact with affected persons or symptoms such as high grade fever accompanied by dry cough and difficulty in breathing,” said Mr. Rathee.

He said the hospital authorities were forced to increase the number of OPD doctors for general medicines to four from two to deal with the rush.

“Sometimes, we even opened the fifth OPD to deal with the patients,” said Mr. Rathee.

Hailing from Uttar Pradesh, Ashutosh, staying at Nathupur village, said he had body-ache and running nose and though he would not have come for examination in the normal circumstances, he decided to see the doctor to rule out COVID-19.

“I asked the doctor to test me for the virus, but he told me that it was viral and there was no need to worry. I am feeling rest assured now,” said Ashutosh, who works with a finance firm.

Another patient, Amit, said that he had diarrhoea and cough for the last 24 hours so he decided to visit the doctor. “In normal circumstance, I would have waited for a couple of days, but I did not want to take any chances in view of the present situation,” said Amit, a bank employee.

Sudha, a female security guard, said the patients at the registration counters spilled over to the park outside the building and it was not manageable on a few occasions. “The dedicated counter for the pregnant women too had to be opened for OPD registration to deal with the crowd a day ago,” said Sudha.

Doctor Monika at Ayush OPD said she prescribed medicines to her patients for a month now instead of a fortnight earlier to avoid footfall.“I tell the patients to come after a month. If they come to hospital in these conditions, they are at the risk of catching infection and also add to the chaos,” said Dr. Monika.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7g85e4/article31123459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL21-GURUGRAMHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-threat-drives-many-to-hospital/article31123460.ece
369,2020/03/21,Students figuring out options to stay on as varsities ask them to vacate,"They are worried about travelling back home due to virus scare

With Delhi University announcing a shut down of its colleges following an order of the Delhi government, students staying at hostels in the university are worried about travelling home on a short notice and are figuring out alternative accommodation.

Going back to Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala is not a good option for John Thomas, a student at Delhi School of Economics, who is among a few who reside at the International Students House. “I feel more secure with the precautions that are taken here than going back home,” he said.

Mr. Thomas is worried about contracting the disease during the train journey back home and possibly transmitting to his parents, both of whom are above the age of 50.

With international students being allowed to stay back at the hostel, authorities have made protocols such as restricted entry of visitors as well as closing of various congregating spaces such as common area and reading room, a student here said.

Prajwal Pandey from Nepal said that hostel authorities have informed that truncated food service with fewer options will be made available to them. While other students from Nepal and Bangladesh had already left for home or are making plans to leave the hostel, Mr. Pandey said that he decided to stay back since it would be hard for him to study back home. The hostel has also identified two bedrooms for quarantine in case required, he said.

At Under Graduate Girls Hostel (UGGH), students were asked to vacate the hostel by Friday night, Anchal, a student said. Hailing from Shimla, Ms. Anchal said that she was unsure about how to travel back to her home town since public transport was reportedly unavailable, her father has decided to drive down to pick her up, she said.

Amisha, a resident of Ambedkar Ganguly Hostel, said that directions to vacate the hostel was issued to them also, but about five to six hostellers are left behind, who are unsure of what to do. Hostel authorities had reportedly recommended students to go to the State Bhawans if they can’t make it back home, she added.

With only a handful of students reportedly staying back, Ms. Amisha said: “We told the authorities that we will make our own food, but they didn’t listen.”

At the Tibetan Youth Hostel, Pema, a B.Com student, said that some students are staying back and are taking precautions according to WHO guidelines. However, gatherings at the dinning hall and common areas are still taking place, he lamented. “Going back home is not an option for me,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4cjbhu/article31123448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL21-CORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-figuring-out-options-to-stay-on-as-varsities-ask-them-to-vacate/article31123449.ece

Markets in Delhi will remain shut for three days starting Saturday, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said on Friday. However, the traders’ body has exempted chemist shops as well as dairy and general consumables stores from the shut down.

“In the wake of the rapidly growing threat of COVID-19, prominent trade leaders across Delhi have decided to close business establishments for the next three days beginning Saturday to prevent community transmission of the virus,” the traders’ body said in a statement.

It added that all seven crore trader-members of CAIT across the country would close their business on March 22 to join the ‘janta curfew’ called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The traders’ body said that there was adequate supply of goods at present, but panic buying would strain the supply chain. Keeping this in mind, the CAIT has advised traders to discourage customers from buying goods above a normal quantity.

371,2020/03/21,Centre’s response sought on plea against travel ban,"Petition seeks quashing of DGCA circular

The Delhi High Court on Friday sought response of the Centre on a plea challenging its circular prohibiting travel of passengers from European Union (EU) countries, European Free Trade Association nations, Turkey and United Kingdom from March 18 onwards to contain the spread of coronavirus pandemic.

A Bench of Justice J.R. Midha and Justice I.S. Mehta also issued notice to Ministries of Health and Home Affairs and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) seeking their stand on the plea by March 25.

The High Court’s direction came while hearing a petition filed by Ramesh Chander Goyal, seeking court’s direction to the government to evacuate his son, who is undergoing Master of Science in a University in Scotland, U.K., to India forthwith. The plea further said there are nine other Indian students in the university.

The petition sought quashing of circular issued by the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Government of India, on March 16 putting a travel ban in the country.

“No airlines shall board passengers from these nations with effect from 1200 GMT on 18 March 2020,” DGCA said in the circular.

373,2020/03/21,Medical Superintendents can appoint staff on contract: CM,"Kejriwal tells them to ensure availability of all resources

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday convened a meeting with all the Medical Superintendents of Delhi government hospitals to assess preparedness to confront a possible Coronavirus disease crisis in the city.

Directing them to ensure adequate availability of all resources and medical staff in the hospital, he said that the Medical Superintendents had been empowered to appoint additional employees on contract for the next three months. He also asked them to immediately procure all necessary supplies such as medicines and ventilators and instructed Health Minister Satyendar Jain to ensure no supplier overstocks essential items like medicines and masks.

Facilities, equipment

“Currently, Coronavirus disease is rising in the city. We are in a critical phase right now, which can lead to the expansion of the virus. We should also ensure...adequate medical facilities and equipment...We have to ensure there are sufficient number of isolation beds and wards available,” he was quoted as having said at the meeting.

“There has been no community transmission of the virus until now, but we should be prepared to handle the crisis if it happens...Please ensure that all the equipment are operational. If you observe that any of the machines in your hospitals are not working, please get to address that issue immediately,” he was quoted as having said.

Escapes from hospitals

Mr. Kejriwal also directed the hospital authorities to ensure that there were no escapes from their premises.

“We will deploy more security and police personnel if needed. We will speak to the police authorities and ask them to deploy more police personnel in front of all our hospitals,” he said, addressing the possibility of COVID-19 infected patients fleeing quarantine.

The Chief Minister also directed the Medical Superintendents of the hospitals to recruit as much manpower as required under all categories under the Delhi Epidemic Act 1987. The CM also assured that the Delhi government will talk to the Central government to ensure mass procurement of testing kits to Delhi government hospitals.

All shopping malls, except those mainly retailing essential items such as vegetables and medicines, have been asked to down shutters in view of the prevailing COVID-19 epidemic, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced here.

The order came into immediate effect on Friday afternoon. “All shops in shopping malls in NCT of Delhi shall remain closed till 31st March, 2020 except shops dealing with items of daily needs (i.e. groceries, pharmacy, vegetables/fruits),” the order stated.

Meeting with Secretaries

Mr. Kejriwal also issued orders directing Delhi government employees engaged in non-essential tasks to work from home till March 31. In case of essential services, employees above 55 years of age can also prefer to opt for work from home, which shall be decided by the respective heads of departments. The decision was taken at a meeting with Secretaries and heads of various government departments.

“The health of our officials and employees is very important. We have two public service categories, essential public services, and non-essential services. I want every HoD to make a list of essential and non-essential services,” Mr. Kejriwal was quoted as having said at the meeting.

“I would also like to request all the HoDs to make a list of essential employees and non-essential employees. Only essential employees should be present in office and the non-essential employees can work from home,” he said.

No salary deductions

Delhi government employees who opt to work from home must ensure availability over the phone. During this period no deductions would be made for salaries.

“This is not a paid leave but work from home. During this period, the people who work from home and everyone else will get the salary they get... there will be no deduction,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal said he had directed all HoDs to ensure that all government office premises are disinfected before closure on Friday to reduce chances of the spread of COVID-19.

An order issued by the Delhi Legislative Assembly stated that only those of its staff members engaged in work related to the upcoming budget need to come to work.

Justice Yogesh Khanna also directed the police to file a status report on VHP leader Alok Kumar's plea challenging the trial court’s February 18 order for registration of FIR. The High Court has posted the case for further hearing on May 12.

In his petition, Mr. Kumar said that the complaint filed by Mr. Mander revolved around a speech made by a Swami from Kashi on July 9, 2019, following an incident of vandalisation at Lal Kuan in Hauz Qazi.

Mr. Kumar’s plea argued that complainant Mr. Mander does not allege that he made any speech in the rally. The plea also argued that the complainant does not allege that Mr. Kumar had any role in the organisation of the rally.

Mr Mander, in his complaint before the trial court, had named Mr Alok Kumar (as the international working president of VHP) as accused number 1 and the Swami (who had made the alleged hate speech at the rally organised by VHP) as accused no 2.

Mr Mander had complained that, ""the accused persons committed the various offences of criminal conspiracy, willfuly spreading enmity between different communities and the same needs to be investigated by the police"".

378,2020/03/21,"Govt. approves land use change for new Parliament, PM house","Considered all 1,292 objections/suggestions: Housing Ministry

The Centre on Friday notified the change in land use for seven plots in the Master Plan for Delhi-2021, paving the way for the redevelopment of Rajpath and the construction of a new Parliament House and Prime Minister’s residence.

The government had announced in October 2019 its plan to revamp the 3-km-long Central Vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate, construct a new Parliament and develop a new Central secretariat along the stretch.

In addition, the consultant hired for the project, Ahmedabad-based HCP Design, Planning and Management, has proposed to construct new residences for the Prime Minister and Vice-President near South and North Blocks.

According to the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs’ notification, a total of 1,292 objections/suggestions had been received from the public after the Delhi Development Authority notified its intention to change the land use on December 21, 2019. The notification said the Board of Enquiry and Hearing set up by the DDA had considered these objections/suggestions. It added that the Central government had “after carefully considering all aspects of the matter” decided to modify the masterplan as well as the zonal development plans.

A 9.5-acre plot

Among the plots modified is a 9.5-acre plot opposite the existing Parliament that had earlier been earmarked for “recreational” use and will now be the site for the construction of a new triangle-shaped Parliament House. Four plots were changed from “public and semi-public” use to “government office”, which will become the sites for new office buildings for the Central government.

A 15-acre plot earlier meant for “government office” and “recreational” use near South Block was modified to be used for “residential” purposes, which according to the draft proposal by architect Bimal Patel, director of HCP, will be the site of the Prime Minister’s residence. The PM currently lives at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg.

While all the other modified plots are in the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi, a 3.9-acre plot in Timarpur was changed from recreational to district park.

Green areas

In a statement, the Ministry said: “This paves the way for the construction of new Parliament building and other projects in the prestigious Central Vista project. This decision will ensure that the green areas and public and semi-public spaces are adequately compensated or enhanced.”

Among those who had objected to the land-use change was the Indian Institute of Architects’ Northern Chapter, whose chairman Shamit Manchanda said the government’s decision was “saddening”.

“What is saddening is that there have been no answers given to all the hundreds of objections raised against the change of land use. No studies as to the environmental, traffic and ecological impact of this massive project, if done, have been shared. This is something the citizens of the country must get an answer to,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-approves-land-use-change-for-new-parliament-pm-house/article31123316.ece
379,2020/03/21,PM’s call for ‘people’s curfew’ is the need of the hour: Delhiites,"‘Move will help people understand the importance of social distancing’

Welcoming Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a ‘people’s curfew’ on March 22 as “the need of the hour to break the spread of COVID-19”, Delhiites said that the move would also help people understand the importance of social distancing.

Nitin Sharma, an information security officer at AKS IT Services, said he has suspended his Sunday routine of badminton after the curfew call, but is struggling to make his grandparents understand the urgency to follow the self-imposed curfew.

“My grandparents are continuing with their morning walks believing that the outbreak is a joke. I am able to restrict them up to a limit but this Sunday I am making sure that they strictly follow the curfew rules,” he said.

Many are using social media to spread awareness about the nationwide call and have taken steps such as granting leaves to domestic help, drivers and personal helpers on Sunday.

Female technical officer at AIIMS Saroj Singh felt that the PM’s decision was the right way to tackle the situation. “The curfew cannot be a compulsion as healthcare workers like me need to get to work, but it is our duty to be alert and educate people about this required step of social distancing. It will certainly help in bringing down the multi-folding spreading of the infection,” she said.

Future course

The 14-hour curfew is also being perceived as a preparation step towards a supposedly forthcoming lockdown of the city, and might help in anticipating the public response towards a shutdown of their routine lives.

Delhi-based photographer Shubham Saini, who has called off his birthday celebrations on Sunday, said that the one-day optional curfew would be of no use if there are no plans to impose a complete lockdown in the near future.

Pointing out a flaw in choosing the weekend to impose the curfew rather than a workday, senior manager at Future Generali Insurance Company Shoeb Anjum said that few people will venture out on March 22 anyway as it is a holiday.

“The PM should have chosen another day,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/itb035/article31123304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21DECORONATHREAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pms-call-for-peoples-curfew-is-the-need-of-the-hour-delhiites/article31123305.ece
380,2020/03/21,Nirbhaya convicts hanging | Why midnight hearings in death penalty cases?,"SC says it stems from condemned man’s hope his case will rise like the Phoenix

The Nirbhaya case was the third death penalty case for which the Supreme Court opened its doors for a ‘midnight hearing’ in recent times. The previous two occasions were in the Nithari killings and Yakub Memon cases.

Other such cases

In the Memon case, the Supreme Court had mentioned the “unending character” of such death penalty cases which warrant midnight hearings. The court wondered whether it stems from the condemned man’s hope that makes him come back to the apex court at midnight and fight till the last hours of his life, hoping his case would “rise like the Phoenix” and even “possibly harbouring the idea that it has the potentiality to urge for a second lease of life”.

The fourth case of midnight hearing in the Supreme Court, in May 2018, was not connected to death penalty, but concerned government formation in Karnataka. The Congress party had moved the apex court on the eve of BJP leader B.S. Yeddyurappa’s swearing-in ceremony as the Chief Minister.

Woman judge

The Nirbhaya case also marked the first time a woman judge, Justice R. Banumathi, led the apex court Bench which held the early morning hearing on March 20. Justice Banumathi’s one-line dismissal order on a plea by convict, Pawan Gupta, became the final act of justice administration in the Nirbhaya case before all the four condemned men made their final walk to the gallows on Friday. The previous morning (March 19) had seen the Justice Banumathi Bench dismiss, back to back, separate petitions filed by two of the convicts – Akshay and Mukesh.

Pawan’s lawyers had turned up at the Supreme Court at around 3 a.m. after their hectic arguments in the Delhi High Court failed.

Five years ago, a similar series of events had ensued in July 2015 in the Supreme Court, hours before the execution of Memon in connection with the Bombay Blast case.

After a whole day of hearing the case and deciding against giving Memon any relief, the three-judge Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra was summoned in the early hours when the condemned man knocked on the Supreme Court doors at 3 a.m, on July 30, 2015, merely hours before he was to be hanged at 7 a.m.

An exhausted Bench, which assembled in Court Four, had heard arguments made by Memon’s lawyers and countered by the then Attorney General of India, Mukul Rohatgi, for over an hour. The Bench finally denied the plea made by Memon to allow him a 14-day reprieve to make his peace.

However, in 2014, the Supreme Court, in another midnight hearing, gave Surinder Koli some respite in the Nithari killings case. A plea was filed in the apex court just two hours before he was to be hanged in Meerut. The apex court had intervened and postponed his execution.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ad21or/article30905237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-Death-Penalty,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/why-midnight-hearings-in-death-penalty-cases/article31123278.ece
381,2020/03/21,‘Executions brought justice after long wait’,"Maliwal says move is a victory for India

The execution of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case has “brought justice after a long wait of seven years”, Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal said on Friday, even as several activists contended that capital punishment cannot be a deterrent to such crimes.

Continuing with her demands of handing out the death penalty to those convicted of rape within six months of the crime, Ms. Maliwal said, “The hanging of the rapists is a victory for the entire country and of Nirbhaya’s parents who fought tirelessly till the end. I appeal to the Centre to bring in more stringent measures where cases are fast-tracked and capital punishment handed out within six months of such gruesome crimes.”

“A strong message has gone out today and I am hopeful that change will come,” Ms. Maliwal added.

However, several activists argued that capital punishment, which has been in existence for a long time, has not proved to be a deterrent as crimes against women continue to happen.

Stating that Friday’s execution was not “any assurance” that crimes against women will not take place, activist Annie Raja said, “Death penalty cannot and will not be a deterrent. Even after the Nirbhaya case, fast track courts and police reforms took place. But what happened? Crimes against women continue to take place.”

“There has to be time-bound punishment and it needs to be severe but severity does not mean death. With rigorous life imprisonment for convicts, crimes can be prevented to a large extent as people will know that the system is there to punish them. The government should ensure that existing legislation are implemented first and efficiency of all agencies is increased,” Ms. Raja said.

Meanwhile, activist Kavita Krishnan added that a “State which fails women everyday should not be allowed to absolve its sins by taking away lives”.

“Instead of Central and State governments sparring over who gets credit for hanging rapists [or blame for delaying hanging], let us hold these governments accountable for their failure to achieve simple steps which could make women safer and more free. Rather than celebrating the State’s power to hang rapists, let us continue to work for a society which would not produce rapists,” Ms. Krishnan said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/executions-brought-justice-after-long-wait/article31123274.ece
382,2020/03/21,'Executions an affront to rule of law': jurists condemn hanging of convicts,"‘It does not improve access to justice for women’

The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) on Friday condemned the hanging of the four men convicted of the gang rape and murder of Nirbhaya in 2012, while stating that the execution of perpetrators was an “affront rule of law and does not improve access to justice for women”.

Denouncing the executions, the ICJ urged the Centre to abolish death penalty and introduce “systematic changes” to the legal framework to deter violence and improve access to justice for women.

Frederick Rawski, Asia-Pacific Director, ICJ, said: “State-sanctioned executions are little more than public theatre that risk celebrating and perpetuating violence at the expense of the rule of law. As heinous as these crimes were, the imposition of the death penalty — the deterrent effect of which has been widely debunked — does nothing to improve the lives of women.”

The ICJ called upon the Government of India to join other States and take immediate steps towards towards ending the practice of capital punishment, as prescribed by United Nations General Assembly Resolutions.

Senior advocate and human rights activist Vrinda Grover said, “In 2013, the criminal laws were amended. However, seven years later, the graph of rapes has not diminished. Instead of compelling the State to invest in plugging the gaps in the investigation, prosecution and adjudication of sexual crimes and formulating victim oriented processes, the clamour for execution of the convicts has hijacked the discourse.”

“Seven years later, the power of the State to extinguish life stands entrenched, while women and girls in India continue to struggle to live a life of freedom, safety and dignity as equal persons,” Ms. Grover said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/executions-an-affront-to-rule-of-law-jurists-condemn-hanging-of-convicts/article31123250.ece
383,2020/03/21,Time to address loopholes in legal system which favours culprits: CM,"‘We must ensure such an incident never happens in India again’

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, reacting to the hanging of the convicts of the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case here on Friday, said it was time to address loopholes in the legal system which “favour the culprits”.

The tragic incident, he said, had occurred seven years ago and the whole country had been waiting for justice since and it was time to resolve that “no such incident should ever happen” in the country again.

“The convicts were hanged today. It took seven years to get justice for Nirbhaya. Today is a day when we should all stand together and resolve that no such incident should ever happen in India,” he stated.

“We have time and again observed... how some people manipulated the legal system and delayed the whole process, despite repeated death sentences being issued. We have to work together to address the various loopholes in our judicial system that favour the culprits,” he said.

There was a need, he said, to ensure that another Nirbhaya-like incident would never happen again in India.

This, he said, would require work at several levels and include strengthening of the police system, swift investigation and relevant changes in the judicial process to ensure justice within six months in such cases.

“We need to ensure that police investigations are completed in a swift manner. There is also a need to change the judicial system so that in such cases, victims don’t have to wait for seven long years but get justice within six months,” he stated.

“This whole case shows the number of loopholes we have in our judicial system...We all have to work together and strengthen the system to ensure speedy justice to the victims,” he also said.

Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said everyone had to work together to create a society where the “dignity and glory of any woman was not hurt” in any way.

“At home, school, office and all the places, we have to cooperate in maintaining the dignity of women, because the development of humanity is incomplete without women empowerment,” he said, welcoming the development.

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, said justice may have been delayed in the case but was not denied.

384,2020/03/21,"Nirbhaya convicts hanging | Two cremated together, others taken to home States","Neighbours of Nirbhaya case convicts from Ravidas Camp console kin, say they stand by them

Amid heavy police deployment, the bodies of Nirbhaya convicts Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta reached their residence in Rama Krishna Puram’s Ravidas Camp at 2.14 p.m. on Friday. The two, who had spent the last seven years together in jail, were cremated together.

Around 50 men, mostly family members and neighbours, walked about 4 km from the camp to the Green Park cremation ground to attend the cremation.

“Faansi waale [those who have been hanged]” was the term used for the group of men by passers-by as they crossed the roads and streets in full public glare. “Who is attending their cremation?” asked a man to another. “Who knows! Probably only family because they are not martyrs,” the other replied.

At 3.05 p.m., they began the rites and the pyre was set alight. Vinay’s father was spotted sobbing.

Back in the camp, while locals in the area did not sympathise with the families of the convicts, their neighbours did and sat around them under a white tent outside Pawan’s house. His mother sat in the middle against the wall, quiet.

“She is not talking to anyone. She is not even crying. We are trying to make her cry, but she isn’t. She is saying that he will call her like he used to every day. She has not come to terms with the fact that he is dead,” said a neighbour standing outside Pawan’s house.

Pawan’s father sat with a few men on a bench.

While condoling him, a neighbbour said, “There have been more brutal crimes than this. What about the Nithari case?” Another sitting next to him said, “If crime would have reduced by doing this, then we would not have complained but that has no been the case”.

A neighbour said that they stood with the families. “If these people were bad, then no one would have stood with them. They are poor and these families are the real victims,” he claimed.

‘Blame the media’

The neighbours also blamed reporters for the deaths of the four convicts in the 2012 gang rape and murder case and alleged that the media “blew the case out of proportion while there are so many such cases” and that “death sentence was given because of the trial by the media”. Pawan’s father said that they had already told the police in the morning not to let journalists enter the street.

When the bodies arrived at the camp, a reporter with a national daily was beaten up by Pawan’s father and the neighbours when he pulled out his notebook to write.

However, only Vinay and Pawan’s bodies had reached the camp. The body of Mukesh Kumar, another convict and resident of the camp, was taken to his village in Rajasthan while his mother sat at home in the camp on Friday afternoon.

She said she spent every penny that she had to save her son, including a property. She also met the President, she said.

Talking about her last meeting with Mukesh on Thursday, she said that he kept on comforting her that nothing would happen to him as the date of execution had been postponed thrice.

At the mortuary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital where the post-mortems of the four convicts were conducted, Central Reserve Police Force and the local police were deployed to ensure that no one except family members were allowed near the bodies.

From around 8.30 a.m. till 1.30 p.m., the post-mortem proceedings became a public spectacle as those who were visiting the hospital came, clicked pictures and took videos. As it took time for the families to arrive to claim the bodies, rumours claiming that “no one will come to claim them” started doing the rounds. However, about two hours after the bodies reached, families of all four arrived.

In separate ambulances, the mortal remains of Akshay Kumar were taken to his village in Bihar, Mukesh’s were taken to Rajasthan, and Vinay and Pawan were brought to Ravidas Camp.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jgfpot/article31123226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21RAVIDAS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/two-cremated-together-others-taken-to-home-states/article31123227.ece

389,2020/03/21,Fifty Telugu students stranded in the UK,"Local Telugu organisations provide them food

Around 50 Telugu students have been stranded in London for the last three days after their flights were cancelled with the Government of India banning flights from the European Union.

These students are among the 86 students who were supposed to fly to New Delhi via Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Some were given boarding passes as well but were denied entry by the authorities, saying they had to get clearance from the Indian High Commission given the restrictions imposed by India.

These students went to the Indian High Commission and the authorities expressed their inability given the restrictions in India. As the students refused to leave the premises, the officials apparently contacted the local Indian organisations to help them out.

Gampa Venugopal, founder chairman of Telangana NRI Forum, UK, said they could persuade some Telugu students to come out of the High Commission and about 20 of them were given accommodation and food was being supplied by local Telugus. “Accommodation is given by the High Commission while we are providing food. In fact, we asked the girl students to come to our houses but they want to stay put in the High Commission to put pressure on the government,” he said.

Some students moved out of High Commission on their own and apparently went back, realising that not much help would come given the circumstances. About 19 students are still in the High Commission.

Mr. Venugpal said they approached the Union Minister of State for Home, G. Kishan Reddy and Telngana Finance Minister T. Harish Rao and they had promised to help out. “Providing food is not a big issue for us and we will support all the students till they are sent back to India,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qcp61p/article31131454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy22UKstudent,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fifty-telugu-students-stranded-in-the-uk/article31131455.ece

Persons home quarantined in the city to arrest the spread of COVID-19 are being stamped on their hands, starting from Saturday. So far, the stamping was not being done in the city, though the persons who have recently returned from abroad are being identified and advised home quarantine.

GHMC Commissioner D.S.Lokesh Kumar, while sharing the details at a media interaction on Saturday, said about 8,300 persons are known to have recently arrived here from foreign countries.

All these persons will be approached and advised home quarantine for 14 days, in addition to the already identified 1,400 persons. They will be stamped on their hands along with the date up to which the quarantine is to be observed.

Health department, in coordination with GHMC and Police, has constituted 150 teams, one for each ward, which would visit homes of the persons who have recently returned from foreign countries and advise them home quarantine. Pamphlets have been printed in English, Telugu and Urdu about the dos and don’ts under home quarantine, which are being circulated near the affected localities.

“We will find out from the individual and their neighbours too if they are observing home quarantine. We are also asking them a few questions to confirm it. If they are found to be violating the quarantine, we will advise and warn them in the first instance. If they violate the instructions a second time, they will be shifted to quarantine centres,” Mr.Lokesh Kumar informed.

If the persons display symptoms of coronavirus infection, they will be shifted to the hospitals where test facilities are available. So far, no such case has been discovered during home visits, he said.

Details of four infected persons have been shared with GHMC, whose homes and surroundings are being sanitised using disinfectants. Hoardings sensitising about COVID-19 have been put up at 265 locations, and pamphlets are being distributed.

405,2020/03/21,High demand for disinfectant spraying,"GHMC starts spraying localities where there are high chances of COVID-19 spread

Calls to GHMC for disinfectant spraying have multiplied from various localities, as the number of coronavirus-infected is growing by the day in the city.

In fact, VIP residences which would routinely refuse inspections by GHMC teams during Dengue outbreak, are allowing uninhibited access now for spraying, sources said.

GHMC Sanitation and Entomology teams have begun spraying localities where there is a possibility of COVID-19 spread. They include areas where COVID-19 patients had been staying, or have visited, areas where contacts of the patients visited, and also in localities where persons arriving from abroad are home quarantined.

The spraying is also being done around the designated quarantine facilities where the ailing and the new arrivals from listed foreign countries are being shifted, sources from GHMC informed.

For disinfection, a solution of Sodium hypochlorite is being used, which is being sprayed using power sprayers and naphtha sprayers by the teams. About 2,000 of these machines have been deployed, officials informed.

A total of 125 teams constituting eight members each have been covering various areas in all 30 circles. In addition, disaster response forces under the Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) too have been roped in for the spraying.

Houses within the radius of three kilometres around the source location are being sprayed with the disinfectants, and so far, 600 to 700 houses have been covered, officials said.

“Our first priority is to get the surroundings sprayed, where the infected stayed. Quarantine centres designated by the government come next. Spraying of public places is the least of our concern,” an official informed.

Though the chemical has no proof of efficacy in public places, constant calls from corporators and elected representatives are forcing the officials to take up spraying even in areas where no infection is suspected. Entomology teams are forced to take up fogging of certain areas too to boost public morale, though its effect on coronavirus is next to nil.

Friday has seen DRF teams in full protective gear spraying the chemical in public places such as Necklace Road, ostensibly to clear the areas of the COVID-19 virus.

On the other hand, there is reluctance from field level Sanitation and Entomology workers to enter the areas where infection is suspected, they said.

Attempts to sensitise them are on, and they are being supplied with kits with protective gear such as gloves and masks, besides hand sanitisers, the officials said.

Meanwhile, GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar has announced that six teams have been constituted with senior officials to monitor the measures being taken to control the spread of COVID-19. Two more teams have been kept in reserve, an official statement from GHMC informed.

415,2020/03/21,Six new COVID-19 cases reported in Kochi,"Five of them are part of 19-member group of deplaned British tourists

Six new cases of COVID-19 were reported in the city on Friday.

Five of them were part of the 19-member group of tourists who were deplaned on March 15 from a Dubai-bound Emirates flight as one of them had reported positive for COVID-19.

However, the wife of the UK tourist who is taking treatment in the medical college, has tested negative. But she is continuing in the isolation ward in the medical college.

All the other members of the tourist group are under quarantine in the hospital.

The sixth person is an NRI, presumably from Malappuram, who arrived at CIAL from Dubai two days ago and was straight away taken to the Government Medical College at Kalamassery.

V. S. Sunil Kumar, Minister for Agriculture, said at a press meet here on Friday that the five who had tested positive would continue treatment in the hospital while those who had tested negative would be sent back to their home countries.

The 19-member group, which had arrived in Kochi on March 6 from Dubai were asked to remain under quarantine, but the tourist group had managed to skip the radar of the surveillance team in the district and had visited tourist spots in Fort Kochi and Mattanchery, Athirappilly, Cheruthuruthy, Adimaly, and Munnar in between attending a temple festival.

When the group arrived in Munnar, the UK tourist developed fever and cough. However, in spite of the fever, the group travelled to the Kochi airport on the night of March 14 to board the flight.

Meanwhile, three members of a family who had tested positive here continue to be under treatment in the medical college. The total number of COVID-19 patients taking treatment in the medical college hospital are 10.

While the condition of the three-member family including that of the 3-year old boy is stable, the condition of the UK tourist continues to be critical, said the Minister.

Mr. Sunil Kumar said that there was no cause for any worry as all the contacts of the tourist group had been traced and put under quarantine. The surveillance team had traced 126 persons as contacts of the group of which 57 were from the airport.

He said the government had reached an agreement with private hospitals with regard to the isolation facilities to be used if required.

416,2020/03/21,Epidemic threat keeps people away from hospitals,"GH, Co-Operative Hospital witness sharp fall in number of out-patients

The number of patients reaching city hospitals has dwindled in the wake of the COVID-19 scare.

From over 2,500 out-patients in the largest public hospital, the District General Hospital, the numbers dwindled to 1,124 on Friday. Compared with 500-600 in-patient admissions daily, there were only 326 on the day.

The hospital was choosing which elective surgeries were to be done even as it was awaiting government orders in this regard, said Dr. A. Anitha, hospital Superintendent.

Out-patients at Indira Gandhi Co-Operative Hospital had come down to around 15 patients for a doctor, sometimes going down to even single digit numbers too. The decline was witnessed from Monday. The number of patients had become a trickle in the past two days, said Dr. Sachidananda Kamath, Superintendent of the hospital.

In Devi Hospital in Thripunithura, the number of patients in the OP section came down by about 60%. Very few IP patients were remaining in the hospital, said Deepak Madhavan, director.

Unnecessary crowding in the hospital too had come down, he said. Usually, a baby’s birth got celebrated in the hospital with a lot of visitors pouring in, unmindful of the fact that there were other persons in the hospital who were sick. A person with reduced immunity could contract diseases from the hospital too, however much a hospital tried to keep the area clean, he said.

“We have had visits by a couple of people under quarantine who were connected to the District Control Room immediately”, said Mr. Madhavan. Doctors are also attending to more over-the-phone consultations.

Dr. Kamath is worried about the crowded roads in the city even as many establishments have provided work from home facility or have rescheduled work on a rotational basis. People continue to take things lightly by moving about the streets in large numbers, he said. Even after the State and the Union governments came out with advisories, the number of people on the street was rather disturbing, said Dr. Kamath “The next 10 days are crucial in getting to know the situation in the State and the rest of the country with regard to new cases as well as the treatment outcomes”.

Two superspecialty hospitals are keeping their usual operations on and scheduled surgeries. “However, we are trying to discharge the patients soon so that rooms are made available as a standby”, said Dr. Sanjeev Singh, superintendent, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences. He said there was a fall of about 10-12% in OP patients.

All staff and patients entering Aster Medcity would be screened and it had also reduced the number of entrances to the hospital, said the hospital spokesperson. The numbers in the OP had come down and there were also restrictions in the number of bystanders for patients, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/o7spyn/article31123883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21-KI-HOSPITAL-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/epidemic-threat-keeps-people-away-from-hospitals/article31123884.ece

422,2020/03/21,Postponement of exams evokes mixed response from students,"A few students decide to take break and wait for new dates

Adithi Manoj was going full steam with her revision at her apartment at Palarivattom ahead of her mathematics exam scheduled for Monday when news broke that the State government had decided to postpone SSLC and higher secondary exams as a precaution against community spread of COVID-19.

For a moment, she went blank not knowing whether to feel elated or disappointed.

“Initially, I was dismayed because postponement meant the anxious wait for exams to get over will be prolonged indefinitely. But then it dawned on me that I would get extra time to prepare for the remaining three exams. So, it is a kind of mixed bag,” she said.

Apart from mathematics, physics and chemistry exams are also yet to be held. SSLC exams were to conclude on March 26.

Caroline Sajan, a student of St. Teresa’s Higher Secondary School, felt that the government’s decision to postpone exams was timely as the epidemic was now into the more serious second stage. She has taken a break from studies and has decided to wait for the revised dates.

Harsha Haridas, another Standard 10 student and classmate of Caroline, was dejected that the postponement of exams came when just three more exams were left though she can see the reasoning behind the decision.

“In a way, it was better that it came during the middle of exams with only three more left. If exams were postponed even before they had begun, then we would have had to live with greater tension, having to prepare for all subjects again. Anyway, I have taken a break at least till this month-end,” she said.

Anandhakrishnan, a commerce student of SNDP HSS, Aluva, felt there was no point in questioning the timing of the decision since the fight against the disease was more important.

Two exams each of science, humanities and commerce streams are yet to be held at the higher secondary level. The Career Guidance and Adolescent Counselling Cell of the Higher Secondary Wing of the Directorate of General Education is mulling whether or not to close the help desk set up to help anxious students appearing for higher secondary exams.

“Shortly after the decision, we received a few calls from anxious students seeking to know when the postponed exams will be held. We have decided to operate the help desk on Saturday as well and based on the flow of calls will decide whether to continue it or not,” said C.M. Azeem, State coordinator of the cell.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/postponement-of-exams-evokes-mixed-response-from-students/article31123644.ece
423,2020/03/21,Bird flu scare adds to hoteliers’ woes,"Hotels drop chicken delicacies from menu

The demand for chicken-based snacks and dishes in hotels has fallen due to bird flu scare.

Several hotels have dropped chicken delicacies from their menu after owners reported that bird flu scare along with COVID-19 had prompted customers to say no to chicken-based snacks.

Representatives of Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association (KHRA) said the situation had not yet improved after the authorities confirmed bird flu cases by March 9. “We have cut procurement of chicken by half and more compared to earlier times in view of the decline in demand for chicken-based dishes,” they added.

Proprietors of shops selling Arabic dishes said the demand for chicken shawarma and alfam had dipped considerably. “Those who are aware that viruses can be removed through proper cooking continue to buy the items, while those who are sceptical have stopped visiting us for the time being,” said the owner of an outlet at Aluva.

However, customers pointed out that a majority of eateries were yet to reduce the prices of chicken-based snacks and dishes after live chicken rates started hovering around the ₹40 to ₹50 range after bird flu was confirmed in the State. “They are collecting the same rate as before even after prices getting slashed by at least half compared to normal times,” they said.

Restaurant owners said they were not in a position to reduce prices as the expenses to run the units remained the same despite the dip in chicken rates.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/bird-flu-scare-adds-to-hoteliers-woes/article31123612.ece
424,2020/03/21,Disease scare forces 30% of hotels in district to down shutters,"Some establishments reschedule their timings to manage crisis

COVID-19 has hit the prospects of hotels and restaurants in the district hard.

According to estimates prepared by Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association (KHRA), nearly 30% of hotels and restaurants in Ernakulam have downed shutters following the COVID-19 impact on their coffers.

“The number of hotels and restaurants that have been closed in Malappuram, Kozhikode, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts may be high when compared to Ernakulam. A hotel, which used to earn ₹1 lakh daily on an average in Ernakulam now gets only around ₹20,000. We are not even able to pay salary to our staff,” said G. Jayapal, general secretary, KHRA.

Hotels and restaurants have re-scheduled their timings to manage the crisis. “Many hotels that used to remain open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. now function from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. There are also hotels that have stopped offering lunch owing to the high expenses,” Mr. Jayapal added.

A hotel owner at Aluva said he had introduced shift system for the staff. “Of the 20 staffers, I have asked 10 of them to come for the morning shift, while the rest join for the evening shift. Apart from COVID-19, bird flu scare too has contributed to the plummeting of sales,” he said.

With various State governments imposing stringent restrictions, inter-State migrant workers employed in hotels and restaurants here have requested their employers to permit them to leave Kerala immediately. “Despite suffering losses, I am keeping the hotel open to protect migrant workers, who have been preparing various chicken-based and other Arabic dishes for long. I will lose customers, if they do not return once the situation turns better,” said a hotel owner.

An employee from West Bengal said he had been receiving frequent calls from his family members asking him to return without delay. “I have been pacifying them, but the pressure is so hard that I cannot resist their requests further,” he said.

With inter-State workers leaving, hotel and restaurant owners are staring at another crisis. “Cleaning work will be affected as it is now done by workers from other States owing to shortage of Keralites for undertaking such work. A few workers are now cooperating with us to carry out cleaning in view of the current situation,” said Mr. Jayapal, adding that the association would co-operate with the Prime Minister’s call for ‘Janata curfew’ on Sunday by keeping hotels and restaurants closed.

A senior Labour Department official said the government had instructed the department to ensure that workers who wished to take leave in view of the health situation might be permitted to do so. It is not possible to intervene at this moment in cases of workers losing jobs as it is a fallout of the pandemic, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/disease-scare-forces-30-of-hotels-in-district-to-down-shutters/article31123573.ece
425,2020/03/21,Aashwasanidhi to bring relief to brutally attacked teenage girl,"DCPO recommends unlimited assistance for her medical treatment

The Women and Child Development Department’ s novel Aashwasanidhi programme may bring relief to a 17-year-old girl who was brutally stabbed reportedly by a jilted lover and has remained in a partially paralysed state at Government Medical College, Kalamasserry, since then.

The girl who suffered as many stabs as her age in the broad daylight attack near Infopark on January 6 has been advised advanced treatment at Velloor for full recovery and return to normal life. Though there is an upper limit of ₹5 lakh under the Aashwasanidhi programme, the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO), one of the nodal officers for the programme, the other being Women Protection Officer (WPO), has made an exception and recommended unlimited assistance as her medical treatment may warrant.

The director of the Women and Child Development Department will, however, decide whether to approve the recommendation sent by the DCPO to the Nirbhaya cell under the Department.

“We have so far distributed ₹6 lakh in two different cases in the district since the programme was launched last year. In one case, a mother and three children who came under acid attack while sleeping at their home at Ramamangalam last year were granted a total aid of ₹5 lakh – ₹2 lakh to the mother and ₹1 lakh each to the three children. Another ₹1 lakh was granted to the family of a teenage girl who died after being set ablaze at her home in January,” said K.B. Zaina, DCPO, Ernakulam.

The Aashwasanidhi programme has been allocated an annual budget of ₹3 crore and potential beneficiaries are broadly classified into four categories – victims of sexual violence, acid attack, domestic violence, and heinous gender violence.

The kind of violence perpetrated against the victims is further classified into eight different categories – sexual assault of minors registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, rape/gang rape/unnatural sexual offence, loss of life, grievous physical or mental injury due to domestic violence, women and children rescued from trafficking, pregnancy on account of rape, loss of any limb or body part. The extent of assistance broadly ranges between ₹50,000 and ₹2 lakh in all these cases.

“Once the case is brought to our notice, we secure the First Information Reports from the Station House Officers concerned. Later, we conduct house visits to collect first hand information and secure medical reports and details of bank accounts of victims and their guardians,” said Ms. Zaina.

All these documents along with the recommendation of DCPO/WPO are then sent to the Nirbhaya Cell, which sanctions the assistance.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/aashwasanidhi-to-bring-relief-to-brutally-attacked-teenage-girl/article31123531.ece
426,2020/03/21,Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram’s annual festival commemorated the 106th anniversary of musician Uppalapati Ankaiah,"The event presented instrumental finesse for the soul

For decades, the vocalist has dominated the Carnatic music stage.It’s time for the rasika to realise that classical music can be savoured in other forms too. It was timely that Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram’s annual music festival commemorating the 106th anniversary of musician Uppalapati Ankaiah commenced with a series of instrumental concerts.

Paying an ode to the late Anakaiah’s musical beginnings, (he had learnt to play the dolu and mridangam for many years), the festival had begun with a nadaswaram concert. Veteran nadaswaram artiste A Purushottham headlined the evening alongside Venugopal in which they provided a taste of the denseness that the instrument could provide in terms of sound.

With the nadaswaram being an instrument that’s more or less restricted to private events and its presence being restrictive on the concert stage, it was heart-warming to see the artistes being given their due. The rasika got to hear a lively set of numbers performed with gusto. Though they took time to come into their element (especially during Thyagaraja’s Sri Ganapathini and G N Balasubramanian’s Saraswathi Namostute), they hit a purple patch for the rest of the concert.

Sonorous sounds Komanduri Anantha Sowrirajan, Komanduri Seshadri, Komanduri Venkata Krishna (violas); Vivekananda Suri; A Purushottham (third from left) By arrangement

The haunting rendition of Raghuvamsa Sudham was their best in the evening and the artistes, through Endaro Mahabhanuvulu, navigated through the challenges of playing the lower notes on the instrument effortlessly. Chandana Charchitha’s healing effect, primarily due to the simplicity in the Mohana ragam, was multiplied manifold on the nadaswaram. The RTP was set in Kalyani ragam – the exchange of musical energies between the nadaswaram artistes who played at different scales gave it a unique touch. The brief yet lively musical passages on the dolu by Nagaraju and Anjaneyulu presented the ragam in a new light.

It was a fair choice that the musicians later went ahead with numbers that are in the musical memory of most connoisseurs – namely Marugelara, Enna Thavam Seithanai and Muddugare Yashoda. They ended the evening with a rendition in Ananda Bhairavi ragam. The rare occurrence of a concert with a homegrown instrument in focus during a music festival was well-utilised by the artistes.

Focus on the veena

The second day featured a veena concert by Vivekananda Suri. A popular figure in the classical circuit, known more as an organiser and less as a well-accomplished disciple of veteran Duddu Seetharamaiah, he held the audiences sway over two hours in what was probably his first full-fledged concert for a recognised sabha. He brought back the near-forgotten tradition of starting a concert with a varnam, as he played Viriboni in Kedaragowla ragam.

Vivekananda Suri

The pleasantness in the Hamsadhvani ragam was traced in the musician’s rendition of Raghunayaka later. Thyagaraja’s melody-rich compositions like Ksheera Sagara Sayana, Brova Bharama, Sambho Mahadeva were equally arresting on the veena, as the crowd hummed along to its lyrics. That the artiste captured the essence of the compositions in their true flavour without overt personalisation made the listening experience purer. The several variations in Tera Teeyaga Raada in Gowlipantu ragam could have been a daunting task to unravel on the veena, but the performer remained unnerved about the challenge and came up with a terrific rendition.

Swara Raga Sudha in Shankarabharanam ragam was his choice of the main item, which he had preceded with an intense and elaborate ragalapana that presented the varied texture of ragam intriguingly. The Yadukula Kambhoji ragam composition, Heccharikaga Ra is a unique work known more for its sahitya but the artiste’s performance to piece showed the amount of musical value it possessed. The youngster Kasturi Bhargav on the ghatam maintained a buoyant atmosphere through the concert, along with his mridangam counterpart P Vidyasagar.

Memorable viola concert

The third day was more or less an ode to versatility among the classical musicians in the city. The evening featured a viola concert by two generations of the Komanduri clan, bringing together the veteran Komanduri Seshadri and his sons Ananta Sowrirajan and Venkata Krishna on the same stage. Prominent vocalist, instrumentalist Shyam Kumar on the kanjira and Srinivasa Gopalan made for a strong lineup that delighted with a wide range of numbers.

The mellowed, refined sound of the viola gives a musician to tap into the niceties of a composition and a ragam beautifully. The leisurely-paced Kambhoji-ragam varnam eased the audiences into the concert well, before the performers unleashed their prowess on the instrument through Sri Maha Ganapathi in Gowla ragam. The complexity in the composition gave their rendition an exhilarating quality – the briskness was largely a result of the reactiveness of the mridangam and the kanjira artistes. Evvare Ramayya in Gangeyabhushani ragam, a rare kriti where a few of the swaraksharas also match the sahitya (for the words ‘nee sari’) was memorable for its swarakalpana.

A masterly delineation of the Dharmavati ragam through Bhajana Seya Raada had a calming effect on the listener, with the delicate bowing of the veteran thoroughly elevated by Shyam Kumar’s receptive responses. A compelling sketch of the Anandabhairavi ragam through Syama Sastri’s Mari Vere Gathi followed, after which they chose Nannu Palimpa in Mohana ragam for their main piece.

Fleshing out the various facets of the ragam and coming up with many attractive swara patterns in a rendition that lasted about 45 minutes, the tani avartanam was replete with devotional fervour. A pensively-composed Deva Devam (by Narayana Theertha) in Sindhu Bhairavi ragam besides Annamacharya’s Narayanathe Namo ended an evening of uncompromised musical bliss.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/1marqa/article31125921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf20ksheera-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sangeetha-ksheera-sagarams-annual-festival-commemorated-the-106th-anniversary-of-musician-uppalapati-ankaiah/article31125922.ece
427,2020/03/21,Six more cases detected in Rajasthan,"Five cases, reported from Bhilwara, were of paramedical staff of a private hospital

Six more positive cases of COVID-19 infection were detected in Rajasthan on Saturday, taking the total number of people diagnosed with the disease to 23. Five of the new cases, reported from Bhilwara, were those of paramedical staff of a private hospital where the three doctors who tested COVID-19 positive on Friday work.

Of the 23 positive cases, three have been cured after their treatment in isolation, though one of them — a 69-year-old Italian tourist — died of heart failure on Friday. The five persons in Bhilwara confirmed with the infection were already admitted to isolation ward in Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital.

The curfew clamped in the municipal areas of Bhilwara remained in force on Saturday and the private hospital, where the medicos and staff tested positive, was sealed. The patients admitted there were shifted to other health facilities.

Additional Chief Secretary (Medical & Health) Rohit Kumar Singh said the large number of patients who came in contact with the COVID-19 positive doctors in Bhilwara would be traced and screened. A team of Centre has arrived in the town to provide technical support to local health authorities and prevent the situation from getting worse.

Mr. Singh issued orders under the Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Act, 1957, to the private hospitals and medical colleges with the bed capacity of 100 or more to reserve 25% of their beds for creating isolation wards for COVID-19 patients as well as suspects. The hospitals were also asked to ensure availability of 25% of beds in their intensive care units for the purpose.

The Jails Department has shifted over 2,200 prisoners from the central and district jails and sub-jails in other nearby prisons to reduce congestion. All meetings of prisoners with their relatives on the jail premises have been stopped to contain the spread of virus.

Civil rights groups here have demanded a relief package for daily wage labourers in the State to help them mitigate the financial burden arising out of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The activists placed the demand before Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot in the wake of similar monetary aid for workers announced by the Kerala and Uttar Pradesh governments.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/bapuzz/article31132052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22JAIPUR2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/six-more-cases-detected-in-rajasthan/article31132053.ece
428,2020/03/21,"Ayodhya restricts entry of pilgrims, visitors","Administration asks hotels, lodges, dharamshalas to cancel bookings till April 2

The Ayodhya administration on Saturday ordered restriction on the entry of visitors, pilgrims and sadhus into the district till April 2 even though it did not explicitly cancel the upcoming Ram Navami Mela amid an outbreak of COVID-19.

The district administration invited heavy criticism after it appeared that it was pushing ahead with the annual Ram Navami mela despite precautionary measures laid down by the State against any form of congregations.

District Magistrate Anuj Kumar Jha issued an advisory to control the possible crowding of people in Ayodhya during Ram Navami, scheduled from March 25. While the advisory does not say the mela is cancelled, it puts serious restrictions on gathering in the district.

All visitors and pilgrims planning to visit Ayodhya Dham have been asked to avoid going there. The restrictions will be in place till April 2, said the administration.

“Those visitors and pilgrims coming from outside will be stopped at the Ayodhya border and sent back to their places,” said the advisory.

The administration has also asked hotels, lodges and dharmashalas in Ayodhya to cancel all bookings till April 2 while also putting restrictions on the gathering of crowds at temples and religious places.

Common bathing in the Saryu river has also been banned.

Mr. Jha said the travel restrictions were imposed for people visiting Ayodhya during Ram Navami “in line with the appeal of” the seers in the district.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/ayodhya-restricts-entry-of-pilgrims-visitors/article31132051.ece

The Odisha government on Saturday announced a near complete lockdown in five districts and eight urban centres till March 29, beginning from Sunday.

Districts and towns have been identified on basis of distribution of 3,200 people who have returned from foreign countries. These foreign returnees have been kept in both home quarantine and institutional isolations. Of the 69 samples, two persons tested positive for COVID-19 in the State.

430,2020/03/21,Mass nesting of olive ridleys begins at Rushikulya,"Around 2,000 turtles have dug up the sand for their nests

Mass nesting of olive ridleys started at Odisha’s Rushikulya rookery coast from early hours of Saturday.

According to an unofficial estimate, around 2,000 turtles dug up nests in the sand to lay their eggs. Each nest, on an average, contains around 100 eggs. Usually these turtles nest in darkness, but there have been instances in the past when they have nested during day time.

According to Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO), Amlan Nayak, at around 3.10a.m., mother olive ridleys started coming of the sea to the beach. The nesting process went on till the sunrise.

“Thousands of mother olive ridleys are in the sea near the Rushikulya rookery, which hints that on Saturday night and on the next few nights, thousands of these marine turtles may arrive for mass nesting,” said the DFO.

Proper enumeration of nesting turtles will start from Saturday night.

As per the experts, rain at the rookery delayed nesting by seven to 10 days. Rain had tightened the sand on the beach and mass nesting process started only when it got dried.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/ra8wg3/article31132044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22NESTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/mass-nesting-of-olive-ridleysbegins-at-rushikulya/article31132045.ece

In Nawab Ali Park in Ekbalpore area of west Kolkata, the demonstrators said that they will “suspend” the mass gathering. “Since the Prime Minister himself has requested us to observe a curfew for a limited period of time over possible health risks, I think we will suspend the mass gathering temporarily. But the movement will continue till our demands are met,” said Md Shafi Abedin, one of the organisers in Nawab Ali Park.

In Park Circus Maidan, termed as Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh, where the crowd is usually in the thousands, the numbers have started plummeting ever since news broke of patients infected by the virus in the State. The protesters said that “precaution and resistance should go hand in hand”.

“If the momentum of this movement breaks, people like me who have fought for so long, making many personal sacrifices, will also crumble. [So] we will sit on a rotational basis, rather than calling it off [on Sunday],” said Nausheen Baba Khan, a Ph.D. scholar at Rabindra Bharati University. Ms. Khan, who is also one of the organisers, said they have decided to maintain social distance between protesters.

“With changing times, our approach will change too,” she said.

Protesters of Raja Bazaar, in north Kolkata and Zakaria Street in central Kolkata, spoke on similar lines.

“We will take every precaution, maybe we will do something entirely different but the sit-in will continue,” said Md Jawed Alam an organiser in Raja Bazaar. He feels the Prime Minister’s call to shut down the country on a Sunday is to “showcase that people are with him but it doesn’t have any relationship with the spread or containment of the disease because [most] people are anyway in their homes on Sunday”.

Meanwhile, a section of the civil society, strongly advocated the withdrawal of anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, in order to contain the spread of the virus. “The movement has achieved a part-victory and should be put on hold for now for safety,” wrote a prominent Left party member. The post was criticised on social media platforms. Meanwhile, the West Bengal government has advised against major public gatherings. However, no notice has been issued to the protesters to vacate the premises as yet.

434,2020/03/21,Panel wants police to act on riots case,"DMC also asks for list of all detainees since February 23

The Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) has sent a notice to the DCP North East Delhi seeking details about the case of an alleged attempt to murder during communal violence in the area on February 24. The DMC attached four photos of the alleged attempt on Mohammad Zubair at an underpass near Bhajanpura market, which it claimed has been published widely, and asked what action has been taken in the case.

“Since the faces of a number of attackers are clearly visible and one has been identified from his Facebook page, you are directed to take this accused man into custody and interrogate him to know his role and the role of other attackers seen in the photographs,” the DMC said. DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya has been asked to submit the details to the commission by March 26.

‘Haphazard arrests’

The panel has also sent a notice to the DCP claiming that it has received several reports of haphazard arrests of youth in the age group of 20-30 in the district without any charges or warrants and that they are being pressured to own up or to implicate others in crimes they have apparently not committed.

“We are getting information that in some cases such arrested youth are forced to pay huge bribes and if they do, they are let off. We take all this as a serious violation of the human and civil rights of the people arrested. You are directed to issue clear instructions to all SHOs under your jurisdiction to desist from such illegal practices,” DMC Chairman Zafarul Islam Khan said in his notice to the DCP.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/panel-wants-police-to-act-on-riots-case/article31123471.ece
435,2020/03/21,Haryana restricts gatherings to 20 people,"Up to five persons allowed in Gurugram; Section 144 of CrPC imposed Statewide

The Haryana government on Friday decided to impose Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in both urban as well as rural areas across the State restricting gatherings to not more than 20 people. In Gurugram and Faridabad, the permissible limit will be up to five persons.

Public transport in the State will also remain suspended from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on March 22 in view of the call for “janata curfew” by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The decisions were taken at a meeting held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Manohar Lal in Chandigarh to review the steps to check the spread of COVID-19.

The general managers of Haryana Roadways have also been authorised to decide on the frequency of public transport both operating inside and outside the State depending on the ridership. Though the frequency of buses could be reduced up to 40%, the roadways authorities have been told to ensure that passengers do not suffer. The city bus service in Gurugram will be curtailed till further orders.

In a separate order, the Haryana Chief Secretary restricted public access to district and State Secretariats. The public will be provided telephone numbers to seek any information and service during office hours. Also, all heads of departments have been directed to advise “vulnerable” employees, including those above 50 years of age, pregnant women and those with medical conditions, to work from home. However, no employee will be allowed to leave the station while working from home. In a related development, Gurugram Police Commissioner Muhammad Akil ordered the setting up of a special task force in each police district of the city to guard the quarantine centres and isolation wards.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/og6ryg/article31123469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21TEMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/haryana-restricts-gatherings-to-20-people/article31123470.ece
436,2020/03/21,Bodoland council polls deferred,"Arunachal Pradesh postpones municipal and panchayat elections

The State Election Commissioner has deferred the elections to the 40-seat Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The elections were scheduled on April 4, according to the SEC notification on March 11.

“We have issued a notification for postponing of the BTC polls. The elections stand deferred after the last date of withdrawal of nominations tomorrow (March 21),” State Election Commissioner Alok Kumar told The Hindu.

Political parties and local authorities across the four districts — Baksa, Chirang, Kokrajhar and Udalguri — under BTC have been asked to stop election campaigns and rallies by Sunday.

“A fresh date for polling and the go-ahead for the resumption of campaigns will be announced in the near future,” an election official said.

The Assam government had on Friday morning requested the State Election Commission to consider postponing the BTC polls because of the need to minimise the gathering of people as a precautionary measure against the pandemic.

The request was made after Governor Jagdish Mukhi, who is the constitutional head of Sixth Schedule areas such as BTC, had suggested postponement of thepolls.

The Arunachal Pradesh government also deferred the municipal and panchayat elections that were due by May.

The frontier State’s Health Department had on Wednesday advised the State government to put on hold the municipal and panchayat polls.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/g97yt1/article31123434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/nd20-pollsIMG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/bodoland-council-polls-deferred/article31123435.ece

440,2020/03/21,COVID-19: IMHANS offers solace to stressful minds,"Helpline numbers launched to offer mental health counselling

The Kozhikode-based Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (IMHANS) has launched helpline numbers to offer mental health counselling to those home quarantined or admitted to isolation wards for COVID-19, suspected patients, their family members, and healthcare professionals and police personnel who are engaged in containing the spread of the infection, and the public.

This is in collaboration with the Kerala State Mental Health Programme.

According to IMHANS Director P. Krishnakumar, the facility will be available between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. “There is a team of 26 people to address queries. If they want general information, they will be given the Health Department’s helpline numbers or the district control room numbers. If the caller requires specialised assistance, it will be forwarded to our faculty,” he said.

G. Ragesh, psychiatric social worker in charge of the facility, said the helpline was launched on Thursday and they had received over 20 calls so far from across the State. “A majority of the callers were those in home quarantine. They were anxious about their current health condition. Some of them were wondering if their earlier health problems would have any bearing on their present condition and their future,” he said.

441,2020/03/21,"Voluntary organisations, residents’ groups join hands to ‘break the chain’","Makeshift hand washing facilities set up in city and rural areas

Warm response from various youth organisations, residents’ collectives and voluntary groups to the State government’s ‘Break the Chain’ campaign has fortified the district’s cautious fight against COVID-19.

With their support, makeshift hand washing facilities are now easily accessible for commuters in most public places, bus stands and waiting shelters in the city and rural areas.

Sensing the need, many shops and wholesale suppliers have come forward to supply hand sanitisers and other cleaning materials free of cost to meet daily requirements. Officials with the Health Department say religious organisations, political parties and socio-cultural forums are working now hand-in-hand to make the drive a success. At the entrance of most government and private offices, there is now special arrangement for visitors to sanitise their hands, they say.

“We have been a step ahead in creating proper public awareness on the need to keep our hands clean. Within just three or four days after the announcement of the special campaign, we managed to set up hundreds of makeshift washbasins using community support and thus prompt the public to follow the guidelines,” says K.V. Baburaj, Chairman of Kozhikode Corporation’s health standing committee.

To ensure easy and cost-effective availability of sanitisers, many voluntary groups including students and self-help groups are now engaged in large scale production of quality products, following the Health Department’s guidelines. Production of quality masks too is under way with the support of trained women’s groups and students. There are also small-scale units engaged in daily production and supply of such products free of cost to meet the needs in government hospitals.

“We have already managed to supply plenty of 100-ml and 200-ml hand sanitiser bottles to Student Police Cadets, college students, policemen and officials at the Directorate of Collegiate Education. The biggest challenge we now face to continue with the process is the shortage of some essential raw materials for the production, which will have to be attended by the authorities concerned,” says T. Sudheesh, an assistant professor who coordinated the production process for students at Zamorin’s Guruvayoorappan College.

The Health Department officials confirm that they have sufficient stock now to meet daily sanitation needs.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/voluntary-organisations-residents-groups-join-hands-to-break-the-chain/article31129389.ece

More beds will be added to hospitals and additional ventilators will be provided in Kozhikode district to address any emergency situation related to the spread of COVID-19, Minister for Labour and Excise T.P. Ramakrishnan has said.

He was addressing a review meeting here on Saturday. Mr. Ramakrishnan pointed out that private hospitals too would be part of the containment efforts. “There are 5,200 beds in 70 private hospitals in Kozhikode district. Discussions are on between the district administration and hospital managements to figure out how many of them can be used,” said the Minister. The Indian Medical Association has also extended help.

Steps will be taken to set up a special COVID-19 observation centre at the Youth Hostel in the city under the Youth Hostels Association of India. Hand sanitisers will be provided at banks and ATM kiosks.

Airport bus service

Meanwhile, Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran said at the meeting that special bus services would be launched for air travellers who land at the Calicut International Airport. This is against the backdrop of many passengers using public transport to reach home. Other passengers would not be allowed in these buses.

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said 7,649 were under observation in the district for suspected COVID-19 in Kozhikode. As many as 1,851 were newly added. Eight are undergoing treatment at the isolation ward attached to the Government Medical College Hospital and 15 were at the Government General Hospital. Four were discharged from the medical college hospital and five from the general hospital. Of the 156 body fluid samples of suspected patients sent for lab tests, 137 had turned negative.

Special control room

A special control room has been set up to monitor the ambulance service that takes those in home quarantine and suspected patients identified by monitoring squads to hospitals. Ninety per cent of the primary contacts of suspected patients are under observation now. Twenty-four squads have been stationed at border points, railway stations and bus stations. Their numbers will be raised if necessary.

The Kasaragod district administration has started taking stringent steps against people and traders found defying orders imposed in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

The situation in the district has raised alarm after six persons tested positive for the disease on Friday.

Route map not traced

The Health Department has not been able to trace the route map of a COVID-19-positive patient, who traveled from Dubai to Karipur airport and reached Kasaragod on March 12. District Collector D. Sajith Babu said the patient, who had traveled to several places, was not revealing the truth and was misguiding authorities.

The patient had something to hide, said the Collector.

He added that the patient had donated blood in Mangaluru, which the authorities got to know on Saturday. He also attended weddings,football matches and visited several places along with his family.

Shops, offices closed

The Collector said the government had given the order to take necessary steps that would help control the spread of disease. “We have ordered that no shops and commercial establishments, except those that provide essential service, will remain open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.,” he said.

Shops that were opened on Saturday were forcibly closed down and the Collector himself visited the places to ensure that the orders were implemented.

For two weeks, all temples, churches, mosques and other centers where people gather would remain closed. All clubs, movie theaters and other establishments that conduct social events will remain closed. Government and private offices too would remain closed for two weeks, said the Collector.

He appealed to those who had returned from the Middle East after February 20 to visit the nearest primary health centres.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kasaragod-on-high-alert/article31129277.ece
444,2020/03/21,"Cases filed against Kannur mosques, temple for defying COVID-19 norms","Prayers were held at three mosques; Trichambaram temple organised festival

Despite orders from the government and the district administration to avoid religious congregations, a large number of people gathered at mosques and a temple in Kannur.

The police on Saturday registered cases against 200-odd people, including the authorities of three mosques and a temple, for violating norms imposed in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

According to District Police Chief Yathish Chandra, the cases were filed against the mosque and temple authorities for allowing the conduct of prayers and a temple festival.

Cases were registered against mosque committee members and those who attended prayers at Palot mosque, 19 Mile mosque within Mattanur police limits and Shivapuram mosque within Maloor police limits. In Taliparamba, the police booked the Trichambaram temple committee authority for organising the temple festival.

Mr. Chandra said the seriousness of the infection had already been discussed with all religious leaders and the concerned police station had instructed the authorities to avoid any gatherings of more than 50 people.

However, defying orders, prayers, masses and a temple festival were organised in the district. It could be tolerated as it was against the government order and put the lives of several people at risk.

He said cases under Sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code had been filed against them. He said it had been decided to serve notice on all the religious institutions to avoid masses and other congregations.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/jz3kdx/article31133407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21KRATEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/cases-filed-against-kannur-mosques-temple-for-defying-covid-19-norms/article31129048.ece

The police registered cases against three mosque committees in Wayanad district on Saturday for allowing mass prayers attended by over 200 people. Mass prayers were held at Juma Masjids at Vythiri, Chundale and Madakkimala, flouting the directive of the district administration, District Police Chief R. Ilango told The Hindu.

They were charged under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Kerala Police Act, added Mr. Ilango.

Elsewhere in the district, most mosques were deserted as people offered prayers from their homes following the district administration holding a meeting with many religious bodies requesting them not to hold gatherings in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Holy mass

Meanwhile, Jose Porunnedom, Bishop, Syro-Malabar Diocese, Mananthavadi, said holy mass with participation of devotees, including on Sundays, would not be held in churches under the diocese in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The Bishop handed over the circular regarding the announcement to District Collector Adeela Abdulla on Saturday.

Vehicle movements

The Tamil Nadu government imposed restrictions on all vehicle movements, except trucks carrying essential commodities and emergency vehicles, from Kerala through various check-posts, on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border, including the checkposts at Choladi, Kottur, Kakkundi, Thaloor, Noolpuzha and Cheeral, on Saturday morning.

Though the Karnataka government was yet to impose such restrictions on vehicle movements, they stepped up surveillance on the Kerala-Karnataka border checkposts at Tholpetty, Bavalai, Muthanga and Perikkalloor ferry checkpoint, said Mr.Ilango.

Inter-district checks

The police began random checking of vehicles on the inter-district borders at Lakkidi, Niravilpuzha, Boys Town and Periya as part of inter-district quarantine enforcement. The checking would help to know if any quarantine violations were made by people placed in house quarantine in Kozhikode and Kannur districts, Mr. Ilango said.

“We have constituted four more flying squads to enforce any spillover from the interstate borders,” he added.

Geofencing

The Wayanad cyber cell also started using geofencing technology to monitor the movements of persons under house surveillance. If any quarantined person moved out of home, the police headquarters would receive alerts, he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/police-crack-down-on-covid-19-norm-violations-in-wayanad/article31129037.ece

447,2020/03/21,Revised rate not yet in place for packaged water,"They claim that they still have old stock procured at higher rates

Even after the State government’s latest notification fixing the price of bottled drinking water at ₹13 a litre, retail traders in different parts of the district are seemingly unaware of the new regulation and are yet to reduce the price. The previous rate of ₹20 a litre is still being collected by some rural and urban retailers, who claim that they still have the old stock procured at higher rates from wholesale suppliers.

Customers who bought packaged drinking water from some shops at Mukkom said the retailers justified the old price, claiming that they were supplying chilled water. Though no such order existed in support of the traders’ unfair practice, many customers believed it and made the payment, they said. Some of the urban traders have just reduced ₹5 for one-litre bottles so as to create a false impression that they were complying with the government order. The product was sold at the revised rate only to some of the customers who threatened to challenge it in consumer courts.

Essential commodities

Officials with the Legal Metrology Department said the notification issued by the government by including the supply of packaged water under the armpit of the Essential Commodities Act, would be enforced by their inspectors. They said the Act was in force from March 17 and the sale of old stock charging unfair prices would be considered a punishable offence under the Essential Commodities Act.

According to Legal Metrology Department officials, the checking squads under the District Supply Office too would join the taluk-level inspections to track illegal retailers in the sector. Those who come across the unfair trade should communicate it to the district-level authorities for surprise inspections, they said.

Though the proposal to reduce the price of packaged drinking water was mooted by the Food and Civil Supplies Department two years ago, it remained unimplemented following the staunch opposition of manufacturers in the sector. The majority of the retailers too had backed the manufacturers in their protest because they feared that the revised rate was likely to slash their profit margin.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/revised-rate-not-yet-in-place-for-packaged-water/article31123941.ece

COVID-19, which has disrupted economic and social life, has also affected the Friday prayers at mosques in Kozhikode city.

Perhaps, for the first time in history, prayers were called off to avert the spread of COVID-19. “We have decided to close the mosque indefinitely from Thursday itself in view of the threat of the contagious disease. Consequently, the jumah prayers was also cancelled,” P.M. Abdul Kareem, secretary of the Pattala Palli at Mananchira, said.

Likewise, COVID-19 fears haVE derailed the Friday prayers at Mohiudeen Palli near the Palayam market and Liva ul-Islam Juma Masjid, Lulu Masjid on the Mavoor Road and Muslim Service Society (MSS) Juma Masjid on Cherootty Road. “Prayers and congregations will be suspended until the dangers of the virus disappears,” Hussain Madvoor, general secretary of All India Islahi Movement, and vice president of Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen, said.

He said that mahal committees had decided to cooperate with the exhortation of the Chief Minister and the Kerala State Waqf Board to take precautionary measures against the spread of the disease. Mass prayers and social gathering had already been stringently restricted.

The Mujahid and Salafi organisations would positively adhere to the measures adopted by the government. Friday prayers have been suspended at the mosques at Civil Station, Narikunni, Palath, Chennamangaloor and other places in Kozhikode district as well, Mr. Madavoor said.

However, prayers have either been curtailed, cut short or held in a symbolic manner at many mosques such as the Misqkal Mosque at Kuttichira. “Before noon, the District Collector asked the committee members to restrict the prayers,” he said.

Similar steps were also taken at the mosques affiliated to Sunni organisations. But the suspension of prayers has not restricted the call to prayer by muezzin.

The Mujahid and Salafi organisations will positively adhere to the measures adopted by the government. Friday prayers had been suspended at the mosques at Civil Station, Narikunni, Palath, Chemandamangloor and other places in Kozhikode district, said Mr. Madavoor.

However, prayers have been curtailed, cut short or held in a symbolic manner at many mosques such as the Misqkal Mosque at Kuttichira. “Before noon, the District Collector asked the committee members to restrict the prayers,” he said.

Similar steps were also taken at the mosques affiliated to Sunni organisations. But the suspension of prayers has not restricted the call to prayer by muezzin and mosques have not been closed.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/12r65s/article31123846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVKD-PALAYAMPALLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kozhikode-mosques-suspend-friday-mass-prayers/article31123847.ece
450,2020/03/21,Elderly couple stranded in Frankfurt,"In the wake of COVID-19, Canada prohibits their entry

John Jofin and Simmy Jofin, a couple originally from Kochi and settled in Vegreville in Canada for the last eight years, were on cloud nine as the much anticipated day of arrival of their parents on permanent residency eventually approached.

But then everything went for a toss when their elderly parents, all in their 60s, who were originally supposed to walk into the warm embrace of their children on Thursday, got stranded at Frankfurt airport in Germany where they continue to languish late into Friday night.

“Our parents were travelling on permanent residency but were stopped from boarding flight from Frankfurt to Calgary, some four hours’ drive from our place, owing to a sudden rule brought in by the Canadian government in the wake of the onslaught of COVID-19 whereby even those on permanent residency could not enter Canada if it was their first visit to the country. We are now Canadian citizens and we were told that there were no restrictions on the entry of family members of Canadian citizens,” a very anxious sounding Mr. John told The Hindu from Calgary over a WhatsApp call.

The elderly persons who do not even have mobile phones and possess only some ₹ 20,000 are accompanied by a friend of Mr. John. The friend himself is in trouble as he is travelling with his young family comprising two children aged 3 and 4 years. “Since the stay and food in the airport is prohibitively costly, our parents didn’t even have adequate food over the last two days. They are so fragile and their life is in danger. Our attempts to approach the Canadian MP and emigration authorities to facilitate their entry also proved futile,” said Mr. John.

Even efforts to check them into a flight back to Kochi proved futile as the West Asia-based airline said that they were no longer flying to that part of the world.

Finally, with the help of the Indian Embassy in Germany Mr. John managed to book them into a flight on Friday late night, which was scheduled to reach Mumbai via Abu Dhabi by Saturday 3 p.m. Hardly had he heaved a sigh of relief, he got a call from the relative who was supposed to pick the parents at the airport saying that there was a lockdown in Maharashtra making it nearly impossible for them to reach the Mumbai airport from Pune or Nasik.

“If my uncle could not pick them owing to the lockdown, then it will be another difficult situation if they are asked to undergo 14 days quarantine in Mumbai, which is an alien place to them. This flight is their only hope to get back to India as I am told that there are no flights to India for a week thereafter. Please do something to bring them back safely to Kerala,” Mr. John pleaded over the phone.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/2vbpd4/article31123473.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200320-WA0089,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/elderly-couple-stranded-in-frankfurt/article31123477.ece

452,2020/03/21,"Now, handwashing introduced in units","A considerable number of manufacturing units in Madurai are ensuring that their employees wash their hands frequently as a precautionary measure against COVID-19.

While work-from-home strategy is well-established in the IT sector, it is not a viable option for the manufacturing sector, which is labour-intensive and operations are majorly undertaken through the use of machinery.

M.S. Sampath, President, K. Pudur Industrial Estate Association, says after repeated awareness, most of the enterprises have installed new water pipelines and provided handwash. “Most of the businesses are ensuring that employees enter the premises only after washing their hands. They are also ensuring that the practice is being followed multiple times through the day, especially before lunch break.”

Although such precautionary measures are undertaken, social distancing is difficult to follow at manufacturing units, says K.R. Gnanasambandan, former president of MADITSSIA.

“Barring a few industries, most of the manufacturing units belong to the micro, small and medium enterprise category. At present, most of these industries are facing a slowdown. Hence, it is difficult to procure face masks or sanitisers as they are sold at exorbitant cost,” he points out.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/e724wg/article31130664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA22-HAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/now-handwashing-introduced-in-units/article31130665.ece

455,2020/03/21,"For MSME sector in Madurai region, trouble comes in threes","After demonetisation and GST, industries are now grappling with COVID-19

In the wake of global spread of COVID-19, disruption in supply of raw materials from China and lower demand for finished products have strongly hit the MSME sector in Madurai, according to industry and trade experts.

With around 50,000 registered enterprises, the sector accounts for more than 95% of industries in Madurai. Demonetisation, introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the economic slowdown have left the sector in the lurch over the last two years. The COVID -19 pandemic has worsened the scenario, they say.

S. Rethinavelu, Senior President, Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, says almost all MSMEs have been badly affected. “For instance, the food industry, which holds a major share in the sector, is the worst hit. As the movement of people has come down drastically, so has the demand for the products.”

For some industries, the disruption in importing raw materials from China and other States in the country, is also a major problem, says P.N. Raghunantha Raja, president, Kappalur Industrial Association.

Barring rice, other food products such as wheat, pulses and oilseeds are imported from other States. With restriction at the borders, inflow of the products has drastically reduced, says S.P. Jeyaprakasam, president, Tamil Nadu Foodgrains Merchants’ Association. “This has affected hundreds of rice mills in Madurai. Also, the prices of essential foodgrains will increase gradually, causing problems for customers.”

He adds that many firms from Europe and the United States have cancelled orders from a considerable number of textile and garment industries in the Industrial Estate in the last week.

“This amounts to a loss of around ₹4crore every day,” he points out.

The situation creates a chain reaction and has effects on multiple stakeholders, explains K.R. Gnanasambandan, former president of Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association.

“In the current scenario, the customers are also delaying payments due to weak market sentiments. As a result, the businesses are unable to pay their monthly instalments on time,” he says.

Nearly six units in Kappalur Industrial Estate are on the verge of shutting down, says Mr. Raghunantha Raja. “Since many units do not have many business orders now, they have temporarily stopped operations. This has directly affected the livelihood of thousands of workers, who are daily wage earners.”

As a relief measure to the important sector, the government can extend the time for repayment of bank loans and interest for delayed payment of dues must also be waived off, says Mr. Rethinavelu.

Mr. Gnansambandan says a three-month holiday from payment of GST needs to be awarded to help MSMEs recover from losses incurred during the period.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/z8o8jy/article31130651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MAMSMEs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/for-msme-sector-in-madurai-region-trouble-comes-in-threes/article31130652.ece
456,2020/03/21,400-bedded separate block ready at TVMCH: Collector,"‘12 patients admitted to isolation ward of the hospital have tested negative’

The district administration has readied a 400-bedded block of Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital (TVMCH) to admit patients with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2.

Meanwhile, all 12 patients admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital have tested negative for COVID–19.

“Armed with life-saving drugs and equipment, including ventilators, we have kept a separate block with 400 beds ready if there is any sudden and heavy influx of patients with symptoms of COVID – 19,” Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish said after inspecting cleaning and anti-COVID-19 operations at Valliyoor on Saturday.

“A good number of private hospitals with ventilator facilities in a separate block have also come forward through Indian Medical Association to join hands with us in this task. If we exhaust the beds in TVMCH, we will accept this offer. I sincerely thank the doctors for their noble gesture,” she added.

Those who arrived in Tirunelveli from other States and foreign countries were quarantined in their homes and would continue to be monitored for a minimum of 14 days although they did not have any adverse health issues. “So far, none has been reported for adverse symptoms,” Ms. Shilpa said.

Handing over protective gear such as masks, gloves and sanitisers to sanitary workers, the Collector appealed to them to visit every house to create awareness of the viral infection and the need for ‘social distancing’ to break ‘COVID–19 chain’. “If you happen to meet anyone suffering from fever, cold and cough on their return from a neighbouring State or foreign country, please advise them to visit the nearest primary health centre of Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for early and right diagnosis and appropriate line of treatment.”

She distributed awareness pamphlets to the public at Valliyoor bus stand and appealed to them to wash their hands frequently and properly with soap and drink nilavembu kudineer, a siddha formulation strengthening immunity against viral infections.

After inspecting disinfection of buses at the bus stand, she visited the government hospital there and disinfection of vehicles coming from neighbouring States at Nanguneri toll plaza. She also distributed awareness pamphlets to passengers travelling in vehicles from other States.

459,2020/03/21,‘Janata curfew’ starts on Saturday afternoon itself in Thoothukudi,"As the police asked the traders to down shutters on Saturday afternoon itself in a bid to discourage overcrowding, the shopkeepers, especially the owners of the evening eateries serving famous parotta, got agitated.

It was early ‘Janata curfew’ for people of this port town as the traders were forced to close down on Saturday afternoon itself by the Corporation and the police authorities following huge number of people rushing to the shops to buy the essential commodities.

Since the people came out in large number in the forenoon and also in the afternoon of Saturday to purchase essential commodities in the wake of the ‘Sunday Janata curfew’, all shops in the town were seen overflowing with customers after nearly a fortnight. When the police, who were patrolling on the bikes, started asking the traders to close down their shops shortly after Saturday noon, they were irked.

As the police asked the traders to down shutters on Saturday afternoon itself in a bid to discourage overcrowding, the shopkeepers, especially the owners of the evening eateries serving famous parotta, got agitated.

“Since the ‘Janata curfew’ is only for Sunday as announced by the Prime Minister, we opened our eateries as usual and prepared the parotta. The public, sensing the nation-wide curfew, came out in large number to buy the essential commodities for the week as there is a fear that the curfew might be extended. However, the police and the Corporation officials started exerting pressure on us since Saturday afternoon to close down the eateries and other shops, except pharmacies. It’s unfair,” said the owner of an eatery at Innaciarpuram.

However, the police and the Corporation officials replied that they, in a bid to discourage the public gathering in large number in front of the shops, asked them to close down the businesses.

“As the viral infection easily spreads as the people come very closely, we’ve to prevent it. Since we received orders from our higher-ups to clear the crowd gathering in front of the shops, we asked the traders to close down their shops and the eateries. More importantly, the workers of these shops should also return home at the earliest as there will be lesser number of bus service in the night,” the Corporation officials justified.

The weddings scheduled for Sunday have been postponed to some other day. “I’d planned to conduct my daughter’s wedding on Sunday. As the announcement on ‘Janata curfew’ came from the Prime Minister, I discussed it with the groom’s family and they happily accepted my decision to conduct the marriage on Monday (March 23). And, we conveyed this decision to our relatives through social media,” said financier Shanmugasundaram of Dhanasekaran Nagar here.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/vs6vd7/article31129791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA22TUT-MARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/janata-curfew-starts-on-saturday-afternoon-itself-in-thoothukudi/article31129792.ece
460,2020/03/21,Rapid Response Teams ready in Ramnad: Collector,"Vehicles from Kerala have been stopped on State border

RAMANATHAPURAM

Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao on Saturday said that Rapid Response Teams comprising doctors and para-medical teams have been formed across the district to handle the COVID-19.

Speaking to reporters after inspecting a self-help-group’s manufacturing unit where face masks, hand gloves and sanitizers were being readied, he said that all the 10 government hospitals in the district were equipped to diagnose any person who approached with fever and cough.

The doctors and their teams would be available and hence, people need not go to any private clinics or hospitals, he said.

The isolation wards were kept ready for observing any person, who had symptoms of Covid-19. There was no need for any panic and doctors were available to explain the steps to be followed. The State government has taken a number of pro-active measures to contain the virus from being spread. He urged the people from different sections to cooperate with the official machinery in successfully overcoming the virus.

The self-curfew, which has been announced for Sunday by the Prime Minister, shall be fully adhered to by every citizen. By remaining indoors from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., it would facilitate to a great extent in minimising the spread of the virus.

Hence, the contribution and support from the public would be crucial in this regard, the Collector said.

There were close to 250 persons, who had history of having visited overseas from the district in the recent past. The officials were monitoring them who have been ‘home quarantined’, he said and the SHGs had manufactured 1,300 litres of hand wash liquid as per the WHO standards. Hence, he appealed to the public to use them regularly as it would keep the virus away.

In Sivaganga district, Collector J. Jayakanthan visited a few of the SHGs which were engaged in producing face masks and hand sanitizers. He appealed to the people to stay indoors on Sunday as part of the national curfew declared by the Central government.

The Theni district administration has established a special control room to handle information on persons who wanted to clarify on the COVID-19, said Collector M. Pallavi Baldev. She interacted with the officials from the Department of Health, Revenue, Transport among others on the preparedness for the Sunday self-curfew.

As a precautionary measure, vehicles from neighbouring Kerala were stopped on the State border. Only essential commodities were permitted entry, a Transport Department official said in Kumily.

In Dindigul, people thronged the vegetable markets as the big chain stores had downed shutters. With Sunday being declared as a national curfew, the public thronged the Gandhi Market. The farmers had a tough time handling the customers as the crowd was huge till noon.

Similarly, small outlets, which were selling green and country vegetables too, were thronged by local people. Collector M. Vijayalakshmi reviewed the situation with officials on the status of visitors to Kodaikanal.

During an informal chat with reporters at Valliyoor, she said comprehensive screening of the labourers, when they reported for work, were in place.

Former Radhapuram MLA M. Appavu, who sent a letter to the Collector in this connection, said over 7,000 construction workers, mostly from north and north-eastern States, were engaged in the construction of the third and fourth reactors of KKNPP and lived in temporary shelters erected by their contractors at Kudankulam, Chettikulam and adjoining areas. They constantly returned to the workplace after visiting their families.

“On an average, 200 construction workers from the north and north-eastern States are returning to KKNPP every week and they are not screened anywhere. The KKNPP should have put in place a well-equipped system to screen them for COVID–19 as they return to their workplace after spending time with their families back home. Besides, they also visit Valliyoor, Nagercoil and Kanniyakumari. Since they are not screened by qualified physicians, local residents are apprehansive,” Mr. Appavu pointed out.

Ms. Shilpa said the district administration organised comprehensive health camps for the workers through the Department of Public Health, besides regular screening by medical teams when they reported for duty. “Those who are running fever with cold and cough are being isolated and monitored. So far, no adverse health report has been received.”

The KKNPP administration had been asked to carry on only essential works until the scare subsided.

Also, KKKNPP and ISRO staff residing in Anu Vijay Township were being monitored by teams from the Department of Public Health.

462,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | TNSTC facing dip in collection by 40% over last two days,"TNSTC is already grappling with severe financial crisis

Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), which is already reeling under severe financial crisis, has again taken a dive in earnings in the wake of COVID-19, officials said here on Thursday.

According to reliable TNSTC sources, the threat perception looming large across the State has resulted in a huge decline in revenue in Madurai region comprising Madurai, Virudhunagar and Dindigul.

With a total fleet of over 2,100 buses, the Corporation earns about ₹1 crore everyday from sale of tickets in the region. However, the ominous viral infection has forced a large number of commuters to remain indoors over the past week.

Over the last two days alone, collection has dipped by 40% on various routes, forcing the Corporation to examine various operational aspects in the coming days, officials in the commercial wing said.

As a first step, stretches having 20 trips daily will be reduced to 14. Similarly, routes where buses are operated six times every day will now have two only.

“There is no point in driving empty buses. At the same time, the Corporation will ply its vehicles wherever essential,” a senior official said.

According to TNSTC Staff Federation joint general secretary S. Sampath, the Corporation should provide masks to crew and maintenance staff.

With bus stands wearing a deserted look during the day, Corporation officials at MGR bus stand, Maatuthavani, here say they will recommend curtailing the number of services at night.

Senior officers have granted leave to employees, a crew member at Periyar bus stand says.

Disinfectants sprayed

While welcoming the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to observe ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22 to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Dakshina Kannada District Congress Committee said on Friday that the Union government should release ₹30 crore to the State government to tide over loss resulting from the spread of the disease.

In a statement, committee spokesperson A.C. Vinayaraj said the call for the curfew has been given with an intention to have social distancing. Preventive measures are necessary against this disease that has hit economy of India and other countries severely. Mr. Vinayaraj said because of actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 many small hotels and eateries are forced to close their units. Labourers, street vendors, autorickshaw drivers, taxi operators, farmers are among the many who are facing the brunt of the restrictions.

Buses, trains and aeroplanes have cut down their operations, while the transport vehicles bringing grains,fruits and vegetables to the city from other parts of the State have also limited their services. Several labourers are forced to return to their native places following closure of the units and they face threat of loosing their jobs as there are less chances of these units resuming their operations, he said.

The Union government should also release ₹11 crore to the State government which is due from the Goods and Services Tax collection, he said. Calling upon people to support the curfew on Sunday, D.

The pujas at the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple will be held as per schedule on all days. But keeping in mind Mr. Modi’s message, people need not visit the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple on March 22 and also other days.

Instead they could pray in their homes. People should heed the words of Mr. Modi and avoid unnecessary visits or movement from one place to another, the seer said.

Meanwhile, the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple and its surroundings wore a nearly deserted look with less people visiting the temple and also the Car Street. Normally there is a long queue of devotees to visit the temple and the Car Street too teems with activity.

468,2020/03/21,We see huge potential in rural areas,"Industry hopes on BS-IV pre-buying belied: Renault India MD

In the last eight years, Renault India, which says it has become the number one European brand in the country, says it sees high potential in rural markets. Last year, Renault India grew 7.9% even as the industry saw a slowdown. This year, the situation may change due to COVID-19, says Venkatram Mamillapalle, country CEO and MD, Renault India Operations in an interview:

How was the year 2019 for you in the backdrop of an economic slowdown?

Despite the challenging macro-economic environment, Renault was the only brand to grow in 2019 and in fourth quarter of 2019, we moved to the fifth spot of the automotive pie. With the launch of Triber [an SUV] in 2019, Renault forayed into the largest and the fastest-growing segment of the Indian auto market. In 2019, Renault India sales rose 7.9% in a market that contracted 12.3%. This growth can be attributed to our product strategy, new launches, localisation and focus on quality.

What is your product line up for 2020?

With Triber, we successfully launched a spacious, flexible and affordable alternative in the market and sold more than 33,000 units since launch. We will create a new segment again with the new products that we will launch this year. We will soon launch the Triber AMT that was recently unveiled at the Auto Expo. AMT technology is becoming increasingly popular in India and we see good potential for Triber AMT. We have action planned for H2 of 2020 and details will be shared closer to the launch date.

What about your sales network?

With a developing product portfolio, we have grown the Renault family to more than six lakh customers and we aim to keep increasing that number. We already have expanded our network reach to more than 370 sales and 450 service touchpoints. Our investments in new products that will be launched in 2020 and beyond, will create new segments and will continue to contribute to Renault’s growth in India. We are working towards doubling our sales volume in India in the mid-term.

However, in the backdrop of COVID-19 and the widespread impact globally, we must look at business through a humane lens.We at Renault India completely support the government’s initiatives to help limit its spread in India. The need of the hour is to come together, ensure the safety of our family and communities and recover from this pandemic as soon as possible. We can then assess the way forward, in terms of business objectives.

Which new markets will you be entering this year?

In addition to our domestic focus, we are also exporting to South Africa and the SAARC region.

We exported more than 13,500 cars in 2019, that include Kwid and Triber. We started exports of the new Kwid to South Africa in the fourth quarter of last year. Currently, our exports stand at about 15% of total sales volume. India is a key market for Renault, and we have always focussed on being disruptive and innovative. In just eight years of our India operations, we have become the number one European brand in India. We see tremendous potential in the rural markets for our growth.

Your exports grew 10% in 2019. Do you foresee similar growth given the current scenario?

Renault India, being a priority market for Groupe Renault, has formulated a strong India-centric product strategy.

While we are strengthening our presence in India, we are starting to work closely with the government, suppliers and other partners, as we look to play a key role in the transformation of the Indian automotive sector into a global export hub.

However, considering the prevailing challenging times, the global business outlook might have adverse ramifications.

On BS-IV inventories...

We have already launched the BS VI-compliant models of Triber, Kwid and Duster. Our BS-IV inventory was liquidated last month from the plant. We had started dispatches of BS-VI cars in January 2020 itself. As on date, many of our dealers have almost nil stocks of BS-IV versions.

For the industry, initially, there was expectation of increased pre-buying of BS-IV variants. However, overall retail sales were much below expectation and the expected pre-buying for BS-IV stocks was not as forecast.

Given the magnitude of COVID-19 globally, and its impact in India over the last few weeks, the industry will have to see how the situation pans out.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/wiae47/article31131240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th20BU-Venkatram-Mamillapalle-Renault-India-Country-CEO-and-MD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/we-see-huge-potential-in-rural-areas/article31131241.ece
469,2020/03/21,Confederation of Indian Industry bats for ₹2 lakh-crore stimulus,"Reserve Bank must consider relaxing NPA norms: Kirloskar

Vikram Kirloskar, president Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid the spread of COVID-19, requesting him to provide a fiscal stimulus of ₹2 lakh crore to needy citizens through Aadhaar-based direct benefit transfer (DBT).

He also suggested the RBI consider relaxing the NPA recognition norms from 90 days to 180 days till September 30, 2020 to provide relief to the industry facing payment issues as well as banks which were under pressure on classifying loans as NPAs.

“The government may consider a strong fiscal stimulus to the extent of ₹2 lakh crore, to be given to the needy citizens through Aadhar-based direct benefit transfer. An amount of ₹5,000 for each individual, especially the rural and urban poor and ₹10,000 for the most vulnerable section— the elderly, may be given,” he said.

These measures will help industry and economy manage the economic impact of COVID-19 and also help the banking sector tide over the stress of NPAs due to delayed debt servicing arising out of disruptions in business operations, the CII said.

To help ease the cost of capital, the CII said the government could consider removing long-term capital gains tax of 10% and fixing the total dividend distribution tax at 25%.

GST payments

The CII requested that GST payments should be based on collection of bills rather than on raising of invoices, to avoid liquidity getting locked, in case there are delays in payments. On monetary measures, the CII suggested a 50 basis-point-cut each in cash reserve ratio and the repo rate, to ensure that banks had enough liquidity to lend to industry.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/neuul6/article31131230.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21thBMPPY01CII-seeks-fiscal-stimulus-of-Rs-2-lakhIMG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cii-bats-for-2-lakh-cr-stimulus/article31131231.ece

471,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Banks refuse NRI foreign currency deposits,"Lenders fear spread of COVID-19 via notes

With the introduction of an increasing number of protocols to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, major private sector banks are clamping down on retail offerings, including by stopping foreign currency deposits by NRIs over fears that transmission could occur via such notes.

Speaking to The Hindu, a HDFC Bank official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that after an audit call on Friday, there has been an internal advisory to temporarily halt foreign currency deposits at retail branches across the country, because “people have realised that it is very difficult to track where currencies have been.”

One customer said told that he had to retain the currency he had hoped to deposit, instead, issuing a cheque and seeking his relationship manager’s help to get the same deposited at a city branch.

So far it appears that no measures have been taken to prevent NRI customers themselves from using banking services, despite questions about the risk of the COVID-19 passing from the notes to the bearer of the currencies.

Nevertheless, private sector banks across States have, since last week, instituted hygiene and sanitation protocols at the branch level, including ensuring that all customers and officials use hand sanitisers vigorously before entering the branch — this is enforced by a security personnel at the entrance — and also the use of masks by all cashiers and others in customer-facing roles.

Both, at HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, rotation of staff in shifts to minimise social contact in the work environment has been put in place and been in force for several days now.

The virus has, so far, proven to be far deadlier, in terms of fatality rate, for old demographic cohorts.

472,2020/03/21,Cabinet approves sops to boost electronics manufacturing,"Three schemes, with total outlay of ₹48,000 crore, will create about 20 lakh jobs.

In a bid to boost large-scale electronics manufacturing in India, the Union Cabinet approved three schemes, including a production-linked incentive scheme, with a total outlay of almost ₹48,000 crore.

“The three schemes together will enable large-scale electronics manufacturing, a domestic supply chain ecosystem of components and a state-of-the-art infrastructure and common facilities for large anchor units and their supply chain partners,” Minister of Electronics and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Saturday.

The schemes are expected to attract new investments worth at least ₹50,000 crore in the sector, while generating more than five lakh direct and 15 lakh indirect jobs.

The production-linked incentive scheme aims to attract large investments in mobile phone manufacturing and specified electronic components, including assembly, testing, marking and packaging (ATMP) units, at a budgetary outlay of ₹40,995 crore for five years.

The scheme will offer an incentive of 4-6% on incremental sales of goods manufactured in India and is expected to create a total of 8 lakh jobs.

“Domestic value addition for mobile phones is expected to rise to 35-40% by 2025 from the current 20—25% due to the impetus provided by the scheme,” an official statement said.

For the ‘Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronics Components and Semiconductors’ the outlay has been kept at ₹3,285 crore over eight years and is expected to create about 6 lakh jobs. “The scheme will provide a financial incentive of 25% on capital expenditure for the identified list of electronic goods... and will be applicable to investments in new units and expansion of capacity/ modernisation and diversification of existing units.”

The third scheme, Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC) 2.0, aims at creating quality infrastructure with a minimum area of 200 acres along with industry-specific facilities such as common facility centres, ready-built factory sheds/ plug-and-play facilities at an outlay of ₹3,762.25 crore over eight years.

473,2020/03/21,"Coronavirus | Soap makers reduce prices, increase production","HUL has also ramped up the production of Lifebuoy sanitizers, Lifebuoy Handwash liquid and Domex Floor Cleaners

FMCG players like HUL, Godrej Consumer and Patanjali said they are helping fight the Covid-19 outbreak by reducing the prices of soaps, hygiene products and ramping up production of these items.

Market leader Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Friday committed ₹100 crore to help in combating the coronavirus pandemic.

“In the public interest, HUL is reducing the prices of Lifebuoy sanitizers, Lifebuoy Liquid handwash and Domex floor cleaners by 15%. We are commencing production of these reduced-priced products immediately and these will be available in the market in the next few weeks,” HUL said in a statement.

“HUL has also ramped up the production of Lifebuoy sanitizers, Lifebuoy Handwash liquid and Domex Floor Cleaners and is committed to scaling it up even further in the coming weeks,” it added.

HUL will donate 2 crore pieces of Lifebuoy soaps in the next few months to the sections of the society which need it the most.

HUL CMD Sanjiv Mehta said, “in a crisis like this Companies have a big role to play. We are working closely with the Governments and our partners to ensure that we overcome this global health crisis together.”

Haridwar-based Patanjali Ayurved said it has slashed prices of aloe vera and haldi-chandan soap variants by 12.5%.

“In the light of the common man’s problem, Swami Ramdev has decided to reduce the prices... to help the common people battle against the coronavirus,” Patanjali Spokesperson S.K. Tijarawla said.

No raw material price burden

Godrej said it has decided not to pass on raw material price hikes to consumers.

“Pricing in the soaps category has seen significant deflation in 2019. However, in recent months, we have seen a 30& increase in raw material inputs. We were planning for a price increase to partially cover for this spike in input costs.

“However, given the spread of Covid-19, we have decided to hold off this increase, currently. It is our sincere endeavour to ensure that stocks are replenished across all channels so that our consumers can adopt better hygiene practices and stay safe, Godrej Consumer Products CEO (India & SAARC) Sunil Kataria said.

474,2020/03/21,Blunting the economic impact of a pandemic,"There are a number of helpful actions the government can take in response to the unfolding distress across sectors

That screeching noise that you hear is of the wheels of commerce grinding to a halt. The effect of the strong clampdown measures taken by the government to arrest the spread of the coronavirus is beginning to be felt across a swathe of the economy.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Thursday, said that a task force under Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been constituted to assess the economic impact of the pandemic and suggest palliative measures.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Here are some suggestions for the task force to discuss.

Cash transfers

Those such as cab drivers, restaurant waiters, mall workers, domestic help, itinerant retailers and other casual job workers are either already without jobs and incomes or will soon find themselves in that position.

It may not be a bad idea to consider cash transfers of a fixed amount to these vulnerable sections. There are 33 crore accounts under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana that can be leveraged for this purpose. There is also an efficient Public Distribution System prevalent in most States through which the beneficiaries can be identified for a cash handout.

There are a total of 23.53 crore ration cards in the country according to the National Food Security Portal. Assuming that all of these are below poverty line cards, a transfer of ₹1,000, which is the least that should be considered, will cost the Centre over ₹23,500 crore. Granted that the funds requirement is huge even for this basic amount. We will look at funding possibilities later in this piece.

Also Read COVID-19 pandemic could make another 25 million jobless

Last month, Hong Kong announced a cash handout of HK$10,000 to every permanent resident as a supportive measure. The United States is also weighing the option of a cash handout totalling $250 billion to its citizens.

Loan guarantee

Service industries such as airlines, hotels and restaurants and tourism have begun to feel the pinch, and in course of time the pain will extend to the manufacturing sector as well. The immediate problem for the services industry is that the cash spigot has been turned off. There will be revenue and profit issues to deal with later but the immediate crisis is one of cash flows.

While the cash registers have stopped ringing, these businesses have to deal with expenses that cannot be put off such as salaries, lease instalments, loan repayments and so on.

Banks are obviously not going to offer any accommodation to these businesses given their own issues with sick loans. This is where the government can consider what most of the affected nations in the West have done —offer loan guarantees to affected businesses. Britain has pledged £330 billion of government-backed loans and guarantees, France and Spain have announced €300 billion and €100 billion aid, respectively.

The priority is to keep businesses liquid and that is the reason why these countries have pledged such large amounts as guarantees. The cash machine has to be kept well-lubricated in these difficult times and the government can play a role in that. For a start, it can provide guarantees to working capital loans and link it with assurances from the borrowers concerned that they will secure the jobs in their companies.

Mortgage holiday

An equated monthly instalment (EMI) holiday can be a huge blessing for individuals and businesses when faced with a job loss, salary cut or loss of revenue. A three-month mortgage holiday should be coaxed out of lenders by the government to begin with for businesses in obvious trouble and to those employed by such businesses.

The Reserve Bank of India should show regulatory forbearance in the matter of asset recognition for banks when it comes to these industries. But it should be made amply clear that this is only temporary accommodation till the crisis plays itself out.

Data | The coronavirus impact on global air travel

God forbid, but if this shutdown prolongs beyond the next couple of weeks, the government may have to look at offering temporary tax relief to businesses. We are looking at an unprecedented situation where revenues are likely to fall off the cliff and cash flows wind down to zero. There are other helpful actions that the government can take such as promptly discharging its bills, refunding taxes without delay, promptly carrying out direct benefit transfers already budgeted for, and, if necessary, even permitting affected businesses to temporarily delay payment of statutory dues such as provident fund and ESI.

How to finance?

This is difficult but there are viable answers. The resources of the Centre and the States have to be pooled to develop a national response to this unfolding economic tragedy. Kerala, for example, has already announced a ₹20,000 crore package and other States may follow suit. It may be a good idea for the Centre to leverage State resources along with its own.

Second, the government will have to engage with the private sector while devising assistance measures. There is a lot of expertise and sharp financial minds available in the private sector and these should be tapped into for innovative ideas. The Yes Bank rescue proves the heft of the private financial sector in coming to the rescue of one of its own.

The virus has eaten into the just-a-month-old Budget whose numbers now appear unrealistic. It is not just tax revenues that are heading for trouble, even the disinvestment budget of ₹2.10 lakh crore now appears unachievable. Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Air India appear destined to remain government companies in the foreseeable future. In this backdrop, it is impossible for the Budget to fund any stimulus programme now. Extra budgetary support will be needed and that is where the idea of a bond issue comes in.

A well-structured, tax-efficient bond issue can be an option to tap into the large pool of domestic savings. The large Indian diaspora can also be tapped into. Remember the Resurgent India Bonds experience of 1998 post-Pokhran? The State Bank of India raised about $4 billion from non-resident Indians against all odds to help India tide over the immediate impact of sanctions. Why not do something similar now? After all, this is as unprecedented a situation for the country as the aftermath of the sanctions in 1998.

475,2020/03/21,The missing notes: The Hindu Editorial on politics and the fight against COVID-19,"Political India should put up a united front against the fast galloping virus

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on March 19 on the coronavirus pandemic, rightly focused on what people should do in what is fast turning into a crisis situation. But there was very little by way of reassurance to the people about what the government was doing, or planning to do, to mitigate the developing crisis. Battling maladies of various kinds all the time, a large segment of the population has developed a detrimental fatalism, against which Mr. Modi had spoken earlier. That complacency has been evident in the social response to the creeping affliction, a nonchalance bordering on irresponsibility. Large gatherings of people at private, State and religious events have continued well after the nature of the disease became clear. The Prime Minister’s call for a lockdown on March 22 could prepare the country for stiffer measures if and when the situation so demands. The Prime Minister also held a conference call with Chief Ministers on March 20. To the extent that it communicated a sense of urgency and emergency, the Prime Minister’s address was timely. But beyond that it did not achieve much. The States are at the forefront of the fight against the virus, and their capacity is frustratingly uneven across the country. Marshalling all resources available, and launching a complete spectrum defence against the virus is the need of the hour. There are measures that the governments, at the Centre and the State levels, have been taking. For those who expected to hear some reassuring words from the Prime Minister on this, the address was a tad disappointing.

The most effective weapon in the fight against the coronavirus, evidence so far suggests, is social distancing. This requires people to disrupt their lives and livelihoods. The Prime Minister emphatically urged people to keep themselves at home, but did not adequately put them at ease on the looming questions of economic insecurity. There is a task force chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and an early announcement of measures that will alleviate the economic pain will go a long way in seeing the populace through these tough times. It is one thing to instil a collective purpose among the people to meet a common challenge and quite another to do what the governments are supposed to do, and communicate that. While Mr. Modi’s address was very forceful on the first, instead of explaining the government’s plans to deal with the crisis, he exhorted people to clap for the frontline responders against the coronavirus, who are doing a splendid job, at a particular time. In most parts of the world, this threat to humanity has prompted leaders to put political differences aside, and opposing sides have joined hands. It will be a tragedy if India cannot do the same. To this end, the Opposition should play a more constructive role, and the government must send out a message that it is taking control of the situation.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-missing-notes-the-hindu-editorial-on-politics-and-the-fight-against-covid-19/article31122479.ece
476,2020/03/21,Crime and punishment: On Nirbhaya case convicts’ hanging,"A society that prefers a male child has already condemned its women to an unequal world

The pre-dawn hangings of four men convicted of the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman may have brought a semblance of closure to her parents, prompting her mother, to say, “Women will now feel safe.” On December 16, 2012, the woman was brutally raped in an empty moving bus in Delhi and she died after battling for her life later that month. A little over seven years later, the first date of execution was set for January 22, and the convicts tried all legal avenues possible to escape the punishment. After the executions, on Friday, her mother said, “Families will start teaching their boys that the punishment for such a crime will be severe.” But is India any closer to guaranteeing safety for women? In 2012, the government of the day, reacting to the clamour on the streets for justice, set up the Justice J.S. Verma Committee to look into rape laws. The report, filed in a month, led to stringent changes through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, but several recommendations were simply not considered, including those relating to marital rape and police reform.

On the imposition of the death penalty, the government went against what the Verma report had suggested — that seeking such a punishment “would be a regressive step in the field of sentencing and reformation”. Now, repeat offenders in rape cases, even those that unlike the Nirbhaya case did not involve murder, can be awarded the death sentence. The Verma Committee had argued instead for rigorous imprisonment of a convict for life. It is a fact that sexual crimes against women have not come down since the Delhi case. The death penalty could actually encourage the rapist to kill the victim. Going by data in the National Crime Records Bureau report, released in January 2020, a total of 3.78 lakh cases of crimes against women were recorded across India in 2018 compared to 3.59 lakh in 2017 and 3.38 lakh in 2016. The total number of rape cases in 2018 was pegged at 33,356, of which Madhya Pradesh registered 5,450 rapes, the maximum in 2018. The crime rate per one lakh women population was 58.8 in 2018 compared to 57.9 in 2017. At the end of 2018, 33.6% cases were pending police investigation. This raises the key question — what does India need to do to protect its girls and women? It is apparent that laws may have changed, but not mindsets. A society that endorses a preference for the male child has already condemned the girl child to an unequal world. Until Indian leaders, policy-makers and society shed the gender bias and the thinking that they need to protect women as a question of honour, there will be no stopping crimes such as rape, sexual assault and harassment.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crime-and-punishment-the-hindu-editorial-on-hanging-of-nirbhaya-case-convicts/article31122483.ece
477,2020/03/21,China’s zero: The Hindu Editorial on China’s lead in containing coronavirus,"The rest of the world might have to follow China’s lead in containing the virus

In a remarkable turnaround, China had zero cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) on March 18-20, including in Wuhan, the epicentre of the epidemic. This comes three months after the first case emerged in Wuhan. But on March 21, Guangdong province had one instance of local transmission from an imported case. As on March 22, China reported 314 imported cases. As the instance on Saturday shows, more number of fresh cases from local transmission can show up, turning the zero cases reported on three consecutive days into nothing but a blip. At the peak of the epidemic, mainland China reported thousands of fresh cases and hundreds of deaths each day before the total number reached 81,054 which is nearly 26% of the global case load of 3,16,659 as on March 22. The total mortality from coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mainland China stands at 3,237, which is less than the deaths reported from Italy (4,825). The initial signs of the epidemic beginning to wane were visible when the first makeshift hospital in Wuhan was closed in early March after all patients had recovered and there were no new admissions. The turnaround in China comes at a time when the virus is galloping in Europe and is spreading in the U.S. Shutting down Wuhan and a few other cities on January 23 and many more in the following days placed nearly 60 million in China in lockdown. In retrospect, the drastic measure sharply reduced the chances of a rapid spread of the virus within China and onward to the rest of the world. It gave Europe and the U.S. the much needed time to take measures in preventing the virus from gaining a foothold. Unfortunately, both Europe and the U.S. seem to have squandered that opportunity. What was once considered undoable outside China is now being played out in Italy — the entire country is locked down. Putting the rights of the community ahead of the individual, many countries have been adopting tough measures akin to China’s — restricting travel, banning mass gatherings, cancelling important events and shutting down educational institutions and entertainment in a bid to cut the transmission chain.

Even as China’s success in containing the epidemic is in the spotlight, its cover-up of the outbreak until mid-January, nearly a month after the first few cases showed up, will remain a stain hard to erase. Worse, its refusal to inform its people even after notifying a cluster of cases to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019 and gagging doctors for raising an alarm show that not much has changed since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002. The only solace is that China did not unduly delay informing WHO about the novel virus unlike in the case of the 2002 SARS outbreak. Also, it quickly sequenced the whole genome of the virus and made the data public just days after informing WHO; it has since shared 126 sequence data. Scientific papers published by Chinese researchers have given their peers across the world a head start in understanding the virus and the disease.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/chinas-zero-the-hindu-editorial-on-chinas-lead-in-containing-coronavirus/article31136886.ece
478,2020/03/21,Covid-19: No metro services between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. up to March 31,"ID cards must to travel in Namm Metro

To curb the spread of the COVID-19, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has reduced the frequency of services drastically between March 23 and 31. Services will not be operating on Sunday when ‘Janata Curfew’ will be observed.

In a press release issued on Saturday, BMRCL said that trains will be operated from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. with a frequency of 10 minutes for those carrying out essential works, and between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. with a frequency of 5 minutes.

There will be no service between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

From 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., services will be operated with a frequency ranging from 5 to 10 minutes.

There will be no service after 8 p.m.

Carrying identity cards is now mandatory during this period. Only 150 passengers will be allowed to travel in a train. All the parking lots at metro stations will be closed till March 31, and the number of entry and exit points at the stations will be limited.

In the press release, BMRCL said that metro services during this period should be primarily used by people carrying out essential services, such as medical and public health, police, security services, transport, municipality and other government services.

479,2020/03/21,Covid-19 hits preparations for census,"Training work, being overseen by the BBMP, has been postponed

The Covid-19 pandemic and restrictions put in place have affected census training work. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which was overseeing the task, has put off further training until the end of the month.

Officials say that this could imply postponement of the eighth population census, along with the controversial National Population Register (NPR), that was to have begun in April.

According to Mangaldas, BBMP’s Joint Director (Statistics), the training for field trainers to be deputed in four zones has been put off. The training for officials in four other zones was completed recently.

“The census work requires deputation of a large number of officials, including field trainers, master trainers and charge officers, at the ward level. That apart, we will also require up to 20,000 enumerators. We are yet to begin the appointment of enumerators,” he said and added that there has been some apprehension from teachers, who are most likely to be appointed as enumerators, due to the novel corona virus scare.

Teachers’ associations are adopting a wait-and-watch policy. “We will wait until the end of the month. If the situation doesn’t show any sign of improvement by then, we will urge the government to put off census work until it does,” said Basavaraj Gurikar, vice president of All India Teachers’ Federation.

‘Cannot spare health officials’

Meanwhile, a BBMP official, who spoke to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, said that some health officials were also deputed for census work. “Given the spread of the pandemic, we need all hands on deck. We cannot allow health officials to be deputed for census work when the number of people affected by the virulent virus is increasing by the day,” the official stated.

The first phase of the census was to include house listing. The same was to begin on April 15 and end by May 29. Enumerators would be required to visit households in the city twice, i.e. once for house listing and then again for population census.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar told The Hindu that since large gatherings had been prohibited in view of the spread of Covid-19, further training to the census staff could be held via video conferencing.

Admitting that there has been no instruction or direction on census activity from the Ministry of Home Affairs, Keshya Naik, Deputy Director (Census Operations), Karnataka, said given the situation in the State, the decision to put off census training has been taken locally. “Training sessions were held until last week. We are keeping the MHA informed about the status and situation in the State,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/73x6ks/article31133763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGCENSUSFILEPIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-hits-preparations-for-census/article31130418.ece
480,2020/03/21,Covid-19: Veggie prices shoot up over short supply and panic buying,"Several retailers are reportedly citing rates higher than that of HOPCOMs

While the price of chicken is crashing, the same cannot be said for vegetables, which have become costlier in just one week. In some cases, prices have doubled due to a shortage in supply. Traders attribute this to the fear of Covid-19 that has triggered a spate of panic buying.

A huge gap in the rates listed at Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) outlets and other retail outlets in the city indicates that some retailers are increasing prices to take advantage of the growth in demand. For instance, a kilo of beans that was around ₹35 per kilo crossed ₹60 on Saturday in most retail stores. HOPCOMS is offering the same product at ₹42.

A senior executive at a retail chain in the city admitted that several retailers are hiking prices. For instance, radish, which was retailing below ₹15 levels a week ago, is today ₹45/kilo, while HOPCOMS is selling it for ₹25.

Kitchen staples like onions, potatoes and tomatoes have also seen an increase. Onions are being sold at ₹40/kilo, tomatoes at ₹30/kilo and potatoes at ₹35/kilo. Onions and tomatoes are available at much lower prices at HOPCOMS.

G.R. Srinivasan, a member of the HOPCOMS Board, said, “Summer has begun and the temperature is going up, adversely impacting the yield,” he said. A fear of vegetables not being available because of the pandemic is prompting people to hoard, and is also skewing the supply-demand chain.

Labour problems

“In rural areas, farmers are unable to find labour to harvest crops and bring their produce to the city. The arrivals have reduced,” said a senior executive leading procurement at a retail chain in the city.

Meanwhile, the Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association, APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur, has announced a shutdown of onion-potato merchant shops from March 25 (Ugadi) to March 29 as the produce comes from Maharashtra, which has recorded a high number of people testing positive for Covid-19.

“There are arrivals of onions from Maharashtra, which seems to have developed into a hotspot of Covid-19 infection. Moreover, farmers do not come in large numbers for a few days after the festival. So we have decided to shut down the market,” said Ravi Kumar, a senior onion merchant.

This may further drive up the price of onions and potatoes, sources said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mtpc0t/article31130320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BgVegetable-pricescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-veggie-prices-shoot-up-over-short-supply-and-panic-buying/article31130321.ece

A 67-year-old man who was put under isolation near Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Friday but escaped that night was traced and brought back to the city on Saturday. He had fled to his native town near Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu.

The man had landed at KIA from Australia and was taken to the isolation centre.

“However, on Friday night, the suspect fled to Coimbatore. The staff at the isolation centre alerted the Devanahalli police who tracked him down, and a team went to secure his custody,” said a senior police officer.

482,2020/03/21,Covid-19: Catering industry braces for a lean patch,"Most people have postponed the functions scheduled in March

Functions and ceremonies are incomplete without good food. But with the atmosphere of fear and lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most people who had functions scheduled this month or in the near future have decided to postpone them. The Prime Minister’s appeal to citizens to follow a ‘janata curfew’ on Sunday saw another rush of last-minute cancellations. The food catering industry is reeling under, what business owners say is, unprecedented losses.

Amith from a Koramangala-based catering service said a lot of functions have been cancelled or postponed, and most clients have been adopting a 'wait and watch' approach due to the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak. “We still have the token advance they had given. But despite that, the losses are huge as we had already procured the commodities and arranged for personnel for the client,” he said.

Some have voluntarily shut down services till the end of March.

Latha Ravi, partner at a catering and marriage contractor firm, said it has been a “very bad scene” since March 15. “There has been a complete lull. Everyone is obviously worried and would not be comfortable hosting too many people, especially if it involves guests from abroad. We are closed from Sunday till March 31 because it doesn’t make sense. We have cancelled requests for 30 orders at least,” she said.

Apart from the owners, it is the staff that is feeling the heat. Most catering businesses have a small in-house team and a large number of outsourced personnel. While some of them have decided to pay the in-house staff despite the losses, the outsourced personnel are unlikely to get any such cushioning.

Arvin Urs, owner of a catering business, said those services that offer non-vegetarian food, such as his, are in distress as people are scared of eating meat. “Apart from cancellations and postponements, there are no bookings at all, not even in the near future. Weekends are when we are busy, but since the Prime Minister's speech, there is absolutely no business,” he said, adding that the industry feels that it will be testing times for them for at least three more months.

With Ugadi celebrations this week also expected to be muted, the non-veg feast the day after is unlikely to offer any consolation. Mr. Urs said unless it is a big affair, people usually prefer cooking at home during Ugadi.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xxxhgu/article31133784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGCATERERSFILEPHOTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-catering-industry-braces-for-a-lean-patch/article31129430.ece
483,2020/03/21,"COVID-19: In garment units, it’s business as usual","Order by Mandya DC to close garment factories withdrawn within a few hours

Employees of most companies have been working from home for some time now as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 outbreak, but thousands of garment factory workers across the State have had no such facility. They continue to follow their daily routine for daily wages: travelling by public transport, working in a hall full of people for long hours, and heading back home in the evening. It is as if nothing has changed. This, union leaders and labour rights activists say, is putting a whole section of the population at risk of being exposed to the virus.

Garment manufacturing units across Mandya district, which employ at least 15,000 women, were instructed to shut operations following the outbreak. But hours after the closure order was issued, the district administration withdrew it on Friday following a directive from the Additional Chief Secretary, according to a communiqué from Mandya Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh.

The withdrawal of the order has been widely criticised by labour leaders and employees of garment units. Terming the order as “against the interests of garments workers”, All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) State president Devi Malavalli alleged that the government was under pressure from industrialists. Over 80% of the workforce in garments units in Mandya district are women, and almost all the workers are from economically weaker sections. They may not be able to afford healthcare if they contract the disease, she added.

There are nearly a dozen garment units at Shettihalli, K.R. Pet, and D. Halasahalli, near Thubinakere; and in industrial sectors at Gejjalagere and Somanahalli in the district.

The government put out “preventive measures” for garment and textile units in the State on Friday, which lists installation of thermal scanners, provision of masks, sanitisers, and hot drinking water, and maintaining 1.5-m distance between employees.

However, Jayaram. K.R., legal adviser to the Garment and Textile Workers Union (GATWU), said this was not enough. “Thousands sit inside one room within close proximity, making them susceptible to contracting and spreading the virus. We are planning to meet government representatives next week regarding this,” he said.

Labour leaders are demanding that the State government consider garment industries as “high-risk areas”, and grant paid leave to employees.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-in-garment-units-its-business-as-usual/article31129386.ece
484,2020/03/21,"Coronavirus | Relieved wife thanks doctors, nurses at Bengaluru’s RGICD","Her husband is in the State-run RGICD after being diagnosed with COVID-19

Amidst rising panic over COVID-19, the news of the recovery of some patients has brought cheer to doctors and the families of the patients. At least four of the 14 positive patients have recovered, and one of them was discharged on Friday.

In a conversation with The Hindu on Friday, the wife of a 50-year-old techie, who tested positive for the infection on March 10, was all praise for the Health Department and staff of the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD).

“The doctors told us that my husband’s viral load was high and he was running high temperature continuously till Thursday. While we were worried that we were not by his bedside to take care of him, it was a such a relief to see doctors and nurses attending to him with utmost care,” said the wife.

‘Temperature rose around 3 a.m. every day’

“Noticing that his temperature rose around 3 a.m. every day, the nurses used an alarm to give him medication at that hour. It was really reassuring when the doctors themselves called me and kept me posted of his health status. Thanks to their efforts, my husband is recovering now,” she said.

Sending food from home

She has been sending her husband home cooked food thrice a day. “His company has provided a car with a driver to deliver food to my husband in the hospital. He picks food from outside our door and delivers it at the gate of the hospital,” she added. She managed to get all household items through online shopping.

When he was diagnosed with COVID-19, their daughter, who had to appear for her PUC exams the next day, had lost all hopes of writing the exam. “But the Health and Education Departments made arrangements for her to write the exam,” she said.

The techie, who returned from the US on March 8, self reported to the hospital on March 9 as he had a flu when he landed in Bengaluru. His samples were collected and he was sent home but he was picked up in an ambulance the next day after his samples tested positive.

His family – wife, son, daughter and mother – were tested. The tests were negative, but they are in home isolation, which will end on Sunday.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/coronavirus-relieved-wife-thanks-doctors-nurses-at-bengalurus-rgicd/article31125941.ece
485,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Gadget dependence can lead to spreading of misinformation: NIMHANS,"Anxiety increases the need for socialisation and sharing information irrespective of whether it was true or false, say researchers

With the State government ordering the closure of some commercial establishments giving employees work from home options, people are turning to the Internet to deal with their anxiety and stress.

However, this behaviour can result in the spread of rumours and misinformation as the average time spent on gadgets has increased drastically in the last couple of days.

The Service for Healthy use of Technology (SHUT) clinic at National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (NIMHANS) has found that lack of correct information and uncertainty/ apprehension among people combined with the lack of socialization is leading towards dependence on Internet-based technology devices. These situations can often lead to rumours spreading.

These findings were based on focused group discussions after India reported people testing positive for COVID-19. The researchers found that people are glued to their mobile phones and are scrolling for new updates on COVID-19. A lot of misinformation on the internet is widespread and people are glued to their technology tools.

“This is applicable to even patients who come to us regularly and want to get over their technology addiction. We are seeing a surge in technology use among them as well as there are no social gatherings and no physical movement. The technology usage of our patients is up by at least 30%” said Manoj Kumar Sharma, additional professor, SHUT clinic.

He added, “When anxiety is high, the likelihood of receptivity to rumours also stands is high. Anxiety increases the need for socialization and sharing information irrespective of whether it was true or false.” The opposite is also true. When anxiety is low, it would be insufficient to motivate its transmission.

Dr. Sharma has said people should have an accurate source of information and rely on checking facts and information twice before developing a strong belief. Those working from home should try to spend less time on the internet and focus on doing offline activities with their family members.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qrm2kt/article31125892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BgCoronaGadgetcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/coronavirus-gadget-dependence-can-lead-to-spreading-of-misinformation-nimhans/article31125893.ece
486,2020/03/21,Health experts recommend counselling in COVID-19 cases,"People with pre-existing mental health conditions can be severely impacted

The case of a 23-year-old quarantined person jumping to death from the seventh floor of Safdarjung Hospital building in Delhi on Wednesday has brought into focus the importance of mental health counselling in quarantined patients to reassure them that quarantine does not mean they are being stigmatised.

Mental health experts said the pandemic is creating conditions for anxiety and panic, and people with pre-existing mental health conditions, such as anxiety disorders, depression, OCD, and paranoia in particular, can be severely impacted.

Karnataka’s Health Department started mental health counselling for all those under isolation even before the first positive case was reported from the State.

“Mental health professionals from the district mental health team are following up through telephonic counselling apart from regular follow up by surveillance teams. We have counselled over 3,000 persons so far, and nearly 20 among these have been treated for stress and anxiety,” said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education) told The Hindu.

“While quarantine has proved to be effective in controlling epidemics, it is important that the process is sensitive enough to ensure that such people do not suffer mental agony. Due to misconceptions going around about the disease, some people think that they are going to die. Such thoughts may affect their recovery,” the official said.

Pratima Murthy, Professor and Head of the Department of Psychiatry in NIMHANS, said pandemics such as COVID-19 are likely to have mental health impact on practically everyone. “So much information and misinformation, changing knowledge about the transmissibility and future spread is itself a cause of anxiety and fear,” she said.

“People who have had mental health problems may be at greater risk if they are exposed to this barrage of information, or are unable to take simple precautions, or are unable to seek timely treatment when they need do,” she said, warning against constantly being on social media or circulating unverified information.

Anish V. Cherian, Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatric Social Work at NIMHANS, said apart from the threat of a possibility of not getting one’s basic needs met, the pandemic is causing a breakdown of the structures that guide our day. “There are many activities people can no longer do due to the precautionary restrictions,” he said.

Both the doctors said a person can keep himself/herself busy even when in isolation, discover forgotten interests or simply read a book and keep in touch with family and friends online.

Dr. Murthy said: “It is also important not to stigmatise persons who are infected or those with symptoms. One can be kind and considerate even when taking precautions at the same time.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/xq0ypg/article31125884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-SLUGcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/health-experts-recommend-counselling-in-covid-19-cases/article31125885.ece
487,2020/03/21,"In Karnataka, hotels and restaurants will be open only for takeaways till end of month","Religious gatherings to be banned to stop the spread of COVID-19

The State government has directed all hotels and restaurants in municipal corporation limits to stop dining facility and remain open only for takeaways and online ordering from Saturday till March 31 to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Pubs and bars too will be closed, while takeaway liquor shops can stay open.

In an order on Friday, the government also imposed a ban on jatras, urs and other such religious gatherings to ensure social distancing. It also stated that all medical staff involved in COVID-19, including students of medical and para-medical courses, cannot be given leave.

Speaking on the restrictions on hotels, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa clarified that this will not apply to outlets that have no seating facility. “I appeal to all hotel owners to keep their kitchens open and facilitate delivery to people who are dependent on hotel food. People can either order online or take parcels. Hotel owners should not misuse the situation and inflate food prices,” he said.

Addressing presspersons after a videoconference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Chief Minister said he had made a personal request to the Prime Minister for permission to start COVID testing laboratories in Kalaburagi, Ballari, Hubbali, and Mangaluru.

The government would procure 500 ventilators and ensure hospitals with a total bed capacity of 5,000 and required oxygen facilities readied to accommodate influx of patients, if such a situation arose.

No new cases

Meanwhile, no new positive cases were reported in the State on Friday. One of the two patients, slated to be discharged was sent home. Patient number 5, the 26-year-old person, who returned from Greece was discharged from Jayanagar General Hospital.

Five more patients will be discharged from Monday onwards till Wednesday, he said, adding that the State had seen ( 981), the highest number of international passengers on Friday as international arrivals will be stopped from Sunday.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1iy1my/article31125872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bengaluruhoteljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hotels-restaurants-will-be-open-only-for-takeaways-till-end-of-month/article31123389.ece

Data from other countries fighting the COVID-19 pandemic points to the elderly being susceptible to the virus. With this in mind, the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd has restricted people above the age of 60 and children below the age of 10 from travelling in metro trains.

In the advisory issued on Friday, the BMRCL has urged citizens to use the metro services only if necessary. Security personnel may not check identity cards to enforce this restriction. “We will, however, not allow elderly people or young children to use the metro,” said a BMRCL official.

The BMRCL has also taken a decision to carry out random thermal screening of passengers. “In case anyone has fever or is observed to have any symptoms of COVID-19, he or she will be referred to the State authorities for medical tests and quarantine. Any passenger who has symptoms similar to those infected by COVID-19 are strictly advised to avoid travel by Namma Metro or any other modes of public transport,” read the advisory.

Limited number of passengers

Metro passengers have been asked to maintain at least one metre distance from each other for security screening, purchase of tickets, entry through AFC gates, waiting for a metro train, etc. “In the trains, capacity is limited to 150 people as all alternative seats have to be left vacant and no standing of passengers allowed.”

The advisory also states that the trains may not stop at stations which may be having crowding that is less than the expected distance of one meter between the passengers.

Chief PRO of BMRCL B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan said, “The advisory has been brought out in the interest of the public. Metro and subway systems all over the world are following the same measures to contain the spread. Security personnel at the metro stations have been asked to guide passengers and ensure that they follow the rules.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/metro-bars-people-over-60-children-below-10-from-travelling/article31123378.ece
489,2020/03/21,Orphanages see 50% drop in donations,"Restrictions on entry of volunteers hit day-to-day functioning

In less than a fortnight, childcare institutions have seen a drop in funding as well as donations in the form of food items and other resources. Like other organisations and companies, NGOs and orphanages are restricting the entry of people to prevent transmission of COVID-19. As a result, day-to-day operations of the facilities have been hit.

P. Lakshapathi, Executive Director of Association for Promoting Social Action, said that they run a shelter Namma Mane in east Bengaluru for 68 children. “Over the past fortnight, four of our events have been postponed. We are not accepting any visitors as we do not know their travel history. Corporate companies are making their employees work from home, and there are no CSR activities. A large chunk of our volunteers are students and their colleges are closed,” he said.

Many of the organisations depend on donors for their rations. Gopinath R., the founder of Sparsha Trust, said that they have around 370 children in four locations, but half of the children have gone back to their homes or to a relative’s house. “For children with a single parent, we are asking if the parent can take care of the child for two months until this problem subsides,” said Mr. Gopinath.

Rita Thomas, Managing Trustee, Sneha Orphanage, which provides shelter to 25 boys, said that donations have come down by almost 50% compared to the previous month. “The donors want to see and interact with the children before they donate money. But now, we are not in a position to allow this,” she said.

Keeping the children engaged indoors is also a challenge.

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has stated that staff and officials of child care institutions should take a slew of precautionary measures in the light of COVID-19.

The Commission has told Child Welfare Committee members that they should minimise their exposure to children. “All the orders should be given through email, and Skype should be used for interaction with children and staff,” the order by the commission stated. The commission has also said that the institutions should ensure availability of sanitisers and adequate water supply in washrooms.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/orphanages-see-50-drop-in-donations/article31123348.ece

493,2020/03/21,NEET coaching goes online,"With the National Testing Agency postponing the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) scheduled for the first and second week of April due to COVID-19, there is uncertainty on whether the National Eligibility-cum Entrance Test (NEET), which is scheduled for May 3, may also get postponed if the situation continued.

Meanwhile, NEET coaching centres are adopting online platforms to deliver lessons. K. Swaminathan, founder, Aspire Ventures, said that the roughly 40-day period from the end of board examinations was the crucial period with many students registering for crash courses for NEET.

Stating that students cannot attend classes in person at least till March 31 due to COVID-19, he said that there is high probability that the restrictions may go on for an extended period.

K. Vinayak Senthil, managing director, Speed Institute, said that his institute was gearing up to provide classes online. “We are not sure if NEET will be postponed. Nevertheless, we are fully prepared to coach our students online,” he said. He added that teachers will either be connecting from their homes or their studio which is disinfected. “All the students can connect in real time through our online platform for the classes. The classes will be interactive as well,” he said.

K. Shiva Kumar, regional head (South), Aakash Digital, the e-learning platform of Aakash Educational Services Ltd, said that his institute was providing lessons online, both in real time and in recorded formats. “Tests are also conducted online. The students can remain at home for their safety while at the same time not lose out on coaching,” he said.

Acknowledging that it was possible to provide classes online, Mr. Swaminathan, however, said that it may not be possible from different backgrounds to make use of this facility. “Moreover, it will not be the same as classroom teaching. The students will also face fatigue sitting in front of screens for 7-8 hours,” he said.

A headmaster from a school in Madurai district said that students from government schools will get affected if the government-run coaching classes cannot be conducted. “Moreover, some of the students have registered for month-long courses in some centres in Kerala. They cannot attend now. I do not think they can avail the courses online,” he said.

Mr. Swaminathan said the government should announce a decision earlier on whether the examination will be postponed or not.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/neet-coaching-goes-online/article31131740.ece
494,2020/03/21,"10-year-old girl raped, murdered in Maduravoyal","The accused threw her from terrace

The city police on Saturday arrested a 29-year-old man who allegedly raped a 10-year-old girl and threw her from the terrace of a house in Maduravoyal.

Police said the girl was the only daughter of a couple who migrated from Rajasthan and settled here 12 years ago. The victim was studying in Class 5 of a matriculation school.

The victim’s father is a street vendor and the family depends on his earnings from selling bajjis.

The family was living in the first floor of two-storey residential building. On Friday night, the girl was sleeping with her mother while the father was sleeping in another room.

At 11.30 p.m. on Friday, the girl woke up and went to toilet outside their house. Her mother, who woke up a little later,was shocked to see her daughter missing. The toilet light was on. She alerted her husband and both searched for their daughter.

They went to the second floor where Mr. Suresh lived. They did not get any response from him despite knocking on his door several times.

In panic, the couple alerted the police control room. A patrol team attached to the Maduravoyal police rushed to the spot. By then, the parents found the girl lying in the backyard of a building. Blood was oozing out from her nose and the suspect too helped in rushing the child to a private hospital where she was declared brought dead, the police said. Her body was taken to the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital for postmortem.

Maduravoyal police grilled Suresh when he led the police to the crime spot. When interrogated, he confessed to the crime, the police said.

Victim was gagged

The investigation revealed that he was watching the girl. When she stepped out late night, he gagged her and took her to his room where he raped her. As she fainted, the accused threw her from the terrace, the police said.

The offender was booked under sections 376AB (Punishment for rape on girl under twelve years of age), 302 (Punishment for murder) of Indian Penal Code and 5 (m) (whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child below twelve years and 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/10-year-old-girl-raped-murdered-in-maduravoyal/article31131675.ece
495,2020/03/21,Judge donates ₹2.25-lakh salary towards unorganised workers’ welfare,"Justice S.M. Subramaniam says it is the duty of every citizen of the country to pool resources and help the hapless

Justice S.M. Subramaniam of the Madras High Court on Saturday donated a month’s salary — ₹2.25 lakh — towards the welfare of labourers in the unorganised sector, whose earnings have taken a substantial hit as a result of the COVID-19 threat.

According to High Court officials, the judge handed over a cheque for the amount to Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam at the Secretariat, with the hope that it would serve as an impetus for further donations towards the cause.

When contacted, the judge confirmed that he had made the donation. He expressed deep concern over domestic helps, construction labourers, sanitary workers and many others having lost their livelihood due to the pandemic.

“People are willing to grant leave to domestic workers to avoid the spread of COVID-19, but not many are willing to pay the wages for the period of leave. How will those poor men and women run their families without any pay? That is why I thought of kickstarting a movement,” he said.

“We cannot depend upon the government for everything. Provisions supplied through ration shops will be hardly enough for the unorganised labourers. It is the duty of every citizen of the country to pool resources and help the hapless,” he said.

The judge went on to state: “I could have chosen to call the Health Secretary to my residence or even to my chambers in the High Court and handed over the cheque to her, but this is a time when we should not disturb government officials who are burning the midnight oil.”

“I can say that actually, I am jobless at the moment due to the restrictions imposed on the hearing of cases in the High Court, but government officials are really busy. So it is only appropriate that I go in search of the officials and hand over the cheque in person,” he said.

The judge was also the first in the High Court to discourage lawyers, litigants, court staff and others from entering his court hall if they were suffering from a cough, cold or fever. He had announced that no case shall be posted under the caption ‘For Dismissal’ till March 31.

He had taken the decision even before the Administrative Committee of the High Court met and decided to restrict hearings to only urgent and admission cases in all courts, till March 31. .",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/judge-donates-225-lakh-salary-towards-unorganised-workers-welfare/article31131666.ece

497,2020/03/21,Metro to stop construction work today,"Phase I extension may be delayed; workers told to stay away if unwell

Chennai Metro has decided to suspend construction work on Sunday on account of ‘Janata Curfew.’

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the utility has already begun testing workers for fever before they enter any of its sites in north Chennai.

At present, the CMRL is carrying out the construction of 9-km stretch from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar. “We have provided hand sanitisers and if they (workers) are unwell, we have asked them not to come for work. On Sunday, according to government’s order, we will not have any construction activity,” an official said. Owing to COVID-19, the progress of construction work was bound to be affected and likely to be delayed, sources said.

The extension project was expected to be completed by June. “Some equipment like those required for installing platform screen doors in underground stations and escalators have to be sourced from China. We are finding other alternatives for it. It looks like we can expect some delay in this regard,” a source said. The CMRL has already announced that services will be stopped on Sunday.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metro-to-stop-construction-work-today/article31131569.ece
498,2020/03/21,Trucks off the road today as owners back PM’s call,"Lorry operators demand tax cuts

Trucks transporting non-essential goods to other States have been asked to halt trips on Saturday.

This is in view of the nationwide people’s curfew announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to prevent spread of COVID-19.

Only about 50% of the trucks had been running in the State for the past 20 days in the wake of economic slowdown. In Chennai, the number of sand lorry loads had dropped drastically over the past few days.

S. Yuvaraj, president, Tamil Nadu State Sand Lorry Owners’ Federation, said instead of the usual 6,000 sand loads, only 1,000 sand loads were being transported to the city daily. M-sand accounted for nearly 70% of sand loads provided to Chennai. The demand had come down as construction activity had slowed down with workers returning home fearing SARS-Cov-2 infection, he said.

While extending their support to “Janata Curfew”, members of South India Motor Transporters’ Associations, want the State and Union governments to consider their various demands, including relaxation in payments of monthly instalments of vehicle loans. “We are educating our members and drivers on the precautionary measures to be taken to avoid being exposed to the virus. We have asked the lorries to deliver goods by Saturday night and begin halting vehicles from early hours of Sunday.”

He sought the government’s support to help the industry affected by various issues, including poor demand, increase in toll rates and insurance. “Several vehicles are standing idle due to decrease in trips. It will take another three months for the industry to cope with the dip in demand. The government must provide relaxation in payment of tax and EMIs until the situation improves,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/trucks-off-the-road-today-as-owners-back-pms-call/article31131550.ece

500,2020/03/21,How Chennai residents are coping with Corona,"COVID-19 is still largely uncharted territory. And therefore, the path to deal with it is bound to have its twists and sometimes, hairpin bends. Geographically-defined groups, especially the gated communities, are improvising along the way, keeping their ears perked for updates from government agencies engaged in tackling the public health crisis; and then adopting best practices from their neighbours on how to carry out the mundane aspects of running a community in the manner that will ensure the safety of residents.

In these times, hand-sanitisers and hand-washes seem to be going hand in hand with entrances to gated communities — it would be odd if you were not greeted by them. It would certainly help if there were a wash basin to go with them. Or, is that asking too much? Not in the least bit, if you knew what CEEBROS Belvedere, a gated community in Sholinganallur, has done. With some jugaad thinking, it has conjured up a wash-basin in what would have looked like the most unlikely space for having one, only a few days ago.

“We have restricted entry to one place — that is, the main entrance — and closed all others, to ensure effective monitoring of visitors walking into the complex, which primarily is about making sure they rinse their hands with disinfectant liquid. It would have been an ideal situation if this place had a wash-basin. Through a simple, and quickly thought-up hack, we created this ideal situation. There was a water pipeline leading to one of the sections in the gated community; here was nothing outward to indicate there was a water pipeline. We tapped into this provision by taking a line out and adding a tap to it, and then fixed a wash basin. For water collection, we used a garbage bin, and an outlet pipe is connected to the bottom of the garbage bin to drain he used water,” explains Kiran Gupta, president, CEEBROS Belvedere.

‘Show them, don’t tell them’

At Sabari Terrace, there is a water tap next to the security room. So, all it would take to get visitors to lather their hands before they strolled into the community was to pair a soap to the existing facility. The Association would not have been more mistaken.

“We discovered to our horror that the soap was neatly and safely placed inside the security room,” begins Harsha Koda, secretary of Sabari Terrace Apartment Owners Association. “The security personnel had become proprietorial about the soap, thinking it was meant only for them. We had to explain that it was not just about they having clean hands, but that everyone who walked in should also be clean. How do we do it? We spent an hour educating them and the other support staff at the community on what this virus is all about, how it has been spreading, and what was at stake. We explained that ‘the visitor touches an auto, walks in, and he signs in the address book with the pen offered to him, and you handle the pen, there is the chance that virus is spread in this manner, and you will end up taking it to your home. The penny dropped. The next thing we knew the soap was right next to the tap.”

From this instance and similar ones, Prabha Koda, committee member of the Association, believes showing hoe these things are done is better telling the stakeholders about it. She elaborates: “As everyone is trying to contain the spread of the Corona virus, we can’t afford to have the right messages being misunderstood. So, we have created a poster of how to wash one’s hands with illustrations, and displayed copies of it around the wash-basins in the common areas of the community.”

‘Hospitals’ at home

Having an in-house medical team, consisting of practising doctors, can be a big relief in these times. This would be a particularly helpful arrangement is someone has a minor ailment for which they need treatment — with a responsive team at “home”, they may not have to step out of the community. This team of doctors can also provide clarifications on matters relating to the spread of new Coronavirus.

Osian Chlorophyll, a gated community in Porur, has formed a 20-member response team, which includes five in-house doctors who visit residents who are are wondering if they are having symptoms of Coronavirus infection. “So far, we have had some people come to us with such doubts, and all that the doctors had to do is counsel them. The doctors also discuss the quarantine measures residents should take and how,” says Ronald Lamech, a resident.

A ready help

At House of Hiranandani Upscale in Egattur, an Emergency Rescue Medical Team has been formed to help residents deal with problems arising from any medical conditions during this period, by being the first line of intervention. Raghavan Murti, president, Union of Tower Association at House of Hiranandani Upscale, says, “At present, when people are advised not to step out and put themselves in harm’s way, if a medical problem can be tackled through an in-house consultation, why not? There are two physiotherapists in the community who can help residents who may need their expertise. At present, five doctors have volunteered their time and expertise for the Medical Team. The community consists of around 20 doctors in the community, and so we will induct more doctors into the team, if the situation demands it.”

Their word is final

Residents of Godrej Palm Grove, a gated community in Chembarambakkam, were advised against panic buying of gloves and masks — the residents took the advice, as it came from two of their own, and these two are doctors.

P.V. Ramaswamy, a resident of the apartment complex, says “We are fortunate to have two doctors in our midst who are part of the COVID -19 preventive committee in their respective organisations. One is Dr. S. Venkatramanan who is a Health Officer with the Directorate of Public Health & Preventive Medicine, Government of Tamil Nadu, and the other is Dr. G.V.V. Giri, oral maxillofacial surgeon and senior consultant with the Sri Ramachandra Medical College & Research Institute (SRMC & RI). Dr. Venkat is a member of the control room committee formed by the Tamil Nadu government and Dr. Giri is a member of the committee formed by SRMC & PI to prevent infection within the hospital. They advised that people who have cold and cough could wear a mask and did not recommend it for others. The doctors said that panic buying of masks could result in shortage and may not be available for people at a time when they need it. Panic buying of masks can also result in odd situation where those in the healthcare sector, who are at a higher risk of contracting the infection, may be faced with a shortage of masks — this is what the doctors told us.”

When The Central Park South, a gated community in Sholinganallur, took sanitation-related measures to insulate its premises, there was the question of what sanitising agent should be kept at all the common areas, including entrances to the various blocks in the community.

“We decided that we would take the matter to some of the doctors in our community, and we went by what they told us was ideal,” says Raakesh Ohri, president of TCPS residents’ association.

For those at the helm of running communities, combating ‘fake news’ can be a drain on time and energy. However, sometimes, the misinformation might have assumed such a monstrous proportion that having to call it out would become a critical act that can not be put off. And combating misinformation becomes an important aspect of the whole exercise. Raghavan Murti, president, Union of Tower Association at House of Hiranandani Upscale in Egattur, a humongous community with ten towers, including a 40-floor tower and six others with 28 floors each, draws attention to an incident in the community that underlines how virulent misinformation can be in these times.

Combating misinformation

“An airline staff residing in our community had been on a flight where one of the travellers was later found to be positive for Coronavirus. The Ministry of Health checked the list of those who had been on that flight, and made contact with each one of them to find out if the infection had been passed on to any of the others on the flight. So, as part of this follow-up measure, a team from the Ministry, including doctors, made a visit to this airline staff’s house. This person was cleared. However, some of the domestic helpers who noticed the team visit the house assumed that there was a problem, and spread the false story. It caused a lot of disturbance; the Association stepped in and apprised the residents of the facts. The domestic helpers who had been spreading this false story were warned, and told that they should check with the Association about such things and not spread misinformation on the basis of their assumptions.”

Keeping all channels of communication open

When they started closing themselves off and shutting out systems that would encourage social contact, some communities started reaping the benefits of past initiatives, and this has been particularly true in areas where they had invested in creating digital communication channels. While they may still continue to post messages on notice boards, they rely considerably on these digital channels to ensure they stay in touch with residents continually, and get all the critical messages across to them.

Last year, Kochar Panchsheel, a 430-unit apartment complex in Ambattur, invested in an apartment society management system that takes care of maintenance, billing, accounting, visitor management and help desk requirements of residents.

“We made it mandatory that every flat owner subscribe to it,” Santosh Abraham, secretary of Kochar Panchsheel Apartment Owners Association.

The Association is finding the application to be of immense help during the present situation where residents have to be informed about the various steps taken by the Association committee as well as create an atmosphere where they is internal sharing of notes among residents, and the possibility of learning from each other.

In WhatsApp there is a limit on the number of people that can be added; and not every new occupant would find out if the Association has a broadcasting group that they can be part of.

This tool has come in handy as it encompasses all residents.

The extra advantage

At CEEBROS Boulevard in Thoraipakkam, a WhatsApp group transmits communications on what have to be, and could be done, during this crisis. Bharathi Hariharan, admin of this group — called “Ladies At CEEBROS Boulevard” — points out that this is an informal group, consisting of 150-plus women residents of the gated community, and during this crisis, this group only seeks to play a supportive role in implementing the decisions taken by the committee. Yet, the ladies can come up with suggestions on how to be helpful as a group to the community and its various stakeholders.

Bharathi gives one example: “The majority of the domestic help who are serving at the community have spouses who are wage labourers. In the current scenario, when most people are staying at home because many work-systems have either shut down or only partially functioning, there is bound to be a huge dip in the family’s earnings. Among the group, a suggestion was put out that everyone consider buying some essential items and distributing them to their respective domestic help or anybody else who may be in need.”

The group reportedly also played a proactive role in ensuring that the support staff at the community followed proper sanitation at their home, thereby ensuring the safety of their family members too.

“We were not sure if they were following the kind of sanitation at their home that check the spread of the virus. As part of this discussion on this group, a video in Tamil on sanitisation was shared, and we decided that each of us would show this video to our domestic help,” explains Bharathi.

She says that the strength of this group lies in its prompt response: “If a question is posted at midnight, you can still expect a response almost immediately.” In these times, when effective and prompt communication is necessary, gated communities can find alternative groups within that are both popular and responsible.

Talking facts

At the time of this article going to press, CEEBROS Belvedere was contemplating asking residents to make a self-declaration if they had recently returned from travelling abroad, and go into self-quarantine.

“It would be a request, and not a rule,” says Kiran Gupta, president, Ceebros Belvedere residents’ association.

“As these are things that go beyond the community level and barge into the personal space, they have to be handled with utmost sensitivity,” he adds.

At Kochar Panchsheel in Ambattur, if it comes to light that that the person has a recent overseas travel history, they may be requested to go on home quarantine. “The application we use has a ‘KYC’ that has to be filled in each time a tenant/owner moves in and out. We have communicated to residents that they should not look at this as a shaming exercise but these are some precautions we need to take,” says Santosh Abraham, secretary of Kochar Panchsheel Apartment Owners Association.

501,2020/03/21,COVID-19: There are those people who can’t work from home,"A traffic police personnel regulates traffic on Santhome High Road in Chennai

There are certain services that can’t be run from home, no matter how much we stretch our imagination; some professionals have to put themselves out there. Those that come readily to mind are the ones engaged in conservancy operations, those who regulate traffic, and of course, those who are in the medical field. The list is longer than this; and their services of these professionals certainly assumes considerable value in these times. There are animators with Greater Chennai Corporation, one for each ward, who are tasked with the job of heading to the households in their ward and talk to them about proper waste management, which includes source segregation. They also issue pamphlets to residents on how to go about it. In these times, animators are being employed in raising awareness among the public about how to stay sanitised so that they check the spread of the new Coronavirus — the awareness sessions are not restricted to houses, but is also conducted in public places where people are seen gathered. Vidhya Padmanabhan, GCC animator for Ward 175, says that animators carry out this work along with sanitary inspectors.

“Now, we also head to bus stands, tea shops and other public places, and hand out pamphlets on sanitisation, and also talk to them about it.” In some cases, the effort is accompanied by a demonstration. “We also want conservancy workers to be safe by using sanitisers properly, and so demonstrations are organised for them,” says Vidhya.

When The Hindu Downtown got in touch with an official of the Solid Waste Management department of Greater Chennai Corporation, on the measures taken to ensure the safety of conservancy workers in these times, he said they have been provided with masks and gloves.

Now, the moot point is whether enough attention is being paid to ensure they use these safety aids, and if they do, use it properly.

Conservation in these times

This is that time of the year when Olive Ridely turtles come into focus in our parts. The sea turtles need us to protect the eggs they lay on the coast from predation on account of stray dogs, and also some humans who have developed a taste for these eggs. As forest officials and volunteers engaged in this work go about doing this work, residents are allowed to go along with as a conservation awareness exercise after they have obtained permission from the Forest Department. Earlier, some stringent rules were said to have been put in place to ensure only those sincere about conservation got to go on these walks. At that time, C.H. Padma, Wildlife Warden, Chennai, said that the measure was taken to uphold the objectives of these walks. Now, with the spectre of COVID-19 over us, the public can’t go on these walks. “The conservation exercise will be carried out by the forest department staff and volunteers of Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN). As social distancing is crucial, we don’t want a big collection of people to do this work. So, instead of two slots, the forest officials and SSTCN volunteers will be divided into very small groups and do the conservation work in four time slots,” explains Padma. This olive ridley turtle nesting season is said to have gotten off to a late start, beginning only in mid-January, and it is now in its crucial stage.

Many of them need this walk to fight certain medical conditions and stay healthy. The fitness walks they on go on, in the morning and evening refresh their mind, as they have healthy conversations. As social distancing being the battle cry, and there has been a government directive not to gather at beaches and other public places, most of the Association members are staying away from the beach sands which is just a hop, skip and a jump away from home for most of them.

T. Arunachalam, secretary, East Coast Beach Walkers Association, says, “As part of safety measures, there is a considerable drop in fitness walkers at the beach. Walkers in our Association know what is at stake -- as many of them have some medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and asthma they want to take the utmost precaution and stay away from the beach. Even those walkers who head to the beach maintain a good distance between each other, while walking on the beach sands.”

Arunachalam continues, “Many members of the Association would head to the beach to have the cowebs of the mind cleared, by having a friendly chat with their friends, Now, they are content having those conversations on the phone.”

East Coast Beach Walkers’ Association has put out an advisory on how to stay safe from the Coronavirus, at the Thiruvanmiyur beach.

First the parks close, and then the playgrounds

As part of the social-distancing strategy to check the spread of the new Coronavirus, the Greater Chennai Corporation issued a directive, closing down the parks within its limits from March 18. Following this move, in certain parts of the city, especially the extended areas, including Ambattur, Mogappair and Thirumullavoyal, there were reports of morning walkers moving to playgrounds for their fitness walks. However, this was short-lived.

On March 20, GCC shut down all the playgrounds within its limits covering all the 200 wards in 15 zones. Field level civic officials were instructed to lock all playgrounds until further orders from the government. “Local civic officials locked the playground in TVS Colony Main Road today morning (Friday) after asking visitors to leave the facility, which is maintained by the Corporation,” says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase - II Residents Welfare Association. It is said that when fitness walkers shifted to playgrounds, some residents’ associations raised the matter with local civic officials.

Disappointed that even playgrounds were out of bounds for them, started having their daily walks on arterial roads. At Nolambur, 2nd Main Road and Mogapppar West in particular, a number of people were seen walking on roads.

They miss the Marina

Morning walkers to the Marina beach seem to be badly missing their routine.

Reportedly, a huge number of them were seen at the beach on March 21 — some passers-by took to Twitter to express their displeasure over what they saw, and sought that severe restrictions be imposed so that people would not throng the Marina.

A few even tagged the Prime Minister’s office; some tagged the Tamil Nadu Health Minister.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pd4fsp/article31128511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22DCWALKERSWALKINGROAD4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/change-in-routine/article31128513.ece
503,2020/03/21,CMWSSB pipes occupy footpath in Ramapuram,"Residents want these pipes to be kept at the CMWSSB’s office which is located nearby

For the past few weeks, rows of new water pipes are found stacked on the newly laid footpath along Mount – Poonamallee Main Road (opposite DLF information technology park) in Ramapuram. They have been kept there by the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB).

Interestingly, residents say that the CMWSSB has its local office within a kilometre where sufficient space is available to keep these pipes.

The pipes are meant to carry water from Porur lake and other water-bodies from the outskirts to overhead tanks and water-filling points, maintained by the CMWSSB, to extended areas of the Greater Chennai Corporation, especially localities in and around Ramapuram.

Residents say that these pipes should be removed from the footpath and accommodated at the CMWSSB’s local office.

“As an IT park and a big shopping complex are located on this stretch, a footpath is very essential. Although many of the IT employees work from home, due to the outbreak of COVID -19 pandemic, people will start using the footpath once normalcy returns,” says S. Premkumar, a resident of Porur. During rush hour, many people prefer to take Mount – Poonamallee Main Road as it is a shorter route to reach Anna Salai rather than taking the chaotic Arcot Road. Therefore, a footpath becomes all the more relevant.

In this regard, a CMWSSB official says “Steps will be taken to relocate the pipes from the footpath at the earliest.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jt2vty/article31128072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22dctngrRamapuramJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cmwssb-pipes-occupy-footpath-in-ramapuram/article31128073.ece

The Chennai Corporation’s shelter helpline is being inundated by calls from residents of other districts and States, who are stranded in the city after being turned away from a few lodges, following the COVID -19 scare.

The Shelter for Urban Homeless Scheme under the National Urban Livelihood Mission, is being implemented by the Public Health Department of the Greater Chennai Corporation in the city.

There are a total of 51 shelters including 13 special shelters in hospitals for attenders of patients. The staff has advertised the GCC helpline number 1913 and shelter helpline numbers 044-25303849 and 9445190472 to help the homeless in the city during the Janata Curfew and to provide them with a roof on other days as well.

“However from Saturday morning till noon we have got close to 50 calls from different parts of the city and neighbouring towns asking if shelter would be provided as people have been asked to vacate lodges. We guided them to the nearest shelter and provided them with the shelter co-ordinator’s number,” said a staff member of the shelter helpline. He said that the staff have been going around and distributing notice to the homeless asking them to stay in shelters on Sunday (Janata Curfew) and other days as well. Many NGOs have also come forward to provide food at the shelters.

“We have been cleaning the shelters at least six times every day and are providing the residents with food and boiled cumin water. New residents are admitted only after they are checked for symptoms in nearby hospitals. We also make them wash their hands using soap and water mixed with neem and other natural disinfectants,” said Asha Parek Nandini, city level coordinator, Shelter for Urban Homeless

A senior GCC official said that they are creating awareness among the residents about COVID – 19. “We will be taking ambulances and jeeps on Sunday and going around the city to help stranded people. They will be brought to the shelters,” said another staff member.

Vanessa Peter, policy researcher, Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities, said that there is an immediate need to open community halls or schools for homeless families to stay protected.

Meanwhile Greater Chennai Corporation officials have clarified that they have not asked lodges to turn away customers, but have advised them to clean their rooms and premises regularly and take precautions.

“There is no need to panic. We are providing assistance to those who do not have accommodation. Those who have homes can stay there itself.

In the wake of the State government asking residents to take precautions against COVID -19, residents associations across the city are pitching in to help sanitary workers and others who serve the society by providing them with masks and hand sanitizers.

One such association is the Seeniamman Koil Nagar, Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board Residents Welfare Association. Members of the association have distributed over 50 hand-stitched cotton masks to sanitary workers, flower vendors, hairdressers and tea shop workers in the locality.

“D. Sumathy, a resident of Block 8, stitched the masks. This is the maximum we could afford, and through this action we also created awareness amongst them about washing hands with soap and social distancing,” said R. Boopalan, joint secretary of the association.

Meanwhile, the Chennai Journalist Colony Welfare Association, which has over 200 families, has provided masks and sanitisers to the members of Narikurava community who have been collecting garbage in the colony for the past 15 years.

“They come into the colony at 8 a.m and work here till 11.30 a.m. They go to every part of the colony and collect garbage. To ensure they are safe, we provided them with masks and sanitisers. They have started wearing them,” said S. Ashok Kumar, treasurer of the association.

V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar West Extension, Phase 2 Residents Welfare Association, said that his association provided 113 masks to sanitary workers. “We also provided them with disposable caps.

507,2020/03/21,COVID-19: Government schools are shut but teachers work,"The Tamil Nadu Teachers Association has sent representations to the Chief Minister and the Education Department, questioning the need for them to be in schools

The Tamil Nadu government has closed all schools in the State as part of the preventive measures taken against the spread of COVID-19, but teachers in government schools are still reporting for duty.

In a circular, the Director of Elementary Education has asked all elementary education teachers to begin preparations with regard to the 2020-2021 academic year’s teaching plan. The teachers have been instructed to work on lesson plans, student classroom activities and timetables, among other aspects.

“Most private schools are closed for both students and teachers. Why is it that all teachers, especially those teaching lower classes in government schools are expected to come in to work?” questioned a high school teacher from Chennai.

Concerns have been raised following the government’s decision to continue with the conduct of board exams despite the CBSE and ICSE postponing their exams.

The Tamil Nadu Teachers Association too, has sent representations to the Chief Minister and the Education Department, questioning the need for them to be in schools and stating that teachers who are on invigilation duty too, are vulnerable.

A senior official from the Education Department said that they were yet to receive any communication with regard to granting teachers leave. “Since the board exams for classes 11 and 12 are still going on, they might be needed for some urgent work,” he said.

Class XII students in Tamil Nadu have an exam on Tuesday and Class XI students have exams on Monday and Thursday.

When asked about the measures in place for the safety of students and teachers, S. Kannappan, Director of School Education, said that the classrooms in exam centres are thoroughly disinfected in the mornings, before an exam.

“Students are allowed to enter only after they wash their hands with soap and use hand sanitizers that have been provided. Through the last week, these were made available in all exam centres across the state,” he said.

To keep a tab on schools that might hold special classes for students despite an order for a shutdown, officials from the School education department have been visiting schools in their jurisdiction.

“Schools are also being called and reminded of the rules in place and told that strict action will be taken if they flout them. So far, we have not received any complaints of students being asked to come to school,"" Mr Kannappan said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-government-schools-are-shut-but-teachers-work/article31126668.ece

512,2020/03/21,Chief Justice appeals for social distancing,"‘It is not to quit life or stop living, it is to secure your life as well as that of others’

The Chief Justice of Madras High Court Amreshwar Pratap Sahi on Friday wrote a fervent open letter to lawyers, litigants and judicial officers across the State urging them to practice social distancing stringently though it may appear onerous. “It is not to quit life or stop living. It is to secure your life as well as that of others,” he told them.

In the four-page letter, “A thought and a sincere request”, he said the virtues of a disciplined life were at times hard to inculcate and those virtues included the art of resisting temptations. The most difficult and trying discipline was how to resist temptations. One of such temptations, basic to human life, was the desire to associate. “This freedom of association is a hard won freedom and any curtailment counters this temptation to associate and socialise. But there is higher value in life that was enunciated by a French philosopher and mathematician Descartes who said that the philosophy of life lies in understanding what to sustain and what to abstain from,” the letter read.

With that background in mind, he stressed upon the need to meet the challenge posed by COVID-19. He said a remedy was not yet in sight to tackle the pandemic and such a situation had reaffirmed the belief in the old adage — prevention is better than cure. “Prevention is the diagnosis of the hour and the remedy is to avoid congestion and maintain distance.

“We have to realise that we can now care for ourselves and for others by maintaining a distance howsoever paradoxical it might appear to us. Avoidance of close association and contact is to help others. We have become vulnerable and we are now largely dependant on the considerate behaviour towards each other,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/h6vjum/article31123677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THHCCJ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chief-justice-appeals-for-social-distancing/article31123678.ece
513,2020/03/21,Sleepless during a pandemic: Insomnia going viral,"The World Health Organisation has increasingly focused on non-communicable diseases such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer which could lead to long term disability, complications and mortality. Sleep disorders which are more common than these and can, in fact, lead to several of these problems are often forgotten.

With the COVID-19 Pandemic, more people are sleepless and now waking up to this issue. The fear of disease, travel restrictions, social isolation and inactivity, financial losses and the overall looming uncertainty contribute significantly to lack of sleep. When the mind is disturbed, insomnia often follows and may lead to psychosocial problems including anxiety and depression. Untreated sleep disorders could also lead to poor control of blood pressure and diabetes.

In these difficult times, simple measures could go a long way in helping a person sleep better.

Inactivity in general can reduce sleep time. Public spaces such as malls, gyms and parks are not accessible due to restrictions and should be avoided. Simple stretches and yoga at home, walking around the house or in the terrace (which could also help with sunlight exposure) would help.

For those who are working from home, create an appropriate work environment at home and work during specified hours. It is important to have a scheduled sleep and wake up time even though there is no compulsion to sleep on time or wake up early while at home.

Healthy eating at the right time and particularly having dinner at least 2 hours before bedtime is essential. Milk, honey and banana have sleep promoting substances and may be consumed before bedtime if there are no reasons not to. Families can also take this opportunity to have meals together which often doesn’t happen when each one is busy with their professional commitments.

Engage in relaxing activities with the family (such as indoor games), reading books and watching television. These would not only prevent boredom but help to keep the mind distracted from worries and fear.

Visiting family members locally if possible (unless anyone involved is quarantined) may be an opportunity to connect and relax. Communicating through video and audio calls with near and dear who are several miles away would help confirm their wellbeing and allay fears.

While two or three cups of coffee or tea per day is acceptable, it is best to avoid stimulants at least 4 to 5 hours before bedtime. Reducing or preferably stopping smoking and alcohol consumption would enhance quality sleep

Patients who have prior sleep problems should contact their doctor early if they encounter any issues while on their current treatment. If travel is a concern, options of tele-consultations should be considered.

Disasters and mass tragedies can lead to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) which can be prevented by taking appropriate measures during the Pandemic.

514,2020/03/21,"Provide food, shelter to the homeless during ‘Janata Curfew’: HC","‘If needed, use community halls, schools’

The Madras High Court on Friday directed the State government to accommodate all street dwellers in ‘night shelters’ run by local bodies and also provide them free food during the ‘Janata Curfew’ called for by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday when most of the eateries are likely to be closed through the day.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Hemalatha issued the direction at the request of advocate A.P. Suryaprakasam who pointed out that the poor living on pavements and roadsides would be the most affected during the self-imposed restriction on public movement, except for emergencies, across the country from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday.

During the course of a habeas corpus petition argued by him, the lawyer apprised the court of the difficulties that could be faced by the homeless poor during the curfew. He said, the government should take steps to house the homeless poor in schools, community halls and marriage halls as it was done during calamities such as floods.

Agreeing with him, the Bench in its order said: “As rightly pointed out by Mr. Suryaprakasam, in these days of crisis, the interest of daily wage labourers and poor workers should be taken care of by this court especially during ‘Janata Curfew’ as this court is a constitutional court. Therefore, it has to incidentally consider the plea made by him.

“Though it is submitted by Raja Srinivas, standing counsel for Greater Chennai Corporation, that 51 night shelters were available in the city, the government and the corporation are directed to inform through media about the availability of such shelters to those who dwell on roadsides. It is also the duty of the government to provide food to them during ‘Janata Curfew’.

“If necessary, the government and the corporation shall utilise the community halls, marriage halls and schools for this purpose on March 22, 2020,” the court ordered.

51 shelters

Homeless people in the city may stay in the 51 shelters maintained by Greater Chennai Corporation on Sunday. This would be in support of the people’s curfew urged by Prime Minister.

Amid complaints of masks being sold for high prices, the Tamil Nadu Chemists’ and Druggists’ Association has assured the State government that it is ready to sell surgical masks — in two-ply or three-ply — as well as N95 masks for the procurement price.

Shortly after meeting the Health Minister and senior health officials, K.K. Selvan, general secretary of the association, told reporters that though masks and hand sanitisers were declared essential commodities, the Centre was yet to fix the rates for both commodities. He said that both masks and hand sanitisers do not fall under the Drug Price Control Order.

“The market rates of masks vary each day and according to place. For instance, the price of two-ply masks earlier was ₹5-6 and now, it is being sold for ₹15-20. In Chennai, these masks are priced at ₹25 today. N95 masks are sold for ₹350-375,” he told reporters.

However, he said that the problem was that people were buying more masks than they needed. Similarly, there was an increase in the purchase of hand sanitisers, he said. Officials said the Department had sealed 32 medical shops across the State for selling masks at higher rates.

The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association has urged doctors, except those involved in the management of COVID-19 and emergencies, to stay as a “reserve force”, according to its president K. Senthil..

“Doctors, paramedics – except those in COVID-19 management and emergencies – hunker down. Stop outpatient duty and elective procedures….Come in turns.

The Madras High Court on Friday imposed a ban on all forms of protests, processions and demonstrations across the State until the threat of COVID-19 abates and directed the State government to issue an advisory, asking people to either postpone or reduce the gathering considerably, even in private functions such as marriages.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy issued the directions on a batch of cases filed against anti-CAA protests held across the State. One of those cases had sought for action against Tamil Nadu Thowheeth Jamath for having organised a ‘fill the jails’ protest near the High Court premises on Wednesday, despite the threat of the viral infection.

The senior judge in the Bench told lawyers that one of his acquaintances had postponed a marriage that had been fixed and hence it would be advisable if people avoid crowd in social gatherings. “The above mentioned directives are illustrative in nature as the spread of coronavirus shall not differentiate the nature of gatherings,” his order read.

The judges accepted a request made by advocate T. Mohan for a long adjournment of the batch of cases since a huge number of lawyers gather inside the court hall during every hearing and there was a threat of the infection spreading from one person to another. What applies to mass gatherings elsewhere should apply to court proceedings, he said.

Advice against travel

520,2020/03/21,Every man is a part of the main,"As literature and history show, crises, which are great levellers, can be overcome by banding together

In the Kannada novel, Samskara, by Jnanpith awardee U.R. Ananthamurthy, the upper caste Brahmins in a village deep in rural north Karnataka, who are caught in the grip of an epidemic face existential dilemmas. Their deeply held religious beliefs and rituals are on test. The chief priest of the village, Praneshacharya, a devout, austere Brahmin, has to provide the answers. His neighbour, Naranappa, an irreverent, rebellious Brahmin, who has a hedonistic lifestyle, and who mocks the Brahmins and their rituals and their superstitions, suddenly takes ill and dies.

Story of contrasts

There is no one to bury him even as the body begins to decompose inside his house in the ‘Agrahara’, the Brahmin quarters, because the Brahmins fear they may invite the wrath of the gods and worry about being excommunicated by the head priest of the mutt for cremating a renegade and heretic. They appeal to Praneshacharya to consult the scriptures and find an answer to the problem. Praneshacharya immerses himself in holy texts and prayers but no revelations come to him.

As time rolls by, rats in their thousands die and lie strewn all over the streets, while vultures begin hovering over Naranappa’s house. More people start dying in the village and the epidemic kills without discrimination. The village is under the deadly scourge of the plague. The Brahmins are hungry and are not allowed to eat till the cremation is completed. Chandri, Naranappa’s companion, is distraught as Dalits cannot enter the Agrahara and refuse to come to her aid. She offers all her jewellery to Praneshacharya and urges him to give it to the Brahmins to bury Naranappa. The Brahmins have by now eaten stealthily. A few relatives of Naranappa lay claim to the jewellery and lobby with Praneshacharya; if they get the jewellery, they will cremate Naranappa. They argue that there may be some provisions in the holy books whereby Naranappa can be cremated under the circumstances they find themselves in.

The scholarly Praneshacharya, who is steeped in iron-clad traditions, is aghast by the unscrupulous behaviour and the greed and does not give his consent till he finds an answer in the holy books. Unable to find any guidance he heads to a temple beyond the village across the woods, and seeks refuge in prayers in the temple. On his way back to the village well past midnight he meets Chandri in the forest who stops him and falls at his feet. He is soon swept away by her irresistible attraction. When he wakes up as the sun rises, he is overcome by shame and remorse, unable to face the Brahmins who are waiting for an answer. He leaves the village under the cover of darkness, devastated.

Chandri, who is desperate to get Naranappa buried at all costs before the body is devoured by rodents, gets a Muslim merchant, a friend, who commiserates with her helplessness, to cart away the rotting body with her help and cremate it.

This is a powerful story that shatters you and exposes the venality and hypocrisy and heartlessness of the upper castes and at the same time juxtaposes it and reveals the joyful, earthy humaneness and magnanimity of the peasants, Dalits and the robust, healthy cheerful outlook of a lone Muslim merchant of the town, who finds strength and common purpose in fraternity and solidarity rising above petty differences.

Many meanings

Then, there is another era and continent. In a different context, in Albert Camus’ The Plague. Here, in the city of Oran in Algeria, an epidemic of bubonic plague breaks out. As dead rats start piling on the streets and people start dying, the authorities, who are in denial and indifferent to the deaths, finally impose a quarantine. Overnight, the people of the city find themselves imprisoned. The total seclusion affects their daily lives and the impact on families suddenly separated from their loved ones throws the town into hysteria and panic. A priest uses the opportunity of the plague, and, invoking his god, preaches refuge in religion to overcome the deadly attack to advance his own standing in the town.

The Plague can be read at many levels. At one level it depicts the human condition when natural disasters sweep a city and affect everyone without discrimination and hold sway over the destiny of human beings caught in such a tragedy. It is also about sacrifice, love, friendship, generosity and connectedness while facing death collectively through stoic courage by confronting external forces beyond one’s control through fraternity and solidarity. And the story also speaks of the pettiness and the cowardice of those who flee from one’s responsibilities to the community. At another level it is an allegorical depiction of the French Resistance against Nazi occupation during the Second World War. The plague is a metaphor for Hitler and the invading German Army.

On the other hand when you are under siege (as it happened to the Jews under Hitler, and France and other countries of Europe which were under occupation by the Nazis Germans during the Second World War), or condemned to live under dictators who are an embodiment of evil (as in Stalinist Russia), when life and death were both uncertain or when you are caught in the inexorable vortex of events of history (such as the partition of India and Pakistan, or the Sikh massacres of Delhi in 1984, the Gujarat riots of 2002, the Syrian war or the recent riots in north-eastern Delhi), and when you have nowhere to run or hide, you realise you may be swept away in the tsunami of hate. You are fated to die, may be perchance to live and your house, shop, or factory may go up in flames depending on your caste, religion, belief and colour of your skin. In times of riots and sectarian clashes that may suddenly flare up or which are stoked by vile politicians and community leaders, and if it rages across regions, and if you happen to be a Jew in a Muslim neighbourhood, or if you are Black or coloured caught in a white supremacist area, or a Hindu in a Muslim-dominated mohalla, a Muslim in a Hindu-majority district or a Dalit in an upper caste locality or a Yazidi or a Christian in a territory invaded by the Islamic State, your destiny is not in your hands. It is determined by your race and religion and colour. It is decided by the vile things men do when their heart is ruled by hatred, bigotry, obscurantism, stupidity and fanaticism and a lust for power.

Only destruction

When a pandemic, a tsunami, an earthquake or a flood ravages mankind, it devours everyone — infants and the old, men and women, the sick and the healthy, all races of all religious and people irrespective of their ideological and political denominations. It is blind in its fury and swallows everything in its path, relentless and implacable as it marches on.

A communal or racial flare-up though may appear to the blinded zealot to be to his benefit or to his community’s advantage; in the end, the blazing fire of hate will engulf everyone. It will spare no one from both sides of the conflict. It is more destructive than the natural disaster wrought by the gods and is sure to annihilate all.

There is only one way. We must all band together to fight evil. Whether the evil is a scourge of pandemic such as the novel coronavirus outbreak or whether the evil deeds are perpetrated by a few who stoke the fire of hatred, in the end, let us not forget that it will devour us all.

As the poet, John Donne, poignantly said: “No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main, ... Any man’s death diminishes me, because I’m involved in mankind. And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”

521,2020/03/21,"Letters to the Editor — March 21, 2020","A call to action

The Prime Minister’s address to the nation seems to have had a remarkable effect (Page 1, “COVID-19: PM calls for social distancing, people’s curfew”, March 20). When I went out for some essential purchases, it was an eerie experience as there was silence all round. When I did come across a group of people, their voices were muted. The Prime Minister’s appeal that there should not be any hoarding is also timely. As a nation we are notorious in shying away from expressing our gratitude to people who do service away from the glare of publicity. Here, the appeal to appreciate the services of those in health services is again an example of statesmanship. This is an opportunity to demonstrate that irrespective of personal belief, ideology, language, caste and religion, we stand behind the nation.

H.R. Bapu Satyanarayana,

Mysuru

This was a thought-provoking speech touching all the key points in the fight against COVID-19. His two most important pieces of advice are: resolve and restraint so that the spread of this viral disease is kept under check. His message of appreciation for health-care workers is praiseworthy. Finally, we should all abide by the golden advice tendered by doctors.

Mani Natarajan,

Chennai

Mr. Modi’s call for a ‘people’s curfew’ reminds one of the time former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri appealed for unity to counter the food crisis in 1964. One hopes that the chain of action extends to other Sundays till the pandemic is totally under control. The global outbreak requires single-minded and joint efforts by all nations.

N. Visveswaran,

Chennai

Many are already aware of the advice given by the Prime Minister thanks to aggressive awareness programmes in the media. The only takeaway from his address was his call for participating in what he called a “Janata Curfew” on Sunday. There was not a word about the levels of preparedness and steps for ramping up testing facilities, especially at an affordable cost. He was also silent on steps to help the private sector produce and validate its testing kits. This is not “ease of doing business”. There is a huge demand for protective gears which have disappeared. Mr. Modi should have addressed these issues instead of indulging in symbolism.

Nature’s message

President Ram Nath Kovind’s article (Editorial page, “COVID-19: What nature seems to be telling us”, March 20), is relevant to humanity in more ways than one. As human beings, we have been divided by borders, religious beliefs, ethnicity, race, caste, creed and colour. The biggest truth of life is “the world is one family”.

After passing through this moment of overwhelming crisis, the world should realise that nobody is superior or inferior and that all human beings are equal; they are equally vulnerable too.

Shujaath Ahmed V.,

Ambur, Tirupattur, Tamil Nadu

The opportunity lies in deciphering the message of nature for humankind. The lessons of equality, interdependence, hygiene and respect for nature are those we must ponder over. As our hectic lifestyles are now on hold, let us take a moment to look back on our actions and their consequences on nature. We should use this opportunity to rise above barriers of religion, race and region.

Vaishali Singh,

Noida

The President of India, true to his style, quietly spoke from his heart to the readers, with humility, simplicity and straightforwardness. The pick of his message in the wake of the outbreakis clear: We realise how deeply each one of us is connected with everybody else. We are safe if we take care of the safety of others — not only of human beings but also of plants and animals.

To decongest the major municipal hospitals in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ordered all stable patients who do not require tertiary care to be discharged immediately to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The step will also help preserve the resources for future contingencies.

BMC Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said stable patients who require tertiary care will be moved to peripheral hospitals within 5 km of their residence. Outpatient departments (OPDs) looking after diabetes, asthma, hypertension, thyroid, haematology and geriatric patients will be shut till further notice. Patients have been directed to approach the nearest dispensary or peripheral hospital in their area.

OPDs of broad speciality will be restricted to 100 patients daily and those screening patients with cough, fever and cold will run round the clock to minimise inflow in casualty wards. Staff at OPDs will direct patients with symptoms of COVID-19, their contacts and people with travel history to affected countries to Kasturba Hospital, which has been dedicated to treat infectious diseases.

Appointments for routine and elective surgeries will be deferred for two to three weeks and patients with such appointments in the broad surgical speciality wards will be discharged. No floor beds or sharing of beds will be allowed and one-metre distance will be maintained between beds. Mr. Pardeshi has ordered all hospitals to conduct small-scale blood donation camps to create ample reserves for future exigencies. Doctors and paramedics screening patients at OPDs and casualty wards will have to wear protective gear.

Drivers of autorickshaws, taxis and app-based cab aggregators Ola and Uber are leaving the city by the thousands. The step-by-step lockdown of the city since the first positive cases of COVID-19 emerged has hit such drivers the worst.

Mohammad Yakub Khan of the State Action Committee for Ola and Uber drivers said around 15,000 drivers had left for their hometowns. He said, “Most drivers hail from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and their earnings this month have plummeted. On an average, they barely make ₹200 per day.”

Mr. Khan said while many left by road, some drove their cars home. He said, “Most of them have mortgaged their cars for cash to survive in their hometowns. We appeal to the Chief Minister to direct banks to exempt them from making EMI payments this month. Most of them pay EMIs up to ₹10,000 on car loans.”

Meanwhile, Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal was quizzed in a separate case and is expected to join the Yes Bank investigation soon.

The ED has been probing alleged malpractices on the part of Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, currently in judicial custody following his arrest earlier this month, in granting loans to Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) in exchange for kickbacks received through accounts of his family members. The CBI is also conducting its own inquiries against Mr. Kapoor, wife Bindu and three daughters.

On Saturday, Mr. Chandra, whose company is alleged to have unpaid exposures worth ₹8,400 crore to Yes Bank, reached the ED office at 11 a.m. for inquiries. He was summoned to appear last week but had cited prior commitments. Sources said he was questioned at length regarding the loans that were granted during Mr. Kapoor’s tenure as chairman and CEO, the procedures followed at the time and other formalities in securing the loans.

“Essel Group wishes to confirm that Dr. Subhash Chandra visited the ED office in Mumbai today and answered all the queries of the officials, to the best of his abilities. He offered complete cooperation in the future as well,” said a statement released by Essel Group on Saturday evening.

Mr. Goyal, whose company has also allegedly taken loans worth ₹550 crore from Yes Bank, appeared before the agency shortly thereafter in connection with a separate money laundering case registered against Jet Airways. He was questioned in the money laundering case on Friday too.

The ED had earlier questioned Reliance Group chairman Anil Ambani, whose company allegedly owes dues worth ₹12,800 crore to Yes Bank, in connection with the case. Officials said inquiries are being made with all major borrowers as part of a larger investigation into the finances of the bank during Mr. Kapoor’s tenure.

527,2020/03/21,2 booked for flouting orders to prevent spread of COVID-19 in Navi Mumbai,"Palghar police take action against 123 establishments

The Navi Mumbai Police have registered FIRs against two people for flouting government orders on precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The first case was registered suo motu by the Uran police against one Narayan Thakur, a resident of Jasai village, who arranged a wedding ceremony the previous day at the Raigad zilla parishad school’s ground.

“Due to the pandemic, we have invoked Section 2 of the Epidemic Act and the orders have been issued that five or more people are not supposed to gather anywhere in public. We are being vigilant about such instances and if anyone is found flouting the order, we are registering a case,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II) Ashok Dudhe said. Meanwhile, senior police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni, Uran police station, said the staff spotted the ceremony during patrolling. “On enquiring, we found that they had no prior permission,” he said.

Meanwhile in Kamothe, a family member of the man who had tested positive last week stepped out despite being advised home quarantine. The man, who had returned from Dubai with his wife had tested positive after 12 days of being quarantined while his wife tested negative. “The couple lived with their son and daughter-in-law, who were asked to stay isolated at home by the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC). Civic officers received a tip-off that the 34-year-old son went to Vashi to meet his brother despite this,” senior police inspector Balasaheb Tupe, Kamothe police station, said.

All three members of the family have now been moved to Gram Vikas Bhawan while the building they live in was being sanitised. “The patient has recovered and will be discharged soon,” said PCMC Commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh.

The accused in both cases have been booked under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Maharashtra Police Act.

Meanwhile, the Palghar police have taken action against 123 establishments in their jurisdiction since March 17 for flouting the provisions of the Disaster Management Act.

528,2020/03/21,"Advocate held for offering ₹50,000 bribe to policeman","He wanted officer to go easy on him, harass complainant

In a rare occurrence known as a ‘reverse trap’, the Palghar unit of the State Anti-Corruption Bureau has arrested a 58-year-old lawyer for allegedly offering a bribe to an officer with the Manor police.

In ACB terms, a government servant is considered as ‘trapped’ when he is caught red-handed accepting a bribe in a scenario set up by the ACB. A ‘reverse trap’, on the other hand, is one where a civilian offers a bribe to a government servant, and the latter registers a complaint with the ACB. Officials said as much as they would like it to be otherwise, reverse trap cases are few and far between as opposed to scores of normal trap cases every day.

Officials with ACB’s Palghar unit said they received the complaint against advocate Rajay Gaikwad on Thursday. “Mr. Gaikwad and another woman were accused in a case of outraging a woman’s modesty registered by the Manor police earlier this month. The complainant, who is at officer level, stated in his complaint that they offered him ₹50,000 in exchange for going easy on them and for harassing the complainant,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Kalgonda Hegaje, Palghar ACB, said.

The ACB then set about verifying the complainant’s claims. In multiple conversations between Mr. Gaikwad and the complainant, which were monitored by the ACB, Mr. Gaikwad allegedly offered up to ₹5 lakh to the complainant. He also promised to pay ₹50,000 as “goodluck”, a slang used to denote “token amount” or “goodwill payment”, which is basically a first instalment paid as a show of good faith.

Acting on the ACB’s instructions, the complainant expressed willingness to accept the bribe, and they agreed to meet at the Manor police station on Friday.

“Around 3.25 p.m. on Friday, Mr. Gaikwad handed over the bribe to the complainant, after which our personnel arrested him and charged him under the Prevention of Corruption Act. While the complainant had named Mr. Gaikwad and the female accused in his complaint, we have only arrested the former as our inquiries have only established his involvement in the offence,” Mr. Hegaje said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/advocate-held-for-offering-50000-bribe-to-policeman/article31131702.ece

The protest, which is being conducted on a relay basis from Mumbai Central and nearby areas, entered its 55th day on Saturday amidst concerns raised by various quarters of society over the ongoing novel coronavirus crisis. The women have themselves thinned out to ensure they maintain a safe distance from each other.

Maaz Azim, a volunteer, said, “The women are trying to continue the protest in shifts and are ensuring that not more than 50 people are present at a time. No one is thinking of putting an end to the protest, but a rumour was spread that some people are in favour of calling it off as a precautionary measure. This led to a conflict between two groups.”

He said it was during this time that Mr. Pathan and Mr. Ahmed were asked to leave by the police deployed at the spot, as all the men apart from the core protesters were being cleared out. The duo, however, refused, which worsened the situation.

“Mr. Pathan has contributed a lot in this protest and has helped the women whenever required, but that does not give him the right to disrespect any of them. In the past too, he had shown unpleasant behaviour towards women and alleged that they are taking a part in the protest for money. This had infuriated the crowd already and Friday’s events only antagonised them further,” Mr. Azim said.

He said the police was very cooperative and controlled the situation efficiently. Senior police inspector Shalini Sharma immediately called in reinforcements and took the duo into custody.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone III) Abhinash Kumar confirmed to The Hindu that both Mr. Pathan and Mr. Ahmed had been arrested. While Ms. Sharma could not be reached for comment, an officer with the Nagpada police said the duo have been booked for assault and outraging a woman’s modesty under the Indian Penal Code.

530,2020/03/21,Janata Curfew: sirens unlikely to sound PM’s battle cry today,"State government scrambles to find solution to defunct war-time sirens

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plea to citizens of the country to clap or ring bells following the sound of a siren to appreciate the work of those leading the fight against the COVID-10 outbreak on Sunday may come a cropper in the financial capital.

The State government may not be able to set off sirens in most places in the city because for the past one year it has been sitting on a proposal from the Director General of Civil Defence to overhaul its war-time emergency public siren system. As a result, only 15 to 20 of the 170 sirens atop government buildings will work at 5 p.m. on Sunday. Similar sirens atop government buildings in Nashik, Pune, Thane and Raigad are not in working condition and may not go off on time, officials said.

Mr. Modi in his address to the nation on Friday had urged State governments and administrations to sound war-time sirens to alert citizens to the start of the event. “At 5 p.m. on Sunday, stand at your door, your balcony to express gratitude to those who are working selflessly for all for us. I urge the State administrations to sound the siren in towns and cities so that people can then clap hands, clang on a plate, and in whatever way can thank those who serve us,” Mr. Modi had said.

However, Civil Defence officials said over the past five years they have removed 100-odd sirens from government buildings. The sirens atop police stations, fire brigades and State government offices are not connected to Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited’s (MTNL) cable system, which allowed them to function from a central control room during wars, emergency, terror attacks. These were installed in Mumbai and rest of the State following the Indo-China War in 1962.

Meanwhile, a new central technology could not be produced by MTNL due to lack of funds. “The MTNL was to provide us with a new technology, which would allow us to operate the sirens from a centralised control room. But somehow it did not work out. On Friday, we received a call from the Civil Defence headquarters in New Delhi following the honourable Prime Minister’s speech and we have informed them on the availability of just 10% to 15% of sirens,” said Sanjay Pandey, Director General of Civil Defence, Maharashtra. He added that the proposal for reviving the system was submitted to the Home Department a year ago.

Senior officials of the Home Department said they are considering making alternative arrangements if the sirens do not function. The system will be revived at the earliest. The Mumbai Fire Brigade may transport its vehicles as backup to sound the siren at 5 p.m.

At least 10 to 15 Indian nationals who are settled in the United Kingdom entered the country in 2017 using bogus passports, according to an investigation by the Mumbai Police Crime Branch.

The Crime Branch Unit VIII recently busted a gang of forgers in Mumbai that produced bogus passports using fake documents and sold them to Indians who aspired to work in the U.K. but were unable to secure visas owing to various reasons.

Immigration check

According to the Crime Branch officers, they learnt about the racket in February this year when a couple flying to Dubai was stopped at the Immigration Desk for a routine check. “The Immigration Officer smelled a rat as their passports stated that they were residents of Mumbai, but they evidently seemed new to the city. After sustained inquiries they confessed that they had obtained the passports using forged documents. The case was then handed over to us,” a Unit VIII officer said.

The duo, identified as Hitesh and Mita Patel, were arrested. During interrogation, they spilled the beans on the racket. “According to the couple, those with the surname ‘Patel’ wishing to work in the U.K. face many difficulties in getting visas. So they approached a gang in Mumbai that offered to get them passports under aliases in exchange for ₹15 lakh each,” said Akbar Pathan, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection I).

The gang members allegedly prepared a set of fake documents, including a leave and licence agreement for address proof, to obtain a passport from the Regional Passport Office in Mumbai. They then sent the clients on a trip to Dubai as their passports need an entry and exit stamp from at least one other country to qualify for a work visa in the U.K. The Patels were flying to Dubai when they were intercepted.

A Unit VIII officer said, “Working on the information, we arrested three gang members from various parts of the city over the last week. Inquiries revealed that they have sent 10 to 15 people to the U.K. since 2017. Once in the U.K., their clients tear up their passports, take up low-paying jobs for two to three years and apply for a new visa citing their work experience and clean record.”

The officer said the accused, identified as Manish Ghogari, Amit Agarwal and Bhavesh Shah, were preparing to send four more people to the U.K. when they were arrested. The police have seized from the accused 14 passports, 11 PAN cards and eight rubber stamps forged in the name of various government agencies.

“The accused have contacts in the U.K. who recommended them to Indians and the racket ran on word of mouth publicity. We are finding out details of the people they sent to the U.K. so that relevant authorities can be informed,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ltl978/article31123908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMGang,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gang-that-sent-indians-to-uk-on-bogus-passports-busted/article31123910.ece
532,2020/03/21,Bandstand blaze: spiritual healer succumbs to burns,"Author and spiritual healer Sidra Jafri (38) on Friday succumbed after sustaining 72% burns in a fire at Bandra’s Bandstand area on Thursday morning.

The fire at School of Awakening, a spiritual healing centre, had claimed the life of British national Evana Morrece (20). Jafri died at 2.53 a.m. while receiving treatment at Bhabha Hospital. The port-mortem report is awaited from Cooper Hospital, a police official said.

The cause of the fire is being investigated by a forensic team and the fire brigade. Samples from the sixth-floor flat of Sea Spring Apartments have been collected and sent for analysis.

Senior police inspector Vijayalaxmi Hiremath said, “The investigation is on. It is sad to hear about Jafri’s demise. We are giving our best to get all the information we can. As of now, no foul play is suspected.”

Jafri’s marriage certificate shows that she married a Pakistani national when she was 19. Her husband’s whereabouts are not yet known.

Meanwhile, the British Embassy has informed Morrece’s elder sister in London about her demise. The right to claim Morrece’s body has been given to Surina Mangat, a friend and speaker at School of Awakening.

The spiritual healing centre has branches across the U.K., Canada and India. Morrece is believed to have been a follower of the centre in the U.K. and later shifted to its office in Mumbai.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sw0pnq/article31123897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMJafri-Ivana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bandstand-blaze-spiritual-healer-succumbs-to-burns/article31123898.ece

“On Friday, some residents of his locality called us up to tell us that he was violating his home quarantine. We sent a team and took him to the SevenHills Hospital.

534,2020/03/21,NMMT slashes trips by 35.83%,"Number of passengers falls by 49.2%; income dips by 46.53%

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT) has reduced its trips by 35.83% with the number of passengers falling by 49.2% ever since a partial lockdown of the city was announced on Wednesday to curtail the spread of COVID-19.

NMMT had a dip in income by 46.53% till Wednesday. “The fixed passes have reduced drastically as people have stopped renewing them. Income has gone down by more than ₹15 lakh and hence we decided to reduce the number of trips,” said NMMT general manager Shirish Aradwad.

On an average, NMMT would ferry 2.50 lakh passengers. The number reduced to 1.95 lakh on March 3, with 72,328 at Turbhe depot, 67,039 at Asudgaon depot and 56,131 at Ghansoli depot. On Wednesday, it reduced further to 1.27 lakh, of which Turbhe, Asudgaon and Ghansoli depots had 48,470, 44,441 and 34,348 passengers respectively.

NMMT used to make a daily income of around ₹39 lakh but on March 3, the income dropped to ₹31.46 lakh. Turbhe, Asudgaon and Ghansoli depots made ₹11.15 lakh, ₹11.18 lakh and ₹9.13 lakh respectively.

This reduced further to ₹7.8 lakh, ₹7.65 lakh and ₹5.37 lakh respectively.

The average daily trips were 5,944, and Turbhe, Asudgaon and Ghansoli depots made 2,359, 2,366 and 1,219 trips respectively. On March 3, it went down by 19% to 4,778. Turbhe, Asudgaon and Ghansoli depots made 1,680, 1,977 and 1,121 trips respectively. The number dipped by 20% to 3,814 trips on March 18, and Turbhe, Asudgaon and Ghansoli depots made 1,336, 1,626 and 852 trips respectively. “The number of trips might go down even more if the number of passengers and income continue to fall.

535,2020/03/21,"No Sunday Mass in churches till April 4, archbishop tells HC","‘Taking proactive steps to prevent gatherings, social contact’

Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of the Bombay Diocese of the Roman Catholic Church, informed the Bombay High Court on Friday that its churches in Mumbai will not conduct Sunday Mass till April 4 as a precautionary measure against the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Senior advocate Joaquim Reis, who is representing Cardinal Gracias, conveyed the message to the court in response to a notice issued by the Bench of Chief Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice N.R. Borkar.

The Bench had issued the notice after it received a letter from advocate Savina Crasto pointing out that Sunday Mass was being held in churches across the city despite the government issuing guidelines to avoid events with large gatherings.

Ms. Crasto letter said the Eucharist is celebrated in Catholic churches and the ceremony witnesses large gatherings. Holy Communion is given during the ceremony, where bread and wine is offered to the faithful. She said though it pains her to seek the cancellation of Sunday Mass, it is necessary as it poses a risk to the general public.

Mr. Ries also submitted an affidavit filed by the archbishop clarifying that the diocese is fully conscious of the grave crisis facing the State and has already taken several proactive steps to prevent large gatherings and social contact.

The archbishop had issued a circular on March 17 instructing all churches within its the jurisdiction of the Bombay Diocese to avoid large gatherings and stop Novena services, observing the stations of the Cross, the Passo service, the meetings of associations at St. Michael’s Church in Mahim.

Responding to the letter, government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade on Friday informed the Bench that the church authorities had issued a circular on Thursday evening ordering the suspension of all Masses in churches till March 31.

The matter will now be heard of April 7.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8shwad/article31123784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMOSWALDGRACIAS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-sunday-mass-in-churches-till-april-4-archbishop-tells-hc/article31123785.ece
536,2020/03/21,"After ordeal, Indians in Philippines reach city","Frantic calls, viral video help students stranded at Singapore airport return home

A video, several phone calls and a long wait that seemed unending helped a group of 300 Indians, a mix of students and tourists, make their way out of the Philippines and head back home after a two-and-a-half-day ordeal across three countries.

Around 60 of them reached the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport on Thursday night after the State government secured permission for one flight to operate.

Gaurav Chavan (31), a cricketer and strength and conditioning coach from the city, was in Manila to complete a course. With the Philippines under lockdown from March 15, his course wound up a day earlier. He said, “On the morning of March 17, I and 299 other passengers left for India from Manila airport. We were then supposed to take a connecting flight from Kuala Lumpur to Mumbai. Most of my co-passengers were medical students.” They were then informed that India had imposed a ban on all flights from Kuala Lumpur and Singapore. Mr. Chavan said, “Not knowing what to do, we spent the night at Kuala Lumpur airport and were shifted to Singapore’s Changi airport the next day.”

Reaching out

Mr. Chavan, who has represented Mumbai Cricket Association at the junior level (State), said more Indians joined them at Singapore from countries like Australia. “I tried contacting a friend who is employed with the Maharashtra government to inform authorities about our situation. This friend helped us reach out to the authorities, following which Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and MP Anil Desai held a meeting with the officials in Delhi. They worked out a plan that allowed us to fly back to India,” he said.

Tanvi Bodas (20), a second-year medical student in Manila, said she was flying back home as her college had given students a break till April 15, but they ended up being stranded in Singapore. She said, “All the students informed their parents and they tried to help us. The State government authorities then got in touch with the Singapore government and the High Commission of India in Singapore. They then provided us with basic requirements like hand sanitisers and masks.”

Ms. Bodas and her friends then made a video explaining their dire situation and shared it with parents and friends who ensured that it went viral. She said, “This helped us to reach authorities in India and the public much faster.”

‘Good treatment’

Mr. Chavan said they received good care at the airport and were offered meals. He said, “We were the last lot that was allowed to fly to India from Singapore. We were screened for COVID-19 symptoms at the airport, given ‘home quarantine’ stamps and asked to stay home for 14 days.”

Ms. Bodas said students from Mumbai were asked to be in home quarantine for 14 days and those from other cities to be quarantined at a hospital in Mumbai. She said, “We reached two and a half days after leaving Manila. These days were stressful for us and our families.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/after-ordeal-indians-in-philippines-reach-city/article31123759.ece
537,2020/03/21,Project Mumbai to deliver essential supplies to the home quarantined,"Initiative aims to reinforce social solidarity at time of crisis

With the number of COVID-19 cases increasing in the State, Project Mumbai, a non-profit organisation, has stepped in to address the healthcare and grocery needs of the home quarantined by delivering medical supplies and groceries through a doorstep service.

The project will engage volunteer groups across the city to deliver prescribed medicines and grocery supplies. The initiative aims to reinforce social solidarity at a time of crisis, while also encouraging physical distancing and staying indoors for health reasons, said Shishir Joshi, CEO and founder, Project Mumbai.

“The city is in need of help. The discomfort will gradually increase for those at home,” he said. “It is an important time to pitch in and offer this kind of help, so that conditions are not made worse for people who are confined in their homes. It ensures that those under quarantine do not feel compelled to venture out to obtain essential supplies, thereby increasing the risk of infection to the public.”

The service will be available to foreigners who have been marked for quarantine at the airport as well as local people who have received a quarantine letter from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) after due assessment in localities.

For easier accessibility and wider outreach, the organisation is exploring possibilities of tie-ups with e-retailers for grocery supplies, and is finalising a tie-up with an e-pharma platform for medicines. The service is available primarily for the elderly and also those who have more serious concerns during their home-quarantining, which will be assessed on the go.

‘Need proof’

Mr. Joshi said, “We will need proof or reasons behind being quarantined; there has to be a logical justification. It can be a case of being tested positive, or if due to a case in a society, other residents are at high risk and have therefore been home-quarantined. So we will need to know the reasons behind it and crosscheck with the BMC, before we go ahead. It is also for elderly citizens, who are more vulnerable right now and are advised to not step out as a safety precaution.”

The project also makes it mandatory for volunteers to follow a medical protocol at work, with guidelines to wear masks and gloves, avoid physical contact or transactions and get an authentication of being home quarantined.

“It is more of a health concern and shouldn’t be made a social issue,” Mr. Joshi said, pointing out that since the outbreak, certain sections, such as people from the northeast have reported feeling ostracised by people from other communities. Ederly citizens, who are shown to be more prone to the virus, also claim to be feeling more vulnerable.

Project Mumbai is looking for volunteers to assist in the initiative.

538,2020/03/21,"From online concerts to sceenwriting classes, celebrities lift spirits on social media in time of social distancing","The Indian film fraternity has been employing Instagram Live in ingenious ways to fight the coronavirus scare

Home alone, anxious and triggered in the time of social distancing? Friday evening, under the sarvayogastudios Instagram handle, musician Ankur Tewari performed live online from his home for his fans spread out far and wide across the globe.

The playlist comprised easy, soothing melodies to help people relax — from songs talking of home and nostalgia, the popular ‘Dil beparwah’ to his signature whistling and singing in Gully Boy’s much loved ‘Jeene mein aaye mazaa’.

This was third of Tewari’s performances live streamed on Instagram in just a matter of one week. He held such virtual concerts from his own Instagram handle on March 15 and 18 as well, asking his listeners to “pay” him in “playlists”. He later shared those online, all to help people feel better in self-isolation. After all, as he puts it — “Music heals”.

He was instrumental is inspiring his colleague from the film industry, lyricist-singer-writer-actor Swanand Kirkire, who, thanks to the “amazing response” to a live performance on Instagram a couple of days ago, is set to do a repeat show on Saturday and again on the #JantaCurfew day.

Music is not the only way to reach out it seems. The film fraternity has been employing Instagram Live in ingenious ways, particularly uplifting in these COVID-19 inflicted times. Like filmmaker Ritesh Batra’s live screenwriting masterclass complete with an appreciation of Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen’s Singin’ in the Rain. “I do it every day in my writing break at 2 p.m. EST... We talk movies and writing and spread the word,” he writes to us, signing off with, “Stay safe and help everyone around.” Writer-lyricist-standup comic Varun Grover has been trying to talk common sense on the virus with humour thrown in, in good measure in his “rant videos” that he has been sharing on social media platforms.

Tewari took to the online world when faced with the disappointment of three of his gigs getting cancelled in the U.S. “I would have been in Los Angeles today,” he tells us. But the artiste’s itch wouldn’t still leave him. “I felt like playing for the people,” he says.

‘Impromptu, intuitive’

According to him, the online concerts have been “impromptu and intuitive, not rehearsed”. “They felt quite different from the earlier ones online. It was like people were in some Bombay pub, hanging out, listening to songs and having conversations,” he says.

Kirkire likes the flexibility and versatility. All you need is a guitar as accompaniment; perhaps not even that. He is also taken in by the interactive nature, the random requests for songs — ‘Bawra Mann’ and ‘O ri Chiraiya’. And some not even his own. “I wasn’t prepared but sang Kishore Kumar’s ‘Eeena Meena Deeka’ and Suresh Wadkar’s ‘Saanjh dhale gagan tale’ on demand,” he says.

In times when people are stranded indoors, having to fend for themselves, are all these initiatives aimed at community building? “It’s to remind ourselves that we are there for each other,” says Tewari. Kirkire feels that people are tired of consuming from the Over the Top platforms and would like newer and newer ways to stay engaged. He himself intends to start going beyond music to read poetry and prose in his future sessions. Whatever be the mode, the message to take home is simple: be responsible and avoid all social interactions.

Meanwhile, as we go to press, more such online events seem set to follow, involving independent and classical musicians. Musician Prateek Kuhad will hold one on Instagram and Facebook on March 25 in which he promises to play some new songs. The Home and the World #ShutInConcert, a Digital Carnatic Live Concert, to be held at 7.30 p.m. on March 29, aims to raise funds for artistes who have been displaced financially due to cancellations in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. A pay-per-access concert, which will be live streamed on Shaale.com, it is by and for those #TogetherAtHome and features T.M. Krishna, Akkarai Subhalakshmi, B. Sivaraman and N. Guruprasad.

Yet another event featuring Indian Ocean, Kuhad, Karsh Kale, Kamakshi Khanna, Karan Singh Magic and comics Vir Das, Aisi Taisi Democracy and others will also be streaming live soon on a computer, mobile or tablet near you.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/anpspd/article31123703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPAnkurTewariJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/celebrities-lift-spirits-on-social-media-in-time-of-social-distancing/article31123704.ece
539,2020/03/21,Man arrested for creating fake Instagram handles,"Used complainant’s photo as display picture

The Cyber Cell of the Navi Mumbai police has arrested a 32-year-old man from Uran for creating three fake Instagram handles of his sister’s 25-year-old friend.

The woman filed a complaint with the Uran police on February 20 and the case was transferred to the Cyber Cell. According to the complainant, the accused used her photo as the display picture of the handles.

“The accused then posted on one of the fake handles a vulgar picture that he had picked up from the internet. He then messaged the complainant and asked her to share one of her obscene pictures. When the complainant asked him to stop harassing her, he threatened to make her ‘Goa videos’ go viral if she did not pay him money or share a vulgar photo,” senior police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni.

Assistant police inspector Vishal Mane and the Cyber Cell team tracked the accused’s Internet Protocol address and nabbed him from Uran on Wednesday. “The accused worked in a logistics company and knew the complainant as she was his sister’s friend. The complainant did not suspect him and realised he was the accused only after he got arrested,” an officer said. The police said he got married two months ago and wanted to earn a quick buck.

Senior police inspector Jayraj Chapriya said, “This should send out a message that no offender can get away with crime. Every user should be cautious while uploading their photos on social media.” The accused was arrested under provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the IT Act and handed over to the Uran police. He has been remanded in custody till March 23.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-arrested-for-creating-fake-instagram-handles/article31123619.ece
540,2020/03/21,Five new cases in State; critical patient shifted to Jaslok,"Two of the fresh patients are from city, including a 62-year-old with diabetes and cancer

Five positive cases of COVID-19 were reported from Maharashtra on Friday, taking the total count of confirmed cases to 53. Those who have tested positive from Mumbai include a 38-year-old man with a travel history to Turkey and a 62-year-man with a travel history to U.K..

The three others include a 53-year-old from Kalyan with a travel history to Dubai, a 20-year-old from Pune who had travelled to Scotland, and a 22-year-old from Pimpri-Chinchwad who was a close contact of a patient who had travelled to the Philippines and Singapore.

State health officials said that of those who are admitted to hospital, 41 patients are currently asymptomatic and eight have mild symptoms. Two patients in Mumbai remain critical.

Deputy executive health officer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Dr. Daksha Shah, said the 62-year-old admitted in Mumbai on Friday is from ‘D’ ward. “He has diabetes. He also has cancer and is on chemotherapy,” Dr. Shah said.

Meanwhile, a 37-year-old man from Kalyan, who is in critical condition, was shifted to the Jaslok Hospital on Friday. The patient had a travel history to the U.S. His wife and three-year-old daughter continue to be in the isolation facility at Kasturba Hospital. Doctors said the patient has developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, but has no underlying ailments.

541,2020/03/21,Uddhav urges PM to increase testing capacity for COVID-19,"We need not be delusional about spread of coronavirus: CM

The country should not be delusional about the spread of the novel coronavirus in India, looking at its pattern all over, even if the present number of cases seems to be small, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday.

The CM urged Mr. Modi to increase the testing capacity for the disease. Mr. Modi held a video conference with Chief Ministers and Health Ministers of all States on Friday afternoon to understand the measures taken by the States in their fight against COVID-19.

“The Janta Curfew called by the Prime Minister has had a positive impact. The government of Maharashtra, too, has taken timely steps to stop the spread of the disease. However, even if the present number of patients looks small, we need not be delusional about the spread of the disease looking at the pattern all over,” Mr. Thackeray told the Prime Minister, according to a release issued by the Chief Minister’s Office.

Mr. Thackeray is also said to have raised the point of the possible arrival of thousands of Indians at international airports before March 22, after which international flights landing in India will be halted. “Before this, around 20,000 to 25,000 passengers are likely to return. These passengers will have to be quarantined or may have to be treated. Those arriving at international airports in Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur may try to reach their homes by vehicles and they need to be stopped. We have to find a solution for this,” he said.

Mr. Thackeray also requested that the capacity of testing centres and laboratories be increased. “We will need more facilities for quarantine as well as medicines, ventilators and more hospitals. We may have to take help from Army hospitals as well. We expect the Central government to make arrangements,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uddhav-urges-pm-to-increase-testing-capacity-for-covid-19/article31123428.ece
542,2020/03/21,City running out of isolation rooms,"State to allow passengers to travel home in dedicated buses

Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has informed the State government that not enough rooms are available in Mumbai to quarantine the large number of foreign travellers arriving in the city. The government has decided to allow people to travel to their hometowns and be quarantined there.

With 26,000 Indians expected to arrive at Mumbai airport from West Asian countries, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is dreading the strain on quarantine facilities. At present, the percentage of confirmed positive patients, being treated at Kasturba Hospital, is low. But even if 6,000 of the 26,000 passengers have to be quarantined in Mumbai, the BMC does not have that many beds.

Currently, Mumbai has 118 people in quarantine centres at Seven Hills Hospital, civic training facilities in Powai and Borivali, private hotels, government guesthouses, college hostels and dormitories. On Friday, 650 international passengers arrived in Mumbai. On Thursday, it was 800.

After Mr. Pardeshi’s request, the government decided to allow those people whose hometowns are within 300 km of Mumbai to be transported there in dedicated buses. If the number of people is smaller or the destination is farther, they will be sent in taxis. They will have no contact with the general public, and will have to pay for the transportation.

The collector has been asked to keep 15-25 buses and 20-25 taxis ready at the airport. The respective collector of that town will have to make arrangements to quarantine these people in hotel rooms and track their symptoms.

“This does not include any Category A (confirmed positive cases) passengers. It is only meant for Category C passengers (travellers who are completely healthy and have no symptoms). We can even include Category B people (travellers who are senior citizens) if they are willing,” said P. Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner in-charge of airports. He said this move is aimed at passengers coming from all countries.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/city-running-out-of-isolation-rooms/article31123394.ece
543,2020/03/21,Buildings at IIT-B to function as quarantine centres,"The facilities will house Category C passengers arriving from overseas who do not display symptoms

The Mumbai Suburban Collector has taken over some buildings on the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) campus in Powai to set up secure quarantine facilities for Category C travellers — air passengers arriving in India who do not show any COVID-19 symptoms.

In an email to residents of the IIT-B campus, institute director Subhasis Chaudhuri said the collector had issued an executive order to designate buildings on the campus as quarantine facilities, despite IIT-B’s strong objections.

“The campus is still alive with many students, staff, faculty members, their families and casual workforce. The collector’s officer has verbally assured [us] that the quarantine area will be properly secured [by the] police. The designated buildings are Vanvihar guest house, H-18, well-maintained part of H-8 (B-wing), and the MTNL guest rooms under us. While we understand the difficulties that the State is facing … the administrators of IIT-B were ordered under the provisions of the relevant Act. Kindly ensure maximum protection to your family and yourself,” the director said.

There was no official communication from IIT-B.

Government officials said quarantine facilities will be required to house several Indians stranded in West Asia who are expected to return over the next few days. According to the Centre’s guidelines, all arrivals from the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman need to be quarantined for 14 days.

Since 15 people who earlier arrived from Dubai have tested positive for COVID-19, the Brihanamumbai Municipal Corporation has converted one of its new training centres for its engineers in Powai into a quarantine facility, apart from the isolation facility at Seven Hills Hospital in Marol.

The Indian Navy, too, last week commissioned a 100-bed quarantine camp for those suspected to have been infected with the novel coronavirus, on the premises of its material organisation warehouse in Ghatkopar. This facility currently houses 44 pilgrims from Jammu and Kashmir who were brought back from Iran.

The Non-Academic Staff Association (NASA) of IIT-B said the decision was taken without discussing it with staff representatives.

“NASA is very strongly opposed to this decision taken by the institute authorities, as it will endanger the life of campus residents and students. If this could have been informed to us before, we could have also strongly opposed the government authorities. However, after knowing these facts, we are also trying our best to cancel this decision taken by government,” a note circulated on campus said.

544,2020/03/21,BMC orders private offices to shut; eateries to cap occupancy at 50%,"Civic chief’s directive follows Uddhav’s announcement

Soon after Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray declared that all private offices and establishments, barring those providing essential services, will remain shut till March 31, Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on Friday issued a formal order to this effect.

As there was ambiguity over operation of restaurants and eateries after the CM’s press conference, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has allowed restaurants, cafes, eateries and dhabas to continue to operate if they can ensure 50% occupancy and maintain a distance of three feet between customers.

The civic chief has also exempted manufacturing companies which require continuity of process or will suffer technical issues or heavy losses, from these restrictions. Such companies can work at 50% staff strength.

Under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the State has empowered municipal commissioners to issue orders in their respective areas to curb the spread of COVID-19. Until Thursday, Mr. Pardeshi had ordered shops to be shut on alternate days and private establishments to work at 50% or less staff strength. As these orders are now irrelevant following the CM’s directive, Mr. Pardeshi issued another order on Friday. “All privates, corporates and establishments to be completely shut down,” the order said.

The BMC has also exempted IT and IT-enabled services and data centres needed for continuity of IT services to essential services, ongoing infrastructure development projects for water, sewage, transportation and roads, and the stock exchange, clearing corporation, depositories, stock brokers and SEBI-registered participants operating through these institutions.

Foreign consulates have been allowed to decide for themselves whether to close operations. Others exempted include production, transportation and supply chain, and e-commerce of all essential goods, including food, pharmaceuticals, pest control and medical equipment, warehousing of all essential food, groceries and grain.

A civic official said, “The exemption for manufacturers is applicable to companies like chemical or pharmaceutical companies, where shutting down manufacturing can lead to heavy losses, long time to restart heavy machinery, disintegration of raw material or chemicals, or things that can lead to large-scale problems. They are exempt, but can only operate on 50% staff strength.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ioabdl/article31123343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMOFFICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-orders-private-offices-to-shut-eateries-to-cap-occupancy-at-50/article31123344.ece
545,2020/03/21,"6 pilgrims from Iran undergo retest, found to be negative","All 44 pilgrims will return to J&K after quarantine ends

Retest reports of six of the 44 pilgrims who returned from Iran last week have turned out to be negative for COVID-19.

All 44, comprising 24 women and 20 men, who completed eight days of quarantine in Mumbai on Friday, had already tested negative before being evacuated. Only six had shown symptoms, and hence were retested.

The pilgrims will return to their homes in Jammu and Kashmir after March 26, when their 14-day quarantine period ends.

The pilgrims, who were stranded in Iran, had arrived in Mumbai on March 13 and were shifted to a 120-bed quarantine facility set up by the Navy close to the airport on the Ghatkopar side.

“All the pilgrims underwent a test while they were still in Iran. Later, screening was done by Mumbai Airport Health Organisation at the isolation bay, and they were transferred directly from the aircraft to the Indian naval facility in Ghatkopar to follow the mandatory 14-day quarantine period. However, as six of them showed some symptoms of cough and cold, they were tested again,” officials said.

Naval spokesperson Commander Mehul Karnik said the quarantine centre is fully equipped and the functional facilities are helping inmates undertake the mandatory quarantine period under the supervision of skilled medical authorities. “Soldiers have volunteered to provide care and support to our countrymen returning from overseas. There are four such facilities in operation at the moment: at Manesar and Jaisalmer, run by the Army; in Mumbai, run by the Navy; and at Hindon, run by the Air Force,” Commander Karnik said.

These quarantine zones are working in synergy with the civilian authorities to ensure proper care to all evacuated citizens. The affected are also being provided with facilities to be in touch with their loved ones, while prophylactic measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the contagion.

Awareness campaigns are being undertaken to educate the people about COVID-19. The coordinated efforts of the Armed Forces with the local administration are bound to succeed in fighting the pandemic, he said.

In addition, more quarantine facilities are being readied and may be made operational within 48 to 72 hours, if needed. These facilities are at Jodhpur (Army), Kolkata (Army), Chennai (Army), Visakhapatnam (Navy), Kochi (Navy), Dundigal near Hyderabad (IAF), Bengaluru (IAF), Kanpur (IAF), Jaisalmer (IAF), Jorhat (IAF) and Gorakhpur (IAF).

The 44 in Mumbai are a part of the second batch of Indian pilgrims to return from Iran. All of them were part of a group of 120 Indians, 76 of whom returned to Delhi on March 15. The first batch of 58 Indian pilgrims were brought back on March 10.

Iran is one of the worst-affected countries and the government has been working to bring back Indian nationals stranded there. At the beginning of the month, there were over 6,000 Indians in various provinces of Iran. These included 1,100 pilgrims from Maharashtra and Jammu and Kashmir.

All the Shia Muslim pilgrims were in Qom city. The shrines in Iran attract millions of Shia pilgrims every year. Besides the pilgrims, there are 300 students in different parts of Iran.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8ro3y5/article31123311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bm-Iran,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6-pilgrims-from-iran-undergo-retest-found-to-be-negative/article31123312.ece
546,2020/03/21,"The two who got away, caused a scare","Two Navi Mumbai residents, who came to Kasturba Hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, caused a minor flurry by walking out without informing anyone. Authorities only breathed a sigh of relief when their results came back negative.

According to the Agripada police, the incident occurred on March 6 and was reported to them a day later. “The duo reached the hospital in the morning and underwent tests. They were kept under observation, as the results take several hours. However, it was discovered within a couple of hours that they were not in the ward,” a police officer said.

The hospital authorities, after confirming that the two patients were nowhere on the premises, informed the police early next morning.

“We sent personnel to speak to the doctors on duty and conduct other inquiries. However, by this time, their test results had come in, and they had both tested negative. A diary entry was made and security was stepped up at the hospital to avoid a repeat of the incident,” the officer said.

Personnel from the Local Arms division, have now been deployed at the hospital. The personnel said there have been repeated incidents of people getting into arguments with them saying they have no time to wait for test results and demanding they be allowed to leave. “The worst are those from well-to-do families who are brought from the airport. They refuse to see the point that they might end up infecting others,” an officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/the-two-who-got-away-caused-a-scare/article31123286.ece
547,2020/03/21,Flu patients crowd Kasturba OPD,"Such referrals by private practitioners put people at unnecessary risk, say doctors

Nearly 60% of the people queuing up at Kasturba Hospital’s COVID-19 outpatient department (OPD) have either been referred by private practitioners without taking proper history or are there as they have panicked. Doctors on the front line at the OPD say such referrals are putting people at unnecessary risk.

“In the past several days, I have seen many people in the OPD with slight cough and cold who have been referred to the COVID-19 OPD by private doctors. The patients are being referred for testing without the doctors checking their travel history at all,” said a resident doctor posted at the hospital.

Many people who have not travelled abroad or been exposed to a positive patient are also walking in. “Many of them are coming with children. They are simply putting themselves and their children at risk, as there is always a chance of a positive COVID-19 patient waiting in the queue,” the doctor said.

According to the current guidelines, those with a history of international travel who develop symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty in breathing should be tested. The Indian Council of Medical Research also says that healthcare workers managing respiratory distress/ severe illness should be tested when symptomatic.

Deputy executive health officer of the BMC, Dr. Daksha Shah, said they have held training programmes for members of the Indian Medical Association, Association of Medical Consultants and other doctors’ bodies so that patients with regular flu don’t get referred to the OPD. “As and when the guidelines change, we update them as well,” she said.

As on Friday, Kasturba Hospital has received 3,682 people in the COVID-19 OPD. The BMC has also started more COVID-19 OPDs at HBT Trauma Care Hospital in Jogeshwari, Bhabha Hospitals in Kurla and Bandra, and Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ax7y4m/article31123257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMKASTURBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/flu-patients-crowd-kasturba-opd/article31123258.ece
548,2020/03/21,"A relic, a misnomer and sheer poetry","The Jap cake is a colonial relic, but if you are a person in the ‘know,’ you will spot this creamy confection in the most obscure corners of a bakery

A little girl, her face pressed against the glass showcase, looked longingly at the tray of pastries dolled up in two-layered gowns, encrusted with crushed cashew nuts, and topped with a chocolate brown button at its centre. In her hungry gaze they seemed to twinkle back at her in the dim interiors of King Star, the confectionery at Charring Cross in Ooty.

The girl — part of a group of boarders from a school further up in the Nilgiri hills, out on a day trip with a ₹1 handout — was me. My grubby hands had held, not five minutes before, a softie ice-cream bought from Kurinji’s on the opposite side of the road after an endless queue. But can a boarder’s hunger ever be satiated?

Piece of bliss

“Sir, may I have a Jap cake please?” I asked the shopkeeper when he looked my way. I bit into this piece of bliss, cream oozing from all sides, cashew crumbs caked on my lips, between my teeth and in my hair.

That was the 20th century. Today, I have to go on a treasure hunt to find this delectable confection made of cashew nuts, egg white, and sugar. Some call it a meringue or a macaroon, others dismiss it — “Oh, it’s just two biscuits sandwiched with cream” — but to me, it remains poetry. Its glory days are over: Gen Z would rather have a dark Belgian chocolate gateau. But people in the ‘know’ can spot a Jap cake in bakeries in the narrow lanes. This time, with ₹30 in my hand, when I ask, “Sir, may I have a Jap cake please,” fellow customers often turn around and ask, “What’s a Jap cake?”

By all accounts, the Jap cake is a colonial relic. Plus, it’s a misnomer. There’s no Japanese connection and its crunchiness suggests that it’s a biscuit, not a cake. Murugan Max, a third-generation proprietor of King Star (instituted in 1942), tells me that his grandfather Thambuswami worked with an Englishman named D.R. Davis, before Independence, in Ooty. Davis, homesick for English chocolates, decided to turn entrepreneur and set up an eponymous confectionery. Thambuswami began working with him and learned the art of British confectionery, one among them being the Jap cake. When the British left, Thambuswami acquired the bakery and named it King Star.

Loyal gesture

But King Star in 2020 does not stock the Jap cake. Instead there are 40 varieties of chocolates arranged on platters in the now brightly-lit store. Murugan recalls that from 50 paise apiece, the price rose with that of cashew. “We stopped making it when my grandfather died. The cost was too high,” he says. But to loyal customers, he makes a promise, “Tell me when you come next and I will keep a tray ready.”

Excelsior Bakery in Shivajinagar, Bengaluru, has been selling Jap cakes since 1962, says Saipreeth, the proprietor’s son. He describes the Jap cake as having an outer shell of cashews with a biscuit-textured interior. It is baked at a slow steady temperature overnight and is oven-crisp by morning. And how did he acquire the recipe? “I don’t know. My great-grandfather had a partnership with an Englishwoman, and she may have handed him the recipe,” says Saipreeth. They make a batch of 70 once in three days. Excelsior started its bakery with a firewood oven, but this has been replaced with a contemporary diesel oven that cuts costs and maintains a steady temperature.

Two dozen a day

At Thomsons in Bengaluru’s Cox Town, the Jap cake rests in a forlorn corner. Renowned for his Christmas plum cakes, bakery owner Abraham Thomas gives the pastry a cursory look and says it has been around since the bakery’s inception in 1962. The recipe was passed down from one generation to the next. “We are a small place, and it is just one of the products,” says Thomas. Still, he sells two dozen a day.

A well-travelled friend swears he has tasted the best Jap cakes in Virudhunagar, Madurai, at Mahesh Bakery. Here too it sells at ₹30 apiece but the recipe is well-guarded and Mahesh says he has made a variant with pista. Next stop, Virudhunagar. I am as determined as William Wordsworth’s leech-gatherer, to “persevere and find them where I may.”

549,2020/03/21,When memories are 90% good,"I said, “Kamalam, why you are talking like WhatsApp forward? Just like that virus will come or what?

Respected Madam/ Sir,

Cannot switch on TV. News is worst. Cannot open newspaper. Headline is worst. Cannot open phone. WhatsApp is worstest of worst. Cannot meet friends. All talks are virus infection expiry only. So these days vipassana type silence is best policy.

This morning silently after brushing teeth Mrs. M and myself ate breakfast in total quiet. Afterwards she is seeing YouTube items on phone. I am reading superhit novel Kolymsky Heights by Lionel Davidson.

After half hour I thought maybe I will get up and put some extensions of arms and legs and all. I went towards balcony and suddenly Mrs. M is diving in my direction as if Jonty Rhodes of South Africa. I said, “Kamalam, what you are diving in undignified manner?” She said, “You want to commit suicide or what? Please do that when I am not there to see.”

I said, “Kamalam, please have some self-control. What nonsense you are talking? Anybody will talk about suicide type shanidosham topics? Already world is full disaster.” She said, “Old man that only I am saying. Why you are even stepping outside on balcony and taking risk. What if corona is there in atmosphere? It will enter through nose. Why you want to create tension for me?”

I said, “Kamalam, why you are talking like WhatsApp forward? Just like that virus will come or what? And if virus is coming in balcony means it will come through window also no? Maybe whole house is full of virus already. What you can do? Nothing. Sit, pray, handwash nonstop. All in the hands of Guruvayoorappa.”

She said, “How you can be peaceful? Everybody is saying virus bad for elderly person with heart and sugar issues. But Kamalam whether I have any heart or sugar problem? Please relax. Let us see film on DVD.”

But Madam/ Sir, she is looking totally upset. Face fallen like three days back appalam. So I said, “Ok ok ok I won’t go to balcony.”

She said, “I am feeling very afraid. Something happens to you means? Your whole family is heart and sugar fellows. Since corona news is coming I am feeling too much tension about your health.”

I said, “Kamalam, sorry for tension.” We sat quietly in the living room for 10-15 minutes. Then I said, “Kamalam, anyway one day we have to go only no? Whether you have enjoyed life or not?” She said, “Old man, don’t make me cry.” I said, “No no what crying and all. I am thinking about last 30-35 years. It is good life. Nice pension, nice house, nice enjoyments and all we have done, children are fine, house loan finished.”

“Kamalam,” I said, “whether you are remembering first flat after marriage? One small room only is there. Scooter used for drying clothes. Kitchen is size of India Today magazine. No TV and all. Only one old radio; Murphy or Philips, I have forgotten. That also we got in wedding gift.”

Madam/ Sir like that, like that we two began to think of lifelong memories from honeymoon to children to one time total confusion holiday when Kamalam is getting on one train but I am getting on different train. We laughed and laughed like anything.

She said, “Yes, 90% are good memories only. Then what is problem? When memories are 90% good means it is right time to go.” After five minutes she said, “Let us stand in balcony and see the outside atmosphere.” So we spent two-three hours in balcony with tea and tiffin. Whether any virus is come? So far no sign. Tomorrow who knows. Just enjoy.

Yours in reminiscences,

Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Saturday appealed to the people to completely participate in the ‘Janata Curfew’ from 7 a.m to 9 p.m on Sunday.

In a WhatsApp message to reporters, Ms. Bedi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi could have given the call for curfew owing to multiple reasons.

Staying away from public places for almost 14 hours would help prevent transmission of the virus, help people familiarise themselves with self-isolation and prepare for hardship in the coming days, the Lt. Governor said in the message.

Ms. Bedi, on Friday, had posted a WhatsApp message after visiting Jawaharlal Nehru Street, expressing dismay at people not practising social distancing and the absence regulations for shopkeepers.

“No self-restriction was seen in shops putting up special sale boards without making any efforts for social distancing. I am not sure people of Puducherry are realising the serious consequences of the spread of the virus,” she said.

Medical services would not be able cope with the rush to hospitals if people did not take care, the Lt. Governor warned.

The territorial administration on Saturday decided to impose Section 144 (2) of CrPC from March 23 to 31, restricting the gathering of more than four people in public places as a preventive measure to contain COVID-19, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said here on Saturday.

Addressing a press conference at the Assembly, the Chief Minister said the prohibitory order was necessary to avoid people gathering in large numbers.

“Though shops will remain open throughout the day, people should come out only to buy essential items,” he said, emphasising that people should avoid gathering in public places for a long time. The Beach Road will remain closed till March 31, he said, adding that these measures were necessary, taking into account the growing number of COVID-19 cases elsewhere in the country.

On Sunday, all shops, business establishments and liquor outlets will be closed in view of the ‘Janata Curfew’ announced by the Prime Minister, the Chief Minister said. The district administration has strengthened screening of people coming to the region at the border areas, he added.

Meanwhile, the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms has advised select departments to allow 50% of Group B and Group C employees to work from home by drafting a weekly roster system for them to attend office on alternate weeks.

However, the 50% limit will not be applicable to departments and public sector undertakings such as Health and Family Welfare Services, Indian System of Medicines, Revenue and Disaster Management, Excise, Police, Electricity, Public Works, Fire Service, Municipalities, Commune Panchayats, Transport, Commercial Taxes, Directorate of Accounts and Treasuries, Ponlait, Puducherry Road Transport Corporation and Puducherry Power Corporation.

Before allowing the officials to work from home, their updated contacts numbers should be obtained.

The Transport Department has directed all categories of public transport operators to clean/disinfect vehicles to avoid spreading of COVID-19.

In a press note, Transport Commissioner A. S. Sivakumar said as the general population was using public transport vehicles like PRTC buses, stage carriage buses, contract carriages (minibuses), tourist buses, minivans, tourist taxis and autorickshaws for their daily transportation needs, it was necessary to prevent spread of corona virus in public transport vehicles.

Accordingly all owners/operators of public transport vehicles including PRTC buses were advised to clean/disinfect their vehicles thoroughly on daily basis so as to avoid the spreading of the viral infection through such vehicles.

Safety measures

The precaution was imperative as the novel coronavirus could spread from one person to other directly and or through carpets/floor mats and other materials commonly used by the public.

The Puducherry and Cuddalore Diocese has decided to restrict Sunday Mass in order to avoid a large gathering till March 31 as a preventive measure against the spread of COVID-19.

Arch Bishop of the Diocese Anthony Anandarayar informed the decision to restrict Sunday Mass and other public gathering in churches to a delegation led by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy when they called on him on Friday.

Thanking the diocese for the gesture, the Chief Minister told reporters that pujas in temples and Friday prayer in mosques were also cancelled as part of the preparations to deal with novel coronavirus. The Diocese will give necessary instructions to churches to hold Sunday Mass without any gathering, the Chief Minister said.

On Thursday night the Chief Minister inspected the border areas to enquire about the screening conducted by Health Department staff and medical students of people visiting the territory. Speaking to reporters after winding up the inspection, the Chief Minister said all preventive measures are being put in place to prevent any outbreak of the virus in the Union Territory.

561,2020/03/21,Coronavirus | Janamaithri police to keep tabs on the quarantined in Kerala,"They have visited 4,858 houses Statewide

The State police’s Janamaithri wing has stepped forward to help the people in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Janamaithri police is reaching out to the people to create awareness of the disease and render help to those in home quarantine.

Beat officers of the Janamaithri police have already visited the 4,858 houses where people have been quarantined.

Travel history

They inquire about the welfare of the quarantined person, other family members, their travel history, and details of those in contact with the family.

If those under surveillance are confirmed to be COVID-19 positive, the details recorded by the beat officers are of immense help to health officials.

The Janamaithri police not only come to the aid of families under surveillance, but also that of surrounding families by sensitising them to the precautions to be adopted against the disease. This includes stressing the need for social isolation so as to check the disease’s spread.

Helping the elderly

They also impress upon the people the need to inform the government if they have returned from abroad recently.

The elderly too benefit from the beat officers’ attention. State Police Chief Loknath Behera has asked them to prioritise the elderly, right from visiting hospitals to buy them medicines to any household provisions that they may need.

Awareness classes

Awareness classes were organised by the Janamaithri police in areas where migrant workers live and among taxi and auto drivers. They are supported by private hospitals and establishments.

Besides information on personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness, awareness on the ‘Break the Chain’ initiative is also being done.

563,2020/03/21,Banks exhort customers to go digital,"SBI to limit staff attendance at main offices in the State to 50%

Banks are urging customers to use digital banking facilities and keep branch visits to a minimum given the possibility of COVID-19 spread and the threat to their staff.

Banks in the State capital have boards on display advising customers to go digital and carry out further transactions from the safety of their homes. While staff have been issued hand sanitisers and face masks in view of the pandemic, banks feel the need to further reduce the risk.

Many banks had reported higher footfall and a spurt in cash withdrawals in recent days, partly caused by the rush to stock up on food. Prominent banks have already taken to Twitter and Facebook, requesting customers to respect social distancing guidelines and use online banking services until the threat subsides.

As part of the precautions, the State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to limit staff attendance at its Local Head Office at Poojappura, the six administrative offices and 29 regional business offices across the State to not more than 50% on working days.

The bank’s corporate head office has issued instructions in this regard, a senior SBI official said. Instructions regarding the bank’s branches are expected soon, the official said.

Earlier this month, the SBI branch at Thottamon, Ranni, had temporarily downed shutters following reports that a COVID-19 patient had visited it. The branch is now open, SBI officials said.

SLBC directive

In a March 16 advisory, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had asked banks to encourage customers to use digital options as far as possible. On its part, the State Level Bankers’ Committee (SLBC), Kerala, has echoed the advice. The SLBC has also urged banks to adopt in-house measures to protect their staff from getting infected, N. Ajit Krishnan, convener, SLBC, Kerala, and General Manager, Canara Bank, said.

Skeleton staff

“We have asked banks to have only skeleton staff for the time being. We request customers, especially elderly citizens, to avoid visits to banks unless they are unavoidable. The important thing is to keep the banks up and functioning. Today, a customer need not visit a bank for basic transactions. ATMs, passbook printing machines and cash-deposit machines are available everywhere,” Mr. Ajit Krishnan said.

As part of in-house precautions, banks in the State have issued face masks and sanitisers to the staff. On-site ATMs and most of the off-site ones that have security guards also are equipped with sanitisers. However, with sanitisers in short supply, some banks have also opted for buckets of water and soap.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/9b9duv/article31122737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVTVCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/banks-exhort-customers-to-go-digital/article31122738.ece
564,2020/03/21,Troubled times for domestic workers,"Many asked not to report for work

As COVID-19 continues its rampage, its social and economic implications are becoming increasingly visible. In the city, domestic workers find themselves in a bind – whether to go to work every day and risk possible COVID-19 exposure or stay at home and face wage loss and other deprivations it may bring.

Sheena Basheer of the Self Employed Women’s Association Kerala says domestic workers are facing a lot of uncertainty as many families have taken leave and left the city. Many workers have been told by their employers not to report for work till the worst of the disease spread is over.

“Nearly 15 to 20 of our members have called up saying they were told not to come for work for some time. These people travel to work in houses, using public transport. The employers feel this could pose difficulties for them.”

In canteens

Ms. Basheer says canteens run by SEWA women too are seeing a drop in footfall. The women too are worried about the crowds coming in.

Ms. Basheer says SEWA women run the staff canteen at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. Besides the drop in people visiting the canteen, the women also had to face an unexpected problem – the pressure from their neighbours not to travel to the SCTIMST daily forced many of them to say they would not turn up for work till COVID-19 had subsided.

Apprehensive about losing work, some of them were even ready to put up near the SCTIMST to avoid travelling to and from work. “It is a very challenging situation,” she says.

Home nurses

Like domestic workers, those working as home nurses too are in a predicament. They too have been told not to turn up, unless they are live-in nurses and staying in a house round the clock.

However, they too are being asked to restrict travel back home at the weekends, says Ms. Basheer. The domestic workers are also scared of travelling to areas in the city from where COVID-19 cases have been reported.

Unorganised sector

SEWA secretary Sonia George says the health crisis will affect those in the unorganised sector the most. While people in some sectors can work from home, domestic workers cannot. SEWA is considering taking up the issue of some compensation for these women. There are other complexities involved. Here, domestic workers are being asked to stay away in the name of containing infection. But in many countries, it was employers who had passed on the disease to domestic workers, she points out.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/troubled-times-for-domestic-workers/article31122726.ece
565,2020/03/21,Sanitiser kiosks put up at public buildings,"14 units, the latest at DMO, set up as part of ‘Break the Chain’ campaign

Kiosks dispensing sanitisers are being installed in the district as part of the efforts to combat COVID-19.

District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan inaugurated the newest one at the District Medical Office (DMO). So far, 14 kiosks have been installed in various public buildings in the district as part of the ‘Break the Chain’ campaign.

The Secretariat complex has four — at the fisheries and revenue departments, the Durbar Hall and South Block. Other venues include the Public Office building at Museum, District Collectorate, DPM Office and Kerala State Housing Board. The Government Women and Children’s Hospital, Thycaud, has two kiosks.

Quarantined

Home quarantine should be viewed positively as a measure for tackling the COVID-19 threat, Byju Soman, a physiotherapist placed in quarantine on his return from Munich, has said.

Mr. Soman, who belongs to Vellanad, had returned from Munich, where he is employed, on March 12. On his arrival at the international airport, he had reported to the medical officer on duty. The next day, he was admitted to the isolation ward of the Medical College Hospital. The State is setting an example for the rest of the world in tackling the crisis, Mr. Soman was quoted in a statement. His confidence grew when he was tested negative for COVID-19.

On his release from isolation, he returned to Vellanad and is now in home quarantine on the instructions of the Health Department. He spends his time reading. Mr. Soman also urged the public to adhere to the guidelines issued by the government.

Helpline

The helpline services run by the District Mental Health programme (9846854844) for people in home quarantine is available from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily. The public can also contact Disha for counselling services on 1056.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/2tsu3h/article31122710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21TVTVCOVID-191,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/sanitiser-kiosks-put-up-at-public-buildings/article31122711.ece

The Food Safety Department has formed special squads to step up food safety inspections as part of the measures initiated to tackle the COVID-19 threat, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has said.

The squads would visit food production and distribution centres, particularly bakeries and restaurants near hospitals, bus stands and railway stations, the Minister said on Friday.

The inspections will cover hygiene as well as the availability of hand sanitisers and soap.

Guidelines

The Food Safety Department has also issued a set of guidelines for restaurants and other food production centres for containing the spread of COVID-19. The Health Minister has urged the public to adhere to the guidelines issued by the department. As part of the guidelines, the department has urged people with cough and respiratory problems to keep away from food preparation.

Masks, hair nets

The premises of restaurants and other eateries should be disinfected at regular intervals. Employees should be issued face masks and hair nets. Utensils should be properly cleaned before use. The proprietor should also ensure that the soaps and hand sanitisers are of good quality and required grade.

Milk, egg and meat should be cooked at the proper temperature. Vegetables and fruits that are not cooked should be cleaned properly before use.

The department has also made it clear that COVID-19 does not spread through imported food items.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/special-squads-for-food-safety-checks/article31122700.ece
567,2020/03/21,Sparrow count yields a mixed result,"Population marginally goes up, but many bastions report a fall in numbers

A survey done on Friday, World Sparrow Day, has recorded a marginal increase in the population of house sparrows in and around the city. The bird count has increased from 120 last year to 129. However, the study also threw up a few worrying trends with the bird count falling in certain pockets hitherto known as a safe refuge for the tiny, chirpy birds.

Survey by NGO

Despite a sharp increase in areas such as Sulaiman Street and Beemapally, there has been a marked fall in the number of sparrows in known hubs like the Connemara market, Chala, and Vettucaud.

The findings serve as an indicator for stepping up conservation activities.

The survey was conducted by the Travancore Nature History Society (TNHS), a city-based non-governmental organisation that has been taking count of house sparrows to mark the occasion since 2010.

The house sparrow population at the Connemara market, considered a bastion of the species for long, has remained in a precarious position in the past few years. Only 26 birds were found in the market this year, as against last year’s 33. The area had recorded counts as high as 148 in 2012 and 101 in 2013.

Nests in poor shape

Nests installed on the market premises by nature clubs used to attract the birds earlier. But now, with the nests falling into disrepair, the birds are opting for other places.

No birds were spotted at Statue, Thampanoor, and M.G. Road. In the Chala bazaar and nearby areas, the number of house sparrows has dwindled. While no sparrows were spotted in the Power House road or the adjoining Sabhapathy Kovil street, six were found at the Kothuval street.

Only six birds were found in Vettucaud that had recorded the presence of 19 birds last year. None were found at Manacaud, Pettah, and Peroorkada markets.

The Sulaiman Street in Valiyathura recorded a relatively high count of 35 birds, most of which were seen perched on branches of bushes and small trees rather than on ground and electric wires. This is inferred to be due to the oppressive heat in the region. Coastal areas of Beemapally and Vizhinjam also witnessed the presence of 20 and 10 birds respectively.

According to TNHS member Kalesh S., the primary reason for a fall in bird count in certain pockets is the non-availability of food. Bird feeders that ensured an availability of grains and water were necessary in sustaining the house sparrow population.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/b5laec/article31122665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvtvsparrow,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/sparrow-count-yields-a-mixed-result/article31122666.ece

571,2020/03/21,Industries step up vigilto prevent virus spread,"Most units functioning with partial deployment of staff

Industries in and around Visakhapatnam are either managing their operations with minimal hands or wherever possible have asked their employees to work from home.

After disabling biometric attendance and directing their workforce to observe social distancing, they have taken the initiative to implement guidelines issued by the Centre and the State government to avoid the risk of spreading of COVID-19. Thermal guns are being used at the place of entry and those found with high temperature are asked to go on leave.

Hindustan Shipyard Limited is managing its operations with half of its employees by allowing them to attend in turns. It has also decided not to ask any questions if any executive goes on leave. “We are engaging non-executives only 50% to work in the shop floors for a week and asking others to work from home. However, those drafted for emergency services have to work as per their duty hours,” HSL Chairman and Managing Director Rear Admiral (retd.) L.V. Sarat Babu told The Hindu on Saturday.

Being a process industry, HPCL Visakh Refinery is taking all precautions with optimum utilisation of manpower. Visitors are allowed after thorough checking only in extraordinary cases.

Visakhapatnam Steel Plant has already closed gyms, parks, swimming pools and asked the employees to observe social distancing to prevent community transmission. Official meetings have been made minimal. Heave Plates and Vessels Plant (BHEL) is also observing all the protocols issued by the government from time to time and managing its operations by taking steps to fight against COVID-19, an official said.

In Jawaharlal Nehru Pharma City, where several multinational pharma companies have bulk drug units, most of the units are working by engaging minimal number of workers on shifts. In one of the units, half of the workers are being deployed in turns.

Alternate working hours has been introduced Laurus Labs, one of the firms at JNPC. The company said all vehicles and places had been sanitised to prevent spread of the virus, an official pointed out.

575,2020/03/21,Panic buying leads to heavy rush at Rythu Bazaars,"Majority of buyers and farmers fail to take safety measures

There was a mad rush at Rythu Bazaars in the city on Friday. The order on closure of malls and cinema theatres from Friday has made the citizens jittery. They went with sacks and large bags to buy vegetables, which could last long.

Vegetables like potatoes, which could be stored for a long time, and onions and tomatoes, which can be mixed with almost all other vegetables in the preparation of curries, were high in demand.

Consumers formed long queues to get their stock and bought five to 10 times of their normal requirement. The threat of COVID-19 did not seem to deter the buyers from crowding around the stalls and standing in queues for a long time.

Most of the buyers did not wear masks and almost all the farmers, who sell their produce at the stalls, were without masks at the Seethammadhara Rythu Bazaar. These farmers are the most vulnerable persons at the Rythu Bazaars as they have to deal with all kinds of consumers all through the day.

“Despite being the most vulnerable areas for transmission of the virus, hardly any measures are being taken by the authorities to spread the message at the Rythu Bazaars. The farmers are ignorant as can be seen by the fact that most of them are not using masks,” says T. Kameswara Rao, general secretary of Praja Arogya Vedika, which has conducting awareness programmes along with other NGOs, in spreading the message at public places.

“Ironically, even educated persons coming to the bazaars are very negligent and sneeze and cough in the crowd without covering their face with a handkerchief.

Travelling abroad on a holiday, business, education and other purposes has become common among the middle class. These people come to the bazaars and some of them behave irresponsibly,” he says.

“The incubation period of the virus in the human body is 28 days, and the symptoms may be evident after a few days or after two, three weeks. Those who return from abroad should invariably be under self-quarantine during that period, in view of the health emergency declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Based on an order from the State government, all multiplexes, shopping malls and cinema theatres have been closed in the city from Friday and they will remain closed till March 31.

But since the rumours of a proposed lockdown has sent the people in a tizzy, which resulted into panic buying since Thursday night, Minister of Tourism Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said that there was no need for panic, as all essential commodities will be made available and only places of mass gathering will remain closed.

“There is no need to panic, as only malls and multiplexes will remain closed, but rest all will remain open,” he said.

Clarifying the close down order, Joint Collector M. Venugopal Reddy said that as per the order non-essential commodities establishment such as shopping malls, mulitplexes, cinema theatres, function halls hosting public functions and meetings, parks and museum will remain closed as per the order, but other essential commodities establishments that does not attract mass gathering including mom and pop provision stores will remain open.

Other places which have been advised to close down as precautionary measures are religious places and places of worship. “The rituals will continue, but they will remain closed for pilgrims and devotees, till March 31,” he said.

According to him, essential transport will continue to run and APSRTC has been advised not to pack the buses with passengers. “They will accommodate people as per the number of seats available, even fewer if possible. We are also advising the auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers and owners and private bus owners to curtail the number of passengers and keep it as few as possible,” he said.

Foreign returnees

As per the immigration bureau, in the last 15 days, 851 persons have come into the district from various foreign destination. This apart the ward volunteers who are on survey have identified 221 foreign returnees. “Over 700 such foreign returnees have been kept on home quarantine and the process on to identify the others and trace all those who have come in contact with them,” said Mr. Venugopal Reddy.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/s9m2a/article31123290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21-VZ-JC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/multiplexes-shopping-malls-cinemas-to-be-closed-till-march-31/article31123291.ece
577,2020/03/21,‘Literature sheds light on the world in a way no news can’: Mirza Waheed,"Mirza Waheed’s winning work, ‘Tell her Everything’, takes the form of a doctor’s confession to present an oblique study of totalitarian regimes and moral choices

Mirza Waheed, who lives in London and worked for the BBC for 10 years, has written three novels. The first two, The Collaborator and The Book of Gold Leaves, were shortlisted for several awards, and his third, Tell her Everything, has won The Hindu Prize 2019.

Written in deceptively simple yet powerful prose, it asks as difficult questions of the protagonist as it does of the reader. The writer speaks of those choices in this e-mail interview. Excerpts:

Your book is in many ways an oblique study of a totalitarian regime. What drove you to write it?

The novel started with a simple premise: what must go on inside the mind of a successful man who late in life begins to take stock of what he might have lost and gained in his single-minded pursuit of success and prosperity. That initial question was, of course, intrinsically linked to his immersion in a system that puts a premium on complete obedience and conformity, with little or no room for difference, leave alone dissent. As Dr. K is the product of a culture where docility of the citizen, acquiescence, and an uncurious deference to authority are often valued, he doesn’t think he’s selling his soul. He genuinely believes that by following orders he can succeed in life, acquire wealth, and he does quite well by the end of his career, living in an expensive apartment with a view of the Thames.

I think the corrosion of his soul comes about not because he believes in all this but because he’s unable and unwilling, at least initially, to see that ‘merely following orders’ doesn’t exempt him from accountability, that he’s complicit in an inhuman system of justice.

Having said that, he’s also a complex figure in that he is aware that penal systems can be cruel and barbaric even in so-called advanced societies. Totalitarian systems of all kinds depend on, and cultivate and impose, uncritical subservience to one kind of “ideal or other”, a “gold standard” that everyone must follow.

Dr. K’s naïve complicity in the system and the ambiguity of his character drove me on.

In the book, Dr. K’s choice is between sanctioned wrongdoing and official protection. Do you believe that politically we are today being offered the same sorts of moral choices? And is it going to be our individual consciences that have to stand up and be counted in the end?

Yes, and it’s quite probably worse in many parts of the world now, in that the state, whether autocratic or democratic, religious or secular, is increasingly characterised by a disregard, even erasure, of individual autonomy. I agree with your description of the moral choices ‘on offer’ today. Equally, we can detect a quiet rebellion from our consciences. We must also note that all these categories can’t be absolutes.

In the world of the novel, Dr. K probably discovers that the soul, too, has a spectrum. As his daughter, Sara, says at some point, “You are a good man, a very good man: that’s the reason you became a perfect wreck. You are, certainly were, a great father. A good man, a good father. But not good enough.”

It’s such an emotionally intense book. How long did you take to write it? And what, if any, was the fallout on your and your family’s emotional state during the writing and after?

It would be dishonest to say that it was an easy novel to write. It took me a while to get inside the head of Dr. K, but once I had some sense of his voice, I became excited by the form of the novel: Dr. K is essentially rehearsing the long conversation that he wants to have with his estranged daughter who lives in the U.S. But being both protagonist and narrator, he also anticipates her answers, or the questions she may ask, which was both fascinating and challenging for me, as I had to get those looping mind-rehearsals right.

None of it is real, of course, because it’s all in his head, and the question then was: can he get it right, how can he get it right? Equally, he’s meticulous when putting down the facts of his life. He wants to give Sara an honest account of his life, his savanah-e-umri — ‘the occurrences or accidents of one’s life’ (novelist Nadeem Aslam’s translation).

By the time I finished a third draft of the novel, my own daughter, who was born around the time I’d started making notes for the novel, was nearly four. Her presence kept me calm.

I was often racked by self-doubt but then again, show me a writer without self-doubt. My family have always been more than supportive and mostly know when to stay out of my way — except the little one, of course. I wrote when she allowed it. This is also the first novel that I asked my wife to read before I sent it out. Novelists Kamila Shamsie, Mohammed Hanif and Alex Preston read an early draft and their words provided a dose adrenaline at the right time.

Within months of your book’s release, Kashmir was bifurcated and locked down. I know from your social media posts how angry you are. Will you write about it? Will writing help? Can literature impact politics?

I am still angry with the Indian state for its actions in Kashmir and I think I’ve written a few times about how I feel about it all. Literature helps us make sense of ourselves and of our world, which is shaped by politics whether we like it or not, whether we acknowledge it or not. And, of course, literature sheds light on the world in a way no amount of instant news or social media can; it shakes the lid off the darker aspects of our world. Fiction, however, takes time to gestate, to ripen, if I may.

Yes, I will write about it. In what form and shape, I do not know.

Do you divide your time between Srinagar and London? Which city would you rather live in, other things being equal? Especially now, as the world battles a pandemic and the Valley is still denied 4G services.

Srinagar is the city of my birth and youth. Even if bruised and brutalised, for me it remains the “emerald city”, as a visiting Japanese photographer called it in the 1970s. London is in some ways the capital of the world, a great city like no other, and I quite like it here — despite the wound of Brexit. Since my children were born here and I stay and work at home, I can’t live away for long periods. My heart, however, remains split. There’s also Delhi in the middle, that mad, cruel and yet magnificent city, where I lived and loved for some years as a young man. The recent dance of death in the city broke my heart.

What are you working on now?

I am trying to write about children and trees. Trees and children. That’s all I know at the moment.

579,2020/03/21,Wanted: Polygraph — An extract from ‘Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists’ by Julia Ebner,"In a vicious circle, the erosion of trust in the media and democratic institutions is playing into the hands of far-right campaigners and conspiracy theorists, who fan deception, leading to further abrasion of confidence. An extract from Julia Ebner’s new book, ‘Going Dark: The Secret Social Lives of Extremists’

Donara [Barojan] is what some call a ‘Digital Sherlock’. Her team at the Digital Forensic Research (DFR) Lab at the NATO StratCom Center of Excellence in Latvia exposes the tactics and narratives used to spread disinformation and follows influence campaigns in real time.

‘There are four tactics to spread disinformation,’ Donara explains to me ‘Dismiss the opponent, distort the facts, distract from the central issue and dismay the audience.’ This ‘4D approach’ is used both by state actors, such as the Russian and the Chinese governments and by non-state actors such as alt-right trolls. The Kremlin’s tactic of flooding the media space with so much content that it becomes impossible to distinguish between right and wrong pieces of information has increasingly been copied by non-state trolling networks. Many of today’s far-right operations are, however, amplified by state-backed bots and media networks. For example, the Russian news outlets Sputnik and Russia Today (RT) frequently help far-right campaigners to spread their messages by amplifying their themes and hashtags.

Some accounts pushing disinformation campaigns operate like cyborgs — semi-automated, human-operated accounts. For

example, a Twitter account that operates under the handle @thebradfordfile tweets over 300 times per day, has a network of more than 100,000 followers and a core group of hundreds of amplifiers. Its messages, which reach from far-right propaganda to conspiracy theories, have been retweeted by Donald Trump and quoted by major US media outlets to illustrate the alt-right’s social media successes.

There are too many elections for the few people at the DFR Lab to monitor. ‘An estimated 100,000 websites spread disinformation,’ Donara tells me, ‘but there are only a few dozen fact-checker websites.’ In other words, we are constantly outnumbered. The Oxford Internet Institute found evidence of formally organised social media manipulation campaigns in forty-eight countries in 2017. Since 2010, over half a billion dollars have been spent on psychological operations and public opinion influence campaigns over social media. Tactics ranged from the use of automated accounts and commentary teams to targeted online advertisement campaigns. Most campaigns involved the circulation of misinformation in the run-up to critical junctions such as elections, referendums and crises.

The disappearance of trust in independent information sources is a slow poison that threatens to undermine the fundamental pillars of our democracies. The erosion of civil discourse, political paralysis, alienation and uncertainty are among the most severe consequences of the ‘Truth Decay’, as researchers of the RAND Corporation have called it. Trust doesn’t vanish overnight, but over the past few years we have watched its gradual erosion on different levels.

First came the distrust in the political and financial establishment. The 2008 global financial crisis and its various connected scandals fuelled fears that national and international political and economic bodies were not acting in the public’s interest and had secret agendas that might at any point afflict the average man’s bank account. Many suffering from real losses or fear of losses in its aftermath felt betrayed by those who they thought had sold them a whitewashed idea of globalisation. This frustration was funnelled into growing distrust in the most powerful and suspicion towards the weakest. A 2013 survey by Public Policy Polling showed that almost three in ten US voters thought that a ‘secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government, or New World Order’. Republicans were more than twice as likely as Democrats to believe in this conspiracy theory.

The second stage brought an escalation of distrust in the establishment media and academic institutions. In Europe, the establishment media’s reporting around the migration crisis, terrorist attacks and rape scandals gradually chipped away its undisputed credibility: the media’s late response to the rape crisis in Cologne on New Year’s Eve in 2015 was a watershed moment that prompted many on the far right to resurrect the historically tainted term Lügenpresse in Germany. Originally coined a hundred years earlier by the German author Reinhold Anton, the term was first used to denounce enemy propaganda during World War I. But it is better remembered for its extensive use by the Nazis in their campaigns against Jewish and communist media. In the UK, the media’s failure to report on grooming-gang scandals in Rotherham, Rochdale, Telford and Oxford was exploited by figures like Tommy Robinson to decry the ‘mainstream media’ as complicit with the rapists.

In the US, polarising events such as 9/11, Obama’s presidency and Trump’s election victory were critical junctions in heating up the nationwide information battle. The investigative journalist David Neiwert powerfully explained in his book Alt-America how the aftermath of 9/11, the racist backlash against the first black US president and the growing popularity of far-right media figures has led to the emergence of a ‘mental space beyond fact or logic, where rules of evidence are replaced by paranoia’. Far-right and conservative social media influencers were quick in promoting the idea that the media’s coverage of Trump was biased, one-sided and unfair. In tandem with Trump himself, these emerging alternative news figureheads helped to popularise the terms ‘lying press’ and ‘fake news’.

A 2017 Pew Research Center survey found that two in three Americans get their news from social media. In the competitive, fast-paced 24-hour news ecosystem, traditional media outlets are struggling to strike the balance between speed and accuracy of reporting. This difficult reporting environment is exacerbated by malicious attempts to trick and manipulate the media. Trolls sometimes plant misleading or inaccurate information into credible sources, such as think tanks or local media, which are then frequently quoted by journalists. For example, less than an hour after the Parkland high-school shooting occurred in February 2018, far-right trolls made plans to hijack the public narrative. ‘Start looking for [Jewish] numerology and crisis actors,’ one wrote on the image board 8chan. This disinformation and obfuscation technique is called ‘source hacking’.

In December 2018, Der Spiegel revealed that one of their award-winning journalists, Claas Relotius, had freely invented major parts of his stories, including quotes, places, scenes, even entire characters. This scandal gave far-right actors such as Martin Sellner across Europe ammunition to paint all journalists as dishonest and unprofessional. One month later, in January 2019, members of Generation Identity launched a nationwide campaign against journalists, attaching posters on the façades of media outlets across the country and attacking a journalist of the newspaper TAZ in Berlin. A similar wave of scepticism towards scientific studies took root when three scholars published a series of hoax papers called ‘Grievance Studies’ with the aim of exposing flaws in the academic review processes of journals in 2017 and 2018. Even though the Relotius scandal and the ‘Grievance Studies’ affair are isolated cases, far-right influencers such as Martin Sellner have used them as the ultimate proof that we cannot trust any news articles and scientific studies.

As a result, trust in the democratic system itself is dwindling at high speed. In 2018, German far-right activists spread panic over rigged election processes, calling on their followers to become election observers in the German 2018 state elections in Bavaria and Hesse. At the same time, Swedish alt-right figures propagated allegations that the national election was fraudulent and designed to disenfranchise the far-right parties in the national election. The German American Harvard University scholar Yascha Mounk showed in his book The People vs. Democracy that people living in Western democracies are not just increasingly suspicious of their political representatives and institutions. With stagnating living standards, fear of multiethnic democracy and the rise of social media, their belief in the system of liberal democracy itself is gradually fading as well.

This democracy trust crisis has led to an atmosphere in which anti-democratic movements thrive, as their calls for radical change become louder and their public protests more widespread. The Tommy Robinsons of this world are getting louder, and their fan boys are multiplying. Had Robinson come to my office ten years earlier, the media stunt likely would not have worked. Not just because Quilliam didn’t exist then, Robinson still attended BNP events and Twitter counted only around 5,000 tweets per day (as compared to 6,000 per second today), but because there wasn’t a big enough audience that wanted to see news outlets dismantled and journalists disgraced.

580,2020/03/21,‘The moon was the ticking clock’: Shehan Karunatilaka,"Shehan Karunatilaka talks about researching war photographers, gay men, Sri Lankan history and ghosts for his latest novel

Sri Lankan author Shehan Karunatilaka’s DSC Prize-winning novel, Chinaman: The Legend of Pradeep Mathew, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. Meanwhile, Karunatilaka is back with a whodunnit with a twist, Chats with the Dead, the tale of a renegade war photographer, Maali Almeida, who is tasked with solving his own murder.

Karunatilaka has been researching for the book all these years; Chats with the Dead is also a documentation of the Sri Lankan conflict, although the seriousness is camouflaged in artful humour. The novel has a huge canvas, with chapters marked by phases of the moon, and a ghost for the narrator. Excerpts from an interview with Karunatilaka:

How are you celebrating 10 years of Chinaman?

The bigger celebration is the finishing of the second novel, Chats with the Dead. The last 10 years have been action-packed: Chinaman travelled the world, I got married, had two kids, moved country twice and took six years to finish that difficult second.

The good news is there are several things in the pipeline. Please Don’t Put That in Your Mouth just came out and there are two other kids’ books on the way, along with a short story collection. So, hopefully, it won’t be 2030 when the next book comes out.

The opening pages of Chats with the Dead says, “There’s a corpse every second. Sometimes two.” Does Maali Almeida take the chronicle of Sri Lanka ahead?

Sri Lanka is always a character in whatever I write. Maali thinks of himself as an apolitical atheist who is racially indifferent. He despises everyone in equal measure. But he happened to die in 1989, along with thousands of other Sri Lankans, caught between that year’s four horsemen: terrorists, insurgents, peace-keepers and death squads.

It seemed a fascinating time to set a ghost story in, a time when thousands of corpses ended up in unmarked graves, and no one could tell if they were killed by the LTTE, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the Sri Lankan army or the Indian army. Except for the ghosts.

You seemed to have done a humongous amount of research for Chats.

I was working full-time in Singapore when I began researching. Then moved back to Colombo in 2014 so I could work freelance, run after my toddlers and maintain the semblance of a writing routine.

If prep for Chinaman was researching cricket and drunks, for this one it was researching war photographers, closeted gay men, Sri Lankan history and Sri Lankan ghosts. Not half as fun, much more time-consuming, but quite rewarding. To arrive at a convincing version of the afterlife, I had to read what the world’s religions, its philosophers and its Near-Death Experience scientists had to say about life after death. I also read ghost stories and watched horror movies. The version I ended up with mixes Buddhism, Hinduism, some Judeo-Christian tropes and the idea of the universe as a bureaucracy.

I also had to read about Sri Lanka in 1989, and decide which atrocities to leave out and which to put in. Plus, I had to get into the head of a gambler, a war photographer, a closeted gay man. So, I’m lucky it only took years.

How many rewrites did you do? A comment on the unusual narrative style?

Many rewrites, many false starts, many discarded sub plots and side characters. I realised that when someone calls a book a ‘sprawling’ work, it isn’t usually a compliment. So, I worked hard to take the ‘sprawl’ out and focus on a guy solving his own murder and dealing with his unresolved relationships with family, lovers and the universe.

The moon was the ticking clock. A lot of mythologies say that it takes three-seven days for the soul to leave the body and three months for the soul to move to the next realm. So, setting the story over seven moons or seven nights worked from a mythological as well as a thriller point of view.

How is the publishing journey of Chats different from that of Chinaman?

With Chinaman I had no clue if it would ever be published outside of Sri Lanka. With Chats, I knew that it would reach readers outside of the subcontinent. Writing the two was very different experiences, as was finding a publisher. Now I have agents and friends in publishing and can call for advice from other writers. With the first book it was just me emailing and posting query letters and synopses to publishers and agents, who mostly ignored me, until Chiki Sarkar replied saying, “Send me MS”.

581,2020/03/21,Republic of grief: Review of Colum McCann’s ‘Apeirogon’,"Colum McCann’s novel, weaving together elements of speculation, memory, fact, and imagination, is a work of pure lyricism and a moving plea for peace

The shadowlines of history are often drawn in arbitrary fashion, as the civilisational narratives of South Asia and West Asia illustrate, but they make for compelling post-war stories. For instance, in Param Vir: Our Heroes in Battle, Major General Ian Cardozo, the first war-disabled officer to be approved for command of an Infantry Battalion, recounts the improbable real-life story of a retired Brigadier in the Indian Army, who lost a son in a tank battle during the 1971 war with Pakistan. Nearly 30 years later, on a ‘bucket list’ visit to his hometown, in current-day Pakistan, the Brigadier is hosted by a gracious Pakistani Army officer and his family. Their two countries may have been at loggerheads, but the two soldiers find themselves drawn together by an unlikely bond of friendship and a karmic connection.

On the eve of the Brigadier’s departure, his Pakistani host makes a startling ‘confession’: it was at his hands that the visitor’s son had died in the 1971 tank battle. The revelation, acknowledged with soldierly grace by both parties, does nothing to diminish their kinship.

One thing in common

Colum McCann’s part-fact-part-fiction ‘hybrid novel’ traces a similar unlikely friendship between Bassam Aramin, a Palestinian ‘terrorist’ who grew up in a ‘cave’ near Hebron, and Rami Elhanan, an Israeli graphic designer, whose father-in-law served as a

General in the Israeli Army. The two men have only one thing in common: each of them lost a young daughter to the conflict. Rami’s daughter Smadar, who once featured as a poster child for peace, was killed in a 1997 attack by Palestinian suicide bombers in Jerusalem. Bassam’s daughter Abir, born in the year that Smadar died, was killed by a rubber bullet fired by an Israeli soldier.

But overcoming the impulse for hate-propelled revenge, the two men channel their grief as a weapon for peace. Like Bassam’s ‘prison number’ (220-284), they become metaphorical ‘amicable numbers’, a mathematical curiosity that entwines their destinies and lets them see each other as humans united in the equality of pain.

Infinite sides

Together with others in similar situations, on both sides of the border, they gather under the banner of the Combatants for Peace, and become catalysts of a peacenik impulse. To the point where they are able to narrate each other’s stories. Rami manifests a preoccupation with the campaign to end the ‘Occupation’; and Bassam, who once delighted in watching Holocaust documentaries for the joy it gave him to “watch Jews die”, signs on for a Peace Studies programme to study the Holocaust in an effort to “understand the history of another.”

For their efforts, they are reviled by hotheads within their own community. Rami’s wife Nurit, a liberal university professor, is mocked as a ‘Jewrab’, a traitor, a whore, for campaigning to end the Israeli ‘Occupation’. In an introspective passage encapsulating his peacenik philosophy, which might just as easily apply in other geographies (including some nearer home), Rami muses: “Some people have an interest in keeping the silence. Others have an interest in sowing hatred based on fear... And, let’s face it, in Israel we’re very good at fear, it occupies us... We use the word security to silence others.”

Such ruminations lead him to an affirmation of his life’s mission: “to personally try to help prevent the unbearable pain for others... to convey this very basic and very simple message, which says: We are not doomed, but we have to try to smash the forces that have an interest in keeping us silent.”

For all its peaceably polemical tone in such reflective passages, Colum McCann’s novel — which, he says, weaves together elements of speculation, memory, fact, and imagination — is a work of pure lyricism. Structured much like the stories from the One Thousand and One Nights — which were themselves drawn from places and cultures as far away as India, Tibet, the Balkans, Baghdad, Damascus and Egypt and across vast expanses of time — Apeirognon (which means a shape with an infinite number of sides) weaves together real and imagined stories across centuries and civilisations. These stretch from Biblical times to Mahatma Gandhi’s Dandi March to French President Francois Mitterrand’s last meal to the correspondence between Einstein and Freud (on building the defences against hate) to Bassam confronting U.S. Senator John Kerry over the murder of his daughter. The 1,001 passages in the novel are threaded together by interlinking strands that connect them cosmically, with fewer than six degrees of separation.

The flutter and the flap of bird-wings echo with every turn of the pages of this epic novel: there are evocative passages of birds in flight in arguably one of the world’s bloodiest avian flight corridors, and a thrilling account of the mechanics of capturing falcons; there’s also a pulse-racing passage on French artist Philippe Petit’s high-wire act in 1987 across the Hinnom Valley, during which he releases a dove. Even these seemingly unconnected strands come beautifully together, like the fascinating murmuration patterns formed by starlings in flight. The story that McCann narrates may be dense at times, but his magical prose carries it aloft on light literary wings.

582,2020/03/21,See you at Jaipur: Review of Namita Gokhale’s ‘Jaipur Journals’,"The real meets the fictional in these delightful stories of a motley crew of characters who converge at the annual lit gala

Javed Akhtar explaining the nuances that distinguish a ghazal from a nazm, and reciting a heart-rending poem at a session in a recent edition of the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF). Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprising address to the nation on November 8, 2016, and the farce that ensued. India’s historic tryst with the Goods and Services Tax within months of the ban on ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes. The emergence of new right-wing apologists (some of whom may have held leftist leanings till it stopped paying the bills) — the very intellectuals who now defend India’s recent economic bungling as well as statistical skulduggery with élan...

The real meets the fictional effortlessly in what has been billed as “a love letter to the greatest literary show on Earth.” Being the founder and co-director of the JLF, which has now metamorphosed into a global phenomenon with offshoot fests held from Colorado to Edinburgh, Gokhale may not have had to look far for inspiration for this delectable patchwork on the inner (and outward) lives of writers — published, unpublished or shy of being published. Yet, it would take more than sheer proximity for her to be able to conjure up the delightful motley crew of characters whose paths intersect at the annual cultural jamboree.

Delectable patchwork

There’s the 52-year-old anthropologist trying to construct a novel with the mythical protagonists Yama and Kama, the gods of death and love, respectively. Single, yet divorced from a non-marriage relationship, she retains her American ex-partner’s name as it lends “more gravitas” to her identity when doubled up with her maiden Indian name!

There’s the controversial queer novelist passionate about gender fluidity and pan-sexuality, devoted to her monogamous wife (or is she?), but has a problem with Simone de Beauvoir’s work being called ‘seminal’. After a panel discussion on The Second Sex goes awry, she is haunted by a secret purple missive that calls her out for being a pornographer, plagiariser and an ill-spelt rhyme of a witch.

Solitary artists

Then there’s the mystical beat writer type who had a spiritual (or was it traumatic?) tryst with India in the flower power 60s. From being around when The Beatles stayed in Rishikesh to another stint in Varanasi when she was obsessed with death, Vajrayogini — as her guru called her — hasn’t been in India for decades. Until now.

Yet another narrative strand belongs to the Bihari boy who has moved on from his father’s life as a ladies’ tailor (who stitched all his client’s clothes too tight for comfort). Now a burglar par excellence, having tapped particularly rich pickings in the aftermath of the note ban as thefts of ill-gotten wealth would go unreported, this namesake of a bawdy real-life comic act is perhaps the most amusing character residing in this irresistible page-turner. Please do note that this Javed Akhtar fan is, however, not so hot on Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poetry.

There’s the teenage author for whom reading and writing are a means of escaping the tyranny of parents and the school education system. And an artist on the prowl for subjects at the literature festival that would feed his secret graphic column in a newspaper. That is when he is not adding to his collection of saris and petticoats, or drawing what’s on people’s minds while appearing to outline their appearance. Last but not the least in this crowd of solitary artists is the loneliest of them all — a septuagenarian from Dehradun (a royal descendant in exile) whose first short story was inspired by Led Zeppelin’s ‘Stairway to heaven’. Her life’s masterpiece remains ensconced in her inseparable jhola, revised and updated many a time but safe from the eyes of potential publishers and readers forever. Or maybe not...

Gokhale attributes the “seed of an idea” for this book to famous literary agent Lynn Nesbitt (who has earlier represented Toni Morrison, Hunter S. Thompson and Tom Wolfe). But her mastery of the craft levitates the idea of a book around a lit fest’s inhabitants to a work of art, evoking an intimate, intermingling landscape of what John Cheever referred to as the “cafard” writers are haunted by — executed with her tongue firmly in cheek.

583,2020/03/21,‘Shahjahanabad: The Living City of Old Delhi’ review: Jinn masjid and other fragments of Old Delhi,"In the final volume of her trilogy, Rana Safvi brings alive Shahjahanabad’s lanes and monuments through research and story-telling

Rana Safvi begins her book, the final volume of a trilogy on Delhi, with the prehistory of Shahjahanabad, named after its royal patron, Emperor Shah Jahan, in the 17th century. Where the city was planned was not a wilderness but one that had seen pockets of habitation, from the grave of Razia Sultana which is close to Bulbuli Khana to the Neeli Chhatri on the Nigambodh Ghat where Emperor Humayun added a pavilion. Salimgarh fort also stood on an island in the Yamuna, built by Salim Shah, son of Sher Shah Suri. The same Salim made a baoli or step-well known today as Khari Baoli, the site of the largest spice market in Asia. This prelude actually reveals the structure of the narrative, where various layers, from the ancient to the modern, are seamlessly woven together.

‘Palpable past’

The reason for this is simple: Safvi wants her readers to feel the ‘throbbing city with a palpable past’, where they should not merely appreciate the massive fort built by the Mughal emperor but also catch a glimpse of the Mughal bagh that existed before English-looking lawns replaced it or the havelis that have now become warehouses.

The city’s residents and their perceptions of the living old city also liberally pepper the text and make for a superb read. Sunehri Masjid, for instance, which was built in 1747 on the orders of Nawab Qudsia Begum is regularly described by old residents like Sadia Aleem and Amit Mitra as being a jinn waali masjid. Aleem remembers that “as children we were told stories that people were slapped by jinns if they dozed off while listening to the Quran” while Mitra as a school kid thought that the “jinns could even report you to the schoolteachers for playing hooky!”

The delightful storytelling is grounded in research as is evident when Safvi traces the travails of monumental memorabilia. The Akbarabadi mosque, named after a wife of Shah Jahan, stood in the old Faiz Bazar area and was demolished by the British in the aftermath of 1857. The calligraphic panels on it — done by the very man whose inscriptions adorn the Taj Mahal — survived and reached a scrap dealer in Aligarh. They were bought and presented to Sir Syed Ahmed Khan for the mosque that would be constructed for students, when he set up the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, now known as Aligarh Muslim University.

Tamarind tree library

If the destruction of large parts of Old Delhi continues at an unstoppable pace and looms large over the book, equally, there are stories of how some of its dedicated women and men have tried to conserve heritage in their own ways. The setting up in 1994 of the Hazrat Shah Waliullah library in the Pahari Imli Mohalla — named after a tamarind tree that no longer exists — is an example of this. Realising that this part of the city had fallen way behind in education, Mohammad Nadeem, a resident of old Delhi, and his friends opened the library. Today, it has as many as 25,000 books in Arabic, Persian, Hindi, Urdu and English which range from original works of Zaq and Zafar to an Urdu translation of the Bhagwad Gita.

A different kind of discovery is being attempted by two other residents, Sadia Syed and Abu Sufiyan. who are reviving an idiomatic language used by Shahjahanabad’s ladies called Begumati Zabaan. This is done through the Purani Dilli Walo ki Baatein Facebook page where Sadia “doubles as WinkiPhuppoo, posting short, humorous scripts on daily life.”

Rana Safvi’s enthusiasm and knowledge about Delhi is staggering and her talent as a raconteur is bound to make her readers want to immediately go out and explore Shahjahanabad’s lanes and monuments — with her book in hand.

584,2020/03/21,‘Plassey: The Battle that Changed the Course of Indian History’ review: Conspiracy in a mango orchard,"Moving away from the British Raj’s whitewashed accounts of Robert Clive and the East India Company, Sudeep Chakravarti breaks new ground in a retelling of the battle of Plassey

For historians of Bengal, the 18th century has been divided in two with the battle of Plassey standing as a decisive marker.

The ‘Rashomon’ approach which Sudeep Chakravarti adopts, transforms Plassey from a military account to a history of deceit, conspiracy, even a lament with layers of fascinating details wedged in between each incident. As the narrative unfolds on June 23, 1757, in a brief battle fought in the mango orchard of Plassey, the East India Company’s army led by Lieutenant Robert Clive defeated the forces of the young Nawab of Bengal Siraj-ud-daulah. It allowed the company a unique opportunity of transforming one of the richest provinces of the dwindling Mughal Empire into a new administrative unit run by English merchants who collected taxes through means of a ruthless private army.

Birth of a colonial power

The East India Company’s founding charter authorised waging war and it had always used violence to achieve its ends. But the creation of this new administration marked the moment when the East India Company ceased to be a conventional trading company aiming to secure an international market for its silks and spices and became an aggressive colonial power. In less than four decades it employed a security force twice the size of the British army.

Perhaps those who claim that India had won in Plassey and those who sadly relate that it was lost are both right.

These two groups, however, resort to a common binary from which Chakravarti has been able to rescue his readers.

The book has been divided into three parts — the first provides the background i.e. the decline of the Mughal Empire, the rise of the Bengal Suba, the importance of Murshidabad as a centre of trade with its bankers and the process through which trade had become linked with politics. The focus lies on the squabbles, skirmishes and greed of the European companies to gain entry into this world of wealth.

The second section is the ‘build up to the historic moment of conflict’. The author while tracing the building of Fort William and the establishment of the city of Calcutta makes a fascinating study of what has come down in history text books as the Black Hole tragedy. Naming the chapter ‘Horror or Hoax’ he gives us details from archives built by both the British and the Indians.

The conflicting versions of the narrative on one hand reflects the howls of indignation from several generations of British in India and on the other hand clearly indicates that the British had lost all interest in the tragic incident and were far more concerned about losing their most lucrative trading station in Bengal. In relation to this, the Holwell monument, an epitaph for those unfortunate British men and women, became an object of tourist attraction.

Panoramic show

The third and final section is simply named ‘The Battle.’ The incidents are presented in a blow-by-blow account through eight chapters. Using archival documents, letters, memoirs, the author creates a panoramic show in which Clive, Siraj-ud-daulah, Jagat Seth, Mirjafar, even Siraj’s deceitful aunts and the entire harem all come alive and the readers are given a free choice to pick their favourite actors.

Moving away from the Raj’s boring, loving accounts which whitewashed Clive and the Cambridge historians’ arguments that the East India Company’s victory rested on the support given by the Bengal aristocracy, Chakravarti breaks new ground by quoting men like George Bruce Malleson: “The name of Siraj-ud-daulah stands higher than Clive. He was the only one of the principal actors in the tragic drama who did not attempt to deceive.” This proves beyond doubt that the British historians did not speak in one voice.

Chakravarti’s main strength, however, lies in his command over Bengali sources. From colonised historians like Akshay Kumar Moitra, social reformers such as Vidyasagar, creative writers Nabin Chandra Sen to Rabindranath Tagore, Siraj was transformed back and forth from a spoiled brat, a debauch, a brutal ruler to the betrayed, patriotic, last independent Nawab of Bengal. To these has been added newly researched material from Bangladesh. Driven by the need to establish a national identity and an acceptable narrative, layers of meaning have been added to the accounts of Plassey. The process, identified by the author, makes his perspective markedly different from Indian nationalist writings.

This book has been termed as a work of ‘popular history’. It goes beyond the limitations of such a genre and demonstrates how rigorous historical research may be imaginatively presented.

585,2020/03/21,‘Truck De India’ review: The road to highways,"A delightful read on truck drivers who live in relative obscurity

This debut travelogue has two characters: one, a techie who hits the road to escape the stationary world of desktop mobility, and two, the multiple images of the ‘other’ who literally drives the economy days and nights on end. Karnail, Raju, Jorawar and Liaqat are possible names of the second character, a devil behind the wheels, whose drunken image sends cold shivers down the road for fellow commuters. Truck de India is an epic encounter between the two — the one who forays into an unplanned journey and the other whose life is a euphemism for an endless road travel. What comes out is a delightful read on the life of truck drivers amidst vicissitudes of a marginalised existence.

Uncanny skill

Maligned and demonised, the truckers lead a life in relative obscurity while ferrying the overloads of economy across the length and breadth of the country. Ubhaykar encounters inconveniences on and off the road with an adventurous ease to reveal the humane side of the truckers as they go about confronting the objective realities of society at large. If anything, these drivers have frustratingly developed an uncanny skill of meandering through the underbelly of extortion and corruption to deliver our goods on time. The narrative on oneness of corruption across the country is a grim reminder on how societal apathy has accorded discretionary rights on the powerful to coercively extract from the powerless.

More than just a fun-filled adventurous trip, Truck de India is as much an ethnographic study of a sub-culture that inhabits an ever expanding road network in the country.

From the confines of the truck cabin the humane dimensions of a hard-earned livelihood unfold in its varied forms. At the end, it is a compelling survival story of a toiling informal sector which not only harbours silent reserves of endurance but holds an inexplicable optimism towards their lived realities.

Rare breed

Within the world of limited possibilities, however, the truck drivers don’t miss out on creating opportunities to survive and thrive with an occasional bout of the forbidden stuff. One begins to empathise with this rare breed whose better part of life is consigned to the vagaries on the highways.

With a keen sense of history, Ubhaykar discovers more than what he had set out for. That Salem holds the monopoly of manufacturing sabudana; Dindigul over locks; and Namakkal for fashioning trucks out of metal and wood would not have come easily. It is his hop-on hop-off experience that lands him in unexpected places, exposing him to unanticipated kindness from perfect strangers.

Much like Columbus, Ubhaykar discovers another India by chance. Without doubt, it has indeed been worth the effort.

The author wonders if his writing will make any tangible difference to the truckers’ lives! Whether or not it does only time will tell, but acknowledging the role of an informal sector in keeping the economy in sound health is no less commendable. It is this aspect of the narrative that makes the book an interesting and worthwhile read.

586,2020/03/21,‘Andal appeared in a dream and told me to write a novel about her’: Sharanya Manivannan,"Andal might be revered as a poet-goddess, but ‘The Queen of Jasmine Country’, Sharanya Manivannan’s fictive reimagining of her story, is more a book about writing

In her lyrical novel, The Queen of Jasmine Country, Sharanya Manivannan imagines the transformation of a young Kodhai into the Tamil poet-goddess Andal. In an email interview, Manivannan speaks of the challenges in writing about the only female Alwar, the research she did for the book, and why she combined prose with poetry:

How did you choose Andal (or Kodhai) as the subject of your book?

As a reader, I’d cherished Andal for a long time before Kodhai came to me. I would have been too intimidated by the grandiosity of the hagiographic figure to have chosen her as a subject, let alone a protagonist. But, quite literally, she asked. She appeared in a dream and told me to write a novel about her, and I did.

You have imagined the story of the only female Alwar. When you select such a revered figure, a goddess, to write about, how do you maintain the fine balance between the human and the sacred? Was this difficult and did you have any apprehensions about how it would be received?

I did have apprehensions about how the book would be received, particularly as there had been a misogynistic and casteist controversy over Andal around the time I was working on my novel, and I was writing through the heartbreak of a close friendship dissolving over similar views expressed. But I had to honour the voice that was coursing through me, compelling me not to stop. The fact that the epithet ‘Andal’ was given to her centuries after her life helped: it allowed me to focus exclusively on my protagonist’s humanity.

She has no idea that her poems will become eternal. They only express her loneliness and her hopes, reflecting the vows she has undertaken to bring love into her life. I’m not interested in either unthinking glorification or in lazy iconoclasm. This meant offering empathy even for parts of the character that made me uncomfortable (an example: the choice to not make her dream of her wedding, based on the “Vaaranam Aayiram” poem, an inclusive or subversive one). At the same time, lacing my novel with subtle subversions was important to me. Authors who work with mythology must consider socio-political realities, modern and otherwise, while doing so.

What did your research entail?

Queen is really a book about writing, about what is between the lines in a writer’s life. I was interested above all in the quotidian: how ordinary people in medieval Tamilagam lived, and what the inner landscape of a lonely, gifted young woman in that time would have been like.

Historicisation and humanisation were both important. I located the story in the mid-9th century during the reign of Raja Srimara Srivallabha, who plays a role in the hagiography of Kodhai’s father, Vishnuchittan (Periyalvar), a timing correlated by an astronomical detail in her poetry.

The plotline of the novel closely follows the Tiruppavai and the Nachiyar Tirumoli, narrativising the writing of the pasurams themselves. I relied on the original texts, recitations, and Archana Venkatesan’s translation, The Secret Garland.

The shift in tone between the two works is explained thus: the pavai nombu Kodhai observes fails to bring her a husband, and embittered, she undertakes secret rites to Kamadeva (as expounded by Vaishnavism scholar Dennis Hudson).

I thought deeply about how Kodhai came to be literate (both unmarried and literate, unusually), how and when she found time to write, what she encountered as a reader, and who and what inspired her. An obsessive reader falls into text after text and conjures them up in her own, sometimes without being able to trace each imprint — for instance, a lifetime of loving poems, goddess mythologies and feminist literature went into Nappinnai-Radha appearing in my novel as the cowherd Matatilli.

The book is lyrical. Was this deliberate, as Andal was a poet, or did your own poetic sensibilities naturally dictate your prose?

The lyricism was deliberate, especially as the narrative is in the first person, but was equally informed by my own natural prose style.

587,2020/03/21,"Coronavirus | Vaccine was rapidly synthesised as novel coronavirus sequence was available, says virologist Gagandeep Kang","It will take at least a year, if not longer, before we have a vaccine for commercial use, says Dr. Kang, who is the executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad.

Just over three months after the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was shared by Chinese researchers, an messenger-RNA (mRNA) vaccine is being tested at Seattle in a Phase-1 clinical trial on 45 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 to 55 years over a period of approximately six weeks.

The trial began on March 16 at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle. The study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants.

Coronavirus | The Hindu brings out e-book on essential COVID-19 information

The vaccine (mRNA-1273) was developed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), U.S., scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial.

Virologist Gagandeep Kang, who is the executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad, in an email to The Hindu explains how the mRNA vaccine is developed and how it has become possible to get the vaccine ready for testing so quickly.

What makes the use of messenger-RNA (mRNA) for the vaccine different from the conventional vaccines and how does it work?

Most of the vaccines we know are based on a whole organism (bacteria or virus, living or dead) or a part of an organism. Usually these organisms cause disease, but to make vaccines, the organism are manipulated by heat, chemical or other biological approaches to ensure that their pathogenicity has been removed. These vaccines, when given to a person, act like an infection, but without producing disease. The parts of the organism which are recognised by the immune response are called antigens, and when they are recognised, an immune response is made, as either antibodies or activated immune cells that protect from disease when the same infection is seen again.

Unlike a usual vaccine, RNA vaccines work by the introduction of an mRNA sequence into the host’s cells. This mRNA codes for a disease-specific antigen. Once inside a cell, the mRNA instructs the cell to produce the antigen, which is recognised by the immune system which makes an antibody or cellular response.

Currently, two forms of mRNA vaccines are been widely developed against multiple pathogens: conventional mRNA vaccines and self-amplifying mRNA vaccines, which are derived from positive strand RNA viruses.

How has it become possible to develop an mRNA vaccine in just about three months? Is it necessary to have the virus to develop the vaccine?

In part, reseachers were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS.

We have incredible genome sequencing capacity now, and got the SARS-CoV-2 sequence in early January 2020. Since all you need for the mRNA vaccine is the sequence of the pathogen, a vaccine could be rapidly synthesised in the laboratory.

Coronavirus | Testing is the easiest thing to do, says Gagandeep Kang

The mRNA can be made synthetically by in vitro transcription or reading of a plasmid DNA template, with a recombinant RNA polymerase. A cap and tail are attached to from a mature mRNA sequence.

No, the virus is not required, but the genome sequence [of the virus] is needed. The messenger RNAs are produced synthetically and this is what makes the technology rapid and reproducible.

Since a particular protein (spike protein) found on the virus is what binds to receptors found on human cells and then infect them, will the vaccine use mRNAs produced for this protein?

The first vaccine to enter human trials is Moderna’s mRNA-1273. This is a novel lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA vaccine that codes for the full-length prefusion stabilised spike (S) protein.

How do vaccine developers know which mRNAs of the spike protein are produced? How do they select the correct ones to be included in the vaccine?

The gene sequences of the proteins of coronaviruses are known. Even with a novel virus, it is possible to figure out which sequence codes for which protein. Only one mRNA is included and it is selected based on sequence matching.

Are the mRNAs used in the vaccine packed in some protective material or used bare?

In the case of Moderna, the mRNA is stabilised so that is protected from enzymes that might break it down.

Has this vaccine already been tested in animals for safety or is it tested on human volunteers bypassing animal trials? How ethical is this?

The US FDA has approved studies to proceed in parallel so human studies are also being done with the same product. The mRNA platform technology by which the vaccine was made has already been used safely in 1,700 volunteers for other mRNA vaccines. So the FDA will have considered that in its decision. There are always worries about ethics when testing in emergencies, because safety should be paramount for vaccines, but there is, so far, no safety signal [adverse effects] from the Moderna mRNA platform.

Coronavirus | China gives go-ahead for human trials of COVID-19 vaccine

With regard to the parallel studies in animals also, one unusual aspect of the mRNA-1273 vaccine is that although other formulations of similar vaccines have been tested on animals, this particular vaccine construct has not been evaluated in the appropriate animal model which is a transgenic mouse expressing the ACE2 receptor. Tal Zaks, Chief Medical Officer of Moderna was quoted in STAT, a news outlet, as saying: “I don’t think proving this in an animal model is on the critical path to getting this to a clinical trial,” He also pointed out that National Institute of Health scientists are “working on nonclinical research in parallel.”

Has there been any instance before when an mRNA vaccine has been tested on humans?

Many candidate vaccines have been produced using this technology and are in various phases of testing. Currently, there are over 20 candidates for infectious diseases and cancers from multiple groups. This is a new technology and, as yet, there are no licensed products.

Will mRNA vaccine produce better protection against the virus than vaccines developed through the conventional route?

We do not know yet what will work and how well, which is why multiple approaches are being taken for vaccine development.

How long will it take before we have a vaccine for commercial use?

It will take at least a year, if not longer.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/g1hpor/article31129227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-SCIGAGANDEEP-KANG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-vaccine-was-rapidly-synthesised-as-novel-coronavirus-sequence-was-available/article31129228.ece

“Government will give grants-in-aid to States with a maximum limit of ₹1,000 crore per bulk drug park, which will have common facilities such as solvent recovery plant, distillation plant, power and steam units, common effluent treatment plant etc.,” noted the release.

The bulk drugs parks scheme is expected to reduce the manufacturing cost of bulk drugs in the country and dependency on other countries for such as drugs.

“The Production Linked Incentive Scheme will lead to expected incremental sales of ₹46,400 crore and significant additional employment generation over 8 years,’’ noted the release.

The Indian pharmaceutical industry is the 3rd largest in the world by volume. However, despite this achievement, India is significantly dependent on import of basic raw materials, viz., bulk drugs that are used to produce medicines. In some specific bulk drugs, the import dependence is 80 to 100%.

“Continuous supply of drugs is necessary to ensure delivery of affordable healthcare to the citizens. Any disruption in supplies can have significant adverse impact on drug security, which is also linked to the overall economy of the country.

At 4.30 a.m. on March 1, a flight from Abu Dhabi landed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai. Among those disembarking from the aircraft was a group of 40 returning from a six-day Dubai-Abu Dhabi tour.

The travellers said goodbye to one another and headed home. Some of them, who live in Mumbai, went home by road. Others began their journey to Pune, Yavatmal, Ahmednagar, Beed and Nagpur. Three women, all senior citizens, went to Belgaum in Karnataka. It is now believed that the novel coronavirus, which has spread like wildfire and brought the world to a grinding halt, travelled with them to Maharashtra.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

On March 9, a 51-year-old manager from Pune (to protect his identity, let’s call him Praful) and his 42-year-old wife, who were both part of the tour, tested positive for COVID-19. “It was our first foreign tour. Who had thought we would come back to become the index patients of some new kind of virus?” says Praful, who had booked the tour for his 25th wedding anniversary. Praful had saved for over a year and liquidated some of his fixed deposits to pay for the trip that cost ₹85,000 per person. To feel at ease in a new country, the couple also took their 23-year-old daughter along. She too tested positive for COVID-19 the next day, along with the cab driver who ferried them from Mumbai airport to Pune.

“I had started feeling feverish the day we reached home. I popped a paracetamol and went to a doctor the next day,” says Praful. At the time, he says, his wife and daughter had no symptoms. “The medication worked initially. But the fever returned. That’s when the doctor suggested that I go to the civic hospital to test for COVID-19.” On March 9, when he visited the Naidu Hospital, doctors took his throat swab and sent it for testing. His wife, a close contact, was also tested. The reports from Pune’s National Institute of Virology (NIV) laboratory arrived a few hours later. Both Praful and his wife had tested positive for COVID-19. This triggered a flurry of activity at the hospital. The couple was forbidden to leave the premises. “We thought that would last 4-5 days. But it’s nearing two weeks now,” says Praful, who has been admitted in the isolation ward of Naidu Hospital.

What followed was nothing short of an investigation. The minutest movements of the couple had to be pieced together. Two doctors sat with Praful and his wife separately to probe what they had done over the last eight days. One of them was Anil Todsam, the residential medical officer at Naidu Hospital. “History-taking is a tedious task, especially when you are not simply asking medical questions but general questions about their everyday life,” he says. Todsam prepared a list of people with whom Praful’s wife had interacted. The list was mind-boggling. It included vegetable vendors, the milkman, neighbours, yoga classmates, and a large group of women she had mingled with at a Women’s Day event. Todsam began jotting down as many numbers as possible. The exercise took him more than three hours.

On the other hand, Praful had limited contacts. He had been to work one day. Two of his colleagues who sat close to him were put on the watch list. The couple’s daughter, a 19-year-old son who did not join them on the trip as he had exams, and the cab driver were also summoned. At the end of the day, a list of nearly 50 contacts was drawn up.

Meanwhile, the larger contact-tracing exercise had begun. “We got in touch with the tour operator and fetched the list of all the group members,” says Ramchandra Hankare, the chief medical officer of Pune Municipal Corporation. When Hankare saw the list, he panicked a little. “The group had dispersed to many corners of the State.”

The beginning in Hubei

In December 2019, China first noticed a cluster of patients with pneumonia in Hubei province. On December 31, it informed the World Health Organization about the cases. The cause of the disease was still undetected. The fact that a new virus had surfaced began to be widely discussed and the world closely followed the developments in Hubei. The primary response was to start screening passengers at airports.

On January 18, the international airport in Mumbai, India’s second busiest airport, began screening all passengers arriving from China. Travellers feared to have been exposed to the virus were sent to isolation wards as a precautionary measure and their samples were sent to NIV, Pune. By March 1, when the group of 40 returned to India, the screening had been extended to travellers coming from 11 other countries: Iran, Italy, Vietnam, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. The UAE did not feature on this list.

“The airport was chaotic when we landed. We must have spent nearly three hours there as many flights had landed around the same time. But we were not screened,” recalls Praful. Two days after the couple from Pune became the index patients in Maharashtra, a senior citizen couple from Mumbai, who had travelled in the same group, tested positive for COVID-19 too. By then, the State had activated its Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme cell and informed the civic bodies and district-level officers. “Within a day, the entire Dubai tour group was tracked and brought to hospitals and their contacts were traced. The Karnataka government was also alerted as three people from the group were from there,” says Anup Yadav, who heads the Directorate of Health Services, Maharashtra. At first, doctors at the airport screened people but as more countries got added to the list, over 100 doctors from the civic body as well as the State had to be posted there in rotational shifts, he says.

‘Like soldiers posted on borders’

Vishal Rakh, a 29-year-old speciality medical officer from the civic-run Nair Hospital in Mumbai, was among the first lot of doctors who were posted at the airport for screening. Armed with a thermal gun, an N95 mask, gloves and surgical caps, Rakh’s primary role was to detect high temperatures and probe the history of travellers. “For the first few days, travellers were extremely impatient. Many would argue with us because the screening caused them delays. But as news about COVID-19 continued to spread, they began to cooperate,” he says. “Most of the travellers are asymptomatic. But they could be in the incubation period and infectious,” says Rakh, who has referred two senior citizens to the Kasturba Hospital’s isolation facility in the past one week. “Both had a fever, co-morbid conditions, and a travel history to COVID-19-affected countries,” he says.

The travellers are divided into three categories. People coming from COVID-19-affected countries and showing symptoms like fever, cough and cold fall in Category A. Those with no symptoms but having co-morbid conditions or who are senior citizens fall under Category B. And those with a travel history but no symptoms fall under Category C. “We had the highest workload during night shifts as most international flights land at that time,” says Rakh. He adds that on an average, they screen 80-90 travellers each during one shift.

At the Kasturba Hospital, Mumbai’s nodal isolation facility, 35-year-old resident doctor Avkash Sinha is among those posted on ‘COVID-19 duty’. He is the first point of contact at ward 9 where a dedicated COVID-19 outpatient department (OPD) has been opened. He has also been on rounds in wards 27, 28 and 29, which are the quarantine wards for those awaiting results. “Ward 30, which is the isolation facility, is the most restricted ward. Only treating doctors go in and out of that ward. That’s where all the patients with COVID-19 are kept,” says Sinha, who studied medicine at the Armed Forces Medical College in Pune and has completed Short Service Commission. “We are like soldiers posted on borders. The enemy here is the virus and our efforts are meant to protect the general population,” says Sinha, who was posted in Jammu and Kashmir for three and half years. While serving in the Army cantonments, he dealt with infectious diseases like chickenpox. “As doctors, we are constantly at risk. But we have responsibilities as well,” he says. All the doctors have made a pact that they will eat food on time, follow good hygiene and infection-control practices, and be well-rested so that they can serve better, he says. “My parents back home in Jharkhand are concerned. I have assured them that I will be cautious,” he says.

In the laboratory

When fear of the virus crept into India, Pune’s NIV was the only laboratory in the country to test samples. By February, the laboratory at Kasturba Hospital was prepared share the load. Trained healthcare staff collect samples from the back of a suspected patient’s throat on tiny nylon or dacron swab sticks and dip them in test tube bottles containing a liquid meant to keep the virus viable for testing. These bottles are carried in a thermos-like vaccine carrier to the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) laboratory on the ground floor of the isolation facility at Kasturba Hospital. As the samples arrive, the scientific officers spring into action.

Patients with COVID-19 symptoms wait for medical examination outside ward 9 at the Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai.

The samples are first put into a lysis buffer solution that helps in breaking the cells and rendering the virus non-viable. Next, the process to extract the RNA of the virus begins, followed by PCR amplification and detection using the real-time PCR system which is connected to a computer running graphs. It is the movement on these graphs that tells us conclusively about the presence of the virus in a sample.

“In a positive test, it takes anywhere between three to five hours to get a screening result and another two hours for the confirmatory result,” says microbiologist Jayanthi Shastri, who is at the helm of the Mumbai lab. The lab is working four shifts to test samples 24X7. At present, the facility tests 100-150 samples daily.

“Sample collection is the most critical step in the entire process,” she says. “The healthcare staff has to rub the swab stick in such a way that enough cells are collected. If that’s not done properly, we cannot interpret the results and the test has to be repeated.”

When more and more cases were reported in Hubei, the scientists were not surprised that the virus moved closer home. “We were not in a slumber. The question in our mind was, will this new virus really hit us? Because, for some reason the SARS outbreak in 2002 never did,” says Shastri. She adds that preparedness of testing facilities began from January 28 when the Indian Council of Medical Research held its very first zoom meeting. “It helped that China released the genetic sequence of the virus on January 11. We got some time to prepare,” she says.

Shastri and her team had an added advantage. In 2009, when the H1N1 pandemic hit the world, the Kasturba Hospital’s PCR laboratory was upgraded to test respiratory samples for the first time. “Till then we were testing blood samples. But to test respiratory samples, a special set up was needed for the safety of the scientists and technicians who are handling the virus,” she says.

Viruses like H1N1 and SARS-CoV-19 latch on to the nasal epithelium. So, the team has to ensure that there is no possibility of aerosolisation (the process of converting some physical substance into the form of particles small and light enough to be carried in the air) in the room where the samples are being handled. Shastri’s team of eight, including scientific officers and technicians, wear protective gear like goggles, gloves and medical gowns and work within special biosafety cabinets with HEPA filters that ensure that the harmful pathogens don’t come in contact with them.

But they cannot completely ignore the risks associated with their job. “Doctors in wards and OPDs deal with patients. We deal with the virus directly. The risk is equal,” says a doctor from the lab, adding that the key is to practice caution instead of being paranoid.

Basic requirements missing

By Friday, 14 people from the Dubai group tested positive for COVID-19 and five of their close contacts were also infected. In Maharashtra, the number of cases jumped to 53, the highest in India. The death of a senior citizen in Mumbai triggered a debate on the State’s preparedness to contain and treat complications. He was on non-invasive ventilator support. Kasturba Hospital, which has admitted all the positive patients from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, does not have a full-fledged ICU. Medical experts say that negative pressure with changing air conditioning cycles, HEPA filters, ultraviolet lights and anterooms are essential for any isolation facility admitting infectious patients.

“The State’s isolation facilities are simple rooms where patients are kept in isolation. The basic requirements of a good isolation facility are missing,” says a doctor. Given that we are dealing with a virus that attacks the respiratory system, ventilators and other supportive devices are crucial. “How many of our district hospitals even have intensive care units and ventilators,” asks public health activist Abhay Shukla. “The capacity of our public hospitals has to be upgraded before the epidemic accelerates,” he says. Dr. Shukla, who is the co-convener of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, says the health system in Maharashtra is highly privatised. “In public health emergencies like these, the State has to in-source private facilities and take control of them,” he says.

Experts say that the epidemic is urban so far, but Maharashtra is a globalised State like Kerala, which puts people at high risk. “The population density varies, but we are 50% urbanised. Social distancing and avoiding crowds are steps in the right direction. But we cannot predict how it will turn out.”

Such epidemics can throw up surprises. For instance, when three people who were a part of the Dubai tour tested positive in the drought-stricken Yavatmal district, nearly 700 km away from Mumbai, the authorities were taken aback. “We have been reading about it in the news but never thought that the virus would reach us,” says Milind Kamble, dean of the government medical college in Yavatmal where the positive patients have been isolated.

Mumbai-based infectious disease specialist Om Shrivastava agrees. The numbers are not overwhelming as of now, he says. “We are in stage two of the epidemic where transmission is still local. Our efforts should be to stop entering stage three, which is community transmission,” says Shrivastava. He says the Maharashtra government’s response has been commendable so far. “We have implemented lockdowns, restricted movement. But we are dealing with a brand new, sly, mysterious virus and it’s hard to predict how it will all pan out,” he says. Many experts, including Shrivastava, say that Maharashtra needs to scale up testing. “We should not be complacent. We have to be watchful,” he says.

At the Naidu Hospital, the index patients and their daughter have now been shifted to the same room. There is considerable distance between their cots. The couple’s son, who did not test positive, has been quarantined on another floor. The trio spend their time watching movies and listening to bhajans on their phones. They are in touch with all the members of the tour group on WhatsApp. Often, the couple skims through pictures from their trip to the Burj Khalifa, Ferrari World, miracle garden, and the mosques. “Everything was so clean and beautiful. I wonder where we got the virus from. It could be from the crowded malls we visited,” says Praful. “Initially, people made us feel like culprits. Our names and photos were circulated. It was disturbing,” he says. “This is a flu. Why does one have to stigmatise so much?”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/4yb47n/article31121861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KASTURBA-COVID-ISOLATION,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/on-the-frontline-fighting-the-coronavirus/article31121864.ece

Isolated inside the SAI Centre here in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s business as usual for the Indian men’s and women’s hockey players as they prepare for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics in a “safe environment”.

The Sports Authority of India Centre, which has been shut for outside visitors, is well-equipped for regular practice sessions and no unauthorised persons are allowed to enter its premises.

“The COVID-19 outbreak has not affected our practice sessions. We are continuously washing our hands and our temperatures are being checked regularly.

“The authorities at our SAI campus are ensuring that we are training in a safe environment,” said the men’s team captain Manpreet Singh.

“With the backing of SAI and our coaches, we have been training very hard for the Olympics,” he added.

Safe environment

The women’s team captain Rani Rampal said her team is fortunate to continue training for the Olympics in a safe environment.

“We are very fortunate to have a facility like the SAI campus here. Everyone is working very hard so that the hockey teams can continue to practice for the Olympics,” said Rani.

“Our health is being monitored everyday and we are taking all the necessary precautions.

592,2020/03/21,Long-tailed macaques show rich tool-use behaviour,"Tool use and object manipulation were observed in six behavioural contexts involving eight different types of objects

In recent times, there has been a lot of interest among primatologists in studying object handling and tool-use in non-human primates such as apes and chimpanzees. A study from IISER Mohali has looked into how long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis umbrosus) in Greater Nicobar Island handle objects and use tools to simplify their efforts.

The researchers observed interesting behaviour related to object manipulation and tool use in six behavioural contexts involving eight different types of objects. They also saw that males were more frequently involved in tool use than females. The results of the study are published in the International Journal of Primatology.

There is a crucial difference between tool use and object use. A tool helps the user get better outcomes. Jayashree Mazumder, first author of the paper explains in an email to The Hindu: “When we change either the function or structure... of an object, we make it a tool. But when we use an item in the manner it is supposed to be used, we are not making it a tool… it is an object use.”

Identifying individuals

Observing the long-tailed macaques from a distance of about 10 metres for close to four months, Ms Mazumder, who is working for her PhD at IISER Mohali, has developed a catalogue of the individuals studied. Each individual was identified based on marks on the face or body. “Identifying adults is easy. They are like humans with distinct features, for example, presence of black or white spots in different locations of the face, scar marks, body size, sex and behaviour. The juveniles and sub-adults were slightly difficult but they too can be identified in a similar fashion,” says Ms Mazumder.

Stefano S.K. Kaburu, professor at the University of Wolverhampton, U.K., a co-author of the paper introduced her to the behavioural data collecting software and guided her in designing the study methods.

Prevalent in males

As per their observations, 14 individuals used tools, and tool-use was more common among males. “The biased nature of tool-use could be due to many reasons. It has been hypothesised that the weight of the individual has something to do with the tool-culture. Again, the tool activity itself also defines who uses them more often, says Ms Mazumder.

She gives the example of how among chimpanzees, females excel in fishing, which they learn from their mothers. Males, on the other hand, become adept in hunting, which they pick up from their peers. “Thus there could be social, ecological as well as demographic factors that could decide how tool-culture is divided among the animals. But we need more studies to come to any conclusion,” she says.

According to her, the most exciting part was how the macaques decide what tool and technology to use. “Some of the macaques had few trials and errors, but it did not take them long to understand that the technique or tool was not providing the best outcome, and therefore, they were very quick in switching,” she says.

Though the long-tailed macaques are further from humans in relatedness than chimpanzees or apes, this study could offer a perspective on evolutionary origins of tool use behaviour.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nwa59d/article31129249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-SCIMACAQUEpng,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/long-tailed-macaques-show-rich-tool-use-behaviour/article31129250.ece
593,2020/03/21,A step closer to developing a potent drug against novel coronavirus,"The presence of the inhibitor in the lungs even after 24 hours is significant because the virus affects the lungs

Designing better antivirals that would prevent the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from infecting human cells may now become possible thanks to a team of researchers producing the crystal structure of the main protease of the virus. Main virus protease is an enzyme that processes proteins critical to virus development. An antiviral that blocks this enzyme, as in the case of drugs used against HIV virus, effectively prevents the virus from replicating. Hence, such an inhibitor will be effective against the novel coronavirus. The results of the study were published in the journal Science.

Deciphering key enzyme

A team led by Rolf Hilgenfeld from the University of Lubeck, Germany developed the crystal structure of main protease of the virus at 1.75 angstrom resolution. And by redesigning an existing inhibitor developed for other coronaviruses, the researchers have been able to develop a potent inhibitor that can effectively block the enzyme and neutralise the novel coronavirus. “Based on the structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2,” they write.

Main virus protease is one of the best characterised drug targets among coronaviruses. The inhibitor against the main protease targets a specific region of the enzyme. And any antiviral that targets this region of the enzyme will be specific to the virus and will not be toxic to human cells.

The researchers had earlier designed broad-spectrum inhibitors of the main proteases of other coronaviruses. One of the inhibitors showed good antiviral activity against other coronaviruses. Now, the team chose that inhibitor and modified it to increase the amount of time the drug is present in the body and to improve its solubility in plasma.

After the modification, the half-life of the inhibitor (compound 13a) increased three-fold, and the solubility improved by a factor of about 19. And to enhance the antiviral activity, the researchers further modified the inhibitor (compound 13b).

The researchers found that the IC50 (concentration of the compound to produce 50% inhibition) to inhibit the novel coronavirus is 0.90 microMolar. The inhibitor showed good potency to block the replication of the virus at half maximal effective concentration of 1.75 micromolar. In human cells infected with the novel coronavirus, a higher half maximal effective concentration of the inhibitor was required.

Effective inhibitor

The metabolic stability of the 13a inhibitor originally modified was found to be “good” in both mouse and human microsomes (a fragment of endoplasmic reticulum and attached ribosomes). Even at the end of 30 minutes, around 80% of the residual compound in mouse and 60% in human cells remained metabolically stable. When the inhibitor was administered subcutaneously into mice, the inhibitor was present in the plasma for as long as four hours but was excreted via urine for up to a day.

The half-life of the compound 13b was found to be 1.8 hours. But most importantly, even after 24 hours there was some amount (33 nanogram per gram) of the compound 13b in the lung tissue. The presence of the inhibitor in the lungs even at the end of a day is particularly signifiicant as the virus affects the lungs.

No adverse effects

The team tested for any adverse effects when mice inhaled the inhibitor 13b. “Inhalation was tolerated well and mice did not show any adverse effects, suggesting that this way, direct administration of the compound to the lungs would be possible,” they write.

Given the “favourable results” the study provides a “useful framework for development” of drugs to combat the novel coronavirus, the authors claim in the paper.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/kgu0yb/article31129219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-SCICORONA-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/a-step-closer-to-developing-a-potent-drug-against-novel-coronavirus/article31129220.ece
594,2020/03/21,Musical scales are a prehistoric gift to us,"During the last a few months, several groups have come up with interesting publications on how music affects the mind. The first is a report on March 1 from a group from Indiana University in the U.S., stating that music may overcome delirium in critically ill patients (https://doi.org/10.4037/ajcc2020175). Such patients experience acute mental disturbance, with speech disorder and hallucinations. The researchers attempted to try music as a drug-free intervention in 117 such patients, and gave half of them music - either their own personally chosen music (PM), or relaxing slow tempo music (STM), and compared them with a control group which was not offered music. The music was offered to the experimental group for 1 hour, twice daily for a week, and their progress noted. Results revealed that such music delivery (PM or STM, either was OK) reduced the incidence of delirium. When audio-books were offered instead of music, it did not help! The STM chosen had relaxing (60-80 beats per minute) classical music, native American flute sounds, or relaxing piano music — all preselected by a board-certified music therapist. They concluded that music is a useful non-pharmacological intervention for critically ill patients.

A little earlier was published a report in Current Science (118(4), 612-620; 2020 ) from Dr. B. Geethanjali of SSN College, Chennai, and her colleagues, titled “Evaluating the effect of music intervention on hypertension”. They did a randomised controlled assessment of 200 high-blood-pressure patients, measuring their heart rate, respiratory rate (RR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP), and found that these parameters declined after music intervention for one month. The researchers chose to offer music intervention, along with the regular treatment, and chose the raga Hindolam (or Malkauns) — a pentatonic, ‘low arousal’, and pleasant one. (As we all know and experience, fast music and rhythms are ‘high arousal’, and excite us).

About this time also, the well known music therapist, Rajam Shankar of Hyderabad came out with a scholarly and well-researched monograph: “the healing power of music”, with details on the kind of ragas that can be used in therapy, and a detailed description of as many as 35 known Carnatic music ragas (many common to Hindustani music too), and some case studies.

A ‘universality’ to music appreciation

Note that while America’s Indiana University researchers used music that was familiar to the patients of the ‘Western’ cultural background, and the Chennai authors used the music familiar in the South, the question is can music penetrate cultural differences with its ability to evoke emotions? This is the question that was studied by the brain researcher Nandini Chatterji Singh of the National Brain Research Centre at Manesar, Haryana, and the results of her studies have appeared six months ago in the journal PLos One (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0222380). Here, she and her group played excerpts from twelve ragas from Hindustani music, online to 144 people from many parts of India, and 112 participants from non-Indian cultural backgrounds ( from the U.S., the U.K., parts of Europe, Japan, Korea). They played the aalap part (a slow paced introduction of the swaras of the raga, which define the sequence of the notes of the octave, with no rhythm) followed by the gat (the same melodic sequence of the swaras but in a faster pace, and with the accompaniment of a percussion instrument (usually a tabla) with an explicit rhythmic cycle). These were played on a sarod. When ragas such as Hansadhwani were played, both the ‘encultured’ listeners from India and the ‘non-encultured’ group from abroad felt ‘happy’ or ‘romantic’, and when the raga Marwa was played, they described a feeling of ‘sadness’. The non-encultured group responded to the rhythmic part, the gat, more readily. This, the researchers point out, is in agreement with other reports wherein American members in the audience reacted more readily when they witnessed traditional Indian classical dance. There thus appears to be an ‘universality’ in emotions in the auditory domain. They further note that a similar kind of reaction when foreigners were invited to listen to music of the Javanese people.

Ancestral gift!

This raises the question of how this universality has come about, and how music across the world uses the basic tonal alphabets and rhythms. Is this an evolutionary gift to us, much as DNA sequences are? What are the origins of music in us humans? A whole field termed ‘biomusicality’ has come about since the 1990s, which studies the origins of music, what areas of the brain are involved in music processing and the functions, uses and costs of music making, and what universal features can be detected across various cultures. Some researchers have suggested that prehistoric humans played the ‘drum’ from whatever material they found suitable, and that it is an evolutionary borrowal from our ancestral cousins, the primates. And some archaeologists have looked at the kind of music from prehistoric, Paleolithic ages of humans (Neanderthals) about 4000-5000 years ago. The first such prehistoric musical instrument was a ‘flute’, made of the bone of a young bear, in Slovenia; this find has at least three holes in the hollowed out bone, perhaps there were more, which were broken away when found.

Another set of flutes, found in the Jiahu region of China, was dated even earlier (7000 -8000 years ago, using isotope dating methods), and when the researchers played them (vertically like a shehnai), they found the music reminded them of the traditional do, re, fa, so la, ti (or sa, re, ga, ma pa..) scale! (More on this in my earlier column in The Hindu, of October 14, 1999). Recall what Saint Thyagaraja wrote: Sobhillu Saptaswara ( worship the goddess presiding over the seven swaras- from the navel to the heart to the throat, tongue and the nostrils)!
