The unexpected closure of schools across the country as part of controlling the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown up challenges for parents. Now, with the lockdown too in place, we talk to a few Malayali parents to know how they are keeping their kids engaged on their extended vacationWith the lockdown in full force, my son Sidharth and I have found a new interest – book cricket. We have two teams and take the last digit of the page numbers as the runs the batsman scores every ball. This also helps Sidharth, who is nine years old, calculate mentally and he also gets to know more about international cricket teams and players. I also focus on getting him physically active. As we are inside the house, I try to get him to do small workouts with me daily to keep him healthy.My eight-year-old daughter Roya knows we can’t go out now, and so she spends her time making crafts by looking at do-it-yourself videos on YouTube and also colouring them. Her creative projects include making greeting cards for her friends and family, paper wallets, paper notebooks and drawing. She also likes reading fables and watching dance videos of children. She knows the lockdown is for protection against Covid-19 and is determined that unless she completes her craftwork, she won’t move from the place.My six-year-old son Advik R Krishna does get bored but he tries to overcome that by inventing his own games like a simple quiz where he gets to play the quiz master. He has stopped watching TV and now has developed a keen interest in reading books and children’s magazines. I think the lockdown has made kids explore all options to stave off boredom. Earlier it was hard to make him sit and read storybooks, but now he does it voluntarily. If Advik loves the stories, he also tries to draw the characters. He is also now a storyteller and makes up his own characters and tales.While the lockdown has spoiled our summer vacation plans, we are now thinking of ways of making it fun for our four-year-old daughter Shreya at home. As both my wife and I have to work from home, our day usually starts by waking up early and we have also got Shreya to do the same. She used to draw pictures, read books, watch baby videos but we also want her to be aware of daily activities and household chores that would be useful to her in the future. She now joins us when we are watering the plants and even helps with getting vegetables from the fridge when we are cooking. When she does that, she also learns to count and the names of the vegetables. By involving her in washing and cleaning, we make her understand the importance of cleanliness and the need to lead a hygienic lifestyle. This helps the child to learn to be responsible.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74879091,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-3049029,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/malayali-parents-keep-their-children-creatively-engaged-during-lockdown/articleshow/74878568.cms

4,['30/03/2020'],Corona: The first film on the Coronavirus addresses racism,"The first Coronavirus movie is ready and its trailer is here. Canadian-Persian filmmaker Mostafa Keshvari ’s English film, Corona , is said to be a suspense drama that carries the tagline ‘Fear is a virus’. Shot in a single take, the film follows seven neighbours, all belonging to different racial backgrounds, who are trapped in an elevator during a pandemic. Amid discussions about a virus in the building, one of them, an Asian-origin woman, coughs, and the lift stalls. Mostafa, who wrote the story and filmed it in February before the Coronavirus affliction was declared a pandemic , says it was the various instances of racism that inspired the story. “When the virus first broke out, there was open racism towards Chinese-origin Canadians. The virus was referred to as the ‘Chinese virus’. As a filmmaker, who belongs to a minority community, I could relate to them and decided to use my film to fight racism,” he says. Mostafa, who condemns xenophobia, says one of the biggest takeaways from his film is his learnings about dharma right from his young age when he was influenced by Buddhism.""Today, the fact is that the virus doesn't belong to one specific race anymore and all of humanity must come together to defeat it. We all have a role in this universe to fulfil. I may not be able to save lives like doctors during the pandemic, but I can make films that could potentially save lots of people from discrimination and racism by changing their perspective.""Mostafa adds that his diverse cast and crew has people from various nationalities, which includes Mrinmoyee Ghose, an Indian student there who worked as his art director.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74875386,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-203302/74875386.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/english/hollywood/the-first-film-on-the-coronavirus-addresses-racism/articleshow/74875386.cms
5,['30/03/2020'],Iconic ethnic newspaper ceases print edition after 50 years,"NEW YORK: An iconic ethnic Indian newspaper in the US that catered to the Indian diaspora for the last 50 years has announced that it will cease the print edition from Monday due to pre-existing troubles in the publishing industry worsened by the cancellation of advertisements amidst the coronavirus outbreak.Suresh Venkatachari, chairman and a publisher of India Abroad , a weekly newspaper, announced its decision to cease the print edition.Founded by Indian-American publisher Gopal Raju in 1970, India Abroad rose to great heights of popularity by focusing on Indian news meant for expatriate audience.In 2001, Raju sold the publication to Rediff.com. In late 2016, Rediff.com sold its venture to 8K Miles Media Inc. ""Dear readers, I regret to inform you that India Abroad will cease its print publication at the end of March 2020. The last issue of India Abroad will be dated March 30,"" Venkatachari said.""For the thousands of readers for whom India Abroad has been an integral part of their Indian-American journey, the close of the publication maybe heart-rending, but hardly surprising, given the reversal of fortunes of print publications in the United States and across the world,"" he said.""Like many newspapers, India Abroad has been struggling with declaring advertising revenues and subscriptions since the advent of the Internet age. The past few years have been particularly difficult even as we revamped the newspaper under the aegis of 8K Miles Media,"" he said.""Compounding all of this, was the advent of the ominous coronavirus pandemic and the devastating repercussions in its wake, which led to several advertisers cancelling their advertisement and hence the looming outlook for future revenue generation appearing even more bleak,"" he said.Venkatachari said people expressed fears to touch physical copies of newspapers, magazines and journals on newsstands and those delivered to them, which may have gone through several contacts, and the post office also indicating that it will give priority only for the delivery of letters.It led to the possibility that publications may be delayed or may not even reach subscribers and added to the woes of publishing houses reeling from the cancellation of advertisements, he said.""Over the past 50 years, India Abroad has been a leader in the ethnic media, serving the Indian-American community with integrity and professionalism. Despite many challenges and pressures, it has remained steadfast in its editorial integrity and impartiality. It wore attacks from the partisan left and the right as badges of honour,"" he said.Several generations of Indian Americans have gone on to the great strides and achieve great heights in different fields, including politics, business, technology, literature and entertainment , after they have been first featured in the pages of India Abroad.""The publication will always be a proud part of their origin story,"" Venkatachari said.Perhaps, the most influential role India Abroad played as a newspaper of record is in the annals of US-India relations. It has been the premier publication to engage the political establishment in Washington, DC, including members of US Congress, administration officials and the diplomatic corps in recording relations between the United States and India, he said.""As the curtain comes town, it is only fitting to remember the founder and editor Gopal Raju, who built India Abroad into an institution that has a special place in the history of Indians in America,"" he said.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/iconic-ethnic-newspaper-ceases-print-edition-after-50-years/articleshow/74879598.cms
6,['30/03/2020'],"For failing to enforce lockdown at Anand Vihar ISBT, 2 senior Delhi govt officers suspended, 2 get notice","New Delhi: Taking tough action against officers for failing to enforce the Centre’s guidelines on containment of Covid-19 by allowing thousands of migrant workers to congregate in large numbers at Anand Vihar ISBT in violation of the lockdown, the home ministry on Sunday initiated disciplinary proceedings against four Delhi government officers for “dereliction of duty”.While two officers — additional chief secretary Renu Sharma (transport department) and principal secretary, finance Rajiv Verma — have been suspended with immediate effect, two other officers — additional chief secretary, home and land buildings department Satya Gopal and SDM , Seelampur, Ajay Arora — were issued showcause notices. It is also contemplating initiating proceedings for major penalty against both Sharma and Verma.A home ministry release issued late on Sunday evening said, “It has been brought to the notice of the competent authority that the... officers, who were responsible to ensure strict compliance to the instructions issued by chairperson, national executive committee, formed under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, regarding containment of spread of Covid-19, have prima facie failed to do so. “These officers have failed to ensure public health and safety during the lockdown restrictions to combat Covid-19. Due to the serious lapse in performance of their duties, the competent authority has initiated disciplinary proceedings against the officers.”Sharma oversaw deployment of buses to bring migrant workers to Anand Vihar ISBT and ferrying them to 8-9 locations in UP on Saturday. Verma was responsible for distribution of food through hunger relief centres. He was to oversee various locations across the city to make sure work was being done by DMs and SDMs who report to him.The availability of DTC buses to ferry migrant workers in large numbers to the UP border and ISBT has been at the centre of discussion with regard to crowding of inter-state borders and streets in the capital on Saturday. The Delhi government was accused by UP of not doing enough to hold back migrants, a charge that has been denied. The UP government subsequently made arrangements to transport people from the border to hinterland destinations to clear the human logjam.Home ministry sources said they decided to initiate disciplinary action against the officers as their inability to manage the migrant worker exodus had put a large number of people at risk of Covid-19 infection at a time when it has affected over 1,000 people across the country. The action is also a warning for other officers as they enforce the guidelines issued by the home ministry under the Disaster Management Act to not go lax in their implementation.While the Seelampur SDM was issued show cause notice as Anand Vihar bus station falls under his jurisdiction, the transport secretary was suspended for failing to prevent/contain congregation of large number of migrant workers, in violation of social distancing guidelines, at the bus station.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74879579,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-689856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/for-failing-to-enforce-lockdown-at-anand-vihar-isbt-action-against-four-officers/articleshow/74879497.cms
7,['30/03/2020'],PM Modi condoles death of IAF veteran,"NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday condoled the death of Air Vice Marshal (retd) Chandan Singh Rathore , describing him as a valorous air warrior.

Rathore, 95, died at his Jodhpur residence on Sunday morning. He is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter. He had distinguished himself as a young air warrior during the Sino-India 1962 war and the 1971 Indo-Pak war.

""India will always remember the impeccable service of Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Chandan Singh Rathore. He was a valorous Air Warrior who contributed towards a stronger and safer India,"" Modi tweeted. ""Pained by his demise. Condolences to his family. Om Shanti .""

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also paid tributes to the IAF veteran.

8,['30/03/2020'],India’s energy demand dips sharply as lockdown bites,"NEW DELHI: India’s demand for petrol, diesel and jet fuel has declined by up to a third in the last five weeks, while power consumption dropped by a quarter as the coronavirus pandemic and the 21-day lockdown to check the infection from spreading brought almost all commercial and industrial activities to a grinding halt.But LPG demand recorded 4% growth during this period as families were confined to their homes due to the lockdown. On year-ago basis, the demand is higher by 6.5%.Latest data from grid operator POSOCO shows power consumption dropping to 2.59 billion units on Friday, the third day of the national lockdown. This is a level last seen on March 1, 2015, when India had 25% less generation capacity.Power consumption has fallen as the lockdown hit the largest chunk of demand -- industry (41%), agriculture (18%) and commercial establishments (8%). Domestic consumption make up 33% of the demand, which is expected to rise over the next fortnight or so when families staying at home switch on air-conditioners as temperature rises.Chairman of India’s largest refiner and fuel retailer IndianOil, Sanjiv Singh said demand for petrol has fallen by 13.5% between February 20 and March 28, diesel 21%, jet fuel 27% because the lockdown curbed economic activities.The lower demand for refined products has forced state-run oil refiners to taper crude processing and invoke ‘force majeure’ clause to put off oil shipments for April as they have run out of storage for crude and refined products. News agency Reuters last week reported liquefied natural gas importers too deferring cargoes under the same clause after demand shrivelled as the lockdown sent CNG vehicles off the road and shuttered industries.Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday explained the situation to his Saudi Arabian counterpart Abdulaziz bin Salman and Aramco CEO Amin Nasser through video-conference and requested additional LPG supply. The oil price crash also figured in the talks.India imports 55% of the 27.5 million tonne of LPG it consumes in a year and Saudi Arabia supplies some 200,000 tonne of the fuel every month. It is also India's second-largest oil supplier, selling close to 2 million tonnes of crude very month.Singh, who continues to work in spite of losing his father two days back, told TOI the company has mapped the demand for April and all its crude and products are full. He said the oil companies have crude and product stocks to last 10-15 days. LPG stocks are good for 20-22 days and additional supplies were being tied up from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE.“The PSU oil companies hold enough stock of LPG to last 20-22 days. Crude and refined product stocks are good enough to last for 10-15 days. Please don’t panic. It stretches the system,” he said.“I expect LPG demand to rise further as people remain confined to their homes and free supply of refills to 8.3 crore poor households under Ujjwala scheme. We are tying up additional LPG shipments from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and UAE,” he said. India imports 55% of the 27.5 million tonne of LPG it consumes in a year and Saudi Arabia supplies some 200,000 tonne of the fuel every month.IndianOil has mapped the demand for April “as the period till mid-June is crucial for the farm sector.” “If the lockdown continues for longer, we will have to prepare for that. But whenever the demand comes, our tanks all over the country are full. Our personnel continue to man their stations hand in hand with associates. There will be no dearth of products anywhere,” Singh said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/indias-energy-demand-dips-sharply-as-lockdown-bites/articleshow/74879812.cms

While talking to Bombay Times , the lyricist-writer and the chairman of the IPRS, said that the decision was made unanimously during the society’s first-ever board meeting held virtually, through video and conference calls, a few days before the complete lockdown had set in.“No one opposed the idea because each one of us understands the gravity of the situation. Royalties earned from music are collected by us and they go to the publisher, author and composer. Depending on their body of work, certain companies and individuals collect far more royalty than others. I felt that we should do something for those who don’t have enough royalty coming their way to sail through this difficult time,” explained Javed, adding, “We drew up a list of about 3,000 people from the music fraternity and hopefully, this week, we will be able to start sending them monetary relief so that they have the means for basic supplies.”Originally, the idea was to distribute a smaller amount every week, but Rakesh Nigam , the CEO of IPRS, said, “We have decidedto send out the amount in one go so that people can stock up sufficient supplies. We have a welfare and benevolence fund formed by using a percentage of the royalties earned by our members. We’re using about Rs 3 crore from that fund to help those in need. We will look at doing something more if the situation persists for too long. We don’t accept donations, and neither do we run a business that supports us.

It’s lockdown mode for several countries, including India. And while there may be no way of travelling anywhere in the real world, in the virtual one, you can hit the road. Blue skies, beautiful mountains, bustling cities and road adventures are making for a respite for a bunch of folks, who can get out into these locales, via virtual travel-themed board games. Ready to go?There are so many places on the world map to choose from for these board gamers. Riddhi Dalal, a board gaming expert, says, “In addition to basic board games that can be played at home now, one of the key themes is travel, considering we can’t do that in the current scenario. The best part is, they let you take on another avatar as you jet set. Want to be a zombie slayer, detective or even a space ranger? Just go for it!”She adds, “Most companies have enabled their games to be free in these times and they are a lot of fun. In Tokaido, for instance, you can travel in Japan from Edo to Tokyo. You get to go to scenic spots, stop at selfie points and collect souvenirs. I play this with people all over the globe.”Adds Chembur-based IT marketing professional, Meenakshi Vivekanand, “I like to play Jaipur and Istanbul-centric games with my pals. I also enjoy Onitama, which gives a flavour of the Far East.”The games are doing more than busting boredom that arises from being indoors all the time. They are raking up a few skill sets, too. “In one game that I have started playing, I have to create mosaic walls a la Gaudi (the famous architect) and in another, I have to build those beautiful blue domes off the water in Santorini, Greece — it makes for such a zen like experience,” says gamer Taha Kapadia. Thane-based gaming enthusiast, Aditya Jairam, explains why it’s such a balm for the soul now. “The visuals are amazing in these games,” he says, adding, “In a four-player game, you have to colonise an island strategically, using the resources that are available.

CHENNAI: When Dubai’s health authorities began door-to-door screening on Saturday for Covid-19 cases in Naif, one of the city’s most populous localities, public health officials in Kerala felt a stab of anxiety. Nearly 70% of those who have returned to the Kerala’s Kasargod district in the past few days lived in this crowded commercial-cum-residential area of the Gulf metropolis.These returnees — Kasargod accounted for 34 of the 39 new cases reported in Kerala on Friday — have now been categorised as “high-risk” and are being tested for the novel coronavirus infection. “These people have become the biggest concern for the state,” said Dr Amar Fettle, Kerala’s state nodal officer for infectious diseases.Many of those who returned from Gulf countries to India in February and early March were neither screened at airports nor advised to quarantine themselves. The focus then was on passengers from China, South Korea, Iran , Spain, Italy and Germany. Dubai and Saudi Arabia weren’t even on the radar. Orders for screening passengers from the Gulf did not come until March second week.As a result, in the past 10 days, several states are seeing a spike in the number of patients with a history of living in or transiting through Gulf countries.In Maharashtra, for instance, the novel coronavirus arrived with a group of 40 people who had gone on a six-day trip to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. “At least 15 from the group have tested positive so far,” officials said.After Kasargod became Kerala’s Covid-19 hotspot in a single day, the district administration put 6,511 people who came into the district after February 20 under observation, of which 127 people are in isolation in hospitals. “The number of people in isolation will increase in the coming days. The results of 215 samples are expected in a day or two,” Dr Fettle said.Public health officials and experts across the country say screening of passengers from the Middle East should have started much earlier in March. “A large number of professionals and skilled workers from across India migrate to the Gulf for employment. It is also one of the most popular transit hubs. That by itself makes it a high-risk zone,” said public health activist Dr Sumanth Raman.Kerala now is observing nearly 300 contacts of these travellers who landed in Mumbai on March 1 and dispersed to 10 districts, including Belagavi district in the bordering state of Karnataka More than three-fifth of the Covid-19 patients in Maharashtra have an international travel history. Most patients travelled from the UAE, according to an analysis by the Maharashtra state department of medical education. Tracking the case sheets of 122 positive cases, officials found 67 people with travel history. Around 28 of them had travelled to the UAE.In Bihar , a 38-year-old, who died on March 21 before he tested positive for the virus, had landed in Kolkata from the Gulf and returned home to Munger district on March 13 by car. He went to Patna Medical College and Hospital with symptoms, and doctors there referred him AIIMS-Patna. All his relatives who took his body in a private ambulance were exposed. Four people, including two private hospital staff, have since tested positive, forcing the Patna district administration to seal the private hospital, where he first visited.In Gujarat, more than half the patients with a travel history have come from Dubai or Saudi Arabia. Among 47 people who tested positive, 27 had returned from abroad. Of these, seven were from Dubai and eight were from Saudi.Last week, after the department of immigration handed over names and travel history of all passport holders, the states are beginning to isolate those who travelled into the country since February.Some of them who are still asymptomatic may be infecting the elderly or people with low immunity, said officials. In Tamil Nadu, for instance, a 60-year-old man from Rajapalayam, who tested positive on Saturday, did not have any travel history. “But he told us he met one of his relatives who came from Dubai. The relative showed no symptoms,” said Tamil Nadu joint director for public health (epidemic diseases) P Sampath. Officials have asked the relative to remain in quarantine. In the past week, at least three people with a history of travel to Dubai have tested positive for the virus in Tamil Nadu.Epidemiologists are noticing interesting patterns. For instance, health workers in Kerala found that most people who tested positive had visited a mall at the airport. The mistake cannot be undone now, but experts say testing more people is the only option for the government. “Track, test, isolate and treat,” said public health expert T Sundararaman, former dean of School of Health Systems Studies, TISS.(Pushpa Narayan and Rajiv G with inputs from centres)",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74881670,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-182093,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/coronavirus-how-dubai-saudi-returnees-slipped-under-radar-leading-to-spike-in-cases/articleshow/74880151.cms

MEERUT: A crowd of mourners, most of them wearing white and brown skull caps, baffled onlookers as they carried a body to the cremation ground in UP's Bulandshahr amid chants of ""Ram naam satya hai"".Ravi Shankar, in his late 40s, had died on Saturday afternoon after a prolonged battle with cancer at his home in Bulandshahr’s Anand Vihar area, leaving behind his wife and four children. With relatives stuck due to the lockdown, Shankar’s distraught wife didn’t know whom to turn to.It was then that a group of neighbours approached the family and offered to take out the funeral procession. Soon, amid Hindu chants, scores of Muslims of the area lifted the cot on which the body was lying and took it to the ghat for the last rites.Videos of the funeral soon went viral on social media platforms, drawing accolades from hundreds of users.The cremation took place according to Hindu rituals and practices.""People from the entire locality came forward to support the family. Both communities have always stood with each other in times of need,"" said Mohammed Zubaid , a local resident.""Given the prevailing condition, people are reluctant to come out of their homes. And in cases of deaths, people are more cautious, unwilling to take part in big gatherings. But here people came out in large numbers though they took care to maintain social distance,"" another resident said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74880237,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-101760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/muslims-take-body-of-hindu-neighbour-for-cremation-in-up/articleshow/74880235.cms
18,['30/03/2020'],Seniors in a lather as TV soaps run dry,"Ganesh Krishnamurthy, 76, sits back on his couch in Chennai, worried about Sreemoyee and her estranged husband Anindya in Kolkata. “Anindya needs a stent for his heart, Sreemoyee’s former love interest has reappeared in her life while their son wants to leave them and go away to another country... Things are at a critical juncture and I don’t know how long I’ll have to wait to see what happens to Sreemoyee and her family,” he rues. ‘Sreemoyee’ isn’t a relative but the title character of a popular Bengali serial who keeps the septuagenarian company for a few hours every evening. Or at least she did till the coronavirus lockdown shut down television production across the country.Unlike the younger tech-savvy population which relies on the web and OTT platforms to stave off boredom while locked down, one cannot underrate the role of television in the lives of the older generation that grew up in an analogue era, navigating channels instead of the web. Now, they are trapped in a cycle of reruns since TV networks have no new episodes to telecast.“It’s quite depressing that I am left with nothing these days,” says Patna resident Sarita Sinha , 62, for whom a diet of Bhojpuri soaps was her only escape from monotony and the darkness of the ongoing pandemic. Thankamani A, a 50-year-old homemaker in Thiruvananthapuram, is “mentally preparing for the coming weeks” after her son told her that her favourite serials may soon stop airing while those like Ashok Mangalkar from Nagpur, who sought refuge in the comfort of Marathi soaps, feels a void. “I miss those evenings of watching daily soaps and afterwards discussing the stories and the character with my wife,” he says.Leena Gangopadhyay, writer and creative director of popular Bengali soaps, has been receiving countless messages from anxious viewers. “All the social media sites are flooded with messages. The mother of an executive of the channel that telecasts ‘Sreemoyee’ is so addicted that she has personally requested for the serial’s storyline,” says Gangopadhyay.How long the delays will continue depends on how long the lockdown lasts. But it’s wise for viewers to come to terms with the fact that the next month (or more) will not follow their usual TV rhythm. Pretty much all prime-time scripted series and non-fiction shows across languages have exhausted their banks of unaired episodes and are now trying to figure what to do in terms of content.If Doordarshan brought back 80s cult hit “Ramayana” to keep its viewers occupied, Hindi channels like Zee TV have decided to dip into their collaboration with ALTBalaji’s OTT repository and dig out three new “finite shows”. “It felt like the right time to see if audiences take to these three finite series which feature very popular television faces of all time,” explained Aparna Bhosle, business head, Zee TV. “Also, it made sense to offer finite series in the current context. The lockdown is temporary, post which we would resume shoots and continue with our usual line-up of daily fiction shows.”Some of the leading Tamil and Malayalam television channels, like Star Vijay , Zee Tamil and Colors, internally assessed the available content and a few found a way to judiciously manage fresh content by cutting down on viewing time of the episodes to prolong shows for a few more days. Content providers for Sun TV even opted to work double-shifts that went well into the early morning of March 19 to capture as much fresh content as possible after the Film Employees Federation of South India’s announcement to stop shoots much before the three-week lockdown came into force.With more than 60-70% content of the channels suspended, according to Ranjan Satapathy , head of Tarang, an Odia entertainment channel, channels have resorted to dubbed versions of popular Hindi serials apart from reruns of soaps and reality shows, old Odia films, and religious programmes. The Kannada television industry that usually keeps a larger reserve of 20 shows too is facing uncertainty with production on pause.In the Telugu-speaking states where the popularity of TV serials often overrides the publicity given to new film releases, fresh episodes came to a grinding halt from March 21, with at least 70 fiction and 20 non-fiction shows not being telecast, according to Telugu Television Producers Council president A Prasada Rao The last time that the Indian television industry had taken such a hit was back in 2008 when more than 100,000 workers had gone on an indefinite “non-cooperation” strike against low wages, late pay and long hours.“But unlike the past when production houses would keep a bank of at least 10-15 unaired episodes, today one doesn’t keep a backup of more than one or two,” says Ashoke Dubey, general secretary, Federation of Western India Cine Employees. “It’s mainly because TRP ratings fluctuate and determine the nature of the next few episodes that are shot a day or two prior to being aired,” he explains.As the entertainment industry stares at loss and disarray, Radikaa Sarathkumar, who heads the Tamil production house Radaan Mediaworks, says: “We did not expect the virus to impact our lives to this extent.” The audience probably echoes that.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74880273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-242070,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/seniors-in-a-lather-as-tv-soaps-run-dry/articleshow/74880275.cms

NEW DELHI: In a move to curb the movement of migrant workers on roads and highways, the Centre on Sunday used the Disaster Management Act to fix responsibility on district magistrates and senior superintendents of police to seal district and state borders while making arrangements for those on the roads to be housed in shelters besides also dissuading such workers from leaving their current place of stay.The measure followed concerns that continued movement of lakhs of migrant workers from various cities to the hinterland could lead to a problematic spread of Covid-19 in rural areas and was accompanied with directions to ensure salaries were paid and employment was not terminated during the ongoing national lockdown and the ensuing shuttering of economic activity in large parts of the country.Responding to questions whether the government was caught unawares by the migrant outflow, Lav Agarwal , joint secretary in the health ministry, said the entire situation due to the global and national spread of coronavirus was unprecedented in scale and the Centre had done its best to anticipate as well as respond to the developing situation on the ground.Apart from enforcing the lockdown, states were directed to ensure all employers, be it in the industry or in shops or commercial establishments, shall make payment of wages to their workers, at their workplace, on the due date and without any deduction for the period their establishments are under closure during the lockdown.It was also said that wherever workers, including the migrants, are living in rented accommodation, landlords shall not demand payment of rent for a period of one month. If a landlord forces labourers or students to vacate premises, the state police have been told to make him liable under the Disaster Management Act.In a fresh order issued by the Union home secretary under Section 10(2)(l) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, states and UTs were told to ensure proper screening of migrants on the move for Covid-19 and keep them in government quarantine facilities for a minimum 14 days as per standard health protocol.

Among themselves, they spoke about the lockdown lasting three months — echoing WhatsApp messages doing the rounds — and their savings would run out much before that.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said around 90,000 people were sent in 850 roadways buses and scores of private ones on Sunday, after which the bus service was stopped. The borders have been sealed again. From Ghaziabad alone, 2,000 buses had been run since Friday night to evacuate people. Of these, 650 buses were provided by Haryana.At Anand Vihar ISBT, which had on Saturday thrown up shocking visuals of thousands crowding round the bus station for a ride home, around 1,000 people was all that remained on Sunday of the sea of humanity. The Kaushambi bus depot, in UP territory on the other side of the road, was disinfected and closed.In an eight-hour-long overnight operation, the Delhi government transported 30,000 people, who had reached the area despite fervent appeals and assurances from chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to stay back, were transported to Lal Kuan in Ghaziabad, from where the UP bus service picked them up. Senior Delhi and UP government officials remained stationed in the area.Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the government decided to deploy buses after it realised people were not willing to turn back despite the appeals.“It was important to provide transport to the swelling crowd, considering the stampede-like situation. The exercise started around 9pm (Saturday) and continued till 5am on Sunday,” state transport officer Kailash Gahlot told TOI. “We pressed about 600 buses into services and covered 8-9 locations, including Hapur, Sikandrabad, Modi Nagar, Muradnagar, Ghaziabad and Bulandshahr. Maximum trips were made to Lal Kuan in Ghaziabad,” Gahlot said.The UP bus service from Lal Kuan started around 8am. Officials said the buses took people to Bareilly, Jhansi, Hamirpur, Mirzapur, Hardoi, Lakhimpur and Aligarh, among other UP cities. Some also headed further into Madhya Pradesh and Bihar Delhi Police, civil defence volunteers and others arranged for food, especially for women, the elderly and children. Gahlot said the operation took place in coordination with Delhi Police and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC).“Despite lockdown, many people managed to reach Anand Vihar and now strict orders have been issued that only those with curfew passes would be allowed to board DTC and cluster buses. There has been a complete clampdown in the city and strict action will be taken against anyone found loitering on streets,” said a Delhi government official. “Nearly 40% of workers had come via national highways from Haryana and Rajasthan. They have been sent to our night centres so that no one faces any difficulty,” the official added.Those who tried to reach Anand Vihar ISBT on Sunday were relocated to various industrial areas from which they travelled by Delhi Police. “They were provided food packets. We dropped people from Haryana at night shelters,” a police officer said.Starting Saturday night, police made announcements asking people to contact them for help. Police officers simultaneously also alerted neighbouring districts about the movement of workers.“Over 50 DTC buses took rounds and transported the workers from near Anand Vihar to their respective destinations. In order to ensure social distancing, we did not let people crowd the buses and no one was allowed to stand in the bus.” said a senior police official.In a wireless message to the ranks, Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava said, “Since the lockdown is underway, strict legal action would be taken against people who join a gathering or decide to march. If any labourer is venturing out, provide them food, speak to them and drop them back to their location in the bus. Let them know that no buses are plying towards Uttar Pradesh and in view of the pandemic all must stay put wherever they are.”During picket checking at Dhaula Kuan flyover, three buses found carrying passengers in violation of lockdown were seized by Delhi Police and their drivers were arrested. The owners of the buses were also later arreste",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74880295,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-478499,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-borders-cleared-but-screening-poses-challenge/articleshow/74880292.cms
21,['30/03/2020'],"Coronavirus in India: Protective gear delivery only after 25 days, govt hospitals told","PTI photo.

NEW DELHI: Government hospitals seeking personal protective equipment (PPE) are being told that it will take a minimum of 25-30 working days for them to be delivered. The Covid-19 emergency procurement cell of HLL Lifecare, the public sector unit acting as the central procurement agency for the government, has told them this is due to short supply of raw materials required to manufacture PPE and the prevailing transportation situation in the lockdown.

For government health facilities grappling with acute shortage of PPE, this cannot be good news. In many places doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are worried and beginning to protest as the shortage is forcing them to work without protective gear.

According to HLL sources, components for PPE kits are made by different manufacturers and supplied erratically as most makers are in the small and medium sector. With just a few designated collection centres where components are assembled into kits, there is further delay in getting them from these centres to where they are needed, said the sources.

Coronavirus lockdown: Latest updates

The sources said over 80,000 PPE kits have been dispatched and the textile ministry claims that 10 lakh masks have been supplied till now. TOI had reported how the textile ministry has roped in 11 Indian firms to produce PPE suits and two for producing masks, including N95 masks, spread across Gujarat, Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu , surrounding areas of Delhi including Gurgaon and Ghaziabad , as well as in Bangalore and Kolkata. Efforts are on to add more manufacturers in the coming days. Nodal officials from the government have been posted at factories to oversee production and to smooth transport problems. However, according to textile ministry officials, firms have been producing 5,000 protective suits in two days. They hope to push it up to 8,000 per day by March 30.

On March 23, the indent was for 10 lakh protective suits. Even at the optimistic estimate of producing 8,000 PPE suits per day, it would take four months to produce 10 lakh of them.

Perhaps more worrying is the question of whether even the 10 lakh PPE suits will be sufficient.

There are over 250 medical college hospitals across India. At the moment, only a few are being used for Covid patients. If the crisis reaches a stage where the others also need to be pressed in service, even if just 50 medical personnel in each hospitals were to require full PPE suits, it would work out to 12,500 suits per day. People working in two shifts would mean double that number or 25,000 PPE kits per day or 1.75 lakh per week. There are hundreds of government hospitals not attached to medical colleges whose staff too will require not just PPE but lakhs of masks.

22,['30/03/2020'],Frontline medics fume over protective gear,"The Covid-19 pandemic has brought to the fore that all is not well with the country’s medical staff. A dozen doctors in five states have contacted the highly contagious virus — mainly due to lack of masks, gloves and personal protection equipment (PPE) — and there are many resident doctors and interns who feel they, as the frontline medical soldiers who handle patients every hour, are “sitting ducks”.In Kolkata, young doctors are upset because they have to run fever clinics wearing a plastic raincoat for protection. “We are raring to go and realise that there is a scarcity of PPEs. But if even one of us is infected, it will be a blow to the morale of the healthcare fraternity,” said a doctor who is part of the Covid-19 team at the Medical College Hospital in Kolkata. (Experts say plastic raincoats offer protection against viruses, but should be customised and discarded every 4-5 hours).“Do you send soldiers on the warfront without guns? Then why are you sending doctors to fight this war without proper kits,” said Dr Ravi Ranjan Kumar Raman of Nalanda Medical College and Hospital in Patna.“My parents and sister cry every day when I leave for work. They ask me not to go to the hospital but I can’t skip my responsibilities. Somewhere in my heart, I know that even if I die, it won’t affect the system,” said Dr Raman.Junior doctors at Nalanda believe they are sent to the front line “while senior and experienced doctors are on the back foot”.In Chennai’s private hospitals, resident doctors are “absconding” from work saying their parents don’t want them to report for duty.The central health ministry and state governments had a two-month notice about Covid-19 in the form of the goings-on in China’s Wuhan province where over 3,000 died in three months. Yet, the task of gathering PPEs, special N95 masks and gloves has been sluggish in all states. A central health ministry drew up a wish-list just 10 days ago, stating the country needs 7.25 lakh body overalls, 60 lakh N95 masks and one crore three-ply facemasks.The fear of contracting the virus is so high that NMCH Junior Doctors’ Association wrote to the Bihar principal secretary (health) on March 25, asking senior doctors from other government medical colleges and private hospitals be put on duty while junior doctors be kept as “reserved manpower”. Bihar has 11 COVID-19 patients at present.They alleged their principal had quarantined himself in his home and has ignored their demands. “All Covid-19 positive people are in NMCH, still we do not have hazmat suit and mask. Instead, we have been given normal gown worn in operation theatre. Our principal has also stopped coming now for his safety and has left us to die,” said another junior doctor.In Mumbai, the former president of Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors Kalyani Dongre wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray about resident doctors forced to wear single-use three-ply mask for three to four days. “If a doctor doesn’t have protection, how can she or he protect others?” asked a Mumbai doctor.The PPE shortage is compounded by the shortage of manpower, again resulting in student doctors being forced to put in extra hours. Holidays have been cancelled for all doctors, including residents who are required to work 24-hour shifts once or twice a week.In Tamil Nadu, the directorate of medical education has asked deans of medical colleges to extend the one-year internship of MBBS students by another month so that they can help out in tackling the Covid-19 crisis.In states such as Orissa where medical manpower is a serious problem, the government is planning to deploy MBBS students of 7th, 8th and 9th semesters (fourth year and fifth year) on Covid-19 duty. There are 1,500 such students in the state.Some students are apprehensive. “My seniors said there are no masks or PPE available for doctors. Pushing us to the forefront in such a situation could create problems for us,” said an MBBS student of a government-run medical college.In a private medical college, which has partnered with the state government to open a separate 500-bed Covid-19 hospital, two doctors have threatened to resign after the management asked them to work in the corona-care facility.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74880349,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-149637,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/no-protective-gear-fume-frontline-medics/articleshow/74880348.cms
23,['30/03/2020'],PSU charges govt hospitals high margins on PPE,"HLL Lifecare, the public sector company that acts as the government’s central procurement agency for personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers is charging mark-ups of up to 50% on components of the protective gear it is providing to government hospitals. With HLL having floated tenders for 10 lakh coveralls and 40 lakh N95 masks recently, that would amount to almost Rs 22 crore as mark-up on coveralls alone and Rs 8 crore on N-95 masks.

Sources in HLL said that the mark-up was to account for transportation costs, which was high especially in the period of lockdown when it was difficult to find truckers willing to transport the kits. HLL’s letters to institutions states that the rate includes cost of road transport of the items.

In some cases, HLL might also need to send kit by airfreight, which would cost more, said HLL sources. However, HLL letters to institutions state that if airfreight was required that would be “charged extra” to the institution placing the order.

HLL has also told institutions that they cannot order most components of the PPE kits separately, N95 masks being an exception. Thus institutions could get stand-alone consignments of N95 masks, which have the highest mark-up of 50%.

The letters also warns that since “there is acute shortage of the items in the market”, the price is highly volatile. If the purchase price changes, accordingly the final price will change, it added.

Many PPE kit component manufacturers, who are bearing the cost of transporting the finished items of PPE kits to collection centres identified by HLL, expressed surprise at the high mark-ups by HLL. Their contracts state that the price they are being paid by HLL includes transportation cost to collection centres. This has raised questions about how a public sector company can levy such high mark-ups on supplying to government institutions during a national health crisis. HLL has been under a cloud over recent controversies about lack of transparency in their procurement process.

""It is indefensible that the public sector company is making a high profit on supplying government health institutions during a national health emergency,"" said Malini Aisola of All India Drug Action Network ( AIDAN ).

Despite the high mark-ups, doctors in hospitals struggling to get PPE said that HLL prices are possible only because it is buying in such huge volumes, as the price of an N95 mask has shot up to more than Rs 200 in the open market and even at these prices it was difficult to find any.

One Chandan Singh from Aman Nagar in Ludhiana told TOI over phone that eight from Bihar were stuck in their rented accommodation there. “After the lockdown, we are managing with one time meal to save our limited ration. Police gave us food at 11pm on Saturday after we informed them but we received nothing today. We also went to a langar nearby, but food exhausted quickly and we were unable to eat,” Singh from West Champaran said. He said around 100 youths from the district were facing the same situation and wanted to go back home.

“Several of them have left for Bihar on bicycles. We are also planning the same,” he added.

Omprakash Kumar from Buxar said on phone from Indira Nagar in Jodhpur that police were announcing about bus services being provided to them to reach Uttar Pradesh border. “They said we would be dropped at Bharatpur. We are worried that how to reach Bihar from there. We are now only left with rice, don’t know how we will manage in days to come,” he added.

Kundan Kumar from Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad said he along with 70 others boarded a truck to reach Aurangabad in Bihar. “Each of us paid Rs1,000 to the truck driver. We are near Prayagraj. The truck would drop us on Bihar border,” he said, adding that community food was being provided to them at Vijay Nagar but supply was irregular and the system was to pick up food and eat.

Meanwhile, CPI-ML state secretary Kunal, in a press statement, said many of the daily wagers from Bihar were facing hunger.

Meanwhile, additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani said the government was thinking of fixing a deadline for people to reach Bihar from other states.

One group of 20 people, including women and children hailing from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh, will have to cover more than 350 km on foot. The group began their walk on Sunday morning after the contractor who had brought them to Aurangabad said he will not be able to feed or pay them during the lockdown.

Locals and some policemen on duty were seen handing out food packets to the families.

Some workers, who had reached Abdimandi after walking about 30km, were provided assistance by Daultabad-based journalist Kishore Patil, who along with the village’s deputy sarpanch Ismail Pathan, made provisions for food packets and water. Police personnel from Waluj police station, led by inspector Sandeep Gurme, also helped arrange food packets for the group migrant workers. They were seen helping stranded truck drivers. Similar scenes were seen across MIDC Waluj and Chikalthana police station limits.

Many other groups of workers were seen passing through Aurangabad and making their way towards highway stretches in Nagpur, Solapur and Beed to get out of Maharashtra.

Senior authorities said the groups are mostly of daily wagers who have been left without any pay during the lockdown.

The Centre has urged state governments to ensure housing or temporary shelters for those trying to get home. The states have also been told to quarantine these workers for a minimum of 14 days.

There was also an advisory ordering employers not to cut or stop wages of these workers during the lockdown. But at many places, contractors have not paid the workers.

28,['30/03/2020'],Social media usage jumps 87% as people spend over 4 hours daily,"Chennai: The first week of lockdown saw Indians spend more than 280 minutes a day on social media, a spike of 87% over the previous week, as people remained indoors. Streaming platforms and televisions also saw a rise in viewership, while out-of-home (OOH) media and radio were neglected, according to a survey.

Social media usage, on average, before the lockdown was nearly 150 minutes per day. In the first week of lockdown, that figure jumped to 280 minutes per day, with 75% people spending more time on apps like WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook compared to the week before. The survey respondents said they accessed social media often to consume news, and to communicate amid the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

According to the Hammerkopf Consumer Snapshot Survey conducted on March 28 across 1,300 people in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai. Over-the-top (OTT) media consumption too saw a spike, with 71% people watching more than a week ago. The prime time for streaming platforms this week began at 7pm, unlike a week before, when it was between 10pm and 12am. Meanwhile, 76% of those surveyed said they watched TV in the morning between 8am and 9am.

The study was aimed at capturing behavioural change in digital media consumption, as India stayed indoors.

“Undoubtedly, when we look back at the coronavirus pandemic, we will clearly see two distinct time periods: An India before the virus, and a new one in the post-virus era. The digital habits are undergoing a dramatic change, with a fresh slew of consumer apps, benefiting from strong network effects, in communication, entertainment, food and fitness, and enabling Indians like never before,” said Namagiri Anand, managing partner, Hammerkopf, a firm that is engaged in analysing emerging technology shifts.

“During this unprecedented situation and lockdown across various parts of the country, we want to be sure that we don’t devoid our audiences of their daily dose of entertainmen,” Tarun Katial, CEO, Zee5 India, said the platform has witnessed an increase in over 80% in subscription and over 50% in watch time in the last five days.

Meanwhile, there was also a rise in the number of people downloading cooking guides (89%) as compared to health and fitness apps (88%), and edtech apps (88%).

“Given the changing consumer pivot to new digital media, we are advising our clients to leverage the new opportunities. In the new homebound economy, brands are in a position to gain consumer mindshare and confidence, by being infotaining and informative, and, by being creative and connecting. Brands that are proactive and ahead of the curve will survive in the times ahead,” added Namagiri.

Prior to the lockdown, the peak time for smartphone usage was during work (41%), and at night (31%), with moderate usage in morning and early evening. With work-from-home being implemented by several companies, last week, smartphone usage during work surged to 62%, with moderate rise in the rest of the day.

Internet browsing too saw of 72% spike, compared to a week ago, with people turning to it for information and news amid the Covid-19 outbreak.

With the lockdown in place, impacting commute, related media consumption lost significantly. While radio and music streaming consumption saw a significant decline this week with 89% of those surveyed said they listened to it less often, compared to a week ago, OOH media lost more eyeballs this week, with 91% of consumers seeing less billboards compared to a week ago.

While the surprise showers were a welcome respite with the weather turning pleasant, it once again created tension among citizens with the chances of spread of viral infections being more in this weather, as per doctors.

Sunday’s rains were accompanied by gusty winds at many places in Vidarbha. According to the officials of Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Nagpur, the region is expected to witness more rains in the coming two days.

“A trough extending at 0.9 km above sea level from north Kerala to south Chhattisgarh across Marathwada, Vidarbha and Karnataka caused the rainfall,” officials said.

They added that some parts of the region might experience light rainfall on Monday and Tuesday.

Wani in Yavatmal was the wettest in the region with 15.3mm rain. Other parts of the region like Akola, Chandrapur and Washim too received rainfall.

Despite rains, the mercury was on the higher side. Nagpur recorded a maximum temperature of 37.6 degree Celsius on Sunday. Akola was the hottest at 38.8 degree Celsius.

Stating that virus can survive for longer duration in humid weather, doctors have advised people to stay indoors.

The suspected cases are being checked for fever. Doctors said in case they fit the criteria, the patients are moved to the isolation wards for further investigation.Earlier, the suspected cases were directly taken to the isolation ward where positve patients too were admitted. This led to three patients fleeing the wards even while their test results were awaited.GMCH has also started taking measures to free up beds occupied by recovered patients. As of Wednesday, GMCH had 70 additional beds for corona positive cases. Doctors said other patients who have recovered are being asked to take discharge.Earlier, such patients would seek additional hospital stay. Mayo and GMCH beds are occupied by patients admitted by police or social workers. When they recover, they continue to stay back as most are destitute or can’t recall their names and addresses.

31,['30/03/2020'],When education goes virtual,"Ahmedabad: No student is allowed to miss Prof Nigam Dave’s lectures at SLS, PDPU – even when it happens online.

“With advanced tools embedded on platforms such as Zoom online classes, Canvas or Google classroom, we can capture screenshots or gather data on students’ engagements during the virtual classrooms,” said Prof Dave, director of SLS, PDPU. “Discussion forums and assignments have also gone online completely.”

The Covid-19 global pandemic has changed the way several sectors work, perhaps forever, and one of the most obvious fields is education. More and more institutes have switched to online mode during the national lockdown. In the premier educational institutes in Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar, virtual is the new normal for both lectures and evaluation.

Chirayu Bhatt, deputy provost (academics) at Cept University, said that several online platforms are utilized to connect faculties and students for studios. “All sessions are being conducted according to scheduled time slots in the regular semester. Students also interact with faculties in real time, completing the online class experience,” he said. “One-on-one video conferencing is also taking place to provide feedback on student projects.”

At MICA, the annual curriculum presentation to the second-year students of PGP course was made online where the faculty members presented their proposed elective courses and held a discussion. “Respective instructors have volunteered to design online examinations for their courses and the examinations are in progress. Assignments, which are part of planned evaluations, are to be submitted online,” said a MICA official.

Soman Nair, registrar of DA-IICT, Gandhinagar, said that there are several ongoing research projects where students and faculty members collaborate. “Our PG curriculum relies heavily on research work. In this lockdown period, the students and faculty members are collaborating online to work on research papers and simulations where labs are not required. Online meetings are conducted for the same,” he said.

The swab samples of the trio have tested negative to the virus in the first test conducted during treatment. However, doctors at ID Hospital, where the three are admitted, said their samples will go through another round of assessment before they are declared free of the virus. They will continue to be treated at the hospital till they test negative in the second confirmatory test.“Two consecutive reports have to confirm that the patient is negative to the virus. The first test can show a sample negative to Covid-19 due to intermittent shedding of the virus. In that case, the consecutive test might show positive. That is why a second test is necessary,” said a doctor.The first patient to test negative was the Oxford-returned 18-year-old boy who tested positive on March 18. The other two were a 22-year-old youth from Ballygunge and a 23-year-old woman from Habra. The two returned from London and Scotland, respectively, and had tested positive to Covid-19 on March 20 and 21.“A hard-working and dedicated medical team is taking care of the Covid-19 patients in our hospital. Though the three have to undergo another round of tests, we are hopeful of their complete recovery. Once the second test confirms they are negative to the virus, we will be ready to send them home, following protocol,” said Anima Haldar , principal of Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital.The trio had to be given only supportive medicine to treat their symptom. “The good thing about these three patients is that they are young and none showed any aggressive symptom during treatment,” said another doctor.Though none of the positive patients are critical, doctors are concerned with the 76-year-old woman from Egra who tested positive on Saturday and was subsequently admitted. She had attended a wedding with a 56-year-old woman and a 66-year-old man, who also tested positive to Covid-19. The 66-year-old was admitted to Peerless Hospital and is responding to the treatment of Covid-19-induced pneumonia. His urine output had been low on Saturday night, indicating a kidney problem. But there has been improvement with medication. Doctors, however, said his condition was still critical.“There is no new infection in the lungs and no increase in demand for oxygen. The patient is also maintaining blood pressure and his urine output is improving.

What are your plans given the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 outbreak and the lockdown?

Will officers of the merging banks continue to have the same authority as before in all matters?

What about the head office functions of the treasury?

What is your continuity plan if the situation worsens?

Will there be any transfers?

MUMBAI: From April 1, Mangalore-based Corporation Bank and Hyderabad-headquartered Andhra Bank will merge into Union Bank. The merger , which was announced and planned last year, comes into effect amid the Covid-19 lockdown. In an interview with TOI, Union Bank MD & CEO Rajkiran Rai explains how the focus is on zero disruption.Customers will see the same branch and the same staff. The systems and processes will be the same. In the case of Union Bank, since all account numbers are unique, all customers will retain their account number after the merger. Internet banking portals and mobile banking apps will continue to operate separately. Deposit products may change slightly, but it will not make any difference to staff in terms of data input. Every branch has been linked to a ‘buddy branch’ of Union Bank for any assistance. A microsite has also been developed for employees with the facility to gets queries addressed.It is difficult to answer this when there is no good view of the future and a lot of things are not in control. Right now, the focus is on how to protect staff and keep branch operations going. As far as the amalgamation is concerned, the focus is on zero disturbance for customers and keeping staff comfortable so that operations continue. For the future, we do have a business plan, but there will not be any strategy meeting now. The biggest variable is the Covid virus. How long will the lockdown continue? How long will it take for a business to come back? We need to assess the damage that has taken place and look at different sectors, what kind of restructuring is required, what is the funding requirement. Even the RBI policy focus has been on preventing default and maintain the status quo for three months. On the back-end, there is work going on for integration, so that when things normalise, we can go ahead with amalgamation.As far as sanctions are concerned, we have maintained status quo by retaining the reporting authority structure. Up to the level of the GM, there will be no change. If approval beyond the GM is required, each GM’s reporting is now mapped to one of the four EDs in Union Bank. As far as rules regarding branch operations are concerned, each state has a different system and the state-level bankers’ committee takes a call on operations and timing. Over 90% of branches are operating, except in some pockets of Rajasthan and Punjab. There, too, we are in discussions with authorities to restart.We have integrated the treasuries and all treasury operations will be undertaken from Union Bank of India. Two other locations we have kept as backup as part of our business continuity plan if there is a complete shutdown for any reason.We had a couple of cases where the branch was shut by authorities and staff quarantined. We are drawing up district-level lists of healthcare and testing facilities that will be available to branch staff. If the situation continues and people are unable to travel, we will allow them to report to the nearest branch.We will not be doing any transfers now. There will be some transfers at a senior level in the future. Where employees who have been transferred out of their home state have completed their term, we are allowing the transfer orders to be issued with a condition that they would not be relieved for a month, which could get extended to two.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74884264,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-335126,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/union-bank-md-focus-is-on-zero-disturbance/articleshow/74879176.cms

Every year on the 7th night of Chaitra Navratra, ‘nagar vadhus’ of the city used to gather at Manikarnika Ghat and dance till midnight amid burning pyres after offering prayers to Mahashmashan Nath, the Lord of cremation ground.

But this year, the 7th night of Navratra on March 31, will miss the celebration due to the nation-wide lockdown to check the spread of coronavirus. The unique celebration has been an attraction for local residents as well as foreigners.

“As the entire country is in lockdown to break the chain of Covid-19, this celebration has been cancelled,” said temple manager Gulshan Kapoor.

However, the three-day ‘Shringar Mahotsava’ of Baba Mahashmashan Nath symbolically started on the 5th day of Chaitra Navratra on Sunday with vedic rituals and recital of Sunderkand of Ramcharitmanas. It would be followed by a special puja on Monday praying for the end of corona virus and a tantric puja on Tuesday.

“Since the country is under lockdown, all the programmes have been cancelled. Only temple priest Pt Lallu Maharaj and members of temple management will perform the rituals to maintain the tradition,” said Kapoor.

According to him, the tradition has been continuing for about five centuries after the Mahashamshan Nath temple at Manikarnika Ghat was renovated by Raja Sawai Man Singh of Amber, who had also built Man Mandir Ghat in 1585 near Dashshwamedh Ghat.

It is a common tradition to hold music programme on the inaugural day or special occasions. As the nagar vadhus offered their services on the inauguration of the temple, the tradition has been followed since then.

From Monday onwards, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) will start shifting migrant labourers to the premises where almost 300 people can be accommodated.

Mohabbat Singh Tuli, the school’s owner, said, “On Sunday, the cops came and inspected the place and tomorrow, NMC officials will send the first batch of migrant labourers. My son Vikram and I wanted to help those who are struggling in the current situation. All arrangements are being made so that these people do not suffer during this long lockdown.”

It all started a few days ago when Tuli was near his resort at Deolapar. “On the highway I saw so many workers walking or cycling. They said that they can’t stay in Nagpur hence were heading back to their villages in Madhya Pradesh. Imagine walking for hours, even days, with children in tow.”

Tuli immediately rushed back to his resort where they cooked food and came back on the highway. “We started a langar at the bus shelter on the highway. We not only fed people, but also told them to take parcels. After that I decided that my resorts, school and colleges will now be offered to the government as shelter homes. NMC has now decided to make use of the school building and we are glad to be of help,” said Tuli.

Urvashi Yashroy, director of Tuli Group of Educational Institutes, said, “We had initially planned accommodation only for women from the migrant community, but the authorities gave us feedback that only families will come. So we are going by what NMC is saying and by Monday, or at the most by Tuesday, we will be fully operational.”

37,['30/03/2020'],"Zoho accuses Freshworks of stealing, misusing information","Chennai: In an ugly battle between Zoho and Freshworks, the poster boys of SaaS in Chennai, Zoho has filed a lawsuit against Freshworks accusing the latter of attempting to poach customers, steal and misuse confidential information.

The lawsuit filed at the US district court, Northern district of California says that Freshworks has breached 2 acts - including Defence of Trade Secrets Act and California Uniform Trade Secrets Act. “Freshworks is contacting Zoho’s Partners and asking them to convert to Freshworks’ Partner programs,” the suit said.

Founded by two former Zoho employees, Girish Mathrubootham (formerly a VP of product management at Zoho) and Shan Krishnasamy (formerly a Zoho Technical Architect working under Mathrubootham), Freshworks secured initial funding through use of Zoho’s non-public financial information and has since engaged in a systematic practice of poaching Zoho’s employees, using Zoho’s confidential customer and competitive marketing information, planning press releases to coincide with Zoho’s undisclosed product launch dates, and pressuring Zoho’s business partners to divulge Zoho confidential customer information, Zoho contended in the lawsuit whose copy was accessed by TOI. Among other allegations, Zoho said that after leaving to start Freshworks, Mathrubootham improperly included Zoho confidential revenue figures in early Freshworks investor pitch materials to secure initial investments, leveraging his work at Zoho and suggesting his new start-up would perform like Zoho. “As recently as February 24, Freshworks has been systematically contacting Zoho’s customers using Zoho confidential information. In some of these instances, Freshworks contacted Zoho’s customers at email addresses the customers created solely for registration with Zoho’s cloud-based offerings. The only way Freshworks would have knowledge of the email addresses it used to contact Zoho’s customers is through unauthorized direct access of Zoho’s confidential CRM database,” a statement from Zoho said in the lawsuit.

In a statement to TOI, Zoho said that it had compelling evidence that Freshworks has stolen customer data from Zoho and attempted to contact its customers. “We are investigating the extent of the data theft. In order to protect customer data, we were compelled to immediately sue Freshworks to stop their illegal and immoral behaviour” the statement said.

Freshworks added that they are taking the allegations seriously and are planning to defend themselves.

The details of those who came to the state from abroad between March 10 and March 18 will be verified.

Earlier, samples of only symptomatic people were being sent for test. State health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said now samples of those who came to the state on or after March 18 will be tested. “We will first start with those who came to the state on or after March 21,” he added.

Sources in the health department said the move would help trace the Covid-19 suspect.

Bihar on Sunday not only reported four fresh cases, but also witnessed maximum number of passengers enrolling for observation in a day. According to state health department, 469 people were put under observation on Sunday, taking total number of such people to 2,376.

PATNA: The prisons department is in a dilemma over how to release undertrial jail inmates on parole amid complete lockdown.

The Supreme Court had issued orders that state governments should consider releasing undertrials, whose offences attract seven years or less imprisonment. The order was issued to decongest the jails in the wake of Covid-19, but a nationwide lockdown was enforced thereafter.

Prisons sources said around 9,000 undertrials in state jails come under the category to get relief in form of parole in the present situation. Home department collected a data from all prisons on Wednesday and Thursday.

Sources said a high-level meeting was held between additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani and IG (prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra on Saturday on the issue of releasing prisoners on parole, but no concrete decision was taken immediately due to several practical problems, which might further aggravate the situation.

A senior IAS officer of home department said now the state government will take a call as how to release prisoners as a precautionary measure. “There are several practical problems in releasing undertrial inmates. One is that how they will reach home as there is no transport facility available. Several times prisoners are shifted from one jail to another in different districts. Amid such a scenario, how will one be able to reach home in another district,” he said.

The officer said the matter has further complicated as the state government has decided to quarantine migrant workers coming home from different districts in special camps on state borders. “Then how prisoners can be allowed to go home. Separate yardsticks could not be used,” he said.

Meanwhile, a central jail superintendent, preferring anonymity, said several undertrials are senior citizens and it would be risky if they have to walk for several kilometres to reach home after getting released from jail.

At present, there are eight central and 32 district jails besides 17 subjails and one open jail in Bihar with total sanctioned capacity of around 43,000 inmates against which around 40,000 are in prisons. However, some of the jails are overcrowded.

44,['30/03/2020'],E-tail to take $1 billion hit in lockdown,"More on

BENGALURU: The 21-day lockdown will lead to a loss of at least $1 billion in gross sales as India’s largest online retail platforms like Amazon and Flipkart stop selling non-essentials till at least the middle of next month, based on current government directives. What’s of further concern is that the online retail players are expected to grow only by 5% this year, in the most optimistic scenario, compared to about 26% growth in the previous year to reach $23-24 billion in gross sales. Overall e-commerce sales, including movie tickets and other platforms, was $32 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Forrester’s data exclusively shared with TOI.While online grocery is seeing a spike in orders, it constitutes only about 10% of overall sales for e-tailers. Last year, e-grocery sales stood at about $2 billion. Online platforms see $50-60 million in daily sales around this time of the year, which for several players is down to zero. Smartphones, large appliances, electronics and fashion are the top drivers of gross sales for e-tailers, contributing 60-70% of the total. To be sure, these data points are based on current circumstances and may evolve further, for better or worse, based on how India manages to deal with the pandemic.“If they (online retailers) can grow by 5% this year, they should feel lucky. Even after the lockdown ends, consumer spending will be hit. Even with EMI waivers, people will push many of their spendings to next year,” said Satish Meena, senior forecast analyst at Forrester. According to Meena, retail sales in China were down 21% in the last two months and e-commerce sales grew by only 3%, but grocery is a big part of online sales in the country, unlike India.Investors tracking the space feel the April-June quarter could be a washout for the sector. Some e-commerce executives said that electronics and other items would also need to be allowed for deliveries if the lockdown lasts longer than April 14 as the groceries segment by itself is not sustainable in terms of margins. Some sector-focused e-tailers like fashion website Myntra and baby care products seller FirstCry have stopped taking new orders. Others such as beauty products seller Purplle and furniture seller Pepperfry are taking fresh orders but offering delivery only after April 15.Even before the outbreak of the coronavirus , overall consumer spending was muted owing to broader economic challenges. But the virus spreading at this pace brought online commerce to a screeching halt. Last year, 140 million Indians shopped online at least once, according to Forrester. This might not grow significantly in 2020 even though online grocery and medicine delivery platforms are seeing new customers sign up.“During a meeting for 2020 projections at the end of 2019, Amazon India leadership team was told about economic and policy challenges in India, which might be a hindrance to growth. The mandate was to grow despite those issues. But now, with Covid-19, it looks virtually impossible,” an Amazon executive recently told TOI when the number of confirmed cases started to rise in India. Flipkart and Amazon India spokespersons declined to comment.Investors said that the next few months will be tough for the business and there will be a slowdown in discretionary spends even after a potential recovery. But the development could increase penetration of online shopping, like in grocery, which has largely remained offline till now. “There will be some permanent behavioural change in consumers due to coronavirus and they will come back after getting used to purchasing online, especially for must-have categories,” said T C M Sundaram, MD at venture capital firm Chiratae Ventures.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74881371,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-487606,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/e-tail-to-take-1bn-hit-in-lockdown/articleshow/74879044.cms
45,['30/03/2020'],Making sure their blood remains pure,"Nagpur: Lockdown is throwing many challenges for those who need to visit hospitals regularly for blood transfusion or kidney dialysis. While travelling for medical purpose is not banned, many patients find it difficult to get any means of public transport for this. Kidney patients in particular, who are already at high risk for covid-19 due to their low immunity, find it risky to take an autorickshaw or cab. Amid all this, a young entrepreneur has emerged as a hero for hundreds of such patients who need kidney dialysis regularly.

Prashant Nair has already established a brand MyCapello, a chain of luxury salons in Nagpur. Recently, he started a new venture Laundryfy which provides free pick-up and drop service for your laundry. Nair had to discontinue this service during lockdown. But, he decided to dedicate his resources to a constructive work.

“I came to know from a friend based in Mumbai that kidney patients need to visit the urology center for regular dialysis. Public transport is not available at hand, and not every patient has his/her own vehicle. So, we decided to drive in our vehicles for such people,” Nair said.

Laundryfy has Maruti Vans with drivers and a manager who handles their movement. This entire set-up used to deal with house-to-house collection and delivery of laundry. Now, they are free. So, Nair converted this vehicle into a transport service for kidney patients.

“We consulted with senior nephrologists in the city and fully sanitized our car. Drivers were trained to follow safety practices. I also got permission to commute kidney patients in this van from Amabazari police,” said Nair. After completing all legal formalities, Nair launched this free service on March 27. He received 10 phone calls on March 28 and he completed all requests.

“We are offering free pick-up and drop facility to people in need of dialysis. The facility will be provided from 10am to 8pm till April 14, the last day of lockdown. All you have to do is call our associate Girish on mobile number 9607979797 and the van will reach your doorsteps to help you,” Nair said.

This van has police permissions for commuting people. It’s safe for kidney patients as the vehicle is regularly sanitized. “Our drivers are trained to deliver and pick-up at least 30 orders daily. I think we can provide service to least 20 patients a day,” he said. Nagpur has around 600 patients who need regular dialysis.

Nephrologist Dr Dhananjay Ookalkar, who welcomed the first patient through this free service on March 28, said that it’s a commendable job. “We have many patients who come from poor families. They used to come by autorickshaws or buses. But, it’s not safe for them amidst coronavirus threat. Such sanitized vans will reduce their risk,” he said.

Moreover, the service is free. So, poor patients will benefit a lot,” he said.

46,['30/03/2020'],"Despite ban, stream of migrants continues to flow into MP","CORONA VIRUS AND OLD MAN INDORA SQUARE

Khawasa (Madhya Pradesh): It was raining and the scene at Madhya Pradesh-Maharashtra border here reminded of footages from Partition time or some international refugee crisis. A day after Maharashtra government issued directions to bar the movement of migrant labourers from the state while promising them food and shelter, the exodus continued. The migrating groups had infants, children and even elderly with them.

Migrant workers poured into MP on foot, bicycles, and even stuffed in coal dumpers and goods containers. TOI travelled 80 kms to Khawasa, the entry point to Madhya Pradesh on Seoni/Jabalpur road on Sunday.

The order on restricting movement was issued from Maharashtra side on Saturday. MP side had no communication about it. Finally at 5pm, after 5,000 had already crossed, Khawasa checkpoint got an order to stop. The entry was stopped right then. A couple of bikers who were stopped begged with folded hands to be allowed to go. The officials relented as six more containers and trailers passed in next one hour. Each one had at least 60 persons.

Khawasa is one of the two major entry points to Madhya Pradesh from Maharashtra. The highest traffic was from here.

From Nagpur to Khawasa, TOI could spot at 1500-2000 migrants. These included people stuffed in two coal dumpers three mini trucks, one container and scores on foot at every kilometre. They included casual labourers, those working on Samruddhi Expressway or ones with WCL.

Most were going to Balaghat, Seoni and Jabalpur in MP but a sizeable number was heading further to Uttar Pradesh too. Despite ban from the Maharashtra side, the flow continued unrestricted. Although TOI saw the Maharashtra police stopping a family coming from Madhya Pradesh as they had home quarantine stamp on their hands. There was no bar on Madhya Pradesh bound traffic.

The officials at Khawasa checkpoint accepted the situation was out of control. Social distancing norms were forgotten by both the workers and officials. An official of Madhya Pradesh state public service said the exodus began from March 21 and so far 30,000 had crossed over from Khawasa checkpoint alone.

MP officials had parked buses to take them further inside. Officials said they had run short of buses and even private containers and trucks passing from the highway were asked to accommodate passengers. TOI saw workers from a bus being made to alight and as ked to get inside a container. It was bound for Delhi, which gave hope to those heading towards UP. After some truckers dropped the workers mid way, cops began accompanying each vehicle.

At the checkpoint each one was scanned for temperature and other symptoms but none was found with any symptom. From Khawasa it was another 100 kms to the districts like Balaghat and Seoni. From there vehicles of respective districts take over. There is a strict vigil and even the villagers are not allowing migrants back without a stamp. The stamping is done at the villages, said an official at the checkpoint.

At Kamptee, TOI saw workers being stuffed in a coal dumper through a narrow opening in the rear. “We are providing free service,” said Chandan Singh who helped people board, along with his friends.

It was 2:30pm when Singh and his friends had dispatched five dumpers and five mini trucks as two more took off. A dumper had 70 persons and a truck carried 35. The dumpers were deployed in WCL. A few kms ahead, Gopi and 5-6 others managed to come over 40 kms on their bicycles as they waited to get in a truck or dumper after that.

Rang Bahadur and 10 other working for Afcons, a company engaged in construction of Samruddhi Expressway, walked with shoes in their hand. They had started from Pulgaon and covered nearly 200km when TOI caught up with them. They were heading for their villages 50 kms away from Allahabad. Meaning another 800km. At 6.30pm they were seen nearing Khawasa border along with others.

Thousands housed in shelters

More than 13,000 migrant workers have been stopped from going and accommodated in shelters across Vidarbha as on Sunday morning, said the commissioners in-charge of Nagpur and Amravati divisions.

Sanjeev Kumar, divisional commissioner Nagpur, said there were 73 shelters in the division having 5500 persons. The migrant workers are being provided food and shelter with social distancing also being maintained. Apart from it, shelters are being run by NGOs and religious organizations too. Nagpur district alone had 16 shelters, he said.

In Amravati division, 8,000 persons were kept in various shelters. Amravati divisional commissioner Pravin Singh said, the division has districts bordering both Telangana and MP.

“We are retaining all workers of Samruddi Mahamarg and they have been asked to stay where they are,” Singh said.

The labouers heading from there or from Maharashtra towards Rajasthan or other states have been stopped too.

Areas like Burhanpur in Buldhana, Dharni in Melghat have borders with Maharashtra and Yavatmal borders Telangana.

47,['30/03/2020'],"No entry: Kolhapur, Satara &amp; Sangli dists seal borders","Kolhapur: In a serious response to the returning migrant workers, the local administration on Sunday announced that not a single person or vehicle would be allowed to enter the districts of Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur.

Satara district collector Shekhar Singh issued an order on Sunday morning, after which, the police presence was further strengthened at the district’s entry points. Singh also issued a warning that stated individuals trying to enter will face legal action.

Kolhapur district collector Daulat Desai has asked police superintendent Abhinav Deshmukh to take legal action against individuals caught violating lockdown orders to enter Kolhapur district. Desai said many people, particularly those employed in Pune and Mumbai, were currently making their way back into Kolhapur, which itself was illegal.

“I have ordered the police to arrest such people, confiscate their vehicles and to put them in institutional quarantine,” Desai said. The collector’s strict orders followed reports of people using emergency vehicles such as milk tankers and ambulances to enter the district.

District guardian minister Satej Patil also has asked the administration to use force, if necessary, to put those coming from Pune or Mumbai under institutional quarantine. Both Desai and Patil have said that strict measures are in place to limit transportation during the lockdown.

Desai went a step ahead to announce that legal action will also be taken against elected representatives who allow travel permits to individuals. “In such cases, the vehicle in use will also be confiscated,” he said.

Similar orders have been issued in Sangli and Solapur disricts. No one is allowed to leave the districts either. The Solapur administration has posted a special team to secure its border with Sangli because of the high number of cases detected there.

These orders are significant as Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Solapur districts have been experiencing large-scale reverse-migration, mostly of workers returning home from Pune and Mumbai.

Satara district collector Shekhar Singh told TOI that the number of people coming in has substantially dipped since the curbs on transport were put in place. He said the orders were issued to stop people from traveling during the lockdown.

Rough estimates reveal that nearly 90,000 people have entered Satara district over the past few days. A majority of them are registered with local authorities.

In Solapur district, around 40,000 people — many employed in Pune and Mumbai — have returned. In Kolhapur, that number is around 51,000. In the district of Sangli, estimates put the number of returned at around 40,000. All these people have been asked to quarantine themselves at home.

Karthik Patil, who is currently preparing for a civil service exam, is thinking of returning is hometown in Chandgad tehsil since he is unable to manage food and other essentials in the city. “I have small gas ylinder which needs to be refilled to cook food at home. Last month, I had bought the cylinder as there is no mess near my house. Now, the cylinder needs to be refilled. I had placed an order for the same at a local gas agency which is already facing delays in providing cooking gas to its regular customers.”

“The hotels are closed, mess services in the city have been shut and I have no relative in the city where I can stay for some time. My family members are ready to send a vehicle to take me back home. However, the authorities are not permitting us to do so,"" Karthik said.

He said that some of his friends managed to escape with the help of vehicles carrying vegetables and milk.

The district authorities have decided to act against such transporters. Owing to lockdown, the dates for competitive exams as well as college exams have been deferred. Students come to city to seek guidance for medical entrance as well as engineering entrance exam. The classes too have been closed. Teachers are sending notes and test papers through Whatsapp. Some coaching institutes have approached local NGO's to provide food to students. However, students live on rental basis at different places in the city and delivering food to each of them is a difficult task.

Working people who come to city every day from villages by public transport service too are facing problems.

Suvarna Kamble, a regular commuter from Chandgad, works for a legal firm in Kolhapur city. She was at the Central BUs Stand when the lockdown was announced. She was informed that al buses have been cancelled. She is currently staying at a women's hostel in the Takala area.

“I reached the bus stand a little late on the day when the lockdown was announced. My other colleagues left earlier and they could get on the bus. With the help of some local contacts, I am now staying in a women's hostel. There is no facility to cook and i am surviving with difficulties.”

The district administration and police personnel are also extending support to the poor and daily wagers by supplying eatables and providing accommodation to the homeless.One Sharmila Agarwal, a resident of Exhibition Road, who has been providing home-cooked food to at least 100 homeless people since last four days along with her husband, said, “Several people, including rickshaw pullers, don’t have access to meals due to the sudden lockdown. We are trying our best to reach out to these people in our locality and provide them food,” she said.Another Good Samaritan, Kamal Nopany, is also providing free food to the destitute. “Around 350 families from Rajasthan and Haryana, who used to sell clothes on the roads, have become jobless and are on the verge of starvation at Karbigahiya.

Several shopowners said short supply of essential commodities was still a major concern, leading to price rise.The lockdown has adversely impacted the movement of trucks and other vehicles used to transport essential commodities such as foodgrains, spices, vegetables, fruits, medicines and other goods.Vishwajeet, a grocery shopowner on Boring Canal Road, said, “I have no control over the price. The demand of goods is high and the supply is low. We have increased the prices on pulses, flour and spices by 10% only, while the packaged food items were being sold at its original price. Even the supply in wholesale market is hit due to lockdown,” he said.Kishan Kumar, a vegetable seller at Bazar Samiti, said onion prices increased by Rs15 to Rs45/kg. “Potato is selling at Rs48/kg, brinjal Rs40, ginger Rs210/kg, cabbage Rs60 and cauliflower at Rs100. Since the public transport has been stopped, we find it difficult to bring the vegetables to market place from the wholesale mandis,” he said.“We have to bring all the vegetables on private cabs and they charge high rates. This forced us to increase the prices of vegetables,” Kishan added.Sonu Kumar, a fruit seller at Sabzibagh, said the police personnel stopped our pickup van at several points and extorted money from the drivers. “We are forced to increase the rate of apples, oranges, grapes and bananas, as we pay extra money for transporting fruits,” he said.

52,['30/03/2020'],Coronavirus Cases in West Bengal: 12 of 21 Covid-19 patients are from three families,"TimesView We seem to be entering a critical phase in our fight against this disease. So it is important that we do not repeat those mistakes that some of us made when the disease was yet to have a Bengal footprint. It is imperative that we stay careful and safe.

KOLKATA: More than half of Bengal’s Covid-19 patients till Sunday — 12 out of 21 — belong to three family clusters who were infected by individuals with a history of foreign travel, which underlines the importance of keeping social distance even at home. Three individuals who returned from the UK have transmitted the virus to 12 people in these clusters and led to the quarantine of 45 people, some of who have tested negative. Experts felt the number of infected could have been curbed had the families acted more responsibly and stuck to the distan-cing norms. Ballygunge youth who got infected in the UK — the first to test positive in the state on March 20 — spread the virus to his parents and a domestic help. Eleven members of the family were quarantined. A 67-year-old who tested positive last week had picked up the virus from a family member at a wedding in Egra. Later, two other members of the family tested positive. On March 27, five members of a family from Tehatta, who had been infected by a UK-returned relative at a gathering in Delhi, tested positive.Even though the norms had been laid down and an alert had been sounded throughout the country, none of these families bothered to follow them, rued virologist Amitabha Nandy.“They must have known that anyone returning from the UK was a suspect even if there were no symptoms. But they chose to ignore it and risked the lives of several around them. What’s more shocking is that they didn’t even care to insulate themselves from the suspect, resulting in a spread. Had they stuck to the home- quarantine rule, they could have prevented the transmission . It will now take a considerable effort to break the chain,” said Nandy.Once the quarantine norm and the rules of social distancing are flouted, transmission will be inevitable, making it difficult to trace those who have come in contact with the patient, said infectious diseases consultant Rahul Jain.“Some people tend to infect more than the rest. The ones that transmitted the virus in Bengal turned out to be effective spreaders. A Bollywood singer, though she had come in contact with several others, did not infect anyone. So there is no alternative to following the distancing norms at home,” said Jain.Amiya Hati, former director of School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, said, “Social distancing is a must at home too, especially when there is someone suffering from flu-like symptoms or someone who is asymptomatic but has come from an affected area.”“Everyone in these three clusters are educated and well informed. But they broke the guidelines and made mistakes. For example, in the Ballygunge case, the youth could have infected more people because of his movements after returning from London. Luckily, he infected only three. If we do not learn from such mistakes, more cluster infections will happen,” said pulmonologist Dhiman Ganguly, who is part of the 12-member expert committee set up by the state to combat Covid-19.“In the Tehatta case, the five infected had mingled with a US-returned relative who was in the risk category. Now, they may have infected others in Tehatta. Currently, we have identified 16 such high-risk contacts,” said a state health department official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74883292,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/12-of-21-covid-patients-are-from-3-families/articleshow/74879865.cms

All three children and their mothers are being treated at ID Hospital. However, though doctors have said the virus is known act less severely on children, they are being flooded with calls from anxious parents on how to keep their wards safe.“Since the virus is just about three months old, there is very limited data about its severity on children. But so far, Covid-19 is believed to cause less severity and fatality among children,” said paediatric intensivist Prabhas Prasun Giri.According to healthcare experts, so far only China has come out with data on children affected by Covid-19, which says out of the 3,000 affected initially, only 2.4% were under 15 and the mortality was at 0.2%. “We do not have any data on children under one, but in general, other coronavirus have spared children largely in terms of infection rate and mortality during SARS and MERS,” said Raja Dhar, pulmonologist at Fortis Hospital , Kolkata.However, since the virus spreads through the respiratory route and kids’ lungs are immature, doctors said infected children need to be closely monitored. “While caring for infected children, we should keep an eye on the oxygen saturation level and ensure they get sufficient fluids,” said ICH director Apurba Ghosh “Children are susceptible to the virus, but are known to have better prognosis than adults, according to the literature available,” said paediatrician Pallab Chatterjee of Columbia Asia Hospital Many children with lung conditions like asthma are also at risk.

But city cops are not sparing even those who are venturing out alone, if they are roaming without any concrete reason.

On Saturday, a case each was registered with Paldi and A division traffic police. Anandnagar police registered two cases.

In these cases, cops have cited the notification of the state home department imposing a lockdown between March 23 and March 31 which bars any unnecessary movement. It needs mention that the city has reported three corona deaths.

The highest number of such cases, 10, were registered at Madhavpura police station. All the FIRs say that more than four persons had gathered at one place when cops were patrolling. The cops then claim that in all cases, four people fled and one was caught. In each case, the apprehended person has been charged under IPC Section 188 for disobeying notification issued by a government servant.

59,['30/03/2020'],Internal roads of rural areas closed,"Aurangabad: Police has restricted the movement of vehicles and people in internal roads of different rural areas on Sunday.

Authorities informed that this move is aimed at effective imposition of lockdown.

Since the announcement of lockdown about a week back, Sunday was the most deserted in the rural areas, which otherwise remain abuzz with weekly Sunday markets.

After being convinced by the police, several internal roads were closed down by the villagers, while at some places, the police restricted the movement.

In Pachod, attempts were made to set up Sunday market, but the police and the village sarpanch foiled the plan.

Police closed the Jamgaon – Vaijapur road, which eventually cut down the access to Jamgaon, Pagdi, Mamdapur and Kanadgaon villages. The same was witnessed in Sillod, Kannad, Gangapur, Soyegaon, Karmad. Police station in-charge appealed to villagers to remain indoors, unless there is an emergency.

Aurangabad rural superintendent of police Mokshada Patil said, “We appeal to the civic sense of fellow citizens for self-regulation. With planning and honest execution at the family level, we can get through this phase.”

The officer said that rural police have roped in community leaders and elderly people from the village to keep a check on the youths and prevent them from stepping outside their homes for no valid reason.

60,['30/03/2020'],Sanitiser is fine... so long as flame isn’t at hand,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: While advice about using alcohol-based hand sanitisers if soap and water are not available is sound, a 44-year-old man found out that there is additional advice that should be given to such users. He was brought to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Sunday night after sustaining 35% burn injuries. While doctors said a sanitiser evaporates 2-3 seconds after application and so poses little direct threat, immediately lighting a flame or perhaps a cigarette after using sanitiser can be risky.

Being treated in the department of plastic and cosmetic surgery at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, the patient is in stable condition. Doctors disclosed that the resident of Rewari in Haryana was at home at the time of the incident. He was cleaning his keys and mobile phone with a hand sanitiser and carried the bottle of the liquid to the kitchen, where his wife was cooking. There some sanitiser spilled on his kurta. “The fumes were ignited by the gas flame and the kurta caught fire. The patient suffered burns on his face, neck, chest, abdomen and both hands,” a doctor confirmed.

Dr Mahesh Mangal, chairman of the department, stressed that though absolutely essential at this time, hand sanitisers needed to be handled with care. “The high ethyl alcohol content of up to 62% makes a hand sanitiser highly flammable. Never use sanitisers near a fire or heated place. Use a limited quantity and allow it to dry,” Mangal instructed.

Another doctor added that alcohol-based sanitisers posed no great risk on the skin because it evaporated in seconds. “Only if spilled in fires or on your clothes do sanitisers catch fire easily. People can cook or use a sanitiser near a flame, but need to be careful,” he pointed out. “In any case, one should ideally wash hands with soap before cooking and not rely on sanitisers.”

Dr P S Bhandari, consultant, burns and plastic surgery, Lok Nayak Hospital, reiterated that the chances of catching fire through sanitisers was low. “Deodorants, repellents and other sprays also have alcohol content, making them flammable. Like them, sanitisers are generally safe to use. But remember not to light a flame or come close to a fire immediately after using it,” he said.

Dr Bheem S Nanda, senior consultant in the department of plastic & cosmetic surgery at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, suggested relying on scent. “Most sanitisers are scented and the smell vanishes after a while. This is generally an indicator that the alcohol in your hand has evaporated and you can then light a cigarette or agarbatti or begin cooking,” said Nanda.

KOLKATA: Hours after Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma assured Kolkatans that pharmacy shops will remain open, several police stations in Kolkata — especially in the added areas — held meetings with local pharmacists and worked out methods to ensure that supply remained normal at these retail shops . Sources said police stations like Patuli and Thakurpukur even chalked out a seven-point plan — from arranging temporary stay for staffers in the area to getting stocks cleared at police naka points — to ensure that locals do not have to run around for medicines.

“We arrived at a few decisions after discussing the situation. There were mainly two issues — supply was not steady from wholesalers and staff availability issue.

A simple application at the police station should settle staff movement issues. It was also agreed that crowding must be avoided at the shops at any cost,” an officer said.

“We have reassured them of help in getting the supplies cleared in case it gets stuck in any naka point. We have also offered them help in arranging a temporary shelter for their staff in the locality in case the staff are unable to travel,” the official added. An officer at Patuli said WhatsApp groups have been formed with all local medicine shop owners and distributors so that they can reach them immediately in case of any need.

Almost 85% medicine shops across the city were open on Sunday. “Around 3,500 retail shops and 150 stockists were open on Sunday. With adequate staff at the shops we expect services to normalise by next week,” said Manik Lal Das, south Kolkata secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association.

In north Kolkata, supplies are getting stabilised slowly and shop owners were asked to keep outlets open. There are 200 retail shops between Hedua and Sinthi. We have briefed them about how to download and print e-passes. That will help the staff to resume duty from Monday,” said Subir Sen, south Kolkata secretary of the association.

VARANASI: With the arrival of migrant workers in east UP districts from Delhi and NCR, officials are ensuring that no one goes home without thermal scanning and stamping of home quarantine instructions.

Chief medical officer Varanasi Dr VB Singh said that the buses ferrying migrant workers started reaching Varanasi via Rajatalab and Pindra borders from Saturday night. Before the arrival of the buses, three teams were placed at each point of Pindra and Rajatalab. These buses, headed to Varanasi, were stopped at the borders and each passenger was examined with thermal scanners. Most of them were also asked to fill a form and allowed to go after stamping instructions of home quarantine on their hands.

Regional manager Varanasi of UPSRTC SK Rai said that nine buses were arranged at Pindra border on Saturday late night. Of these three buses left for Sonbhadra, two Naubatpur (UP-Bihar border) in Chandauli and one to Ghazipur after the arrival of passengers from Ghaziabad and Noida. All these passengers were allowed to board buses for their native places after proper examination by the health department team.

Rai further said, “We are arranging replacement of the buses which are unable to move forward if any driver is unable to drive further after a long-distance journey.”

After a driver expresses inability in continuing journey after reaching Varanasi, the bus is replaced by local depots of UPSRTC.

Rai said that on Sunday nine more buses for different districts of the region had been sent till late afternoon while entry points are being monitored for further arrangements.

There is no crowding at entry-cum-checking points on Varanasi borders as the migrant workers are reaching here after district-wise segregation, said officials.

District magistrate Ballia Hari Pratap Shahi said that all those who reached here from Delhi and NCR areas were properly examined and stamped before allowing to leave for their native places. Details of each passenger were collected after queuing up them at 10 counters ensuring that they maintain distance as per the prescribed norms and then they were allowed to move ahead with mask, gloves, and slips of home quarantine. Arrangements have also made for those quarantined at gram panchayat and school buildings, said Shahi.

As the influx of migrants from Delhi and NCR had increased since Saturday night and continued on Sunday, the exodus of labourers from Varanasi and neighbouring districts of east UP towards their villages in Bihar also continued. In Lohta area a large number of labourers could be found moving on foot to their villages in Bihar. Another group of labourers, who were engaged in different units of Varanasi, also walked to their homes.

Many policemen in bordering areas helped the labourers, who were rigid to go to their native places despite arrangements of food and lodging made at temporary shelter homes by local authorities.

ADG Varanasi zone Brij Bhushan said that in view of the directives of the government to stop the migration of people, all necessary arrangements are being made in government primary schools along highways with availability of food.

From Friday, the city police started moving casual labourers to houses of Rajiv Awas Yojna behind Rajpath Club on SG Road. These labourers were picked up mainly from Chiloda Circle and Odhav Circle on SP Ring Road after they started walking out of the city because they were running out of money to survive here.

“Nearly 3,000 persons were shifted to the AMC facility,” said an official of the city police. “Though they were provided food and water they did not have fans and running water. They raised objections on Saturday night after which they were told by the cops and the civic body that they could leave.”

The police official said that the houses were not maintained due to which it was difficult for the labourers to stay there. Another police official said that the facility provided by the AMC was not proper which led the labourers to create an uproar.

“The labourers were dissatisfied with food quality and the condition of the houses,” said the official.

Hanumant Rule, in-charge of the blood bank at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), said the state-run facility has sufficient stock available now. “After a shortage of blood for a brief period, the government had appealed to masses to donate the blood and many responded to such call. Also, we received sufficient stock from Jalna district,” he said.

Rule said the average daily requirement of blood has also gone down amid the outbreak of COVID-19.“The daily requirement has gone down by more than one-third. A certain drop in planned surgeries is one of the main reasons behind such reduced demand. The casualty department is witnessing a lesser number of patients meeting with road-accidents and it is another cause behind lower demand for blood,” he said.

Manju Kulkarni, in-charge of Dattaji Bhale blood-bank, said that the number of volunteers donating blood as a social responsibility has increased post-outbreak of coronavirus. “There is no more shortage of blood now. In fact, we have put a cap on the number of donors donating the blood as there is reduced demand. We are accepting blood from only 40 donors every day and requesting others to wait for their turn.,” she said.

Kulkarni added that every donor is asked to fill a special consent form in the wake of the outbreak. “The National Blood Transfusion Council (NBTC) has issued special guidelines while receiving blood from a donor. It involves self-declaration that donor is not having any COVID-19 like symptoms as well as certain lab tests,” she said.

Authorities at different blood banks also said that they have strictly stopped camps to collect blood. “The blood donation camps have been stopped in order to practice social distancing norm advised by the government,” authorities said.

Pravin Bhandekar, a government employee, said he voluntarily donated his blood post-outbreak.

Even two days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s appeal to doctors to reopen their clinics, that had been shut due to the coronavirus scare, very few have complied.

Desai said: “We are aware of the situation. Yesterday (Saturday) we met some doctors. We have asked them to follow the orders. They claimed that around half of the clinics have reopened. However, we are yet to check. If the doctors fail to follow the orders, then we will take stringent actions such as sealing the clinics and cancelling their practice licences.”

The collector said the doctors’ demand for providing protective equipment is under consideration. The doctors carrying out general practice should also have gloves and wear N95 masks. The doctors claim there is a shortage of protective gear.

Meanwhile, patients with diabetes, eye-related issues, dental problems, minor injuries, blood pressure etc. are facing inconvenience. Even the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation-run clinics are of not much help to them as most of the doctors and staff have been assigned to check suspected coronavirus patients who are under home-quarantine. The civic body’s health officials said that for minor complaints, doctors are advising patients to get the medicines and stay at home.

People are angry since all other essential services are operational such as retail grocery shops, pharmacies, milk outlets, but clinics are closed.

Doctors with N95 masks and gloves are attending the clinics. They have been provided with a chart by the apex medical body that instructs the use of protective equipment before checking patients. The doctors fear that a patient with coronavirus may spread the infection. The district administration has said that such patients should compulsorily be referred to the Covid-19 screening centres immediately.

71,['30/03/2020'],Businessman who drives through Jaipur streets to feed strays,"JAIPUR: Fifty-five-year-old Sanjiv Sankhla used to spend time with animals on a daily basis. Feeding the strays was part of his daily routine. However, what was a 20-minute activity has now expanded into a dedicated few hours to feed the stray animals during the ongoing lockdown An exporter, whose own business has been affected by the lockdown, Sankhla is busy mapping closed thadis (roadside stalls), eateries and waste points in the city in his pick-up van stocked with fodder, biscuits and medicines for stray animals. Sankhla goes from area to area to feed the stray dogs, cats, cows, bulls and pigs that come his way.It was his love for animals that made him start an NGO Help Suffering Animals a few years ago and now he is spending his time fully in taking care of the animals. “It is good that the government has made all arrangements for humans, and it is our duty to help the stray animals in any way we can,” said Sankhla, whose voluntary work has doubled ever since people were confined indoors.Ever since he received a permit from the city administration to carry out his distribution work on March 25, he and his team feed stray animals at 45 points in the city.“For cows, people are compassionate and they offer leftovers, but for stray dogs and cats, who need non-veg food in their diet are starving,” said Sankhla. He and his team travels in areas like Mansarovar, Raja Park, Malviya Nagar, C Scheme, Pratap Nagar, Sodala and Vaishali Nagar.“Our focus is on urban areas as our experience has shown us that people on the outskirts are a little more compassionate and are feeding the strays,” he said. Every morning, he gets fodder from the nearby villages for cows and buffaloes, while for cats and dogs, the challenge remains as meat shops are closed. They have to depend on branded food, which comes with a cost. “However, once I started, a lot of my relatives, friends and even strangers voluntarily came forward with donations,” he added.Sankhla ensures his team members take all precautions by wearing masks, use sanitisers, clean their tools with sanitiser and before entering their house, they change their clothes and shoes. “Our families have been very supportive. My elderly parents, teen daughter and wife wait for me to tell them about the day’s work every evening and also spread the word on our work,” he said.What Sankhla finds a concern is that many people, even educated ones, believe that their pets or stray animals pose a threat. “I have lost count of people who call me to ask what they should do to ensure they don’t catch Covid-19 from their pets or animals. Some even asked if they should stay away from their pets. Animals are not carriers and the lockdown should not be a reason to mistreat them,” he said.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74881368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-106036,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/bizman-who-drives-through-city-streets-to-feed-strays/articleshow/74879586.cms

Before he could catch the train back home, the lockdown left him stranded here. The Rs2,000 he had have been spent, Kazare now spends his time on the footpath near Kasturchand Park , living on the charity of do-gooders, who are distributing food around the city.Kazare says his job was to only deliver the packet to the person, and had no idea who was he or what was inside the packet. “The chartered accountant’s office is at Camay Towers, Marine Lines, and my boss stays somewhere at Andheri. I called up the office but they told me to wait here till April 14,” says Kazare.Kazare had also gone to Raipur for similar work, but by the time he returned all roads were closed. Kazare says, “I had no money to stay in a hotel, what I had was spent in buying food. I stay here in the morning and go to sleep at the railway station, because its not safe on the footpath in the night.”Later, when TOI contacted him again in the evening, Kazare had been contacted by NMC officials, who said they will make arrangements for him.Next to him was Satyam, who worked as a chef in Bhatinda, Punjab, and was returning home at Raipur, Chhattisgarh. “After reaching Delhi from Bhatinda, I took the Chhattisgarh Express that goes till Raipur. When the train reached Nagpur, people started saying it will not go further, so I got down, only to find out later that the train had gone ahead. Now, I am helpless,” he said showing the ticket.A drive along the road shows many others like Kazare and Satyam.

As a vehicle approaches some of them eagerly come forward, hoping that food packets are being distributed.Section 144 is in force but there is hardly any social distancing happening here. The crowd increases in the evening, said a local living near by.Most of those waiting here are daily wagers who used to gather there to take up odd jobs.

The decision to postopone the exams is posing a problem for the students who have to mostly depend on coaching centres or other tutorials because of the physical distancing. They are finding it difficult to depend on online resources and e-learning materials to continue with their preparation. IIT Kharagpur has developed a preparatory module for JEE and JEE Advanced, available free for students on the NDLI platform. Students can visit the NDLI website https://www.ndl.gov.in/ or https://ndl.iitkgp.ac.in/ or log on to the NDLI mobile application.

The website of NDLI now has a special section called, ‘Corona Outbreak: Study from Home’, which students can access. The repository contains NDLI Tutorial for JEE Advanced for 12 years and Practice Questions and Solutions for JEE Preparation. Content for JEE Mains for the past five years is also getting readied and will be added to the site soon, said experts. “The solutions have been prepared by subject matter experts and doctoral students in related areas. Hence, the solutions are diverse and students can opt for their preferred methods. Further we have provided reference materials for related problems, so students can explore further,” said Partha Pratim Das, a faculty and joint-principal investigator, NDLI.

Students can browse the “School” option under the ‘Corona Outbreak’ module or search by relevant keywords. The developers recommend registering on the portal for better user experience, though the resources are available without any restrictions.

Only cargo aircraft have been flying to the city since.According to sources, an empty Air India Boeing B-787 aircraft will come to Kolkata on Tuesday and pick up German nationals, including the envoy and diplomatic mission staff as well as select staffers of other European missions in the city. The plane will then head to Delhi, where more German citizens and those from other EU nations will board the flight that will then depart for Frankfurt.“This evacuation flight is one of nine chartered flights that AI will operate from Delhi and Mumbai to Frankfurt, following a request from the German chancellor Angela Merkel to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Following the lockdown, German nationals are stuck in Kolkata, Bengaluru, Goa, Trivandrum, Chennai, Delhi and Mumbai. AI will operate these one-way flights to help them return home,” a source in the national carrier told TOI.According to airline sources, AI will operate five flights on March 31, one flight on April 1, two on April 2 and the final one on April 3.With a capacity of 236 seats, the nine B-787 flights can evacuate over 2,000 Europeans. There will be no passenger on the return flights. The crew will wear personal protection equipment (masks and gloves) during the flight and on-board services will be limited to avoid exposure and infection. Sources said pre-packed meals are likely to be kept in the seat pockets for passengers.

The number of coronavirus cases in Maharashtra increased to 197 on Sunday.Amid a global shortage of such equipment, the state’s medical fraternity had written to the health minister about a similar situation in Maharashtra and stressed the need to address the crisis at the earliest. With over 1,000 hospitals set to admit Covid-19 positive patients, the requirement of personal protection equipment has increased and the state is reaching out to all local manufacturers, besides those abroad, to urgently address this issue.Tope said he has received complaints about the shortage of such equipment in the state and the government was reaching out to top companies to procure such kits through CSR funds. “I have urged many of our existing players to make this supply available. There should not be any shortage of these kits as doctors and other medical staffers would not be able to work in the absence of these protective gear,” he said.The minister also assured medical insurance cover for all Covid-19 patients under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana from April 1. “This is a flagship health insurance scheme in the state and all Covid-19 patients will be covered,” he said. The scheme allows the coverage in over 1,000 private hospitals.Indian Medical Association state president Avinash Bhondwe said there was a dearth of personal protection equipment in both the government and private sectors. “We have been repeatedly saying that this shortage should be addressed. Besides requesting the government, we have also created a corpus to tide over the crisis,” he said, adding that elected representatives could also come forward with the MLA and MP funds for the purpose.Another point raised by a health worker is that the manufacturers have increased prices ten-fold and the government needs to intervene into it.

The SCR has handled inter-change operations of 961 freight trains originating from other zones and passing through its network, around 160 freight trains in an average daily, as per an official release said.

Chief public relations officer of SCR, Ch Rakesh, said the zone has decided not to levy demurrage (the charge for the detention of any rolling stock after the expiry of free time, if any, allowed for such detention) or wharfage (the charge levied on goods for not removing them from the railway after the expiry of the free time for removal.) for goods and parcel freight traffic from March 22 to April 14 in keeping with the directive from the Indian Railways, amid the coronavirus outbreak.

“The waiver initiative of the Indian Railways relaxes the norms of the earlier decision to bring the demurrage and wharfage rates to half of the prescribed tariff. No charges will be levied for stacking, detention and ground usage in case of container traffic too,” he said.

The commodities primarily ranged from coal to thermal power plants for electricity, fertilizers used in the agricultural sector, food grains to ensure uninterrupted supply and transporting of milk to Delhi. “An extensive coordination is being maintained with various state governments to seek their involvement in the smooth running of trains and to deliver their own needs,” Rakesh said.

SCR general manager Gajanan Mallya, said, “With the looming threat from the global pandemic, SCR is trying to overcome various challenges to ensure freight trains reach their destinations,” he said.

The SCR authorities said medical attention is given for all railway employees and staff. “The working places and rest houses are continuously sanitized. To negate any possibility of contracting infections, the mandatory breath analyser test has been done for crew operating freight trains,” Rakesh said.

KOLKATA: Milk supply in Kolkata and its adjoining areas is likely to become normal from Monday after dairy owners met animal husbandry department officials at an emergency meeting in Nabanna on Sunday. The rationing of two packets for each buyer, imposed by the retailers in view of the supply shortage, is also likely to be lifted.

Metro Dairy, which had to increase production to accommodate the sudden surge in demand after supplies from the market leader Amul dipped sharply, will continue with its usual production level. Faced with a sudden surge in demand, the government had requested the private dairy to increase their production by 30,000 litres per day. It had taken the government’s help to despatch the excess production to retailers across the city. The company will go back to its normal production of 2 lakh litres per day from Monday, sources said.

“We are continuing with our usual production level of 2.2 lakh litres. There is an excess supply of fresh milk in the market as the sweet shops are closed. But we are unable to accommodate that as we are not sure of the quality of that milk,” said Narayan Majumdar, director of the company. The dairy owners, who have been facing the shortage of staff, were also assured of help by the state government. “We expect to operate with the normal supply fleet from Monday,” Majumdar added.

Meanwhile, the state government-run Mother Dairy has also increased its procurement of fresh milk and raised its supplies. It has enhanced the quality of the most economical, toned milk, at no extra cost. “Not a single booth in Kolkata is running dry now. We are sending milk directly from the factory at Dankuni to each of the 200 booths in Kolkata to ensure unrestricted supplies. Vehicles are leaving twice in a day to assure that booths have enough milk supply,” said an official of the Mother Dairy.

“Production of fresh milk at the cow sheds in Kolkata and surrounding areas has dipped in the past two days. Farmers are taking the excess production to far-off areas and continuing with the distress sell. Some of them are trying to convert the produce into paneer (cottagecheese) and dahi to minimise their losses,” said Rajesh Sinha, president of Jorasanko Dugdha Byabsayee Samiti. Amul, hit hard with shortage of staff, will continue with restricted production of its Gold variety. The toned variety , however, is likely to resume increased supplies soon.

More migrant labourers were spotted moving on Varanasi-Kanpur highway as they wanted to walk down to Jalaun. Mukesh , a migrant worker, said“ We started our journey from Varanasi on Saturday morning and reached Prayagraj on Sunday and would be travelling on foot to Jalaun”. He also said that he had no money. “Some people gave us food at Handia when we were on way to Prayagraj.”

Migrant labourers, however, demanded local authorities to make arrangement to send them to their native towns in Rewa, Satna, Meja, Manda and adjoining areas.

83,['30/03/2020'],Lockdown affects cattle feed production,"Kolhapur: The problems of dairy farmers in the sugar bowl of Maharashtra is likely to increase in next few days as the raw material for producing cattle feed is getting exhausted and the industries producing the feed would have to discontinue production . The farmers have enough fodder for their cattle, but need cattle feed to increase the nutritional content.

Gokul, one of the major milk procurers and cattle feed producers in the district, is facing an inter-state supply problem to source raw material.

Cattle feed is used to increase the quality and nutrition of the milk. Most farmers get the cattle feed through the dairies that are attached to Gokul through its cattle feed-producing plant.

Gokul’s cattle feed plant sources raw materials like deoiled cakes of rice bran, corn, millet — which has high protein content — and molasses from other states like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka.

Ravindra Apate, the chairman of Gokul Dairy, said: “Since the lockdown , we have been unable to get the supply of these raw materials. Without the raw materials, we cannot continue production. Usually, we produce 600 tonne of cattle feed every day. But now we have reduced the production to half. With the available raw material, we can sustain for the next few days. If the situation continues, we will have to discontinue production from April 15.”

Rahul Khade, a dairy farmer from Kolhapur city, said, “We have enough fodder. The government has allowed the supply of fodder in the market and there is no scarcity. The fields along the banks of the Panchaganga river also have sufficient fodder that can be cut and supplied to the major markets for livestock. What we are fearing is the shortage of cattle feed. We are not getting enough supply of the cattle feed for our buffaloes and cows.”

Ramesh Malgonda Patil, the chairman Laxmi Vikas Seva Society and a dairy farmer from Gadhinglaj, said, “Usually we need one 50kg bag per cattle per month. The price is around Rs 1,150 per bag. We usually procure cattle feed from the dairy we supply milk to. Though we asked for two bags of cattle feed, we got only one. The dairy officials have asked us to use the feed judiciously.”

84,['30/03/2020'],Social distancing ignored as crowds throng markets,"Trichy: All the meat outlets in the city were seen crowded on Sunday with people competing against each other to wind up their purchase at the earliest, and thereby throwing to the wind social distancing .

As Janata Curfew was observed the previous Sunday, all the chicken, mutton and fish stalls in the city were shut. Since people usually purchase meat on Sundays to preparing non-vegetarian delicacies at home, residents who were deprived last week were determined not to miss the opportunity this week.

Despite the lockdown, meat stalls in Gandhi Market, Woraiyur, Palakkarai, Kattur and Subramaniapuram were flooded with residents. The footfall was such that mutton stalls had completed sales by around 11am. “Customers did not listen to our instructions to maintain social distancing. As people continue to flout restrictions, we are worried about clampdown on us in the coming days,” J Prabakaran, a meat stall owner from Palakkarai said.

The price of one kg of boneless mutton was Rs 900, up from Rs 700, while chicken was sold at Rs 80 to Rs 120 per kg. People, however, did not hesitate to shell out more.

While a one metre gap is mandatory between people in public places, the rule was deliberately flouted. “Compared to last few days and last week, the sale this Sunday was decent. The business is gradually picking up,” said S Nagarajan, a chicken stall owner from Bhima Nagar.

Trichy Corporation and city police had instructed the meat stall owners to ensure social distancing during the sales. “We repeatedly told people not to crowd, but the footfall was high. If only people can realise the gravity of Covid-19, they will stop crowding and cooperate,” a Trichy Corporation official said.

PUNE: Shivajinagar received yet another “intensive” shower on Sunday, adding 4mm to the area’s total rainfall this summer, while Lohegaon received 1mm.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather at India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune, told TOI that Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada, including Pune city, are likely to receive very light rain at isolated places on Monday as well, along with thundery activity. “Rainfall activity is likely to reduce from Monday, with only partly cloudy skies on Tuesday followed by mainly clear skies in Pune for a couple of days,” Kashyapi said.

He said the city was experiencing intensive showers, which are usually intense and fall within a short period of time. “The reason for the showers is a trough-line passing through Marathwada and Vidarbha. Hence the areas adjacent to these regions are receiving rainfall. The high temperatures as well as the moisture flow into parts of Maharashtra due to the prevailing weather systems have been resulting in local-level instability, leading to convective rains,” IMD said.

On Sunday, locations like Katraj and adjacent areas also experienced hail. Two days ago, the sudden rainfall interrupted power in many areas of the city, severely affecting the schedule of many citizens, who are working from home due to the prevailing Covid-19 lockdown.

However, looking at early trends of test results, doctors have stated that the spread is still limited to family members and very close contacts.Since Thursday, NMC checked more than 100 close contacts of positive patients. Of them, only six have tested positive.For example, manager of the Khamla businessman who tested positive had travelled along with him to New Delhi. A shop assistant who tested positive used to attend the shop daily and was with the owner for most of the day between March 18 and 21. On the other hand, other two shop assistants who were not in that close contact have tested negative.Khamla businessman’s family members including his mother, wife and son tested positive but his daughter tested negative. Similarly, all family members of the assistant tested negative and only his 17-year-old daughter was positive. Most importantly, neither maid servants, nor neighbours of any of these patients have tested positive so far.“As far as Nagpur’s cases are concerned, we can definitely trace the infection source of every new local patient. Only those who are into close or long time contact of the positive patients have been infected so far,” said a senior doctor working in the laboratory of IGGMCH.More than 85% of the total samples tested in this lab have been negative. It has till date tested 730 samples including 20 on March 29. Of these, 711 have been negative and 19 positive.Municipal Commissioner Tukaram Mundhe also stressed this fact in his video message. “Most first phase patients in Nagpur have the infection source somewhere outside Nagpur.

Never diagnosed with Covid-19, his quarantine just doesn’t seem to end, even after two months.

Piyush, a software engineer in a Gurugram firm, was one of the 3,700 passengers on-board the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship which at that time -- in February -- carried the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside mainland China. Over 700 people aboard the luxury liner had contracted the virus then. After spending 23 days of the quarantine period on the ship, he was allowed to return to India. But soon after landing, Piyush was taken to a government facility in Manesar for another 14 days. That was not the end of it.

Piyush returned to Meerut and was advised to spend another fortnight locked inside his house. And then, before his self-imposed quarantine could end, the nation went into lockdown.

“And all this when I never tested positive for the disease,” said Piyush, who is currently working from home for his company

Recalling the ordeal, he said, “I had boarded the ship on January 25. And quarantine in the ship started on February 3 after one of the passengers, who disembarked, was later found to be Covid-19 positive. I was kept in the ship till February 26, for 23 days. I was again in quarantine after reaching India on February 27 at the Manesar facility. It ended on March 12. I returned to Meerut on March 13. But again I was told to be in quarantine for another 14 days. The 14-day period ended on March 27. And now I can't go out due to the lockdown till April 15. It's a long, long journey ahead.”

His travails notwithstanding, Piyush cautions people against taking the contagious disease lightly. “From my nearly two-month-long quarantine period, all I have learnt is that if anyone has coronavirus-like symptoms, he should inform concerned officials immediately so that steps can be taken to contain the disease and stop its spread,"" he said.

89,['30/03/2020'],PMC starts home survey in slums to check Covid-19 spread,"edited

Pune: The civic administration has started home-to-home survey in the dense slum pockets that accommodate over 30% of the city population.

Officials said the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has taken the step to extend its surveillance and contain the spread of coronavirus in the slums.

The surveyors are getting the forms filled by residents with basic information of members in every family, their recent history of outstation travel and if any one of them have come in contact with anyone with an international travel history. Details of women and those working in nearby housing societies as domestic helps, especially those visiting the homes of people with recent international travel history, are also being collected.

The surveyors are also collecting information on the health status of people living in the slum pockets, especially those with symptoms of cough, cold or sneezing. The symptomatic people would be immediately referred to the medical staffers for help, officials in the administration said.

The city has slum pockets in almost all areas. Some of the major slum areas are Patil Estate, Janata Vasahat, Kasewadi, Market Yard and Indiranagar. All these pockets are densely populated with small-sized homes.

A senior official said anticipating some resistance from citizens in furnishing information, the surveyors have been provided with identity cards and letters explaining the reasons for collecting the information.

The official said, “People sometime do not want to reveal details about family or ailments. We are appealing to all citizens to provide necessary information. This is vital to curb the spread of Covid-19. The administration is strict about the home quarantine of those who have come in contact with the people with international travel past. Any such cases identified during the survey will be immediately referred to the medical teams.”

The PMC has appointed staffers from its various departments, besides the Asha workers, clerks and officials from the education department for the survey. Separate teams are being appointed to visit the slum pockets in each ward.

The officials said besides gathering information, the surveyors would conduct awareness drives to educate people on the practices to be followed to restrict the spread of coronavirus.

Vadodara: Many in the city are distributing food and grocery kits to poor, some drinking water while others masks. But there are some who have taken the onus of providing free disinfecting services to police stations and giving sanitizers that are difficult to find to the cops.

Police stations witness movement of both police personnel and others. They cannot be shutdown like other offices and cops remain on duty overtime. Cops also come in close contact with many while distributing food or preventing them from violating the lockdown.

In the wake of the situation, a city-based entrepreneur has started disinfecting police stations and even vehicles used by the police. “We had introduced disinfecting as a service as we are already into laundry services, house cleaning, sofa and upholstery sanitization,” said entrepreneur Pradeep Sharma.

However, when their team was returning after sanitizing a school in Warasiya area, cops stopped the team on seeing the equipment. “They asked us details and then requested us to do the same for their police station. The lockdown began the very next day and we decided that we should provide the service for free to the police as they were at risk,” he said.

Sharma’s team has so far sanitized the police commissioner’s office, his residence, police stations and outposts as well as police vehicles. “They are working overtime and we cannot afford to let them fall ill,” said Sharma.

At the other end, Savli-based company Indo Amines Ltd has arranged 20,000 bottles of sanitizers for policemen and other personnel out in the field. The employees and top management of the company started distributing 200ml bottles on Monday and will continue doing so. They are also flooded with demands for arranging more such bottles. The company has ordered more bottles of sanitizers and assured the men in uniform that the supply will continue.

“Meter readers will not be able to go about their duty of recording meter readings,” an official said

The consumers have also been advised to pay their electricity bills online.

Though the department has introduced various online payment platforms, a large section of the population still continues to pay their bills over the counter and at banks. Now, with banks and department offices shut, this will not be possible.

To ensure that citizens are not inconvenienced by any power-related problems during the lockdown period, the department has also appointed taluka-wise nodal officers who can be contacted. A total of 30 nodal officers – 18 for North Goa and 20 for South Goa – comprising executive engineers and assistant engineers have been appointed to ensure uninterrupted power supply during the lockdown. Depending on its size, each taluka has one executive engineer and multiple assistant engineers who have been appointed as the nodal officers.

“The helpdesk number, 1912, can also be accessed round the clock and will be monitored continuously by an officer specifically posted for the purpose,” chief electrical engineer Raghuvir Keni stated in the order.

A Antony Raj, 51, has been feeding about 40 dogs in his street, a daily routine that he has been doing the last five years. He runs a coconut shop near his house and also raises four dogs.

On Friday night, when he went to feed the dogs, he was picked up by Palakkarai police for coming out to feed them.

He usually goes out after 11pm at night to feed dogs with cooked poultry waste like legs and intestines to ensure that no one is disturbed. However the police personnel on rounds on Friday night were not convinced, following which an altercation ensued and he was even slapped.

The union home ministry had on Thursday clarified that inter-state transport of animal feed and fodder was exempted from the lockdown. Also, the state animal husbandry department directed to allow feeding homeless animals.

The animal husbandry department also asked the respective district administrations to identify genuine feeders and issue passes in consultation with local body authorities and police. A senior official from the district administration said that it may not be possible to issue pass or identity cards as it may lead to duplication and misuse.

A Thangaraj, 52, from Sanjeevi Nagar, said that despite furnishing necessary documents, which allows feeding dogs during the lockdown, police from Malaikottai police station are refusing to even read the documents.

“They simply said that they would arrest me if I continue to feed dogs for violating section 144. I have approached the district administration with a petition a few days back. It would be helpful for people like me if district administration issues an identity card or a letter allowing us to carry on with our service,” he said.

Such incidents only reflects the general aversion among most people in the society towards homeless animals, says honorary district animal welfare officer G Ramakrishnan from the Animal welfare board of India. “It is important to understand that foods from eateries and restaurants have been cut-off in the wake of lockdown.

It gave them an opportunity to pray with family and friends in Kolkata.

The mass started at 8am, and was relayed live via YouTube. But there were a few technical snags that interfered with archbishop Thomas D Souza’s sermon. The video was later uploaded online. In his sermon, D Souza delivered messages on hygiene as well.

“It was unbelievable…we all sang hymns sitting in New York. We will be saying the Good Friday and Easter prayers with family back in Kolkata as well!” said Joseph Gomes from New York. “Seeing the archbishop praying gave us goosebumps. We will pray together on Good Friday and Easter too,” Sadhana Gomes wrote from Birmingham, UK.

“On Good Friday too, the celebration of the Lord’s Passion will be streamed live from the Archbishop House at 3pm,” said vicar general Dominic Gomes . Since no one will be in church, parishioners will organize the Way of the Cross at home. For Easter Vigil on April 11, the Easter Vigil Liturgy will again be streamed live from the Archbishop House.

PUNE: The Pune rural police on Saturday registered offences against four morning walkers in Narayangaon. Another person found wandering on the road in Kamshet in the evening was also booked.

“During the lockdown, people are expected to stay at their homes, not head out for their daily morning walk,” said inspector Arjun Ghode Patil of Narayangaon police station. The officer added that the police teams have been appealing to people to remain indoors.

Even so, some people were seen stepping out of their homes early in the morning. “On Saturday, we fanned out teams to trace morning walkers. We found four people and registered offences against them,” Ghode Patil said.

“They claimed that they had stepped out of their homes when there were hardly anyone on the road. People should know that they will remain safe indoors,” the officer added.

Similarly, an officer from Kothrud police station noticed a few elderly people on an evening walk on Saturday. “I requested them to return home as they are the most vulnerable right now,” the officer said.

PMC corporator Alpna Varpe too has appealed to people to put morning walks on hold for now. She warned that the police will take action against morning walkers.

Balasaheb Deshmukh, the chief administrator of APMC, told TOI, “The fresh arrivals are sufficient to meet the city’s vegetable requirement for the next two days and another round of arrivals is expected on Tuesday. In normal circumstances, the daily arrival of vegetables is in the range of 15,000 to 17,000 quintals. On Monday, the market will open for onion, potato and fruits.”

The APMC and Shree Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Adate Association, a body of the commission agents which facilitate auction of produce for farmers and wholesale traders, are yet to reach a consensus on the need to open all shops in the Gultekdi Market Yard. On Sunday, barely 10% of the 450 shops belonging to the commission agents were opened. Vegetables like coriander,spinach and fenugreek were sold in the range of Rs4 to Rs8 per bunch. Other vegetables like tomato, and cauliflower, among others were sold at average rates, the authorities said.

The vehicles came to the market between 9pm on Saturday to 4am on Sunday. “Only license holder traders and staffers are allowed inside market,” Deshmukh said.

He said, “We expect a better response going ahead. The commission agents need to understand that meeting people’s requirement is a priority. Our discussion with the association is under way and we hope they will respond positively.”

However, Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the commission agents body, said, “Our concerns relating to the health scare are genuine and our members won’t open their shops till March 31.”

With two new cases detected today, the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 has risen to five in the state.

Until Sunday afternoon, only one patients was being treated in ESI hospital while two were in the isolation ward of the Goa Medical College (GMC). The GMC authorities, who were ready to shift the two patients under its care to the ESI hospital earlier, had to defer plan until today.

A senior government official said an anesthetist attached to GMC had certified that the ESI hospital was adequate for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, but the government requested former GMC dean V N Jindal to conduct an inspection with other members.

“Hence, the two patients could not be transferred there immediately even though the GMC had the ESI hospital inspected by an ICU expert. The expert did not point to any discrepancies and there was no need for a fresh examination. The commissioning of the hospital was delayed,” the official said.

The 60-bed hospital is relatively new. Provision for ten ventilators have been made,” he said.

Secretary, department of health and family welfare, Preeti Sudan had written to chief secretaries of all states and Union territories to create a fully dedicated standalone hospital for Covid-19 patients as it will able to provide specialised care for the unique needs of the confirmed cases and prevent risk of transmission.

Professor and head of medicine department, Dr Edwin Gomes has been appointed nodal officer of the ESI Covid-19 hospital. A team of frontline doctors comprising physicians, anaesthesiologist, pulmonary specialist, ENT experts and expert nurses for ICU have been posted there, the official said.

103,['30/03/2020'],Pune: Head nurse at forefront of H1N1 fight battles Covid-19,"Saroj Pillai

PUNE: From sleepless nights at home after completing the day’s duty to watching out for her own health with blood pressure and sugar issues, Saroj Pillai, head nurse of the Naidu hospital’s out-patient department, is fighting battles on two fronts.

Pillai was also at the forefront of operations tackling cases of H1N1 in 2009 at the infectious diseases section in Naidu hospital, and with her vast experience, she is once again at the current situation with Covid-19 cases.

“I have two daughters. Both are married. But, one daughter has sacrificed her own family, and come to help me at home knowing I spend several hours at the hospital. They know that I must take care of myself. So my daughter has been staying with me since January. She cooks for me and takes care of the house while I am away,” Pillai said.

Pillai said Naidu hospital began getting ready to fight the coronavirus ever since the outbreak in China. The staff had undergone several training sessions on precautions, treatment, handling patients, maintaining their own health, wearing the safety kit to other aspects of the disease.

“We have also experienced H1N1 in 2009. I was head of the OPD even then so although there was a lot of panic outside when the first couple in Pune was diagnosed with Covid-19, we at the hospital were calm as we know exactly how to handle the situation. We do not have any fear in us any more,” she said.

In the initial days, when the first patients were admitted to Naidu hospital, the staff would spend over 12 hours at the hospital getting things right. Now, that it is more streamlined, Pillai said she is able to return home after the eight-hour duty.

“When I come home, I first go to the washroom, take a bath, wash all my clothes then I move around the house. That’s the protocol we must follow. This disease is more dangerous than H1N1. It is spreading like wild fire and all the steps put down by WHO must be followed judiciously,” she added.

At home, Pillai, said she is unable to sleep. “I get constant thoughts of hospital, patients and I keep hoping everything is alright there. Even the eight-hour duty is highly stressful, both mentally and physically.”

Her neighbours and people in the locality are cooperative and check with her about her health and the situation at the hospital. The hospital has provided vehicles to pick and drop the nursing staff so she does not have to worry about commuting, she added.

104,['30/03/2020'],Jaipur: Inmates of Sanganer open jail join fight against pandemic,"Around 60-80 inmates are involve in manufacturing and packing of sanitisers in the jail.

JAIPUR: On usual days, the inmates of Sanganer situated open jail are allowed to go out and work as mechanics, tailors or other random jobs with a condition that they will get back to jail at 6pm. However, during the ongoing lockdown while they were not having their usual jobs, the jail authorities have roped in a private company for which the inmates are manufacturing and packaging 5,000 litres of sanitisers every day. With this initiative, at least 80 inmates with their families are able to earn Rs 350 per day in this tough time as well. Inmates, including convicted prisoners had earlier prepared 4,000 masks.

Sanganer open jail in Jaipur is for prisoners who have a very good conduct. At this jail they are allowed to live with their families in different quarters. They are allowed to move out of jail for various small jobs.

“After lock down was announced, they were sitting idle. Though we have engaged them in some other work, still there was a need to channelise their energy in some work. A private company involved in manufacturing of sanitisers came to us since they witnessed a problem of short staff. So, we asked them to bring their machines and raw materials and provided them our men,” said NRK Reddy , director general of police(Jails).

Also, inmates would be working in shifts and work for 24 hours for this job. 49-year-old Ram Naryan, who is convicted in a murder case and serving life imprisonment, is happy to be into this job. “We too will think that while country is facing a crisis, we are contributing with our ways and means. It is a wonderful idea by authorities,” he said while talking to TOI over phone.

He said that authorities started the work on Friday and will continue. “Everyday, about 60 to 80 inmates are involved in manufacturing and packaging of sanitisers in 100 ml to 500 ml bottles. This has provided us a source of earning,” he added.

The idea to involve the inmates into such kind of work struck into mind of Vikas Kumar, inspector general of police (Jail) when he was asked by an inmate about how can he contribute to the society in this tough time. “It touched me. Apart from sanitisers, we have so far made 40,000 masks. Some of them have been distributed among the inmates and our staff,” Kumar added.

Jail authorities are also mulling over giving manpower to agencies and NGOs who are into distributing grocery items to the poor people. “We are in touch with some agencies. In a day or two our manpower of inmates will also start packing of grocery,” he said.

“We discussed the matter with the vendors. They have some logistic issues. The market will start functioning from Golibar Maidan once those issues are addressed,” Gajbhiye said.

“In this prevailing situation, we had to shut the market and start at the new location with proper earmarking between two vendors. Besides, we will make the necessary arrangement to maintain the required social distancing between vendors and customers,” he said.

Elected board member Priyanka Shirigiri said, “The vendors operating at the Shivaji Market do not pay heed to any instruction or notice issued by the board. The police and the board should take stern action against the violators to send a stern message.”

108,['30/03/2020'],Bootleggers cash in on depleting liquor stocks of confined tipplers,"A closed liquor shop on Lenin Sarani on the fifth day of lockdown

KOLKATA: Depleting liquor stocks at homes have given the bootleggers an opportunity to make a fortune by selling whisky and rum at a huge premium. With more than a fortnight still to go before the lockdown is either lifted or extended further, suggestions have emerged on how to make a restricted availability of liquor for home consumption to not only rein in the risk of adulteration but also resolve the issue of stocks that retailers and clubs have as the excise department’s deadline of March 31 looms large.

As the lockdown in Bengal was initially scheduled till March 27, many consumers had stocked up booze for a week. But with the Centre announcing later the extension of the shutdown till April 14, there was no way consumers could buy and stock up any more. With stocks now getting depleted, a section of regular tipplers has started making frantic calls to retailers, displaying signs of the onset of withdrawal symptom.

“I have been getting calls from almost everyone — the customers whom I know and strangers. The call usually begins with any information as to when the store would open and is followed by a request to purchase a bottle or more on the sly. They even offer huge premium on the MRP. But I have had to turn them down because I don’t want to risk a crackdown,” said US Roy who runs a liquor store in a shopping complex off EM Bypass.

Some people in the city had last purchased liquor on Monday when the shops were open till 5pm. “I was shocked when the PM announced the 21-day lockdown. I have been judiciously consuming one peg and a half in evening. But my friend came to my place one day and we polished off half of the bottle. Now, I am out of stock,” said Gaurav Talukdar , a Parnashree resident and a central government employee.

A bootlegger in Behala has got five youths in his team to step up supply of liquor in keeping with the increasing demand. “Considering the risk I am taking and the bribe I am paying, I am not supplying booze at exorbitant prices,” said the man who is charging Rs 100 to supply bottles.

109,['30/03/2020'],NMC brings 35 contacts of 14th positive person for tests,"Nagpur: Immediately after learning about the 14th Covid-19 positive patient in city, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) launched a containment drive in his residential society, and brought 35 people, including family members and close contacts, for testing.

The NMC team led by additional medical health officer Dr Praveen Gantawar rushed to the society near Gandhisagar Lake. “The patient resides with wife, son and daughter. We got list of close contacts from the person and family members, and brought others too in for testing. This is very essential for controlling further spread of Covid-19,” he said.

As per information available from the NMC team and other flat owners in the society, the person is a lawyer and income tax consultant. His son is studying in a residential school run by Iskcon at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh. The person, his wife and daughter had gone to Vrindavan on March 15.

They offered services at Iskcon Temple , which is visited by a large number of people, including foreigners. They returned with their son on March 18, travelling in the Telangana Express, the same train in which the Khamla businessman and his manager, who too later tested positive, returned to the city from New Delhi. However, this person and his family were in 3rd AC compartment while the Khamla businessman and manager were in sleeper class.

The boarding station of the family could not be exactly confirmed. One of the flat owners in the society said they might have boarded from New Delhi while NMC team members said they took the train from Mathura.

The patient also runs an office from his flat. Two assistants and one office boy work there, and the family also has a housemaid.

Gantawar said, “The patient is a member of Iskcon and used to regularly take part in activities at the Iskcon Temple in his society. Therefore, we identified other members of Iskcon and brought them too for testing.”

The patient’s parents reside at Kamptee. NMC is planning to bring them too for testing on Monday.

NMC has conducted door-to-door containment drive in the society with 80 flats on Friday and Saturday. The person had gone to Mayo Hospital for testing, probably after getting guidance from the NMC team.

After tests of 42 persons, NMC has stopped identifying more contacts of the Khamla businessman, his three family members and manager, with a containment drive in 3km radius of Khamla.

On Sunday, two staffers of the businessman were picked up from Khamla and admitted in MLA Hostel Quarantine Center. They had tested negative on Friday, so had returned home. However, the latest orders of collector Ravindra Thakre says all suspected cases have to stay in quarantine centre.

At Jaripatka, NMC had sent 16 persons, including family members and friends of staffers of the Khamla businessman, for testing on Sunday. The staffer has tested positive. Reports of three others are awaited.

NMC has come to know about another six persons who were in constant touch with the staffer. The NMC’s containment drive has started to trace these six persons, and they will be brought in for testing on Monday.

Also, the civic body launched the containment drive in 3km radius of Jaripatka.

110,['30/03/2020'],Families huddle to ‘quaran-binge’ on old TV shows,"Prayagraj: They say history has a way of repeating itself. The words couldn’t be truer in Prayagraj resident Vinay Mehrotra’s case. He has fond memories of being hooked to the television while watching shows like Ramayana and Mahabharata on Doordarshan as a child back in the 1980s.

Now 45, Mehrotra is reliving those days as he sits down to watch the same shows this time with his children. Following the announcement of the 21-day lockdown to arrest the spread of the novel coronavirus contagion, Prasar Bharti decided to re-telecast many of its popular shows including Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Shahrukh Khan-starrer Fauji, almost 25 years after they first aired on Doordarshan.

Forced to stay indoors, residents are using the time to bond with their families by watching these iconic shows together.

“These shows were a part of our lives. I am delighted to watch them again with my family,” Mehrotra said.

Lukerganj resident Rajul Bhargava said, “It feels good to relive those days. Arun Govil and Deepika Chikhalia, who played Ram and Sita in the drama, became household names after the show.”

“Watching these re-runs is a great way to keep the monotony of staying at home during the lockdown,” he added.

Ramayana first aired on Doordarshan in 1987.

For many like Meerapur resident Anil Kumar Mishra, it is a flashback to the time when television was still a luxury.

“We used to live in Old City in the 80s and our family was the one of the few which owned a television set. More than two dozen people used to gather in our home every Sunday morning to watch these shows,” Mishra said.

The 46-year-old’s wife Manorama said her children, now aged 22 and 18, were familiar with stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata thanks to these shows.

Civil Lines resident Kunal Sharma beleives the lockdown has given families a reason to spend more time together. “Otherwise, most of us are too busy to just sit back and relax with our near and dear ones.”

Then there are many others who are using the free time to explore fun-filled activities.

Be it trying out new hobbies or working on creative projects together, Prayagraj residents are all for using this time constructively.

Old city resident Pankaj Singh said that he is utilising the time by reading books penned by his favourite authors.

Aditi Pandey, a teacher by profession, said, “We are living in difficult times and therefore must follow the state government’s advice to stay indoors. We should the use time to bond with our family members in the best way possible.”

He made free door-to-door supply of vegetables worth Rs 15,000, of which a portion was grown on his own farm.Acknowledging that the preventive lockdown has affected lives of daily wage labourers, Moorthy said he was attempting to compensate their losses by providing them essentials free-of-cost.People have been thanking Moorthy for this gesture as it will save them some money to manage during the lockdown.“On the one hand Moorthy has been saving us from the possibility of getting infected with Covid-19 by bringing to us vegetables and on the other hand helping us save some money to manage several weeks of lockdown that we are likely to face,” said S Mahendran, a resident from Bose Nagar.Moorthy said that it was this section of people who need utmost care during such a crisis as they depend on daily wages to run their families.Saying that he would continue to help them in the coming days, he also took it as an opportunity to propagate organic farming to the people.He brings around eight types of vegetables from the wholesale market apart from onion, tomato and garlic which are essential. He also brings snake gourd grown on his farm.Moorthy who was running a restaurant in Pudukottai town for 20 years took to organic farming five years ago after a snake gourd curry prepared in his hotel went sour which made him realise the effect of chemical fertilisers used to raise vegetables. He then started raising vegetables in his farm through organic farming techniques. Now there are about 20 farmers who have adopted organic farming after abandoning chemical fertilisers.",trichy,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74884139,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-707684,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/farmer-supplies-veggies-to-families-free-of-cost/articleshow/74879632.cms

TRICHY: A 65-year-old banana farmer from Kuzhumani village, who consumed pesticide four days ago distressed by crop loss, died at the Mahatma Gandhi Medical College Hospital on Saturday night.

Family members of K Periyasamy of Mela Kuzhumani said he resorted to the extreme step as he could not harvest Nendran banana cultivated on half an acre of leased land following the nationwide lockdown. He had raised Ela Arisi banana on his one acre and Nendran on the half acre.

Periyasamy was upset that he could not harvest and sell his crop and it had started to ripen on the tree itself. He was found consuming pesticide at his house on March 25 and was rushed to MGMGH where he died on Saturday. Deputy superintendent of police Jeeyapuram C Kokila told TOI that the loss sustained in banana cultivation had caused some domestic issues. Jeeyapuram police registered a case under 174 IPC based on a complaint from his family members. He is survived by his wife P Krishnammal, a daughter and son.

TOI had reported how the fall in demand for Nendran in Kerala had hit Trichy farmers hard leading to a crash in the price of the variety to about Rs 10 to 15 a kg. The outbreak of Covid-19 dealt a huge blow to the distressed farmers as it halted the transport of the entire consignment of Nendran to Kerala. The 21-day lockdown only made matters worse. Farmers’ leaders have appealed to the state government to compensate the victim’s family appropriately

Sawant said that the supply chain of essential commodities may have been affected because of fear in the minds of distributors and retailers to send their vehicles to get the stock, as police may stop them.

He warned wholesalers that action would be initiated against them if they do not open their godowns to maintain the supply chain.

Sawant also said action would be taken against traders who try to increase the prices of essential commodities and vegetables.

Food delivery apps can only deliver prepared food, and not essential commodities, he clarified. He also said that the state government has started a ‘food bus’ to supply food to the needy.

“There are some villages that have blocked the roads leading to their villages to keep people out. They should not do it,” he said.

He also said that 2.5 lakh labourers wanted to cross the state borders and leave, but that the government has made the necessary arrangements to keep them in the state. Sawant also said that three people entered the state using a letter from the embassy, but were asked to leave soon after.

Sawant said the state has appointed the excise commissioner as nodal officer and foreigners in distress should contact him for evacuation.

Most colonies have banned entry of outsiders — other than essential services — and are ensuring that those who enter wash their hands with soap before coming inside. The security guards have been provided masks, sanitisers and hand wash and advised to wash their hands every hour. Treasurer of Fortune Estate Phase-2 CB Churiya said, “There is a notice board on the colony gate where we have written that all outsiders, even relatives and friends of the residents have been banned to enter amid the corona scare. The guard has also been instructed to not let people go out until it is a real emergency. We have made a special request to the residents to not go out for groceries every day and stock things for the next two weeks.”

Harish Kumar, of Uma Enclave, Kolar added, “Ours is a very small colony with only 30 families. So, we have kept a bucket of water at the gate and clearly told the guard to make residents wash their hands before entering the colony and wash their clothes as soon as they enter the house, before greeting the children.”

Many colonies have also formed committees to ensure proper supply of water and other necessary items in absence of the colony management staff. “I live in the new residential colony developed by the BDA in Katara Hills. As we understand that there is a shortage of the management staff, we have formed teams to ensure that if in case the staff doesn’t come, we know how to turn on the water supply for the buildings so that people don't face problems. We will also form an emergency fund in case we find the virus has affected some residents,” said Bhagwan Singh, member of the committee of Gaurishankar Parisar.

Ravi Galkate, resident of Fortune estate, Trilanga said that all the members of the locality have been asked to stay indoors and skip their morning and evening walks to ensure that the lockdown is followed properly.

NEW DELHI: Delhi government will begin online classes for around 1.4 lakh Class XII students to compensate for the classes curtailed by the Covid-19 lockdown. Students from nursery to Class VIII will, however, be promoted to the next class without sitting for exams under the no detention policy of the Right to Education Act.

These announcements were made by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister and education minister Manish Sisodia on Monday. Sisodia said, “The main decision we have taken is for Class XII students appearing for the board exam next year. We will start online classes for them with two subjects per day. The students will be provided with a link through SMS. They will have to register for the class.”

An education department official explained, “Teachers who teach the main Class XII subjects have been shortlisted. They are being given orientation on how the online classes are to be conducted.” The online facility is on the lines of a Zoom app session and a private firm has been consulted for holding these classes. The state government will provide the students money to purchase internet data packs.

“The online classes will begin from the first week of April,” said Sisodia. “Later, we will start similar classes for Class X students. For Class IX, we are discussing the format with CBSE.”

Students can post their query in a chat box for teachers to answer them in the next class. Even though the eight lakh students from nursery to Class VIII will be given promotion, there will still be continuous assessment for Delhi government, aided and municipal corporation schools.

Sisodia said, “The exams were first hit by the riots and now the coronavirus pandemic. This is the reason why we are promoting them. But the students will have to study with the help of parents and technology. We will send them basic activities through SMS and IVR, one activity per day. This will be in the form of a project and will have to be submitted once the school reopens. Internal assessment will be based on their work.”

117,['30/03/2020'],When police fed hungry migrant labourers in Jaipur,"JAIPUR: Amidst the long march of migrant workers from various states passing through the state capital, a police jeep comes to an abrupt halt just below the flyover at Transport Nagar junction around 2.30pm on Sunday.

There were three policemen in the front — two constables and an officer. For a couple of minutes nobody got down just as flying patrol teams do — just watch and leave. Soon, the officer comes out followed by the constables including the driver. They open the rear door of the vehicle. Inside, there are at least 500 food packets. With hordes of people passing by, circle inspector Gayasuddin Khan shouts out to people to collect the packets. In five minutes, the food is gone.

“For the last two days, a lot of organisations, especially trade bodies, are dropping food packets in the police station for distribution. Since movement is restricted, they are coming to the thana and requesting us to distribute the packets,” Gayasuddin said. “Since morning, we have distributed over 2,500 food packets among migrant workers. A few of them hadn’t had any food since yesterday night. It feels good to help them,” he said.

The officer said a number of traders’ bodies were also distributing food packets in their localities. “To ensure that there is no chaos while distributing, we are deploying a couple of constables there,” he added. In addition to giving food packets away, the constables were also helping the labourers to board buses going to various destinations.

“I am from Agra and want to know where I will get a bus,” asked Praveen Sharma , a construction worker from Sikar to the constable. “Please stand here for a while. The state government is operating a number of buses. You will surely get one,” the constable, who refused to be identified, said.

Gayasuddin expressed fear that with most people not wearing masks, one infected person could wreak havoc in the days to come. “They aren’t lucky like us. Most of them don’t have masks. All they can do is to cover their faces with towels and handkerchiefs. But since they are walking for miles, the heat is preventing them from covering their faces,” Gayasuddin said.

118,['30/03/2020'],Old hobbies become survival mantra for many during lockdown,"Bandana Bhattacharya

Surat: The nationwide 21-day lockdown to contain spread of COVID-19 has made some people feel as if they are under house arrest. However, it has also provided an opportunity to many others to revisit old hobbies and undertake health pursuits which were not possible earlier for them due to their busy schedules.

Spending quality time with family

For diamond baron, Hitesh Patel, the lockdown has come as a blessing in disguise. His busy schedule at the diamond company and frequent travelling kept him away from enjoying family life, which he is trying to live during the lockdown. “I was yearning to stay home with my family. The lockdown has given me a golden opportunity to fulfil my dreams. I keep myself engaged reading Bhagavad Gita, playing board games with my kids and doing a bit of gardening in our bungalow,” Patel said.

“Every evening, all the family members gather in our garden and sing bhajans and do aarti after offering special prayers to the almighty for the well-being of people in our nation,” he added.

Back to reading and cooking

Bandana Bhattacharya, renowned fashion designer, was not getting time from her busy schedule to read books and cook food for her children at home. Though she is very much concerned about the spread of COVID-19, lockdown has given her an opportunity to be at home with her children and husband. “Our cook is on leave, so I am preparing delicious dishes for my children, including traditional Bengali dishes,” Bandana said. “I was not getting time to even read books, which I am doing now staying at home,” she added.

Bonding with children over games and dance

Sanat Relia, hotelier, was missing an emotional connect with his grandchildren due to his busy schedule managing his three hotels in the city. But, lockdown has come as a blessing in disguise for him.

“My grandchildren were not much attached to me as I was unable to spend time at home. As I remain at home during lockdown, they now have an emotional bonding with me. Now they play indoor games and dance with me. They have found a new friend in me. In the evening, all the family members gather at the dinner table, which we missed since long, and enjoy the delicious meals,” he said.

Keeping healthy and cooking for the needy

Pramod Choudhary, textile entrepreneur, sees an opportunity in lockdown to keep himself healthy with exercise and Yoga. “We all are passing from the toughest phase of our lives where we don’t know what is going to happen in next few days. So, I am practising Yoga, meditation and doing gardening to keep myself fit. In the evening, we cook food for about 60 poor people living on the footpath near my residence,” he said.

The group expanded its horizon to offer services in education, child welfare, waste management, disaster relief and other social causes. At present, the group is holding Facebook live sessions daily to help those stranded by coronavirus and will launch an app soon

Nagpur: In 2012, the brutal Nirbhaya gang rape shook the country’s soul. While protest marches demanding justice for Nirbhaya were happening across the country, Nagpur’s poor protest culture hit the consciousness of a young city boy.Nakul Agrawal, then 21, felt the need to show support to the victim. Two weeks after the incident, Nakul decided to organize a march in the city. The news spread like wildfire. He managed to bring together thousands of people to show solidarity with the victim.This was when he realized that Nagpur, too, “stood for good.” Tells Nakul, “After the rally, I realized that citizens wish to do good; all they need is a platform through which they can do so as not everyone has the vision to initiate things.”With this understanding, Nakul went ahead to form the NGO ‘ Renovatio ’ which is a Latin word for renewal, restoration and rebirth.Initially, the young group started by teaching children in municipal schools, orphanages and slums. “We focused on holistic education by teaching them mathematics, science and English experientially, along with meditation, yoga, dance and arts. We also created libraries and playrooms in some schools and shelter homes,” says Sonal Hikare , who manages the outreach of Renovatio.Simultaneously, the group organized numerous awareness and educational campaigns in the city. These included Ecycle your Ewaste, No Honking, Helmet and Road Safety Awareness, Project Muskaan for rescuing child labourers & beggars, waste collecting mobilizing campaign, RenoYoga, sanitary napkins’ usage and disposal etc.The young lot also conducted ‘Share the Spare’ drive across the city in which they would collect clothes, toys, books, food grains, medicines and send them to disaster affected areas.Under its project ‘RenoCare’, the organization distributed resources to other organizations like Goonj, and Baba Amte’s Anandwan. “We also extended the project to the city slums wherein we would attract slum dwellers by giving them the required resources and then educate them about several important aspects like education for children, sexual abuse, menstrual hygiene,” says Manpreet, a volunteer who conducts informative sessions for children and women.The NGO is also part of the national initiative ‘Alliance for Rivers’ which is trying to save the water bodies in the country.The organization has now expanded its operations to five cities. And all this, without raising any funds or asking for donations. “I used to work and whatever money I would make, I utilized it to run the organization,” says Nakul who has studied chartered accountancy.Since last three years, core members of the organization are conducting sessions on spirituality and meditation for thousands of people across the country including the paramilitary forces and prisoners in Central Jail. “Every day, we try to answer people’s questions through social media and motivate them. We have managed to save some people from committing suicide,” says Abhishek Jaiswal, who manages back end operations.At present, the group is holding Facebook live sessions daily to help those stranded by coronavirus. “We are also working on a mobile application named ‘Somebody’ which will be launched within a week. This wellness app will encourage people to help themselves mentally and physically as well as others during the lockdown,” says Sagar Zodape, who is in-charge of Renovatio’s technical and marketing work.The young group envisages to reach a million people in three years. “We want to help them become physically healthy, mentally more aware, compassionate towards others, and responsible members of the society. A very important yet missing piece of the current education system is that a person is taught about the world outside but nothing about the inside, despite the fact that it’s the inside of a person which determines the quality of life. We want to empower people live a happier, meaningful and beautiful life,” adds Nakul.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74879692,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/renovatio-leading-social-renewal-through-service/articleshow/74879693.cms

The arrangement for sending these students back home in different districts of the state was made by the local authorities.

These students were stuck up in hostel rooms due to lockdown and were a troubled lot since they had exhausted their money and also their coaching centres had temporarily closed down. Authorities said some 450 students were sent back home to districts like Gorakhpur, Ambedkar Nagar.

Kakadeo area is also called ‘Coaching Mandi’ and houses thousands of coaching centres where students take classes for various competitive exams such as IIT-JEE, NEET among others. Such students stay in private hostels in this area.

The students were thermally screened in the presence of district officials and were made to board buses that were parked in the area.

This was also done to reduce the human presence from an already packed and crowded Kakadeo area where coaching centres these days are closed due to the ongoing lockdown. The students were also facing difficulties such as no delivery of food, all eating joints were closed and that they were simply locked in the hostel rooms, officials told TOI.

The students were provided with snacks and water by the authorities which made them shower praise on the officials.

A student waiting to board the bus told TOI that his parents were worried for him and wanted him to come back home but he was unable to go due to lockdown. He said that he was happy that the authorities were sending students like him home.

Other students also had happiness on their face since they were going home. Students also praised arrangements such as snacks and water provided to them.

Station House Officer, Kakadeo, KK Dixit said, “About 450 students, after proper thermal screening, were allowed to leave for their respective cities.”

He said that the students staying in private hostels in Kakadeo were stuck up and were getting worried. Therefore, they were on Sunday allowed to proceed to their native place such as Mirzapur, Gorakhpur, Balia, Ambedkar Nagar, Lucknow, Unnao, etc.

Some of the residents over phone urged him to organize something for them, while still following the social distance norms.“I have been singing since my school and college days and have been brought up in an era where we had singers like Mukeshji, Kishoreda and Rafi saab. So, last evening, all of us sang together. In these times when people are being inundated with negative messages on social networking sites and everyone is scared of Covid-19, my singing will hopefully work as an anti-depressant,” Saraogi said.Like him, Kavi Sharma, another resident of the colony and an automobile dealer, plays the guitar and sings. “This lockdown is inevitable. Thus, rather than complaining we should make certain adjustments in life,” Kavi said.What is more satisfying and relieving for the people here is the fact that they are getting dairy products, bakery items like breads, vegetables, fruits and milk at a reasonable price. “Our resident welfare association tied up with a wholesale vegetable seller of Mohana Mandi, a dairy and a wholesaler of grocery. Every night, we get a list of items to be sold on moving vehicles with their prices. You are supposed to keep the exact amount of money for the items you are willing to purchase.

During the lockdown period, movment of migrant labourers has become a cause of concern for the district administration. The district magistrate and SSP Anant Deo both visited the bus station and reviewed the situation. The DM said that migrant labourers were being stopped at the district border where medical teams are examining them.

“We are not stopping people going out to get their essential items. But if a person is found roaming around unnecessarily, action will be taken against him or her,” Deshmukh said.

“A section of the citizens was not understanding the gravity of the situation. The should stay home. The state government has taken several measures to ensure that farm produce and grocery items are delivered at one’s doorstep,” he said.

Amid reports of migrant workers moving towards the state’s borders, the minister said all state and inter-district borders have been sealed. “The district administration has been asked to provide them with shelter and food. We will not allow any movement of people across the borders,” he said.

One such patient Aqueel Ahmed, who has to undergo dialysis three times a week, said ""There was just one technician to look after 11 of us who were put on dialysis in the first session Dialysis is a delicate process and requires attention till the patient is on the dialysis machine. How do you expect one technician to take care of 11 patients at one time particularly when nursing staff and ward boys in attendance were inexperienced and knew little about dialysis.""

He apprehends that unlike BMHRC , which remains clean and hygienic, Kamla Nehru Hospital is ""dirty"" and “people like us, who have low immunity, may contract an infection anytime.”

Urvashi Pathak, who accompanies her mother Vidya Pathak for dialysis for the past 12 years, said, ""There used to be two to three technicians at the time of dialysis of patients at BMHRC and even ward boys were highly trained but here if the machine started to beep in warning, the nursing staff and ward boys had no clue as to how to put it on mute. She also complained of unhygienic conditions in the ward, where dialysis was carried out.

When contacted for comments, director of Kamla Nehru Hospital, Dr M A Khurram said, “After 31 patients registered for dialysis at BMHRC were transferred to Kamla Nehru Hospital, the number. of patients for dialysis have doubled at our hospital. It will have its impact. They have sent us two dialysis machines, but when we asked for technicians they refused on the pretext that they may need them for COVID-19 patients.""

On Monday, a Candolim resident who had gone to the Nerul petrol pump for fuel was turned away. “Do you have the government pass?” the attendant asked him. When the customer replied in the negative, the attendant declined to give him fuel. The petrol pump had put barricades at the entrance with dozens of locals outside waiting hopefully for fuel.

On Sunday, another resident who rode to the petrol pump at Calangute on Chogm road found the pump closed. To make matters worse, his fuel also ran out as he was returning, and had to park his two-wheeler by the roadside and walk back home.

Meanwhile, Quepem deputy collector Rohit Kadam on Saturday ordered all fuel pumps within his jurisdiction to refuel vehicles belonging to government or local bodies and those holding valid transit passes, prohibiting private vehicles.

But when TOI contacted Kadam, he confirmed that he received instructions from higher authorities to withdraw the order. However, the lone petrol pump in the town was shut on Sunday, with the earlier notice still prominently displayed.

On Sunday morning, Vidya Reddy, a resident of EVK Sampath road in Vepery, sought assistance from the civic body to repair a motor pump at her residence and within 10 minutes a plumber was sent to her home by officials of the Royapuram zone.

""I have two elderly people who are in their nineties. On Saturday, the pump had stopped working.

So I called up the numbers flashed by the corporation,"" said Reddy, appreciating the prompt response from the civic body.

The plumber worked for three hours and repaired the motor.

Royapuram zonal officer R Manoharan told TOI that they have skilled workers ready in all divisions and units to help residents. ""We have a few workers to carry out our jobs and also we have contacts of those who do jobs for us from time to time. Since our workers carry ID cards, police will not stop them,"" Manoharan said.

According to Manoharan, some residents called up the zonal office or the helpline seeking assistance with buying medicines and the corporation staff were immediately pressed into service.

""The residents can pay the workers directly for their services and the rates are for the work carried out. We see to it that the residents are not overcharged,"" another official said.

It was flexible towards providing them with buses by increasing the present daily fleet.

Employees of some hospitals, who have to come to duty each day considering the Covid-19 spread, have complained that they have to wait for a long time for buses. A senior PMPML official said daily schedule of the transport body had been prepared after consulting the authorities.

“At present, the PMPML is plying 87 buses across 51 routes. The service starts at 6am and continues till 10pm. A proper schedule has been prepared and it is made clear that the buses will be available at one-hour intervals. However, the PMPML is always flexible and can tweak the schedule according to the demand,” PMPML’s joint managing director Ajay Charthankar said.

Earlier, the PMPML authorities had said the number of buses running on a daily basis for essential services might be increased.

A senior official working at a hospital said many nurses had complained about having to wait for long for buses. “They have been allowed to report late to duty as it is known that they have to travel and public transportation is scarce. The staff is already overworked and the waiting time adds to the frustration,” the official said.

“We too are working under tough conditions. It is not possible to ensure all get buses on time,” a PMPML official said.

Charthankar said any private firm providing essential services and in need of buses for their staff were free to contact the PMPML. “They can call on the helpline numbers — 020-24545454, 020-24503211, 020-24503223.

South Goa district magistrate Ajit Roy told TOI on Sunday that arrangements have been made in every taluka to arrange for shelter and food to all those who have been stranded in the district, particularly the labourers from other states.

“Self help groups have been roped in to run the community kitchens. On Sunday, food was cooked for and supplied to around 2,500 people stranded in migrant labour camps across South Goa,” Roy said.

The largest number of migrant labourers is in Ponda taluka with approximately 900 people, followed by Salcete with around 600. Canacona and Dharbandora talukas each have 400 migrant labourers , while Vasco has 200, data obtained from the district administration revealed.

In view of the lockdown situation, migrant labourers as well as migrant roadside vendors have been left without their daily earnings, which was their sole source of livelihood. As they are unable to go back to their native places, their plight is deplorable. A group of street vendors camping at the SGPDA ground, Margao, who would sell their wares at temple and church fairs, had to go without food and water for two days until a good samaritan brought their plight to the notice of the district administration, which then made arrangements for their food and shelter.

The district administration, Roy said, also responded to distress calls made for food and essential commodities from various locations. “There were calls from people staying in large groups at some places where they were unable to get any food supplies. Also, there were calls from individual houses which had run out of food stocks and couldn’t purchase essential commodities. We made arrangements to supply food to all of them,” Roy said.

When pointed out that people have been unable to get their essentials at various places as grocery shops failed to open or were forced to close down by police after people crowded the shops, Roy said, “All shops are open and it is up to these shops to do home delivery of the goods. People are free to go to the shops and purchase the items or opt for home delivery service.”

“Police have been instructed not to force any shop to shut down. The shops have to be kept open. There has not been a single case where shops have been ordered to shut down,” Roy said.

Since the curfew was clamped in the area following a Covid-19 positive case, those who are helping them with food and water are finding it difficult to feed them.

Rafiq Qadri, a volunteer who is providing food to over 1,400 pilgrims, said it’s been a week that they are providing food due to generous donations from people. “It will be really difficult to run the food programme for long. After some days, we have to focus on the local poor families and with limited resources, we won’t be able to feed both the sections,” said Qadri.

These pilgrims came to Ajmer a few days before the lockdown and got stuck due to cancellation of trains and buses. Out of them, 300 are from Hyderabad and 300 are from Maharashtra , Gujarat, Karnataka and Kerala .

“I have come with 40 members including children and women. Without proper arrangement, we cannot travel. I have appealed to our CM K Chandrashekar Rao to help us return to our state,” said Hafiz Ur Rehman , a devotee from Hyderabad.

140,['30/03/2020'],"Beware, cyber cheats may cash in on virus fear","Indore: Covid-19 has now given a new avenue for cybercriminals, who are trying to cash in on the fear that people have regarding the pandemic.

Several fraudulent websites and e-commerce platforms have mushroomed on the internet, promising to sell medicines that could either prevent or cure Covid-19. Not only this, fraudsters are using this opportunity to dupe people by promising to send vegetable and grocery items at their doorsteps.

Renuka Bundela, 40, a resident of Dhar district faced problems while donating funds to the website created by the PM. “I am glad that I checked before donating Rs 10,000 of my hard-earned money. Someone had created a fake link similar to the one where people are donating money for PM funds,” said Bundela.

She said that the fake link was ‘PM care’ and had the name of the accused in the registered name column. However, the real one was PM cares with registered name also PM cares.

Cyber cell SP Jitendra Singh said that such things are often not seen by the users and in the current scenario when almost everyone is working from home and using online means for all the transactions, it is must to be aware and safe.

“Cybercriminals are also taking advantage of the current situation. Non technical staff while working from home should take care of the confidentiality of valuable transactions and sensitive financial documents,” he said.

SP added that almost all the crimes like UPI fraud, frauds on e-commerce websites and insurance frauds have picked pace in the past few weeks. Online predators are active and are taking advantage of the increasing amount of time that people spend online due to new measures taken by government to stop the spread of the virus.

SP said that the attackers are also using Covid-19-themed malware, social engineering and phishing messages that include links leading to malicious sites or have attached Microsoft Office documents with malicious macros designed to download and execute malware on a victim’s system.

Some of these messages appear to come from the World Health Organization or US Center for Disease Control, exploiting individuals’ obvious need to know more about the pandemic.

KMC , Act Now — this is the slogan for an online petition seeking ban against spitting in the open and stringent action against the offenders. The campaign, using the image of the famous Philadelphia street car with a poster reading “spitting spreads death”, asks Kolkatans to join the fight against the coronavirus menace.Addressed to the Kolkata mayor, the petition has already more than 140 signatories. “We want to make it 200 and then approach the authorities concerned to start cracking down on the people spitting in public . An ordinance could be promulgated to amend the existing laws,” said writer-activist and Ballygunge Garden resident Aditi Roy Ghatak, who initiated the campaign on Saturday.The petitioners want hectic campaigns by KMC so that markets, street tea stalls, public vehicles, local trains, bus stops could be saturated with anti-spitting posters, followed by police action and hefty fine to be imposed on violators. Banani Kakkar of PUBLIC (People United for Better Living in Calcutta), said, “The campaign to stop spitting in public could produce excellent collateral damage in reverse as one of the best by-products of the Covid-19 pandemic.”Her husband and fellow green activist Pradip Kakkar said, “Spitting has always been considered an unhygienic public behaviour because it could spread infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. So, offenders should not only be spot-fined but identified as agents of spreading the disease, even after coronavirus menace is over.” Banani added, “Let’s not let up on it. This is the time to act.” The petition reads: “The coronavirus pandemic has once again focused on the spread of communicable disease through public spitting. Many countries have taken serious measures to ban spitting and penalize the offenders. It’s high time for KMC to take measures that will make people aware of the health hazards posed by spitting. The poster from the 1918 Philadelphia anti-spitting campaign tells it all, referring to the ‘spitting spreads death’ parade 102 years ago amid the influenza pandemic that killed 20,000 Philadelphians.”Ghatak said that the civic body should seek powers within the existing Acts and prescribe regulations to address the spitting act and amend the Epidemic Disease Act 1897 for ensuring safety from not only the current pandemic but also from TB, hepatitis, viral meningitis and other diseases that are spread through saliva.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/look-before-you-spit-warn-s-kol-citizens/articleshow/74880045.cms

In a similar vein, Pilibhit superintendent of police Abhishek Dixit on Sunday launched a ‘koi bhi bhukha na rahe’ plan, including stray cattle and street dogs, besides the poor people.

Women’s police station in charge inspector Jyoti Singh said when entire police department was taking different measures to ensure food to the needy and the poor, they also decided to start preparing food for the people in need. Their effort even won the plaudits of inspector general (Moradabad range) Ramit Sharma. “All police personnel are doing exceptional job by going beyond their duty. They will be felicitated once the pandemic situation is controlled,” said the IG.

When inspector Singh shared the idea of starting a community kitchen at the station house, her colleagues sub-inspector Poonam Rathi and constables Mahima, Kamlesh Kumari, Ruby, Nisha, Bheem Priya, Geeta and Rajvari took no time in joining hands and took up theresponsibility for preparing food.

“Till afternoon, we made more than 150 packets of poori and subzi (vegetable) ready for the distribution. We will continue the kitchen until the things get normal,” said Rathi.

In Pilibhit, the SP ordered the Assam road police outpost of Sungarhi police station to open a “police kitchen” to feed the stranded labourers on way to their home via Pilibhit.

“Officer in charge of Assam road police outpost Achal Kumar has been assigned a special duty of handling the kitchen. As the police post is situated at the crossing that connects the roads leading to three adjoining districts, nearly 835 migrant labourers returning home through Pilibhit were offered food, masks and sanitiser. To the best of our capability, we even arranged vehicles for most of them for their onward journey,” said Dixit.

Dixit also fed street dogs and stray cattle at different places in Pilibhit city on Saturday night.Besides these, the SP also made arrangements for packets of cooked food to be distributed among needy and hungry people.

According to the SP, in the past 24 hours, nearly 870 labourers — 835 persons belonged to Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and Kheri districts while the remaining 35 to Pilibhit — returned to their native place via Pilibhit on foot from several districts of Uttarakhand, including Pithoragarh, Champawat and Udham Singh Nagar.

“The labourers coming to Pilibhit have been quarantined for 14 days, while lists of labourers have been sent to district authorities of the other three districts so that they could make arrangement for quarantining the returning labourers,” he explained.

PUNE: RESQ Charitable Trust rescued two dogs — a labrador and a golden retriever — and buried a pug on Sunday after being notified that their owner had fled from his house in Wagholi in early March.

Neha Panchamiya, managing committee member of Pune District SPCA and founder and president of RESQ Charitable Trust told TOI, “Covid-19 did not do this, but unspeakable human negligence did. The RESQ team received a call on Sunday morning about three dogs abandoned in a house in a society in Wagholi. The person who reported the incident told us that no one had been in the house for many days. I informed my seniors at the Pune District SPCA, the member secretary and district collector Naval Kishore Ram, who put me in touch with the superintendent of police, who gave us permission to enter and rescue the animals,” said Panchamiya.

The man had fled following the Covid-19 spread in Pune, said officials. When officials entered the house they found that the pug had died of starvation and dehydration, while the other two pets were severely emaciated.

Officials said the stranded labrador had a water jar stuck around its neck when it was found. They suspect the dog must have nosed into the jar in search of water.

Panchamiya said suitable action would be taken against the owner of these animals once s/he returns.

The labrador and the golden retriever have been medically examined for dehydration, tick fever and other underlying illnesses. They have been bathed, cleaned and fed and are currently safe at the RESQ Centre in Bavdhan.

SPCA’s message to public

You cannot contract Covid-19 from animals. If you notice abandoned animals in someone’s house without anyone coming to feed/clean them even once a day, please inform the Pune District SPCA (www.districtspca.com) or RESQ on 9890999111.

A man asked for hot ‘somasas’ and sauce to be delivered at his home. It was not for the first time that such an unusual demand was made over the helpline number meant to serve the needy during the ongoing lockdown.

A day earlier, a caller wanted pizza to be delivered at his home.

Perturbed by such calls, Rampur district magistrate (DM) Aunjaneya Kumar Singh decided to “shame” such people in public. The caller from Rampur’s Swar tehsil was caught and made to clean drain and sweep the road on Sunday evening in his area.

“We are receiving several calls on our helpline number in which people are asking for pizza and 'samosas'. So, now we have started ‘publicly shaming’ such people to discourage others who are making fun of this pandemic.”

According to officials, several people who don’t even fall in the BPL category, are calling up the helpline asking for cooked food. The DM also tweeted photos of people who made such calls recently.

“I have tweeted the pictures of those who had already received the ration from the authorities and now are demanding prepared food. One such person in Swar was made to clean a drain and sweep the road of his locality as punishment,” the DM said.

“Cooked food is being delivered to the needy families and to senior citizens. One pregnant government teacher called the helpline and asked for the food, and she got it immediately,” he added.

According to corporation officials, efforts are on to deploy at least 1,000 vegetable and fruit carts from prominent vegetable markets such as Delapir, Kotwali, Quila, and others for the purpose. The carts will be moving through various localities, ensuring that people buy vegetables and fruits at their doorsteps and don’t go to the market.

Speaking to TOI, Bareilly municipal commissioner Abhishek Anand said, “The district administration and the civic body are working jointly to provide residents vegetables and fruits at their doorsteps by pressing around 1,000 carts into service across the city. We are in talks with sellers at markets such as Delapir, Shyamganj, Quila and Kotwali to provide the service until the lockdown is lifted. Several vendors have already started providing service in a few localities.”

“The move is being taken to curb the movement of people outside, as residents are thronging vegetable markets during the morning hours daily. This needs to be controlled, as it defeats the very purpose of the lockdown. Even as the guidelines for social distancing have been issued, many people are not following it, which can be risky,” added Anand.

BMC officials said the service would be available to people from 9 am onwards.

The civic body authorities have been taking several measures to provide residents the required household products at their doorsteps. Nearly 300 big and small grocery stores have been identified by the nagar nigam across the city to deliver groceries at the doorsteps.

152,['30/03/2020'],Lockdown could have long-lasting impact on fishing industry in Mangaluru,"Representative image

MANGALURU: The forced fishing holiday due to the 21-day lockdown will have a long-lasting impact on the fishing industry which is already dented by lesser catch this year.

With investments already made, extension of the lockdown could end the fishing season . Fishermen fear they will be unable to resume operations this season if the lockdown extended as the industry largely depends on labourers from other states. The region has witnessed a steady influx of migrant labourers from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Bihar and they may not return immediately.

Umesh Karkera Kulai, boat owner and honorary president, Purse Seine Boat Owners Fishermen Association, said, “When compared to the previous year, there is 30% catch reduction this year. Currently, about 3,000 trawlers and purse seine boats have been anchored at the Old Port. Even if the lockdown period ends, fishing activity will depend on the return of labourers,” he said.

Harish Kumar, deputy director (in-charge), fisheries department, said over 40,000 people in Dakshina Kannada are affected due to the lockdown. This includes labourers, boat owners, ice plant workers, marketing, fisherwomen and workers involved in works like net mending and transportation, he said.

Kumar said a report on the impact of the lockdown will be submitted to the government.

The fisheries sector provides livelihood to a large section of economically backward people in the state and contributes to the nutritional security, employment generation and foreign exchange earnings. According to the Marine Fisheries Census, 2010, Karnataka supports a coastal populace of 1,67,429 comprising 30,713 fishermen families.

The marine fishing sector in the state has been turbulent during the last decade due factors such as declining catch, imbalance in economic returns between the sectors and high production targeted innovations in fishing practices.

An opportunity to study the impact

Experts feel that the lockdown will help in the reduction of fishing stress.

Dr Prathibha Rohit, scientist-in-charge, ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Mangaluru Research Centre, said marine fisheries and ancillary activities contribute immensely to socio-economic development. “This unexpected but necessary closure of fishing activities will therefore impact several sectors. This provides an excellent opportunity to study the impact of total closure on fishery as well as on the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. This will also provide better insight to develop appropriate management measures in the future. Though transportation and sales of fishes is included under essential and perishable commodities, the landing and auctioning of fishes is not considered safe at this point of time,” she added.

The closure would also highlight the need for better hygiene at fish landing centres. Large gatherings in harbours are not allowed and the supply chains are badly affected, said Dr Prathibha.

Having to procure rice, flour and vegetables at a much higher price during the ongoing lockdown, it is noteworthy that most tiffin service centres are still not charging extra from the customers and bearing the extra costs from their own pockets and braving the difficulties on their shoulders.

“From March 22 to 24, there was an extreme shortage of flour, rice and lentils in the markets as people began to hoard food items in case of an emergency. In those two days, I had to apologise to my customers for not being able to provide them with food. But, now the situation is comparatively better and though groceries have become more expensive than usual, we are doing all that we can to make sure the supply of tiffin goes unhindered. I also got passes made so that cops don’t bother my tiffin boys”, said Deepak Lodhi, who runs a tiffin service centre near the Bittan Market.

Rajesh Kumar Navalia, who runs a tiffin centre at Saket Nagar area told TOI that most of his customers are students and many have left due to the coronavirus pandemic and he is now only supplying food to a few who stayed behind, without any extra charges.

“There are hardly four students left now, so I am giving them tiffin twice a day. They live in my own locality, so it’s not really that difficult to hand them their food. I have a stock that will last for another two weeks, but since vegetables don’t last long, we have to go out to procure them on a regular basis. Since the number of students has decreased, even though groceries are more expensive these days, it’s not really affecting the budget as of now, said Navalia.

Rachna Singh, who runs a tiffin centre in Old Bhopal said, “As students and most of out-of-town employees have left the city due to the coronavirus scare, we are left with only a handful of customers. I prepare the food at home and since we have no staff to deliver the tiffin because of the lockdown, my husband is delivering them for the time being. It is extremely difficult to manage, but we can’t leave the students hungry, they hardly have any money left. I hope the situation comes under control soon”.

There is no reduction in collection of milk and we have continued our supply to Pune, Mumbai in Maharashtra and to neighbouring states like Karnataka and Goa.”Apate said though the collection remains to be the same, consumption of milk has reduced to a great extent. “We are facing problems in Pune and Mumbai where sale has been reduced by more than 2 lakh litre. The nationwide shutdown has affected the sale as Amruttulya (a tea chain) have shut their shops and they are among our major customers,” he said.“People are not coming out of their homes and most of the retail shops where our milk was being sold have been shut down due to lockdown. This has also resulted in reduction of milk sale ,” he added.Apate said they have found a way to deal with the crisis and reduce losses. “We have a milk processing unit that converts milk into powder. At present the daily capacity of the unit is to convert 5 lakh litre into powder. We are left with a stock of around 3 lakh litre every day which will be processed and converted to milk powder. Once the lockdown is over, we will consider of transporting the milk powder to market. Our aim is that the milk producing farmers should not incur any loss due to the lockdown. Though the milk sale has been reduced, we will not stop collecting milk from the farmers.

With the corona lockdown in place, we are trying to ensure the safety of corporation employees as well as the public, and thus, the process of reading meters has been stopped, because it requires corporation employees to visit a number of houses.

Speaking to TOI on condition of anonymity, some police personnel posted in Salcete said that it is the public who are coming to their rescue providing them with water and refreshment

A large number of police have been positioned at strategic locations since March 25 to curb movement of public to enforce lockdown.

Besides, police are also tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that social distancing is being followed at stores.

Sources said that the department has organised two shifts, from 8am to 2pm and from 2pm to 8pm. The first batch gets to go home for lunch during its break. However, some personnel said it is not possible for some of them to report back even after two hours as they live far away. “We can’t even carry packed lunch as it will not keep for long in the heat,” one policeman said. They work thirteen-hour shifts and these days they do not know when they can go home as they are charted for a longer period.

They said with all the tea stalls or eateries closed they have to go without food or depend on whatever the public provides. Interestingly, at different police locations, sufficient number of water bottles, fruit juices and fruits were seen. Police said that the public sees them standing in the sun and buys stuff for them.

But the availability of labour is going to be a serious issue . Even if I have to employ a threshing machine , we will need several labourers to cut the crops which is going to be very difficult in the coming days,” said Ramzani, a farmer from Udham Singh Nagar district These fresh problems come after the already devastating months of February and March when untimely rains and hailstorms damaged several acres of wheat fields. “The hailstorms in the past two months have already damaged much of the crops but whatever remains now is also under threat if we do not get the labour to harvest it,” Ramzani added.Meanwhile, another farmer from Jhabreda area of Roorkee said that the problem for him is the breakdown and confusion around the supply chain. “We will start harvesting in eight to ten days. The unavailability of labour is an issue because there is a total lockdown in the state and we are not sure if the administration will let people assemble for the harvest. We are also unsure how we will take the total produce to the market,” he said.Government officials meanwhile said that the farmers will be helped to get labourers and also to get the harvested crops to the market. “We will approach the farmers and work out a mechanism to get the crops to markets.

It can cause epilepsy, suicidal tendency, abnormal behaviour, etc., but making doctors prescribe alcohol for it is not the solution. We have treatment and medicines for the same and we will prescribe that. Besides, if doctors start to give certificates then there would be long queues at hospital at a very wrong time,” said Dr Joseph Chacko of KGMOA.Dr C J John, senior consultant psychiatrist with Medical Trust Hospital, Ernakulam, said that those facing withdrawal symptoms should get treatment as early as possible. “Doctors can’t prescribe alcohol, if at all, we could certify that a person has withdrawal symptoms. But whether to give him alcohol or how much to give him is entirely the policy makers’ decision,” said Dr John.Speaking off the record, doctors, however, said that if the government thinks that supplying alcohol to temporarily avoid issues like withdrawal symptoms and to avoid flow of spurious liquor, it would be a fair policy but doctors cannot be asked to write prescriptions for that.Indian Psychiatric Society- Kerala State wrote to the chief minister with a five-point suggestion on dealing with the withdrawal symptoms.

172,['30/03/2020'],"Bhopal: Curfew Wali Mata Mandir locked, but open for prayers","People stopping and offering prayers amid the lockdown,

BHOPAL: In times of Corona curfew, Bhopal’s ‘Curfew Wali Mata Mandir’ continues to provide succour though its gates stay locked. People stop by for a few seconds, keeping one eye open for the cops posted in the vicinity, murmur a prayer and hurry on.

The idol of ‘Curfew Mata’ was established 38 years ago in Peer Gate area during a month-long curfew following riots. Hence the name. It was open even during Bhopal gas tragedy, but is now shut for the first time in memory.

The temple is locked but there’s no stopping the devout. On Sunday, the usual crowd of devotees was replaced by half a dozen policemen, tasked with enforcing curfew in letter and spirit – and with a stick, if need be.

People drove or pedalled by, closing eyes in reverence and sending up a silent prayer, before hurrying on lest the cops begin ‘enforcing’. But here, the cops are lenient, too. Who would stop a prayer in these times?

Those who paused a while longer got a gentle reminder from police to “leave it to Mata and move on”.

“It’s part of my daily routine to pray at the temple, so I continue doing it. The temple is closed to visitors, and we know it’s good this way, seeing the Coronavirus crisis, but something draws me here. I don’t get peace of mind until I see the temple and pay my respects. I’m thankful that I can do this, no matter how briefly,” said devotee Vishal Namdeo, nodding in gratefulness to the cops.

One of the policemen deployed there said there is a steady trickle of devotees, but they all pray for a few seconds and move on. “They come here as if the very sight of the temple reassures them,” he said, adding that only the priest goes inside every morning and evening through a backdoor for the rituals these days.

The temple was established during trying times in the city. Seventy-three-year-old Ramesh Saini, president of the 13-member committee that runs the temple, recalls the day it was set up.

“I was around 35 years old when the temple was built in 1982. It was during Navratri that year that an idol of goddess Durga was established and immersed after nine days. But locals established an idol there and the administration took it away, leading to a dispute. Curfew was imposed but soon people from nearby districts started flocking to the temple though there were arrests every day,” said Saini.

His father Babulal Mali, a Congress leader, was among the founding members of the temple, Saini said.

“Arjun Singh was the chief minister then, and Vijay Singh the Bhopal collector. Seeing the public sentiment, the administration asked us to establish the idol during the curfew. A puja was done at 5am and the idol was established. This gave the temple its name,” said Saini.

The temple has never seen such a time, he said, not even during the Bhopal gas tragedy. “There was no curfew after the tragedy, but roads were deserted for a long time. We still kept the temple open for entire nights so that anyone who needs help can come to us,” he said.

In the past 38 years, curfew was imposed once or twice but the temple never had to shut. “These are extraordinary times, and require extraordinary measures. On March 28, the administration ordered us to shut the temple completely,” said Saini.

“The goddess is watching over us. This is a trying time. It, too, will pass with Mata’s grace,” he said.

173,['30/03/2020'],Village school goes digital in Anand,"A teacher explains maths digitally to the students under lockdown

Vadodara/ Anand: Like all other educational institutions, this school in Anand district too is closed because of the 21 days lockdown. While the state has already announced mass promotion of students from Class I to IX, 200-odd students enrolled with this government primary school are taking their lessons at their homes.

Teachers of Gopalpura primary school are taking their classes through WhatsApp groups. This, they say, is a voluntary initiative to ensure that kids don’t forget what they have learnt in their classrooms. And this initiative has found support from Anand district administration which has started promoting it as a model to educate children when they are away from their schools.

“Initially, this WhatsApp group was meant to share general information about the school schedule, programmes and other communication with parents,” said Shalin Dabhi, principal of Gopalpura primary school. “But after March 25, every teacher selects a topic – be it simple dictation, multiplication, subtraction or tables of subjects like mathematics or alphabets of language subjects. The teacher then prepares videos which are posted on the group and students are asked to follow them up at their home with the help of parents,” she said.

The school has nine teachers, of which six are involved in preparing this home-to-do digital syllabus. The school located nearly 3 km from milk city Anand has extra benefit as the kids are already tech-savvy.

For a population of just 3,000, the government school is equipped with five smart classes apart from computer lab with broadband connection thanks to support from NRI donors. Like Gopalpura, eight teachers of Jahangirpura primary school near Hadgood village are also involved in this digital education drive.

“We have 254 students in our school. The WhatsApp group formed has 200 members but many of them are wards of same parents or live in the neighbourhood. They share the content posted by our teachers. It also helps in long term as although students will get promoted, they can be made ready for the next class,” said principal Mitesh Mecklin.

Anand district primary education officer (DPEO) Nivedita Chaudhary told TOI that there is no directive from the state government to this primary schools or teachers. “These teachers have taken this initiative just to ensure that the wards don’t get cut off from their school,” she said.

174,['30/03/2020'],Authorities struggle to check home-quarantined deviants,"Panaji: There’s a fresh headache for authorities in the form of people who are in home quarantine but not following it in toto. Sources said that this deviance increases the risk of transmitting the disease should they test positive. Of the two who tested positive on Sunday, one is the brother of one of last week’s positive cases.

Authorities have noticed several incidents of persons defying home quarantine, particularly those with travel history. Over 700 persons are in home quarantine . Goa has five confirmed cases of Covid-19.

A senior official confirmed that they are facing problems with people in home quarantine. They have been instructed that those caught defying quarantine should be lodged in facility quarantine.

“We recently found that a person who was home-quarantined was manning a counter at his shop in the village a few days ago. He has been warned since,” an official said.

Another senior official said it has been emphasised to authorities that those defying home quarantine have to be dealt with strictly. “Even after warnings, if they do not listen, they need to be lodged in the facility quarantine with a clear warning that if they mingle with others in quarantine, they she will be locked inside a room,” he said.

Sources say it is not physically possible to check on each person in quarantine. The official said that in Sankhali itself, there are 388 persons plus 26 travellers in home quarantine.

“Though calls are made to them every day, there is no way for us to know if any of them had stepped out unless someone brings it to our notice,” he said.

Goa has resorted to stamping persons who are in home quarantine. “We need to be strict with them if we want to keep the count of Covid-19 low,” an official said. It has been suggested that the quarantine period of 14 days be extended to 28 days, at least for persons having a travel history.

“From the day of entry of virus to symptoms, it takes a maximum of 14 days. A 28-day quarantine is advisable,” a GMC doctor said.

Accusing him of denying civilians the right to volunteer, they said the CM should not bring politics into play at such a time. The fight against the deadly coronavirus (Covid-19) should be fought unitedly, without any politics, they said.

Siolim-based Rajan Ghate said Sawant should realise that he is the CM of the state and not of BJP members alone. “We have been working for the people. Sawant should consider our demand as we are used to volunteering our services,” he said.

Many activists had already submitted their applications for volunteering on March 25 when the government suddenly came up with the idea of appointing only MLAs, panchayat members and councilors as volunteers.

Another activist, Shekar Naik, said his application has been lying pending with the authorities. “I cannot understand how just these elected representatives will be sufficient to cater to the needs of so many households,” he said.

“There is a lot of ongoing politics going in the appointment of volunteers. The rejection of our applications is proof of this,” Mapusa-based activist, Pravin Asolkar said.

The stranded people were to be allowed the use of private taxis and Uttarakhand Transport Corporation buses to reach homes.

However, according to the guidelines issued by the Union ministry of home affairs on March 29, the states and Union territories must make temporary arrangements for stranded people, migrant workers, and those in need. The directive adds that all employers (industrial, private, commercial, or any other sector) shall make payments of wages to their workers without any deductions.

The MHA also issued an advisory to people who have rented out their homes to migrant workers asking them to spare one month rent payment. The guidelines add that any landlord, who is found to be forcing a student tenant to vacate the house during lockdown, shall be liable for action.

AGRA: With the government of India issuing directions to states for a complete clampdown on movement of people across borders, Vice chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) has turned down the request of students demanding transportation arrangements to send them back to their home towns.

Confirming this, spokesperson of the varsity, Shafey Kidwai, said that the VC has clearly told the students to stay put in their hostels and directed the provosts to provide counselling to them.

Earlier in the day, hundreds of students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), hailing from UP, Bihar and Jammu & Kashmir had urged the administration to immediately make arrangements to send them back to their home states, as they couldn’t continue staying here under the prevailing circumstances.

Though, the varsity officials initially started the process and approached the district authorities for the same, but gave up after central government’s directions to seal the district and state borders. The VC asked the provost to persuade the 4,500 students in hostels to stay put.

Unhappy with the VC’a decision a kashmiri girl student, Samreen Manzoor , who is pursuing post graduation in Sociology, said “Uncertainty of the lockdown, living far from their families and being virtually confined to small hostel rooms has led to depression and loneliness amongst many students,”

Another research scholars, residing in the campus’s hostel, Nuzhat Akhtar , a resident of Kashmir’s Baramulla, told TOI that she just wants to get out from here. “I don’t care.

Both the departments have been empowered the district collectors, chief medical and health officers (CMHOs) of Dungarpur, Banswara, Udaipur, Jalore, Sirohi and Ajmer to ensure proper screening of these workers who are returning to their respective villages in Rajasthan.

Various camps having doctors and para-medical staff have been put near the bus stand and other areas which are close to the bordering states such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh , Punjab and Haryana.

“Our screening is on since Thursday. But from Saturday, when the numbers started increasing, extra teams have been deployed in various districts to ensure proper screening,” said Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary (medical and health), on Sunday. He added that Asha Sahyogni (health workers) have also been assigned the task to have a door-to-door survey in various villages and hamlets to find if any migrant worker has arrived from other states recently especially Maharashtra and Gujarat. Medical and health department has also asked to rope in private hospitals, clinics for screening of the migrant labourers. “We are more concerned in the districts including Jalore, Sirohi, Dungarpur, Banswara and Udaipur from where a sizeable population works not only as migrant labourers but also do various other jobs. Whereever these people are spotted, they are being screened,” said a senior officer .

186,['30/03/2020'],"Overcharging, hoarding of essential items concern Uttarakhand officials","DEHRADUN/UTTARKASHI/HARIDWAR/UDHAM SINGH NAGAR/NAINITAL: With the lockdown completing almost a week, reports of overcharging by traders and hoarding of essential commodities are coming from all across the state.

“The Covid-19 lockdown has triggered panic among people and as a consequence, traders are stocking essential commodities and shopkeepers are charging extra for home deliveries and other supplies. It is upon the local administration to check such incidents,” Mahesh Bhandari , president of Doon residents’ welfare front, told TOI.

Bhandari, who is also the in-charge of 70 RWAs, is actively urging residents to not hoard daily essentials.

On Sunday, six shopkeepers were penalised by Dehradun district administration for overcharging. Taking cognisance of such incidents, Dehradun district magistrate Ashish Kumar Srivastava has now mandated a rate list in every shop to avoid overpricing.

In Uttarkashi, soaring prices of vegetables and food grains are burning a hole in the pockets of locals during the ongoing lockdown. “Traders in bigger cities have started hoarding essential commodities. Besides, local farmers are no longer selling their produce and are saving it for their consumption fearing a crisis in the days to come. All this has led to sky-rocketing of prices,” said Dwarika Semwal, a social activist.

Gopal Matuda, Uttarkashi supply officer told TOI,”We have set up teams which conduct routine inspections in different areas to check overcharging and hoarding. We have also asked shopkeepers to put up price list in their shops to maintain transparency. We want to assure people that there is no shortage of basic commodities in the district.""

Haridwar residents are also facing similar issues. The local administration has issued a rate list for fruits and vegetables but a price list for other food items, including flour, rice and wheat, is still awaited.

Yogesh Pandey, a resident of Ranipur area, told TOI, “Shopkeepers are over charging us for daily essentials. A bag of 10 kg flour is being sold at Rs 300-Rs 350 much more than the normall rates.”

Such incidents are also being reported from Udham Singh Nagar . “Ration shops have long queues and shopkeepers are charging exorbitantly. Even after action by officials, many continue to charge Rs 5-Rs 10 extra for almost every commodity,” said Pramod Singh, a resident of Kichha area of US Nagar.

In Nainital, however, people are complaining not so much of overcharging but of low supplies. “We are dealing with short supply of food items and protective gears like masks and sanitisers. But the prices have remained largely the same,” said Naresh Sah, a resident of the lake town.

To deal with this shortage in supplies, Nainital administration has set up a team to check black marketing of commodities.

189,['30/03/2020'],Mangaluru: Uncertainty rife in dairy industry,"MANGALURU: The dairy sector in Karnataka is headed for a Covid-19-induced meltdown. Faced with the problem of disposing of around 8-10 lakh litres of unsold milk daily, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), that manages the affairs of 14 milk unions, is also hit by labour and transport issues , and fast dwindling stocks of raw materials needed to keep the milk industry running on a daily basis.KMF procures an average 68-70 lakh litres of milk daily, and sells around 40 lakh litres either as milk, curd or packaged milk. The remaining 30 lakh litres is converted into more than 100 milk products such as ice-cream, peda, ghee and butter. Due to the lockdown, barring ghee and butter, there is no market for the rest of its bouquet of products, resulting in stocking up of unconverted milk.Through its five milk powder units at Channarayapatna, Dempo Dairy, Dharwad, Mother Dairy and another unit in Kanakapura, KMF converts around 15 lakh litres of milk into around 200-200 tonnes of milk powder. The Covid-19 crisis also scuttled KMF’s plans to commission a state-of-the-art milk powder production plant at Ramanagar, that would have the capacity to produce around 100MT of milk powder daily. Trial runs are on at the facility.A senior functionary at KMF said on condition of anonymity that the Ramanagar plant could have helped the federation face the present crisis. The experts who came to install the plant were from France and Italy, that are bearing the brunt of the Covid-19 pandemic, and returned to their countries. “We are in touch with them, and are trying to operationalise this plant,” he said.The Ramanagar plant would have helped KMF convert an additional 4-5 lakh litres of milk to milk powder. Presently, KMF is left with 8-10 lakh litres of excess milk. With milk sales to neighbouring states drying up, disposal of excess milk is a huge problem, he said. A labour-intensive industry, 15,000 workers are needed to run operations, but KMC is operating with only 60% of its workforce, he said, adding KMF is waiting for the government to take a call on its future.",mangaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74884304,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346765,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mangaluru/uncertainty-rife-in-dairy-industry/articleshow/74879130.cms
190,['30/03/2020'],Funerals timings hinge on availability of grave diggers,"Panaji: Funeral services which otherwise draw a crowd of relatives, friends, neighbours and acquaintances, now allow just a handful of family members. In keeping with the new Church guidelines there is no mass, just the final rites directly at the cemetery.

But with the regular grave diggers refusing to step out of their homes, getting someone to dig graves is becoming increasingly difficult. A majority of these workers are migrants.

Saturday and Sunday, saw three burial services in Siolim. There was no Mass – as is traditionally held for the soul of the deceased prior to the burial. Akin Fernandes has been helping St Anthony’s Church in Siolim to get workers to dig graves. They charge Rs 2,000 for each grave, and the burial has to be scheduled as per their convenience. “On Saturday, after I managed to locate two migrants who agreed to dig two graves, they came to the cemetery on their own bikes. But today (Sunday) I had to arrange for their transport as they said they got beaten up by the cops while returning.”

The priest, who usually always goes to the residence of the deceased and prays before the body is moved to the church, did not go. Instead, the bodies were brought directly to the cemetery and lowered into the grave. The priest then performed the last rites in the presence of close family members and a few friends. Almost everyone present was wearing masks. All dispersed quickly, without condoling the grieving family members.

“We kept the church closed. The family was cooperative. I told them I will celebrate mass myself and offer it for his soul,” a priest from a church in Bardez said.

At a funeral in South Goa where only a dozen people were present, they were asked to sit away from each other, on different benches during the Mass and were asked to wash their hands with disinfectant before entering the Church. “There was no choir and we priests did the readings ourselves as a precautionary measure,” the priest told TOI.

Most of the 5,000 families staying in the eight civilian wards in the Cantonment areas are daily-wage earners, domestic helpers, construction and sanitation workers.

Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) of nearly 300 colonies have been told by their employers to stay home. “I used to earn of Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 per month, now who will take care of us?” said K Nagamma (38), a domestic helper and resident of Indiramma Nagar in Rasoolpura.

Durgaiah (28), a daily wager, said the SCB staff and local ward members have failed to help him during the crisis. “The state government had announced it will supply rice, oil and dal through fair price shops, but in the Cantonment, the officials concerned are not implementing this. I have five family members to feed,” he said.

Several families in slums also said SCB officials were only making announcements on preventive measures rather than providing them essential items.

192,['30/03/2020'],Manek’s masks keep Barodians stay safe,"Workers at Chaitanya Manek’s

Vadodara: Ahead of the new academic calendar, Chaitanya Manek stocks up on cotton material for school uniforms. This year too he did the same, but the coronavirus pandemic decided to play spoilsport and schools and colleges closed down jeopardizing his business plans.

But for someone who earns just Rs20,000 a month by sewing clothes in his shop in Sama area, Manek thought of putting the stock of material to good use — make face masks when there was acute scarcity in the market. However, unlike many, his pursestrings were not opened by necessity, but by his heart. And so, lion-hearted Manek, not thinking about the loss he was incurring, decided to give back to the society by distributing these face masks for free.

Manek, who has been making school uniforms over last couple of years, told TOI: “Ahead of the new academic year, I always buy cotton cloth in bulk so that I can make school uniforms and deliver them in time. When the coronavirus scare started spreading some weeks ago, I thought it would subside soon. We began making uniforms. But about a week ago, I realised that the threat is real and closer home.”

“The health authorities were suggesting that people should wear face masks, but I learnt that their isn’t enough masks available in the market. That is when I decided to contribute from my side,” the 40-year-old SSC pass said.

From uniforms to masks was a giant leap and so Manek searched online on how to sew them, also talked to some people on the requirements. “And I began making cotton face masks of specific shape and size and also trained all the six workers in my unit how to sew them perfectly on machines. We are now making about 400 masks every day,” Manek said.

What’s the crowning glory to this venture is that he distributes them for free to the needy so that he too fights the spread of the deadly virus, in his own way.

When asked what prompted him to do so, Manek replied: “People are battling the deadly virus out there — police, health officials and government officials — all are doing everything to save people’s lives. This is my way of contributing to the society. I can’t be thinking about money now!”

After stitching in bulk, Manek hands over the masks to the police department for free distribution. He too distributes them to whoever approaches him.

And that’s not all.

Manek, who has two more mouths to feed at home, that of his son and wife, was ready to pay his employees their monthly salaries. However, inspired by his noble cause, the workers refused to accept the wages as they too wanted to be part of his missionary zeal!

195,['30/03/2020'],"Travel pass norms tweaked, med urgency prime yardstick","Cops are now allowing travel passes only in cases of medical emergency or death of kin

Bhopal: Once again, the order to issue travel passes to people, who want to go to their native places, has been changed. Now, only those people, who either want to go out for medical emergency, or in case of death of a close family member or those in essential services, will be allowed to go out of the district.

Since the lockdown order was issued for Covid-19, students and professionals hailing from outstations and residing here, had to face a lot of problems.

Many such people started flocking to police stations to get travel passes to go to their respective home towns. Initially, police issued them travel passes, but the very next day, an order was issued and only district administration officials were allowed to issue passes. Then again, an order was issued that passes will be issued by the local police station where the person needing the pass resides.

Police officials too were perplexed due to the orders being changed repeatedly. Now, cops maintain that the outstation students, who were left in the city, will have to stay in their hostels.

Speaking on the issue, Piplani SHO, Chain Singh Raghuwanshi, said that Piplani police issued around 1,100 passes and 80 per cent of them were issued to students, who mostly belong to Bihar and UP.

SHO MP Nagar, Manish Rai, said that most of the students left for their native places before the restriction order. Around 10-15 hostels still have some students, but they have been told that now they will have to stay here till the lockdown ends. Some hostel owners were asking students to leave or arrange for their meals themselves.

Police have warned such hostel owners to supply food and essential services to students lodged in their hostels or they will be booked under relevant sections and the hostel facility will be acquired by the government until the lockdown ends. SHO of Ashoka Garden, Sudesh Tiwari, said that Ashoka Garden police station has issued around 3,500 travel passes and around 40 per cent were issued to students.

SHO Ayodhya Nagar, Mahendra Kulhara, said that most hostellers in his jurisdiction have already left for their respective places.

ASP Zone-2, Sanjay Sahu, said that now the districts have been sealed and students have been advised to stay in their hostels and that all hostel managers have been informed to arrange food and essentials for the students.

On Saturday, an irate doctor, Dr Debopam Chatterjee from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Rishikesh exemplified the concerns of scores of medical professionals who are at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. Posting pictures on Facebook about the kind of equipment provided to doctors and medical personnel at the Kolkata Medical College and Hospital — a dedicated hospital to treat Covid-19 patients — and comparing it to ‘raincoats,’ he wrote, “Healthcare providers should be rather asked to sign their death certificates prior to going on this suicide mission...we are ready to serve but not without protection!!”Not just Dr Chatterjee, medicos from across the country are protesting on the kind of protective gear that they are getting. What is fuelling these protests are rapidly emerging cases of doctors getting infected with the virus.Of the over100 patients in Mumbai, four are doctors who treated Covid-19 cases. In Delhi, a doctor of a mohalla clinic was found corona-positive. His wife and daughter have subsequently been infected as well. Doctors from Kerala as well as Lucknow have caught the virus infection too.The protests against lack of equipment have been simmering across the country. After Meerut reported its first Covid-19 case on March 27, nurses and paramedical staff of Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College refused to treat patients in the absence of PPE kits. They were provided the kits a day later on March 28 when the city reported four Covid-19 cases in a single day.In UP’s Baghpat, there were similar protests by nurses and paramedics who alleged that instead of PPE kits, they had been given gear used in HIV protection which would not be as effective against Covid-19.That even premier hospitals still don’t have the protective equipment needed to fight the disease came to light recently when a letter from the chief medical superintendent (CMS) of King George Medical University, Lucknow, written to its V-C, went viral in which the CMS had proposed to deduct a day's salary of teachers, resident doctors and non-teaching staff to buy masks for health workers deputed for the treatment of suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases. The proposal was later withdrawn.Terming the issue of safety of medical staff which is engaged in the fight against Covid-19 as one of paramount importance, the members of Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum of India had a few days ago written to the Prime Minister to provide doctors with adequate protective gear like masks, gowns, head covers etc. A similar request was made by United Resident and Doctor’s Association of India which sought “urgent intervention” of the PM on the issue.The concern of doctors as they work every day in hospitals putting their own safety at risk is best exemplified by a doctor from Patna. Speaking to TOI, Dr Ravi Ranjan Kumar Raman, president of junior doctors’ association at Nalanda Medical College and Hospital in Patna, said, “My family, parents and sister cry every day I leave for work. They ask me not to go to the hospital but I can’t skip my responsibilities. Somewhere in my heart, I know that even if I die, it won’t affect the system.

ASP Crime Branch Nishchal Jharia, who has been assigned to keep a check on police check points on city outskirts said that people, who work as labourers in Indore and other cities and are returning to their home towns by walking, have been constantly coming at these check points. They seem so depressed and tired that cops counsel them and provide them food and necessary things. They are being sent to their native place. He raised concern stating that now that the new order has been issued and district boundaries will be sealed, police and administration will have to find solution of this issue.

200,['30/03/2020'],Rise reported in alcohol withdrawal syndrome cases,"Picture for representational purpose only.

KOCHI: With the lockdown proceeding with stringent restrictions , the number of alcohol withdrawal syndrome cases is on the rise in the state.

The Vimukthi cell under the excise department received 407 calls from all 14 districts at the tollfree helpline number 14405 over the last three days. Over 85% of these cases were of severe nature, including symptoms of violence and suicide tendencies. All these cases were referred to respective nearby government hospitals, where separate wings have been opened to treat patients with the withdrawal symptoms. The excise department and its Vimukthi cell are struggling to tackle the cases and are planning to extend the present 18-hour service to 24 hours with the help of more psychologists.

“The cases are increasing every day and the calls are made by the patients’ relatives. On Saturday, we got 201 calls and 194 were referred to hospitals. On Sunday, 201 cases were reported and a group of five Vimukthi counsellors are attending the calls and advising relatives of the patients. Several cases are being referred to respective nearby taluk hospitals or primary health centres. If transportation facilities are unavailable due to lockdown, people can contact their respective excise office. They will ensure the transportation,” said Vinu Vijayan, sociologist, excise department.

Officials said that most calls were of people with Delirium Tremens (DTs), which is a rapid onset of confusion usually caused by withdrawal from alcohol. When it occurs, physical effects may include shaking, shivering, irregular heart rate, and sweating. “People may also see or hear things that others don’t (hallucination). One call we received was of a patient hallucinating about liqour bottles hidden in his house and kept on searching for it throughout the night. It may finally lead to a very high body temperature or seizures. These people have high suicide tendencies. The only solution is immediate medical attention,” said Saranya S R, a Vimukthi counsellor.

Meanwhile, some excise officials raised concerns about the government’s plan to provide alcohol to patients with withdrawal symptoms based on the doctor’s prescription.

JAIPUR: From Mumbai to Aligarh via Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Jaipur and Mathura , a group of 22 ice-cream sellers has embarked on a journey of nearly 1,500km covering four states. On Sunday afternoon, they reached Jaipur’s Transport Nagar hungry and tired. After a short break, they were back on their feet. Home was still another 300km away.

Hundreds of migrant workers along with their families from Gujarat and Maharashtra have been tirelessly walking for the last couple of days to reach their villages in Mathura, Agra, Aligarh and other places in Uttar Pradesh .

While some managed to hitch a few rides here and there covering a few hundred kilometres, most of them have no clue if they would make it home in the next couple of days.

At Transport Nagar, hordes of people were seeking help from policemen to show them the directions which would take them home. Though Rajasthan government has arranged buses to drop them at the Uttar Pradesh border, the numbers of vehicles is hardly any match to the demand.

Most of these labourers have kids who are left with no option but to walk. Various NGOs have arranged food packets, but looking at the huge numbers, most have to keep walking hungry. A policeman deployed at Transport Nagar said more than 35,000 migrants crossed through the area on Saturday night.

A senior police officer said all the motorists have been booked under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant and their vehicles were taken to the police stations concerned.

Sajan Sonawane, senior PI of Bhadrakali police station, said, “The errant motorists will have to go to the local court and pay the fine following which they will be able to collect their vehicles.”

DCP Amol Tambe of Zone 1 said the action was initiated by police considering that people continued to neglect the continuous instructions that use of vehicles has been banned in the city and only those who have a medical emergency and those falling under the category of essential services are allowed to use their vehicles.

DCP Vijay Kharat of Zone II said, “In our zone we seized around 90 vehicles. The vehicles were seized from Ambad, Satpur, Indiranagar and Nashik Road areas. People are not heeding to the appeals made by police and the government. Hence, we have started seizing the vehicles.”

He added, “Once people realize that the police have started seizing vehicles, we hope that people will start observing the lockdown in the true sense.”

A constable said that police cannot be everywhere and people need to understand this. “A force of 3,000 police personnel is working in shifts to ensure the lockdown is a success. The decision has been taken in the interest of everyone, but some people do not understand the importance of it. If people continue to neglect the lockdown, the situation would become worse,” he said.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, police started making use of drones in Zone 1 and Zone II areas. On identifying the spots where people are gathering on the streets, the drones are flown to that spot for making announcements.

“The footage from the drone cameras will be used to take action against people under section 188 of the IPC,” he said.

The police plan to deploy six more drones for effective monitoring across the city.

Over 135 crore people in India, who are locked in their homes to maintain social distancing, are abuzz with ideas to control the deadly disease.

While not all ideas may be useful, all would not be useless either. A Gwalior-based techie has created a platform to give voice to the people of the country on the Corona issue. Kapil Gupta, a 2012 batch engineer, created republicindia.in wherein people can give their suggestions to fight corona that would directly reach to government of India and to all chief ministers of the country.

In the past 72 hours, at least 10,000 suggestions have been put forth on the platform from different parts of the country. Once a is posted on the portal, within seconds, it goes to the Union health ministry and to chief ministers of all states in the country.

The portal is trending on top on Google and whenever a person types to give suggestion to any government, it opens first, even above the government sites.

“The suggestion to use vacant rail coaches as isolation wards since there is a shortage of isolation wards in the country was also sent to the government from this platform. It was sent by a youth, Swapnil Dattatray kadu Swapnil from Songaon in Maharashtra, mentioning that since there are toilets, bed and electricity in train coaches and trains are not running in lockdown, doctors can easily use the coaches to attend to patients,” said Gupta.

The suggestion was sent on March 26 and was just one among over 10,000 suggestions sent in the past three days, but we do not claim that government accepted any of them, as the government did not write back to us acknowledging the suggestions, Gupta said. He added: “We do not accept any promotion or advertisement on the platform and the purpose is solely to give a platform to the masses to pour in their suggestion to the state governments as well as Union government.”

CHENNAI: Glitches in the online bail application system have ensured that prisoners whose release was ordered by the judiciary to decongest jails during the lockdown continue to languish in captivity.

As soon as the lockdown was announced, the state judiciary permitted release on own bail of hundreds of accused in prison for petty offences.

However, people charged with offences carrying up to seven years of imprisonment could not be released. To help them, an online system was introduced through which accused eligible for bail could apply before the orders were communicated to their advocates through e-mail.

Two officers under the respective principal district sessions judge were deputed for each district. Advocates were instructed to file the bail application through the notified email addresses in the prescribed manner. A couple of phone numbers for each district were also notified for the lawyers to mention.

The problem was that the online system didn’t work in some cases and in others the deputed officers didn’t respond to mails or even phone calls. Advocate V Kannadasan said, “I mailed a bail application for a client accused of subjecting his wife to cruelty. But I didn’t receive any acknowledgement or response from the Tiruvallur sessions court. Then I tried to contact the mobile numbers provided. One was switched off while calls to the other went unanswered. I don’t know who else to contact since the courts are also in lockdown,” he added.

“When bail is a right for every accused person, denying such right would amount to a double jeopardy for people who are already in jail. While the main aim of such an arrangement is to decongest jails, such glitches would not serve the purpose exposing the prisoners to the outbreak. The issue becomes more serious considering the sanitation conditions in the prisons,” Kannadasan said.

Adding that the courts promised that such applications would be processed in 24 hours, Kannadasan suggested that the process be processed through the state legal services authority for efficient delivery.

Advocate Duraikannan, who practises in Chenna,i said he had applied bail for an accused arrested in a TNPSC exam scam. “My application mail was responded to immediately. But I don’t know what happened after that. I don’t know the status of my application.”

HYDERABAD: A 23-year-old young woman sarpanch of Madanapuram village in Nalgonda district has been taking rounds of her village to ensure that people stay home during the 21-day lockdown.

During the first few days of the lockdown, Akhila Yadav , a BSc graduate and sarpanch of the village stood outside her village holding a stick to stop people from entering it without a valid reason. “Earlier, people were not taking the lockdown seriously, I saw people from other villages travelling here for no valid reason. So I sat at the entrance of the village and put up barricades. I would ask them the reason for roaming outside and entering the village if they have a genuine reason, they were allowed to enter. Or else I would ask them to go back,” said Akhila.

She would stand at the entrance from morning till afternoon. After a break, she would again stand there, till the curfew hour. After the restrictions on people’s movement were tightened, she removed the barricades, but the sarpanch has been regularly taking rounds of the village to ensure people stay home during the lockdown period.

“This is the time we have to take precautions to save ourselves and loved ones from the pandemic. I know I can’t protect everyone, but this the least I can do for the safety of my village. If one person gets the infection, the whole village can be affected,” she said, adding, “If I find a new vehicle or new faces in the village I enquire about the reason for their visit, especially if someone comes from the city.”

She has also been asking villagers to take an alternative road while venturing out to buy essentials. The young sarpanch has also been going door-to-door to educate villagers on ways to protect themselves and symptoms of Covid-19. “It is important they know about the symptoms. There are around 1,600 people in the village, and we have distributed around 2,000 masks here. But there is a shortage of hand sanitisers,” she said.

The sarpanch worked for 10 months in Hyderabad in 2018, before returning to her village and getting elected as sarpanch.

The incident took place on Saturday evening. Based on their social media posts and CCTV footage, the jurisdictional Krishnaraja police on Sunday registered a case against the three staff of the mall under Section 153 (1)( b)188,341 of the IPC.

However, the staff of the mall denied allegations and informed police that it was the public who asked the two youths not to allow the duo into the store as they looked like foreigners.

The incident came to light when one of the victims posted about the incident on his social media page. In his post, the youth , who is studying in a college in Mysuru informed that the incident happened when he went to the supermarket in Chamundipuram with his friend on Saturday evening for buying grocery. According to the post, the duo stood in the queue for 25 minutes maintaining social distance according to the norm. But when it was their turn to enter the market, they were stopped by the staff posted at the entrance. “Though we requested them to allow us as we didn’t have any symptoms of flu, they didn’t oblige. When we asked the reason, they said: ‘because you are not from India.”

Though the two youths were offended, they showed them their Aadhaar cards to prove their nationality. They told the people that they were from northeast India, studying in a college in the city. But nobody was willing to listen to them. The students said they argued for 10 minutes and went back without buying goods. The youth wrote in his post that it saddened them that they had to prove that they are Indians.

A source in GHMC said that the patient who passed away did not move around much as he was 74 years old. The area was also inspected by Khairtabad MLA Danam Nagender, GHMC zonal commissioner of Khairathabad, P Pravinya and the police .

From there, I went to Haridwar and then to Jawalaji in Himachal Pradesh. Then I went to Vaishno Devi and Golden Temple,” said the man who has spent a month and 27 days cycling alone.

“ I am travelling on the belief of Sri Ram and God and so far, in this journey, my bicycle has not got punctured even once. due to curfew, I have been stopped at many places,” Chandran said and added that he was cycling to Hyderabad now.

218,['30/03/2020'],"To keep food supply on, farmers seek bailout in Telangana","HYDERABAD: Farmers are facing hardships due to 21-day nationwide lockdown, said Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA) on Saturday, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief ministers of all states.CIFA demanded that government issue a moratorium on loan repayments and interest waiver on crop loans. Farmers are facing problems due to closure of shops, non-availability of pesticides and fertilisers and labour shortage due to barricading of villages.CIFA general secretary Bojja Dasaradharami Reddy told TOI, “During the lockdown, it is extremely important to ensure that food supplies are maintained, and the population does not become vulnerable to the risk of secondary infections due to malnutrition on account of short supply of food.”“We suggest an immediate removal of all village barricades. Most farms require farm labour from neighbouring villages and the barricades prevent the free movement of labour which is effecting the farm operations, such as picking of chillies, vegetables, horticulture crops and other crops which are currently ready for harvest,” Reddy said.If prompt action is not taken to address this issue, it is likely that there will be a huge loss of crops on account of the produce not being harvested. The barricades have hindered access to towns in case of health emergencies. The barricades have been installed by local communities either on their own or on instructions of local panchayat authorities or local law enforcement personnel,” Reddy added.CIFA demand a message be sent that barricading of villages is not permitted unless as a containment strategy on the instructions of the local health authorities in case of a spike in Covid-19 cases.“The instructions currently issued, while permitting farm operations, are silent with regards to the issue of supply of pesticides and fertilisers to farms. The fertiliser and pesticide shops are being closed by the local law enforcement only to be opened as soon as the police leave. It is necessary to provide clear instruction to the law enforcement authorities so that they do not close down the fertiliser and pesticide shops,” said Dasaradharami Reddy.CIFA suggested that in order to limit the physical movement of people, the government should make arrangements to deliver the stock from the shop to the farmers on a fixed fee basis based on the delivery distance so as to prevent large scale movement of farmers to the nearby towns. “There is a difficulty in marketing perishable goods such as vegetables due to non-availability of transport. While some states such as Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have already announced that the produce will be purchased from the villages directly, a comprehensive policy is required to be framed and a system put in place so that the crops do not get damaged waiting for the arrival of the government agencies to procure perishable agri produce and other agri produce at fair prices. The policy may also provide for a redressal mechanism to promptly address any issues which may be faced by the farmers in selling their produce,” he added.CIFA alleged that farmers are facing a lot of harassment from the local law enforcement personal while transporting labour from the neighbouring villages.“In recent times, there has been a massive increase in the number of auto rickshaws in rural areas, as they provide last mile connectivity in the most interior villages apart from forming the backbone of labour transport. However, since the lockdown, law enforcement have not been permitting the autos to ply between villages and rightly so, as it is difficult to maintain social distancing norms in an auto . However, there is every need to address the issue of labour shortage and it is suggested that the road transport authorities may operate special buses in rural areas in order to facilitate safe movement of labour to farms,” he said.In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is imperative that the government declare a moratorium on the loans disbursed to the farm sector for one crop season similar to the moratorium declared on working capital loans taken by companies, Reddy said.“It is further requested that the government provide interest free loans for the next crop season in order to facilitate easy access to capital and prevent loan sharks from taking undue advantage of the farmers. Apart from the above, it is requested that the government provide an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh to each farmer and farm labourer currently risking their life in order to feed the country and treat them on par with our health care professionals,” Reddy concluded.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74880742,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271722,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/defer-loan-repayment-waive-off-interest/articleshow/74879783.cms

The capital had the highest number under home isolation till Saturday with 18,094 persons and by Sunday the number further rose slightly to 18,145. The sharp rise in number of persons who had to be brought under surveillance was mainly owing to reconsolidation of passenger data.Two days ago, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba had asked states to strengthen surveillance of international air travellers who entered the country between January 18 and March 23 since there was a gap between those being monitored for Covid 19 and 15 lakh arrivals during this period in the country. The cabinet secretary had pointed out that such a gap could threaten the efforts at containment.The district administration and health team received information from airport authority and bureau of immigration on passengers with passport address based in Thiruvananthapuram. The verification process revealed that many persons had landed in Kochi, Mangalapuram and Trichi and travelled by other means to Thiruvananthapuram. The details of these persons were missing in the surveillance list of district administration. Seat numbers were also checked to further confirm and now over 10,000 new persons were included in the surveillance list.Even on March 25, less than 7,000 persons were under home isolation in the district. Between March 26 and 28, the number rose from 7,968 to cross 18,000. This is expected to put additional pressure on ward-level surveillance teams. At present, 8,230 squads are being deployed in the district for home based surveillance and 15,081 volunteers have been directed to regularly check on people under home isolation. As on Saturday, 9,590 houses were visited by the ward-level teams, said minister for tourism and devaswom Kadakampally Surendran.With numbers crossing 18,000, the district administration is using a combination of severe penalty measures, manpower and technology to keep a daily tab on persons under home quarantine. The district collector had voiced his concerns over home isolation being compromised, even when the number was just 284. The administration initially stuck with an advisory and hoped people would obey that.The district administration was later forced to go for the harsh step; invoking section 51(b) of the Disaster Management Act which says that if anyone refuses to comply with the direction given by or on behalf of centre or state government or district authority or state/national executive committee, they shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both. Further if such refusal to comply with directions results in loss of lives or imminent danger, the imprisonment will extend for a period of two years.Recently, stickers were pasted on houses where people are under quarantine mainly to avoid visits by relatives and friends. Although some households were not enthused about the move, the administration has gone ahead with the plan.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/dist-has-2nd-highest-number-of-people-under-home-isolation/articleshow/74879271.cms

226,['30/03/2020'],Residents start to throw social distancing norms to the wind,"Coimbatore: Days after chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami projected them as exemplary figures on Twitter for maintaining social distancing at markets, the city residents on Sunday made it look like they were completely ignorant of the big fight to contain Covid-19 as they crowded the markets like any other normal day to stock up vegetables, meat and other essentials.

One doesn’t know for sure whether the government’s recent move of reopening major markets across the state and relaxing rules to ensure adequate supply of essentials has sent the wrong message to the residents.

In the city, major markets at RS Puram and Singanallur functioned as usual on Sunday. While police and city corporation officials had jointly marked slots for customers at a gap of every 1m in front of each shop to ensure social distancing, they were completely ignored by the residents in their hurry to buy vegetables.

The picture wasn’t any different at Ukkadam fish market, farmers’ market at Somanur, and meat shops across the district, where the public moved in close contact with each other.

While sellers, especially at individual shops, managed to ensure social distancing by their customers, doing so was a difficult task for their counterparts at markets.

A shopkeeper said, “People have been purchasing vegetables out of panic and in their struggle to stock up items before they were sold out, they violated the social distancing norms. They were getting at us whenever we asked them not to crowd the shop.”

Disappointed at the city residents’ behaviour, a government official said the district administration has been creating awareness on the measures to prevent Covid-19 infection and the importance on maintaining social distancing. “They had also drawn slots in front of shops to ensure minimum distance between the customers. What more should the district administration do to make the public abide by the rules,” the official wondered.

On Saturday too, a large crowd had gathered on RG Street to buy essentials. However, the city police had then managed to control them by drawing up slots in front of shops. On Sunday, they could do little to manage the crowd.

Despite several attempts, police department officials were not available for a comment.

THRISSUR: An ayurveda doctor ’s liquor ‘prescription’ for a patient has gone viral in the backdrop of the reported move of the state government to provide liquor to people based on the prescriptions of doctors. However, within hours, the doctor clarified that he had sent a picture of the ‘prescription’ on a lighter vein to a couple of friends and did not expect it to reach the public domain.

Meanwhile, the Kerala Prohibition Council had filed a police complaint against the doctor.

Dr M D Renjit, who runs the Anjaly Ayurvedic Wellness Centre at North Paravur, had prescribed his ‘patient’ Purushothaman (48) ‘M C VSOP Brandy’ to be taken in 60ml thrice in the evening with roasted peanut.

Dr Renjit now says that he had sent the ‘jocular prescription’ in an old letter-pad to three or four friends on WhatsApp and added that the ‘patient’ was fictitious. He added that one of his friends might have forwarded the ‘prescription’ to others, thus making it viral. “I sincerely apologize for the mistake I had committed,” he said.

Renjit said he has already written to the bodies like Ayurveda Medical Association of India (AMAI), clarifying his stance.

He said that he was also planning to approach the police against those who had shared his ‘private message’ without his permission.

231,['30/03/2020'],Hyderabad techie develops app to help achieve social distancing during grocery runs,"HYDERABAD: With Union and state governments stressing on the need for social distancing to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, a city-based techie has now developed an app to enable social distancing.The web-based application developed by Vijayanand Reddy, will help citizens practise social distancing at grocery stores, vegetable markets and super bazaars. Using the app, people can book a slot at particular stores in the city this will help prevent overcrowding thereby helping people maintain the required distance from each other while making purchases.The 38-year-old techie who owns a fin-tech startup had checked the feasibility of the app by implementing it at his apartment complex in Kukatpally. “ We have about 2,500 flats and 8,000 people residing in our apartment complex. We also have an in- house medical shop and a super bazaar. Residents of the apartment have already stated booking slots for the super bazaar and there has been a substantial reduction in the length of queues,” Reddy said.The system works in such a way that super bazars or shops will have to integrate with the app to enable booking of slots. Once users book a slot, they will receive an SMS with an allotted timing. There are two types of type slots available - a five-minute express time slot and a 15-minute time slot. The five-minute is meant to buy basic provisions such as milk, eggs and bread. Users can book the 15- minutes to pick up all other grocery items. The SMS will cost the users 15 paisa per message.“ At our apartment complex, we also have a security guard stationed at the super bazaar so that people maintain social distance while shopping, during their designated time slots, ” Reddy added. Currently, the app is being provided for free to those interested in testing it. “ An apartment in Bengaluru has come forward to test this model. We will also be providing a demonstration of the application to other super bazars. “The app will avoid crowding of grocery stores and reduce the chance of contracting the virus while waiting in queues,” said KV Chandra, a resident of Kukatpally.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74882859,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157001,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/techie-develops-app-to-help-achieve-social-distancing-during-grocery-runs/articleshow/74879771.cms

The city corporation, through its Twitter and Instagram handles, has asked the public to post their selfie that was taken while doing some fun activities at home and challenge five others, by tagging them.

A civic body source said, “The purpose of the contest is to imbibe the thought of social distancing in the minds of people and encourage them to continue to stay at home. As most of the residents are used to going out on regular basis, it will be very hard for them to break their daily schedule. So, we have taken this initiative to keep them occupied.”

Pointing out that their main focus was now on disinfecting public places, the source said they were also concerned about the people who were spending their time alone at home.

While the initiative hasn’t found much takers, the source said they have been thinking of ways to make it popular among the residents.

They claimed that they haven’t been paid for four months but are still being made to do extra work.

“State WCD minister Rekha Arya has asked us to distribute ration amid the novel-coronavirus threat. The state government needs us most right now to ensure that ration reaches the needy at the earliest but they are not giving us our dues. Forget appreciation, we haven’t even received our monthly honorarium of Rs 7,500 for the past few months,” said an anganwadi worker.

Gangotri Bhandari from Pabo block of Pauri Garhwal has in fact put up a video message urging the CM to first resolve the issues of anganwadi workers before forcing them to go on the field during this time.

In the video, Bhandarisays, “I lost my husband in December 2019. I have a daughter and we have no money to even buy food as we haven’t got honorarium after November. I would like to ask the CM how is it possible for me to leave my daughter alone at home at this time. What if I contract the virus? Who will take care of my daughter? We need food for ourselves first before we distribute it to others.”

Echoing similar sentiments, Soni from Ghansali area of Tehri Garhwal expressed concerns regarding honorarium payment and safety kit for the workers during ration distribution.

Soni, who is working as an anganwadi worker since 2011, said, “I have three young daughters to feed and I am the only earning member in my house. We haven’t received honorarium for the past four months. I want money to feed my family first, only then we will be able to do our duty with diligence.""

She added, “There is almost negligible ration available at the anganwadi centres for distributing to all the beneficiaries. This also needs to be made available by the government.”

The 21-day lockdown has left the toil of these farmers in vain as they are not finding any takers for their produce.Only two to three loads are getting transported now instead of 15 loads that used to be transported earlier. Their regular trade market extends from Balaramapuram to Karunagappally. Also demand from the Chalai market is also less owing to lockdown. Due to strict traffic regulations by police, trucks aren’t coming to pick the amaranthus.Around Rs 45,000 is invested by the farmers to cultivate in an acre of land .Usually they get Rs 70,000 to Rs 90,000 as returns. Only 25 days are needed for amaranthus to grow up. Because of this short duration, more farmers take up amaranthus farming. The same is the situation of farmers at Punchakkari, Pandaarakkari, Vavvaamoola and Kalliyoor, who are cultivating other vegetables.The plantain species namely Chingan and Padathi, which were cultivated during festival season face low demand. Due to the cancelled festivals, they get only Rs 25 instead of Rs 75 per kilogram.Manikandan, a farmer, said that they cultivated amaranthus with a lot of hope, but due to the lock down announcement, their plans were rattled. So many amaranthus plants are left to rot due to the absence of transportation and customers. But we are ready to obey the instructions of government even in the time of loss. And we are hoping for some help from authorities regarding this.Pick up van driver Binu said that lockdown and transporting restrictions by police is creating difficulty to take vegetable loads.

COIMBATORE: A 29-year-old doctor, who had treated two Covid-19 patients from Thailand at the Perundurai Government Hospital in Erode, tested positive for the disease here on Sunday.

The doctor has infected her 10-month-old son, 58-year-old mother and a 51-year-old maid, a district administration official said. “Perhaps, she is the first doctor to have contracted the disease from patients in the state. With this, the number of Covid-19 patients here has gone up to six. The four patients are being treated in the isolation wards of the ESIC hospital. Their vitals are stable,” he said.

The doctor had joined duty on March 23 at the Podanur Railway Hospital after she was transferred from the Erode Railway Hospital. As she felt feverish, she took leave on the same day. She was admitted to the ESIC hospital on March 25 after she started showing the symptoms of the infection. Her throat and nasal swabs as well as those of her family members were sent to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research in Chennai. Shortly, the railway closed both the railways hospital she had worked as a precautionary measure.

“Her husband and the other child have tested negative. But their swabs have been sent for reconfirmation,” the official told TOI.

Meanwhile, four people who had travelled from New Delhi to Erode tested positive for the virus on Sunday and are undergoing treatment in the IRT Perundurai Medical College. With this, the number of Covid-19 patients in Erode has gone up to nine.

Health department officials are trying to track down 51 people - 28 from Mettupalayam and the rest from Anaimalai, Pollachi and Coimbatore city – who had attended a religious function along with the Thailand nationals in New Delhi for two days from March 22, said the official. “We tracked down 43 people and collected swabs for testing. They were admitted to the isolation wards of the government hospitals in Mettupalayam, Pollachi and Coimbatore.”

Two people who had returned from the Maldives had to struggle after doctors at the ESIC hospital in Coimbatore prescribed home quarantine on Saturday. “The duo had visited a private hospital in the city as one of them had cough. The hospital sent them to the ESIC hospital in an ambulance. Doctors there ruled out symptoms of Covid-19 and asked them to leave on their own,” a source said.

The duo managed to convince the driver of a goods carrier to give them a ride back home with the help of cops.

238,['30/03/2020'],Citizens get creative with birthday celebrations in lockdown,"Nagpur: Ever heard of a cake made of chips and savoury snacks or seen people celebrating their birthdays with a protecting mask on? Thats the new reality in the era of long lockdown. Nagpurians confined to their homes are celebrating their birthdays in the unique ways. Some have decorated their houses with glittery happy birthday wall hangings, while others enjoyed their ‘Quarantine birthday’ with delicious home-cooked meal, making it a memorable one.

Giving some insights into her celebration, Pallavi Bais, a psychology student, stated she cut a cake made of chips and snacks, “I had a fun virtual birthday as I was busy attending video call of my loved ones. My friends a made a cake with ingredients lying around such as chips, kurkure and other stuff. It was special in its own way,” she said.

Gaurav Medha, a banker, celebrated his birthday on March 25 and feels it was an unusual yet happy experience of being at home for the entire day. “It was indeed a different birthday and I will always remember it for years to come. We did not have any cake or outside food, but celebrated it at home with my family. I just cut some bread symbolically instead of a cake,” he said.

Citizens also invoked their inner chefs and baked their own cakes on their birthday, as they are avoiding outside food and delivery was closed too. Rakhi Ghode celebrated her 46th birthday on March 21 with her family and made her own cake. “It was a different experience altogether. Yet I was happy as I baked my own cake, decorated it and celebrations were doubled as my son who usually stays outstation joined me,” she said.

Sampada Shinde, an architecture student, celebrated her birthday on March 26 with nicely done decorations and also posted pictures of herself wearing a mask. “My brother and mom ordered a cake online, and it was home delivered. They decorated my room with whatever was present at home. I spent the whole day with my family. Otherwise, each year I go out with friends and party. We played carom, watched a movie and had own sweet time at home,” she said.

Self-isolation gave an opportunity to Rinkesh Gorasiya, an entrepreneur, to celebrate his birthday with his family after seven years on March 27. He cut a home-baked cake at midnight and calls it the best birthday ever, “This birthday was special to me as I celebrated it after seven years with my family. I cut the cake which to my surprise was baked at home. We played UNO, and the room was filled with laughter. My most special birthday, better than any fancy party,” he said.

Adding to this, Rahul Dhok who celebrated his mother’s 57th birthday on March 26, said, “We tried very hard to get a cake from a bakery as we had already cancelled big celebration plan. My friend who stays nearby joined for a small get together at home. My mom was happy. It was a very different,” he said.

Talking about her lockdown birthday on March 27, Dhanashree Mathulkar, a banker, said, “No cake was cut as no shop was open. I went to office and came back home. My mother made me sweet halwa and I stayed at home with my family.”

239,['30/03/2020'],"Industries shut, residents get 5MLD more water","Chennai: Industrial units in the city are in lockdown and the five million litres of water a day (MLD) meant for them is being used to supply residents in various areas.

A senior Metrowater official said the per capita consumption of water in the city, with most people staying indoors, is likely to have increased by 15% since the lockdown kicked in at 6pm on Tuesday last. The 100 litres of water a consumed on average by an individual may have gone up to 120 litres per head, he said.

After April 14, when the lockdown is scheduled to end, Metrowater will analyse water consumption across the city to arrive at a rough estimation, the official explained.

Since the shutting down of the desalination plant at Nemmeli on the outskirts of the city to replace a moving filter, or travelling band screen, Metrowater has managed to continue the regular water supply by drawing water from Veeranam lake in Cuddalore district.

Generally, water from this lake is used only during the peak dry period. As on Sunday, the lake had a storage of 1,100mcft (million cubic feet) against the full capacity of 1,465. After the repairs at the Nemmeli desalination plant are completed, drawal of water from the Veeranam lake will be stopped, said the official.

A couple of months ago, Metrowater made a proposal to increase piped water supply to city residents from the existing 650MLD to 750MLD before dropping it.

The reservoirs at Poondi, Chembarambakkam, Red Hills and Cholavaram have a combined storage of 6,400mcft currently. This combined with water from Veeranam lake, a few abandoned quarries, Metrowater’s own sources and agricultural wells in Tamaraipakkam in Tiruvallur district, can help cope with the situation over the next two months, which is the crucial period, the official said, adding that all steps are being taken to ensure there is no repeat of the situation in the summer of 2019.

241,['30/03/2020'],Small farmers to remain indoors as tea production resumes in Ooty,"Udhagamandalam: Small tea growers’ associations in the Nilgiris on Sunday strongly objected to the state government’s move to resume tea manufacturing in the district, when the nation was in lockdown mode to fight Covid-19.

All the tea manufacturing factories - be it bought leaf factories, industrial cooperative tea factories (Indco), corporate tea factories and Tamil Nadu Tea Development Corporation (Tantea) - had shut their operations as soon as lockdown was announced in the country.

However, a corporate player, Chamraj tea estate, had on Friday approached the district administration, seeking permission to resume tea production, citing guidelines issued by the central government for the lockdown. They also urged the district administration to clear the air regarding their operation in consultation with the state government, which said tea manufacturing activities could be undertaken.

Following this, collector J Innocent Divya had on Saturday said tea manufacturing and production activities could be undertaken in the district, subject to general restrictions and other safety measures.

B Dharuman, president, Nellikolu Trust, a body of Nilgiris small tea farmers, said, “When the people in the hills are abiding by the lockdown rules, this kind of clarification by the government only confuses the small tea farmers. We understand the seriousness of Covid-19 and we prefer to remain indoors, irrespective the government’s stance.”

While the managing director of Indcoserve, an apex body of 15 cooperative tea factories in the district, have instructed the cooperative tea factories to resume operations, B Kumaran, vice-chairman, Tea Board of India, on Sunday wrote to the official to stall tea manufacturing activities at the cooperative tea factories, citing practical difficulties involved in following precautionary measures while at work.

There are 22,000 small tea farmers who are attached to the Indco tea factories.

Kumaran said, “The stance of the government, in my view, is not correct as manufacturing of tea subject to general restrictions and other safety measures such as social distancing is impractical given the present situation.”

Pointing out that 40 lakh kg made-tea was yet to be auctioned, he said, “What is the point in resuming tea manufacturing activities in this time of crisis? Government can resume the auction that hadn’t taken place in the past two weeks for supply of tea to the market.”

He said tea production should be stalled in the Nilgiris at least until April 14 in view of Covid-19 outbreak.

Meanwhile, Manjai V Mohan, a representative of small tea farmers in the district, has written to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, seeking a compensation package of Rs5000 for the small tea farmers in the Nilgiris. He said, “The cooperative tea factories would start functioning from Monday. However, supply of green leaf tea will not be available as farmers will continue to stay at home.”

There are around 165 tea manufacturing factories, including 15 cooperative tea factories and as many corporate companies, in the Nilgiris, where more than 50,000 small tea growers cultivate tea on more than one lakh acres.

In addition, Tantea owns around 9,500 acres in the hill retreat, mainly in Gudalur and Coonoor taluks. Sri Lankan repatriates are mostly engaged in works in the tea gardens of Tantea.

Police also charged Noorbina and her husband for organizing the wedding of her daughter and for allowing the presence of their son, who was under quarantine at the ceremony. As prohibitory order is in place in Kozhikode, not more than 10 people can participate in a wedding or other ceremony at a time. The maximum number of people who can attend a wedding ceremony at different time should also not exceed 50.

A few days ago, the police had booked former mayor and CPM leader A K Premajam as she tried to obstruct a group of health workers who questioned the violation of home quarantine by her son. Premajam’s son and family were in home quarantine as they had returned to Kozhikode from Australia.

Even sale of the fruit within the country has trickled due to the lockdown.Farmers from Nashik— the state’s grape capital—are facing labour shortage and issues with transportation as private transporters are reluctant to ply citing police harassment.The situation today is in sharp contrast to the previous season when Nashik exported 1.4 lakh tonne of grapes—an all-time record. The grape season lasts for five months beginning December. Their previous all-time high was 1.3 lakh tonne during the 2016-17 season.According to the Grape Exporters’ Association of India (GEAI), 30% of the produce meant for exports is yet to be harvested. “The vineyards are full of good quality produce but the farmers have no option but to let them rot as there is no demand and no labour to harvest them. Also, there is no way the produce can be carried to the market ,” said Abhijeet Zambhare, a farmer.“Apart from exports, we are also unable to send grapes to various domestic markets as workers are not available to load the trucks. Moreover, farmers are not getting workers to pluck the grapes either,” said Jagannath Khapre, president, GEAI.Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh (MRDBS), an association of grape growers, has said that around three lakh acres are under grape cultivation in Maharashtra, with two lakh acres in Nashik alone. Vineyards on 90,000 acres are yet to be harvested, including around 50,000 acres in Nashik.“We have not been getting containers for the past few days to export grapes via JNPT. We are not getting packaging material as outlets are closed due to the national lockdown,” said Manik Patil, a senior association member.

244,['30/03/2020'],BU to offer masks with viral deactivation properties soon,"Coimbatore: Researchers at the Bharathiar University in the city have come up with a prototype of a mask that has viral deactivation properties. According to them, the nanofiber-based three-layered mask, which contains active compounds of some medicinal plants, would be of great use to both healthcare workers and general public to fight Covid-19.

The researchers said they have been working on the mask since February. It all began with them drawing up a list of medicinal plants, which were prescribed by the ministry of ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, siddha and homoeopathy (Ayush) for prevention and as prophylactic for Covid-19, to be used in the mask.

Last week, papers on their research were published in two journals - Science of the Total Environment, and European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences.

University vice-chancellor P Kaliraj said they have shared the information with the state government and were looking for their support. He said they were also planning to tie up with industries in Coimbatore for large scale manufacturing of the mask “We hope to take the product to the market within two to three months.”

V Balachandar, assistant professor of the university’s department of human genetics and molecular biology, said the active compounds of medicinal plants that were prescribed by the ministry of ayush were incorporated in cotton nanofibers that were used in the mask. “The compounds extracted from the plants would deactivate the virus,” said Balachandar, also coordinator of the research team.

While mentioning that plants such as andrographis paniculata, sphaeranthus indicus, clitoria ternatea and hyoscyamus niger were having anti-viral properties, they said in the research papers, “(They are) renowned for their antiviral and pulmonary protective potentials. Active compounds from these plants can be incorporated into respiratory masks to furnish them with inherent antiviral properties. This will provide the wearer with an extra mode of protection, in addition to the physical barrier.”

However, the team hasn’t named the exact medicinal plants, the active compounds of which they would use in the masks.

Balachandar said they wanted to develop the mask that won’t allow the virus to survive on its surface for long. “The survival rate of virus on its surface will be minimal. We are also looking at making the pore size of the mask small so that the virus would be filtered out.”

Pointing out that developing a vaccine for Covid-19 would take quite a while, he said, “We hope these cost-effective masks would be of help. In the absence of vaccination, protective masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases. Also, medicinal plants infused in the mask would be a protective measure.”

The university vice-chancellor said they have appraised higher education minister K P Anbalagan, health minister Dr C Vijayabaskar and health secretary Beela Rajesh IAS about their research. “We are also looking at industrial collaboration for large scale production of masks,” Kaliraj said.

247,['30/03/2020'],"Thanks to prompt collection, waste worries not piling up","Bengaluru: Having anticipated waste woes during the lockdown, residents of several localities in Bengaluru are relieved at garbage being disposed of promptly.

“BBMP workers are ensuring waste is collected regularly during the lockdown. The responsibility of proper segregation lies on us,” said Niveditha Sunkad, member of Rajarajeshwari Nagar-I care, a resident welfare association.

Hemanth Kumar Agrawal, a member of Domlur Resident Welfare Association, said waste collectors need to be rewarded as they are risking their health to keep others’ safe. “The auto-tippers are visiting us every day and picking up waste. However, people are still not segregating waste properly,” lamented Kumar.

Shiva Prakash, a member of the Junnasandra RWA, said BBMP had been picking waste from their locality on alternate days earlier but is doing it every day now. “BBMP’s solid waste management staffers have turned a new leaf and are collecting garbage without any prodding,” he added.

The Palike has not let the lockdown affect its work. The attendance has remained 80%, officials said. “We want to ensure garbage is collected on a daily basis and residents are not troubled by overflowing bins,” said Nagaraj Kalappa, a waste collection worker. “Our families may be worried for us, but if we don’t collect waste, people will throw it on the streets and this can create a bigger problem,” he added.

Lockdown a challenge

D Randeep, special commissioner, said the lockdown was indeed a challenge. “Pourakarmikas did not have transportation for a short period and were forced to travel in private vehicles. But we gave them an allowance of Rs 100 per day to ensure the expenditure did not drill a hole in their pockets,” he said.

“The situation has improved now as BMTC has decided to extend help to ferry pourakarmikas,” he added. BBMP has ensured some flexibility, wherein a pourakarmika can work for only half a day, from 6.30am-10.30am.

Pourakarmikas and other waste collection workers were largely dependent on hotels and Indira Canteens for breakfast but they too have been shut down, regretted a senior BBMP official.

MYSURU: Two youths from Nagaland alleged they faced racial discrimination when they visited a supermarket in Mysuru’s Chamundipuram to purchase grocery on Saturday.

Based on their social media posts and CCTV footage, police on Sunday arrested four employees of More store on charges of racial discrimination against the two students and denial of food items. Police commissioner Chandragupta said an FIR was lodged at Krishnaraja police station and the manager and staff of the supermarket were questioned.

The arrested are Manjunath, customer service associate, Naveen from IT maintenance division, Avinash, manager of the outlet, and Revanna.

However, the mall staff denied the allegations and told police it was the public who asked them not to allow the duo into the store as they looked like foreigners.

The incident came to light when one of the Naga youths — a college student in Mysuru — posted about it on his social media page. He said the incident happened when he went to the supermarket with his friend on Saturday evening to buy grocery. According to the post, the duo stood in the queue for 25 minutes, maintaining social distance. But when it was their turn to enter the store, they were stopped by the staff at the entrance. “Though we requested them to allow us as we didn’t have any symptoms of flu, they didn’t oblige. When we asked the reason, they said, ‘you are not from India.’”

Though the two youths were offended, they showed them their Aadhaar cards to prove their nationality. They said they were from Nagaland, studying in a college in Mysuru. But nobody was willing to listen to them, the post claimed. The students said they argued for 10 minutes and went back without buying goods. One of them uploaded the video of the incident and accused the staff of racism.

Police commissioner Chandragupta said: “We urge people and shop owners to behave responsibly during such crises.”

Supermarket to probe incident

The supermarket said it will conduct a probe into the incident. “More Retail does not accept discrimination of any kind in its stores. Our stores are open to all citizens of the country. A probe will be conducted into this incident...,” read a statement.

Reacting to the incident, Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju tweeted that this was unacceptable and the Union home ministry has already issued a clear advisory to all states and Union Territories to prevent any discrimination against people from northeast.

All three organizations have their own reasons to oppose the plan.First and foremost, the students are worried about their academics. GMCH houses more than 2,000 students of UG, PG and super speciality courses. All stakeholders are also worried about the lack of proper resources like protection equipment and masks in enough quantity to do the job properly.“We are ready to fight against Covid-19 and mostly resident doctors are taking the responsibility of treating patients in isolation wards. But converting the entire hospital into Covid-19 centre is not at all a good idea,” reads a statement issued by Maharashtra Resident Doctors Association (MARD) in GMCH. According to MARD, poor patients being treated at GMCH will have to go to private hospitals in case GMCH is reserved only for Covid-19 patients. Students are also worried about the future of their academics.Nurses are also worried about patients and their own academics. “GMCH is India’s most prominent medical colleges and many courses related to nursing are conducted here. Nurses trained in GMCH are working all over India. Converting the hospital into Covid-19 centre will be a setback for us,” the statement issued by Sahayohita Mhaisagawali, president of Maharashtra State Nursing Association, reads.Association of Health Workers has also raised issue of poor patients. “Patients coming from across Central India get free treatment at GMCH. Trauma care centre, super speciality hospital and neonatal care unit will suffer in case the premises are sealed for Covid-19 treatment,” said Trisharan Sahare, president of the Health Workers Association attached to INTUC. They have also claimed that GMCH is centrally located in Nagpur and it may spread infection in city if many patients of Covid-19 are accommodated here.GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra said that the state government will take a final decision on setting up the Covid-19 centre only after consultation with medical education department.Meanwhile, the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), on Saturday, issued a resolution that government can now accommodate registered private practitioners to treat Covid-19 patients.

The directorate of school education has instructed CEOs that after schools reopen, this should be entered in the promotion registers.

T Arulanandam, a schoolteacher and the state auditor of the Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association (TNHHSSGTA), said they used to aggregate marks of the first two terms and take an average. “We would enter them in consolidated sheets before entering them online in the educational management information system (EMIS) portal. However, with all the students declared promoted, we are now entering the marks and marking all of them pass. Though it’s an all pass, we have to enter that for all students. If there are 800 students, we have to mention the result as promoted for all of them,” he told TOI.

The teachers are also doing the pending work related to the academic year, says P K Ilamaran, president of the Tamil Nadu Teachers Association. “We have been verifying students’ half-yearly marks and have been entering their results. Once there is an announcement, we would upload them online,” he said.

The teachers have also called for promoting Class X students. “As the academic year is almost over, it would not be appropriate to ask Class X students to return to their old portions.

LUCKNOW: Thousands of parents, whose children are studying in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and other metros and are unable to return to the city due to the lockdown, are passing sleepless nights these days.

Harish and Anju Srivastava, residents of Alambagh , are worried for their son pursuing graduation from Bengaluru. With all state borders closed and no mode of transportation is available, they are haplessly waiting for the government to ensure safe return of their son.

“My son had taken a room in college hostel. But all colleges have been closed due to lockdown. Now he is sharing a PG accommodation with one of his classmates. He was supposed to return Lucknow on April 5 after his semester examination. Video calls are the only option for us to stay in touch with him,” said Srivastava.

Sandhya Paul, another local, has posted on a Facebook group a query asking her FB friends to tell her whether her two sons can drive back to the city from Gurgaon. “I am requesting you to please help me out. My sons are stuck in Gurgaon. Can they come to Lucknow in their car?,” wrote Paul. However, many of the group followers have advised her to stay put till the lockdown ends on April 15.

Suman and Uttam Marwah are counting restless days as their daughter is stuck in Delhi. While parents are worried for their kids, children living away from their families are also trying to return. Avantika Bhatt, a student in Delhi, said she called up helpline numbers issued by the government for people from Uttar Pradesh stuck in Delhi, but to no avail.

Lucknow resident studying in DelhiVasvi Verma took to Twitter to share her ordeal and tagged Delhi CM in her twitter thread.

P Nandakumar, who works as an art teacher in a city school, said he was inspired when the PM said that it was people’s will to contribute that mattered and not the actual amount they contributed. “If I sell my paintings myself, I can get a few tens of thousands. But if the PM does it for the cause, it can fetch much more. So, I have decided to donate five of my best oil paintings to the PM’s Covid-19 relief fund,” he said.

Nandakumar has tweeted this, tagging the PM’s Twitter handle.

In December 2018, when cyclone Gaja hit the coastal districts, Nandakumar sold six of his paintings to raise Rs 95,000. He used the money to buy rice and blankets for the people in villages near Vedaranyam.

261,['30/03/2020'],"Curfew Mata Mandir shuts its gates, but hears prayers","BHOPAL: In times of corona curfew, Bhopal’s “Curfew Wali Mata Mandir” continues to provide succour though its gates stay locked. People stop by for a few seconds, keeping one eye open for the cops posted in the vicinity, murmur a prayer and hurry on.

The idol of “Curfew Mata” was established 38 years ago in Peer Gate area during a month-long curfew following riots, hence the name. It was open even during the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy, but is now shut for the first time in memory, reports Amarjeet Singh.

The temple is locked but there’s no stopping the devout. On Sunday, the usual crowd of devotees was replaced by half a dozen policemen, tasked with enforcing curfew in letter and spirit — and with a stick, if need be.

People drove or pedalled by, closing eyes in reverence and sending up a silent prayer, before hurrying on lest the cops begin ""enforcing"". But here, the cops are lenient, too. Who would stop a prayer in these times?

Those who paused a while longer got a gentle reminder from police to “leave it to Mata and move on”.

“It’s part of my daily routine to pray at the temple, so I continue doing it. The temple is closed to visitors, and we know it’s good this way, seeing the coronavirus crisis, but something draws me here. I don’t get peace of mind until I see the temple and pay my respects. I’m thankful that I can do this, no matter how briefly,” said devotee Vishal Namdeo , nodding in gratefulness to the cops.

One of the policemen deployed there said there is a steady trickle of devotees, but they all pray for a few seconds and move on. “They come here as if the very sight of the temple reassures them,” he said, adding that only the priest goes inside every morning and evening through a backdoor for the rituals these days.

The temple was established during trying times in the city. Ramesh Saini , 73, president of the 13-member committee that runs the temple, recalls the day it was set up.

“I was around 35 years old when the temple was built in 1982. It was during Navratri that year that an idol of Goddess Durga was established and immersed after nine days. But locals established an idol there and the administration took it away, leading to a dispute. A curfew was imposed but soon people from nearby districts started flocking to the temple though there were arrests every day,” said Saini.

His father Babulal Mali , a Congress functionary, was among the founding members of the temple, Saini said.

“Arjun Singh was the chief minister then, and Vijay Singh the Bhopal collector. Seeing the public sentiment, the administration asked us to establish the idol during the curfew. A puja was done at 5am and the idol was established. This gave the temple its name,"" said Saini.

The temple has never seen such a time, he said, not even during the Bhopal gas tragedy. ""There was no curfew after the tragedy, but the roads were deserted for a long time. We still kept the temple open for entire nights so that anyone who needed help could come to us,” he said.

In the past 38 years, curfew was imposed once or twice but the temple never had to shut. “These are extraordinary times, and require extraordinary measures. On March 28, the administration ordered us to shut the temple completely,” said Saini.

“The goddess is watching over us. This is a trying time. It, too, will pass with Mata’s grace,” he said.

When I saw Prathidhwani help desk, I sent them a message and they helped to buy the remaining provisions,” he said.Vineeth Chandran, secretary of Prathidhwani, said they realised about concerns of deaf persons only when they received Sanu’s message. “After Sanu posted about our support in a group, around 4-5 others with hearing impairment contacted us.

There would be no impact on ongoing plans, programmes and projects of state government, said Mittal, adding that the state assembly and cabinet have already passed the state’s budget of Rs 5.12 lakh crore, so there would be no problem at all.

Kannur: The decision of the Karnataka government to block the main road via Coorg and Makkoottam that connects Kannur with Karnataka, in the name of the lockdown has affected the flow of goods to the state, which has caused concern about scarcity of essential commodities and vegetables .

Though chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan intervened in the matter and the issue was discussed at the chief-secretary level, the road is still blocked after the Karnataka authorities heaped soil on the road near Makkoottam in the Kerala-Karnataka border and elsewhere. He had also written a letter to the Prime Minister on March 27, but in vain.

The stand of Karnataka authorities is that there are alternative routes, said Sunny Joseph, MLA. “When this road is blocked, the trucks have to travel an additional distance of over 100km via Gundlupet and Wayanad to reach Kannur and this would lead to the escalation of price,” he said. If the government failed to address the issue immediately, the scenario would worsen, he added.

Though the Karnataka authorities had promised to open the road via Kutta, it has not been opened till Sunday evening, said Iritty tahsildar K K Divakaran .

“Though the road via Kutta is over 75km longer than Virajpet road, it is shorter than the Gundlupet-Wayanad route, but even now there is no clarity as to when it would be opened,” he said. But the Coorg-Makkoottam road is the most important one which should be opened, he said.

Kannur MP K Sudhakaran also intervened in the issue and talked to the chief secretary and state police chief of Karnataka on Saturday.

Many trucks have got struck in the border and the Union cabinet secretary had strictly said in a video conference with the senior officials of all states recently that the trucks should be permitted to cross the borders, he said. The act of Karnataka is objectionable and this has started creating problems for the people of both the states, said CPM district secretary MV Jayarajan in a statement.

“The global pandemic has not spread to the community in UP…. I repeat coronavirus has not recorded a community spread in the state,” said principal secretary health and family welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad, adding, “Every single case in UP can be traced back to a foreign history.” Global health agencies have listed three stages of Covid-19 transmission; Stage-I in which a country receives imported cases, Stage-II when positive cases pass on the infection to locals, but the source of all cases in known, and Stage-III.

Stage-III is community transmission, when the source of infection is not known for majority of infected population and new positive cases can no longer be traced to diagnosed cases. It is marked by scores of deaths and exponential growth in the number of affected persons as in case of ChinaItaly, France and America.

Prasad also said that only two places in UP can be called clusters — Noida and Meerut — where more than one reported case can be linked to a common source.

“Infection containment activities are being carried out extensively in the two districts. In addition, a special officer has been appointed in Noida to oversee the situation,” Prasad said. It is notable that around 20 confirmed cases in Noida and Ghaziabad are being linked to a common source, while in Meerut one person could have spread the infection to four others besides putting 50 more people at risk.

“Not even one patient in UP has needed intensive care facilities till now,” Prasad said. Sources however informed that though UP is not in ‘community spread’ level, containment strategies have taken requirements for stage-III in mind.

“It is for this that UP was readying over 14,000 isolation beds. It has already launched a three-level containment plan in which treatment facilities from CHC to special tertiary care Covid hospitals will be provided. Training of staff is underway and now private sector is also being engaged widely,” said an officer.

On Saturday, two poultry farm owners of Dabhoi in Vadodara district were arrested for dumping dead chickens in open and failing to maintain cleanliness leading to stench in the entire locality.

Residents of Saguvada village complained to village talati Vanrajsinh Parmar that 2,000 chickens died at the poultry farm of Abdul Golawala and Mohammed Golawala and that the brothers had dumped them in the open. “I was quite shocked on learning this so I rushed to the village on Saturday. The information turned out to be false as only about six chickens had died,” said Parmar. He added that they had dumped the dead chickens in the open and also not cleaned the sheds due to which there was stench in the locality.

“There were bird droppings everywhere in the sheds and it needed immediate cleaning. We are already facing coronavirus scare and can’t afford another infection,” Parmar added. When the two brothers were asked about the untidy farm, they told Parmar due to lockdown all labourers have gone back to their native places and that they cannot clean it alone. Parmar informed Dabhoi police and got Abdul and Mohammed arrested.

“We have registered an offence under IPC sections 278 (making atmosphere noxious to health) and 269 (committing negligent act likely to spread infection or disease dangerous to life) since in the past too they were warned by the talati to keep their farm clean,” said a police official.

Not just Golawala brothers, but several other poultry farm owners are facing labour issues. “All our labourers are from Madhya Pradesh and due to lockdown, they have all gone back and things have come to a standstill here,” said a poultry farm owner.

The victim was on a bike and rammed into the road divider at around 4.45am, while travelling from Madanapalle, Chittoor. “Taking up such a journey on highways full of heavy vehicles is suicidal as the rider can crash due to sleeplessness and fatigue.

Also, only a limited number of hatchlings survived in the other nest, which had around 80 eggs, following which they decided to shift the eggs from the third nest to the Neythal hatchery.Praveen and team are tending to two injured turtles as well, including a critically endangered Hawksbill turtle kept in tanks in the turtle conservation centre.“Getting fish to feed the turtles was a problem due to the lockdown. But police have given permission for one person to go to market to buy fish and we have stocked fish to feed the turtles. While the injured Olive Ridley turtle has lost one flipper and cannot be returned back to the sea, the Hawksbill turtle has been recovering from the injury sustained after getting trapped in an abandoned fishing net,” he added.Though the current turtle nesting season has been in its fag end, Neythal volunteers have been monitoring the beach for newly-laid turtle nests as female turtles return to the same beach from where they first hatched for nesting.Ever since its inception almost two decades back, Neythal has released around 25,000 turtle hatchlings back to the sea in Kasaragod.",kozhikode,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74878299,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61975,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kozhikode/volunteers-guard-endangered-sea-turtles-in-time-of-covid-19/articleshow/74878300.cms

RUDRAPUR: After a 21-day nationwide lockdown call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, migrant workers from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh (UP) decided to march all the way to their native villages from different districts of Uttarakhand. But when these workers, more than 3,000 in number, finally trudged up to the UP border late on Saturday night, they were not allowed entry into their home state by the UP Police officials stationed at the check posts.

An administrative official from Uttarakhand told TOI that UP Police told themthat they don’t have any direction for allowing entry to these workers.

“We were stopped by the UP Police at the UP border in Pulbhatta town. They asked us to go back. With no money and no food, where were we supposed to go,” questions Subhash Yadav , a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh’s Pilibhit district .

“The Union ministry of home affairs has directed states to facilitate movement of migrant workers so that they reach their hometowns safely but UP officials are denying entry to people of their own state,"" said Sushil Gava , a social worker and activist.

Taking cognisance of the plight of these workers, Rudrapur sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Mukta Mishra said that food and lodging for these workers had been arranged in a government college in Fazalpur Mehraula village and in Radha Swami Satsang facility on Kichha Road. “We will hold talks with UP officials and ask them to allow these workers entry into their home state. Meanwhile, the health department is screening these workers,” said SDM Mishra.

Notably, on March 28, the UP government had arranged 1,000 buses to take all the migrant workers from Delhi and drop them to their respective hometowns.

PUNE: The civic body has started tracking the home quarantined people with a specially developed software to check the spread of Covid-19.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), in association with a private software firm, has developed the software that will track people with the help of GPS. The latitude and longitude of these citizens’ houses will be used to check if they are properly following the quarantine regulations.

Around 2,200 home quarantined people, who have international travel history, will be tracked with this cellphone-based software. “Mobile links were send to the citizens on Saturday,” a PMC official said, adding that it was activated from Sunday.

The civic officials said the home-quarantined citizens would have to download the application and their monitoring would be done by the PMC’s information technology (IT) department.

The GPS on the cellphone handset would be used to track the home-quarantined people or the travellers. An SMS text sent to them has the link to download the application. The PMC has collected the data of people in home quarantine. The data includes the people’s phone numbers, residence addresses, their longitude and latitude and the GPS coordinates.

“If a person leaves home, we get an update on our software. His or her movement will be tracked through it. These movements are expected to show the locations within the house,” Rahul Jagtap, head of the PMC’s IT department, told TOI on Sunday.

PMC officials said a backup of the phones would also be taken by calling frequently the people staying at home. Both offline information and online data would be matched to see if the patient was in isolation or not. “In some cases, civic officials may give a surprise visit to the residence of a home-quarantined persons to check if he or she is at home. The details about people not following the norms would be sent to the authorities. Legal action will be taken against the violators. Criminal offence may be filed against them,” a senior PMC official said.

Vijayawada: A number of educational institutions in the state are switching over to online classes to utilise the 21-day lockdown period. From addressing queries to assigning homework, institutes are using technology to ensure students stay in touch with coursework.

Online participative learning has received a positive response among students appearing for class X board examinations this year. With board examinations getting deferred twice within the span of a month and uncertainty over the exam schedule amidst the lockdown, students are resorting to online classes and counselling sessions from teachers.

Speaking to TOI, Gitam University VC Prof K Siva Ramakrishna said they have been offering online classes through the supercomputer-powered Centre for Advanced Solutions.

“The students are informed beforehand about the schedule of the online classes. We want to make sure that the students do not fall back in their academics or the curriculum and are switching over to digital learning tools during the lockdown period. Moreover, we can stream the lessons to our students across the country,” said Prof Ramakrishna.

M Vijay Kumar, a physical sciences teacher at a private school in Vijayawada said that a personal computer or laptop with an internet connection, or even a smartphone is sufficient for virtual learning. “Besides offering online classes/video materials, we can even assess the performance of the students through the same platforms by conducting online tests. We are also getting accommodated to the situation during the lockdown as well as embracing digital learning tools,” said Kumar.

R Naveen, a class X student, said students have also been told they may video call teachers at any time to clarify queries.

VIJAYAWADA: Police arranged transport for two women in two separate incidents as lockdown measures have made commuting a near impossible affair.

Police helped a pregnant woman having labour pains to reach hospital. The family members could not find any vehicle due to lockdown. Finally they approached Bhavanipuram police for help and inspector D K N Mohan Reddy shifted her to hospital in his vehicle.

According to Mohan Reddy, the doctors had given probable date of delivery on April 10. However, on Saturday night she developed some complications and experienced pain. As her husband who works in an optical shop went to Guntur and was held up there with lockdown, she called her mother who lives in the same neighbourhood.

On Sunday morning, the mother tried to get an auto but could not as the autos were not plying and those who came out refused to take her due to lockdown. Their efforts to get an ambulance dialing 108 did not succeed.

Finally the neighbours urged them to call the police station for help.

In another incident, the Krishna district SP M Ravindranath Babu helped an elderly woman suffering from elephantiasis who was stuck at Pedana reach her home in Guntur by arranging an autorickshaw for her transport.

289,['30/03/2020'],"With no way out of city, parcels pile up","Chennai: There are mounds of parcels waiting to be shipped off, but there are no means to dispatch them. This is the situation in Chennai Central and the city’s postal head office on Anna Salai. Despite the nationwide lockdown to fight Covid-19, 40,000-odd employees in 12,000 post offices in the state are being forced to show up at work and man deserted counters.

The employees continue to use biometric attendance to punch in despite an advisory against it from the Centre, and those delivering posts door-to-door in the city haven’t been given masks, gloves or sanitisers.

Every day, post offices in TN deliver an average of one lakh posts to every nook and corner of the state. Since the lockdown began on Tuesday last, thousands of parcels including important legal notices, financial statements and registered posts, lie undispatched. With limited number of mail vans, a majority of the posts were dispatched to concerned states/districts through trains and buses. Now that road transportation and rail services are cut off, what’s the point of making their lives miserable by keeping post offices open, ask employees. They have requested the chief postmaster general for complete closure of the facilities fearing this could endanger their lives.

Even before the national lockdown was formally announced, private couriers had cut back on services and stopped accepting bookings, leaving post offices as the last resort for the public.

On Tuesday (March 24), all bookings in Chennai were stocked and sent to the major Rail Mail Service (RMS) points — Chennai Central and Egmore railway stations. With no trains leaving, that night, parcels at Egmore were moved to Ekkatuthangal post office so they can be dispatched to the southern districts through the last truck leaving. But on Sunday, the parcels at Central were yet to be cleared.

After a week’s wait, around 2,000 consignments were likely to be dispatched through special trains to Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi sectors on Monday morning, said a postal department source. These are mostly magazines, invitations, pamphlets and in other words ‘not-so-urgent’ items, said the source.

“But the 7,000 items at Anna Road head office in Chennai were registered posts which contained legal notices, financial statements, personal communications and other important items that couldn’t be dispatched. It’s bad that the post offices are still open despite this,” the source added.

How can it be ‘essential’ services when the needs aren’t fulfilled, ask employees. “What is the benefit in providing such facilities in the name of essential services when booked articles have no further disposal except for lying idle, either in the post office or hubs gathering dust,” asked N J Uthayakumaran, Chennai circle secretary of National Association of Postal Employees (Nape). Such hoarding can lead to important parcels like medicines and equipment getting buried in the mounds as employees will not know what’s inside them, he added.

“For cash withdrawals, there are ATMs in every street corner and in all post offices. So there is no need for employees to be physically present in the offices,” Uthayakumaran said in his letter to the chief postmaster general, urging for the post offices to be shut.

Vijayawada: Minister of energy, environment and forests Balineni Srinivas Reddy in a review meeting with officials of the energy department on Sunday asked power utilities to prioritise supply to hospitals and the healthcare sector.

He instructed senior officials to be ready with teams to address supply outages, especially in hospitals. With domestic demand set to rise with increasing temperatures, the minister directed power utilities to ensure round-the-clock supply to all households in the state.

Power demand in the state fell by around 25% the week after the 21-day lockdown was imposed, the energy department has said.

With negligible demand from industry and commercial establishments, power demand fell from 200 million units (MU) in the week prior to the lockdown to 150 MU during the first week of the lockdown.

The state government has also placed power utilities on high alert to ensure uninterrupted supply to the domestic sector as well as agriculture as several crops are at the pre-harvesting stage.

Following the fall in demand, power generating stations with a capacity of 3,370 MW under AP Genco have been shut down. This includes five units in Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP), four units at Dr Narla Tatarao Thermal Power Plant Station (Dr NTPPS), one unit in SDSTPS, one unit in Kudigi and a 40 MW plant in Valluru.

291,['30/03/2020'],Well-crafted messages on Covid-19 by Pune police get more listeners,"<p>The police use the PA system to tell people about coronavirus<br></p>

PUNE: Audios and videos seem to communicate better what monologues cannot. The Pune police have come up with a novel way to ensure that their instructions to people on securing a complete lockdown till April 14, are followed diligently.

The police started extensive use of the public address system for sensitising people. They have now switched to audios and videos in simple language to tell people about coronavirus. They have sought help from singers, writers and others to prepare audios and videos in Hindi and English.

Deputy commissioner of police (zone I) Swapna Gore told TOI, “When people come out on roads, we have to sensitise them. It is difficult to manage the core city areas particularly the heavily congested lanes and bylanes. The PA system was used by the beat marshals and policemen on CR mobiles after the lockdown was announced. We have now prepared audios and videos in Marathi appealing to the public to follow the government’s directives. We are also playing the audios on the PA system installed on autorickshaws. People are listening more attentively to the messages.”

Senior inspector Ashok Kadam from the Warje-Malwadi police said, “We have started playing Marathi audio messages at six places including Ramnagar and Gokulnagar-Pathar slums and outside housing societies to prevent elderly people and others from coming out. The audios also contain details about what is section 144 of the CrPC and the various orders issued and what are the emergency helpline numbers. The audios and videos have also been circulated on various WhatsApp groups launched by the citizens’ group for creating massive awareness,”he added.

Senior inspector Bramhanand Naikawdi from Swargate police said, “Vehicle users are stopped on Solapur and Satara highways, Tilak Road and other places and made to listen to the five-minute audio on social distancing. The audios contain initiatives bypolice on coronavirus. We ask them questions on what they understood and then allow them to go.”

Marketing professional Vinod Mehta said, “The announcements on the PA system on coronavirus are too formal and not appealing because people get stressed when the same message is recited. The playing of recorded messages in an innovative style on the PA system is more appealing and effective in sensitising the public in the slums.”

292,['30/03/2020'],Govt doubles ration quota for next 3 months,"Amaravati: In a major relief to the poor, the state government has decided to double the free ration supply for three months. A family of four, which is presently getting 20 kgs of rice a month, would now get 40 kg for three months and the entire supply will be free. But instead of giving the entire 40 kgs of rice at one go, the government would distribute ration twice a month that would facilitate rice cardholders to easily carry the stock home. This means that each cardholder would get ration six times in the next three months. After the April quota of ration distribution, which started on Sunday, there would be another five free ration distribution till the end of June.

“Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy has already announced that April quota of ration will be given free of cost and directed officials to double the quota for three months keeping in view the lockdown conditions,” civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar told TOI.

He explained that the decision to give three-month ration in six equal parts has been taken keeping in view several factors. “While it is easy for the people to carry 20kg/30kg depending on the number of family members at home, it also resolves the issues of transportation of goods till the depot,” said Sasidhar. He said that the government would also distribute one kg dal per month free of cost.

He said the distribution of rice and dal has begun across the state early on Sunday as they had successfully sent the stocks to the depots by Saturday in spite of several troubles in cargo movement. He, however, pointed out that availability of ‘hamalis’ or porters in the godowns has emerged as a big issue, as many workers are unable to reach the godowns due to the lockdown restrictions.

Meanwhile, long queues were seen at all ration shops across the state on Sunday. With the civil supplies department issuing detailed guidelines for distribution of rice and dal, the officials visited each and every shop to ensure that social distancing was maintained during the distribution.

They also ensured that cardholders cleaned their hands before collecting the ration. The dealers were also directed to wear face masks as part of containment measures. About 1.4 crore cardholders would benefit from the measure.

The police said that the some people weren’t heeding repeated requests from the police and revenue officials and breaking the lockdown rules. At many places, policemen lost their cool and caned people roaming on the roads, which attracted sharp criticism against cops for beating people.

In order to avoid criticism and at the same time to enforce deterrence, the police have been adopting alternative methods.

In Bapatla, the police made lockdown violators do sit-ups. At Gannavaram in Krishna district, officials took a similar step as punitive action to restrict people’s movement during the lockdown period.

But on the other hand, another video cropped up in social media on Saturday in which the cops were seen beating up some persons in a village of Anantapur district. The cops were seen abusing them in filthy language apart from beating them. The victims are supposedly village volunteers.

Last week, tension prevailed in Hanuman Junction in Krishna district after the police lathi-charged and thrashed journalists on duties.

Another video showed police charging against people who stood outside their homes and beating up a woman and a man at Tadepalli in Guntur district. Some of the videos also included people showing their injury marks.

The group of labourers was demanding permission to go to their native places while the police teams were enforcing lockdown and asked these people to stay put in their homes. In Pandesara majority of the labourers are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and were alleging that they are not getting regular food supply and not being allowed to go to their native places either.

During the clash, the crowd of angry migrants also pelted stones and damaged a few police vehicles. To control the riotous crowd, police lobbed teargas shells and also fired in the air. Police force comprising more than 250 policemen, state reserve police (SRP) battalion personnel and cops from special operation group, prevention of crime branch and detection of crime branch rushed to the spot to control the situation.

""The residents were demanding permission to let them go while police were requesting them to stay at their homes. The situation turned tense and the crowd attacked police. The unruly situation was immediately brought under control by the police using maximum force to ensure peace in the area,"" said city police commissioner, R B Brahmbhatt.

Police teams started patrolling in the area and have also started investigating to find out if the labourers were instigated by some community leaders.

Senior police officials have expressed concerns in the past couple of days about the rising demand of migrant labourers to be allowed to go back to their native places.

Apart from ensuring lockdown in the city areas police are facing the biggest challenge in controlling the movement of these migrant labourers, who are trying various options to reach home across the borders.

297,['30/03/2020'],Corona-induced stress? Tech can help,"Amaravati: The George Institute of India has carried out a research study in West Godavari district using technology-enabled solutions to screen and manage mental health and found insightful results. The research findings were published in the recent issue of Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR).

The findings gain in significance as a nation-wide lockdown being declared, one of the groups to be worst hit are people with mental health issues. Given that patients are being triaged at this crucial time and transport has been suspended, many might fail to access psychiatrists and psychologist. Moreover, the outbreak of coronavirus has added to people’s anxiety.

Titled “Technology-enabled Systematic Medical Appraisal Referral and Treatment (SMART) Mental Health services in rural India”, the study corroborates the fact that technology-enabled mental health services can help mitigate the risks posed by the corona scare. “Technology was used as an enabler to deliver mental health services for screening, diagnosing and managing common mental disorders (CMD) such as stress, depression and suicidal risk in 12 intervention villages in West Godavari district,” Pallab Maulik, deputy director, and director of research at the George Institute of India told TOI. “The findings are encouraging and with some training, mental health workforce can be expanded to tackle challenges posed by situations such as the coronavirus scare in the coming weeks and months,” he said.

This is important in the light of the fact that both during the current COVID-19 crisis and following that, one is likely to see an increase of stress, depression, and anxiety. While the immediate need is to address the respiratory infections, an unaddressed need is management of stress in both the community and among health workers, said research experts.

He said the government would now start registering cases on such complaints. He assured the house-owners that the AAP government would compensate them if the tenants failed to pay the rent even after a relaxation of one to two months.Kejriwal’s announcement came after the exodus of migrants working as daily wagers in the capital peaked on Saturday with thousands of them reaching Anand Vihar ISBT in search of some means of transport to take them to their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Bihar. Some leaders of opposition parties and the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar had questioned Kejriwal on Saturday on allowing the migrants to return to their native places despite the complete lockdown.“Please stay wherever you are — that is the lockdown mantra. If you continue to go back to your native places, this country will fail in the fight against coronavirus,” the chief minister said at a press conference on Sunday. “We have seen what has happened in some of the developed countries like US and Italy. Thankfully, India has not reached that stage yet. But going into a crowd will invite the risk of infection,” he added.He said that even if just two-three people among thousands of those who reached Anand Vihar ISBT on Saturday were infected by coronavirus, thousands of others will get infected. “A lot of villages are not affected by the pandemic for now. You will expose your family and villages to the risk of Covid-19 ,” said the CM.In an appeal issued earlier on Sunday, Kejriwal said the AAP government had made arrangements in schools for migrants to stay and was even getting stadiums vacated in case the need arose.

As states rushed to seal their borders on Sunday to stem the avalanche of migrant workers on a long march home from different directions, the enormity of the Covid-19 fight grew to include another daunting task — of medically screening and providing food, transport, shelter and a sliver of hope to those already halfway down roads to the hinterland.

Jaipur was swamped with hungry and weary migrant workers and their families who had set out from parts of Gujarat and Maharashtra after the lockdown started at midnight last Tuesday. Most of them had walked and occasionally hitched rides on goods vehicles in the hope of reaching their villages in Mathura, Agra, Aligarh and other districts of UP. At Transport Nagar in Jaipur, cops were kept busy since Saturday night by hordes of migrants asking for directions. The state government arranged for buses to take these people home, but there were far too many of them to be accommodated. Those who couldn’t board a bus decided to continue walking. Food packets provided by NGOs quickly ran out. “Since Saturday night, 35,000 migrant workers have passed by,” said a policeman.

At least 1.25 lakh migrant labourers who arrived in the state from Gujarat and Maharastra were screened by the teams of medical and health department on Sunday. For migrants returning to Rajasthan from other states, medical screening centres have been set up in Dungarpur, Banswara, Udaipur, Jalore, Sirohi and Ajmer. “Screening has is been on since Thursday. With numbers increasing on Saturday, extra teams have been deployed in various districts to ensure proper screening,"" additional chief secretary (health) Rohit Kumar Singh said.

In MP, the influx of migrant labour from Delhi-Ghaziabad intensified on Sunday. Those headed from the north have to reach Morena after crossing the Chambal river from Dholpur in neighbouring Rajasthan. More than 3,000 people had reached the MP-Rajasthan border in Morena till 5pm. Hundreds more are on the way.

""They are being stopped at three checkpoints in Morena. Their numbers are going up. We have teams of doctors screening them for Covid-19 on the border before they are allowed to move further,"" Morena collector Priyanka Das said.

After being fed, these migrants are being provided transport for the onward journey to their respective villages.

Hundreds from the Saharia tribe are also moving back to Sheopur from Rajasthan. Inward migration is already proving to be a problem in Barwani district. Thousands from there migrate to Maharashtra, Gujarat and southern states in search of work. They are flooding back now.

Also, since the Agra-Mumbai highway passes through Barwani district, those headed for UP and Rajasthan are also streaming in. Two shelters have been set up on the MP- Maharashtra border.

In UP, the Agra district administration requested the Army to help take stranded migrants to their destination. a day after a delivery boy of a Delhi restaurant died after walking 200km from the capital to Agra. Besides 10 Army trucks, over 300 state buses operated on different routes. Another 100 buses took migrants from Bareilly to various places.

From Lucknow, 721 buses ferried 60,000 people to different parts of the state. CM Yogi Adityanath visited the Mohan toll plaza in the morning to take stock of the arrangements made for migrant workers. Aligarh DM CB Singh said around 3 lakh migrant workers had so far been ferried on buses to different districts of UP and neighbouring states.

The Bihar government has decided to keep migrant workers returning from different states in camps being set up in the border districts. Everyone returning by road will have to spend at least 14 days in a camp. Additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani said the state was contemplating fixing a deadline by which people returning from other states would be allowed in. However, as reported by PTI, those marching towards their native villages in Bihar and elsewhere are not being welcomed back home and instead are reported to the police, who are handing them over to medical authorities for tests and subsequent measures. Some villages in Bihar have gone into lockdown, refusing entry of people from neighbouring areas.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has already expressed reservations about Delhi and UP’s decision to send stranded daily-wage workers to the state. Siwan native Bhagat Kumar Gond and nine others reached their villages on Sunday, travelling nearly 500km from Kanpur on so-called ""jugaad"" vehicles. Rajkumar Prasad and seven others who worked in a shoe factory in Kanpur returned walking through highways for more than two days. Kundan Kumar, from Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad, said he and 70 others boarded a truck to reach Aurangabad in Bihar. ""Each one of us paid Rs 1,000 to be taken till the Bihar border,"" he said.

In Karnataka , CM BS Yediyurappa said after an all-party meeting on Sunday that the government was arranging shelter and medical screening for those stranded on the state borders. Around 1,000 migrant Kannadiga workers are now stuck along the state's borders with Goa and Maharashtra. After the state government set up a helpline for migrant workers on Saturday, it logged 2,833 calls in 12 hours.

Kerala's Kottayam district saw migrant workers from UP, Bihar, Bengal and Odisha hit the streets of Paippad town demanding food, water and transport to return to their respective states. District collector PK Sudheer Babu said food had been arranged for these workers till April 15.

A group of migrant workers headed for north India from Andhra Pradesh in a container vehicle was stopped while passing through Telangana 's Gadwal Jogulamba district. Another group on their way to Maharashtra from Hyderabad was stopped at Patancherru. They have been provided food and shelter, officials said.

In Odisha, which shares borders with AP, Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the HC on Sunday directed the state government to make arrangements in the border districts to medically screen migrant workers returning in droves and give them food and shelter.

HYDERABAD: Railway employees of freight trains in SCR have complained of lack of masks and sanitisers on trains.

“Officials and workers in signal and telecommunications, engineering departments and gatemen work on tracks and we deal with them on a daily basis. There is a significant shortage of masks, gloves and hand sanitisers,” an employee told TOI.

Track machine employees have also urged the authorities to stop their work as they were being asked to work in groups with nary a care for social distancing. Locomotive pilots have also demanded the sanitization of freight train cabins.

Locomotive pilots also highlighted the shortage of sanitisers. “The locomotives, of which we take charge at various crew changing points, need to be sanitised,” an assistant locomotive pilot of a goods train said.

Meanwhile, to negate any possibility of contracting infections, the mandatory breathalyser has been done away with for crew operating freight trains, an SCR official release said. “To implement the measure and ensure no compromise on safety, locomotive inspectors have been deputed to keep a stringent check. Likewise, manual signing of attendance registers in lieu of biometric verification has also been arranged,” said chief public relations officer of SCR, Ch Rakesh.

“The breathalyser is next to the Crew Management System (CMS) machine in the same kiosk in most places. Both the machines get used multiple times in an hour. We have taken steps to avoid any spread of infection through them,” he added. In a letter dated March 27, the Railway Board stated that crew members with history of alcoholism will not be allowed the relaxation. They will be required to provide a declaration stating they are not under influence of alcohol.

Nagpur: The Wardha district administration, along with some non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ), has swung into action to check mass exodus of migrant workers from other states.

The administration is looking after lodging facilities for the migrants while the NGOs are providing food and grocery items.

The district and state borders have been sealed following the 21-day countrywide lockdown. Still several labourers are leaving for their states on foot. They mostly belong Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.

Several small groups of labourers were tracked down by the Wardha administration, police and NGOs. Between Saturday and Sunday, the administration has rescued around 780 workers.

Wardha sub-divisional officer Suresh Bagale told TOI that lodging and food was arranged for around 780 migrants with the help of NGOs. “These workers were brought from different locations. They were convinced to stay back until the situation improves. They belong to different states and were leaving the district on foot in small groups. Several camps have been put up on premises of some companies, dharamshalas and at a library. They are being provided all the necessary items,” he said.

Bagale also claimed that around 370 labourers were working with two companies appointed for construction of Samruddhi Mahamarg. “We helped them get their one month salary which was on hold due to the lockdown. Health officers conducted their medical check-up at different locations,” Bagale said.

Dr Sachin Pawde, president of NGO Vaidakiya Jan Jagruti Manch, told TOI that several NGOs are providing the migrant workers bags containing grocery items. Till now around 60 bags have been distributed. “The NGOs are also working to provide these packets to other daily wage labourers who cannot afford to buy food due to lockdown,” he said.

“Labourers from not only Wardha city but from nearby villages like Selu are also being brought to these rescue camps. We are also spraying sodium hypochlorite disinfectant at these locations. Till now, all the migrants are fine and only some of them have complained about mild cough and cold for which medicines have been provided,” Bagale said.

In a statement on Saturday, GFP president Vijai Sardesai said the panic across the state over short supply of essentials is a result of the fact that the government was “never prepared for such an enormous crisis” as BJP was more focused on the “inconsequential” zilla panchayat election.

“BJP, led by its president Sadanand Tanavade, has chosen to blame the opposition for this chaotic situation. This is a clear attempt to shift focus and shield their incompetent and indecisive chief minister who has been committing flip-flops,” Sardesai said. Stating that the effective enforcement of a lockdown does not mean starving people of their need for food and medicine, the former deputy chief minister said, “It becomes imperative that the government ensures steady and unhindered supply of essential commodities.”

Earlier, Sardesai lauded Rane for having stepped up to deal with the health emergency. “We suggest that sample tests be conducted in the neighborhood of the three people who tested positive for Covid-19, to determine the extent of community transmission, if any ,” he said.

VISAKHAPATNAM: The Covid-19 pandemic and 21-day lockdown are bound to take a toll on the psychological health of people, say experts. Given the prevailing conditions, lack of socialising, with routine life and economy thrown off gear, people are bound to suffer from anxiety and stress. It could also worsen existing mental health issues such as depression.

Mental health experts advise staying productive to stay calm. Dr C Radhakanth, professor of psychiatry NRI Institute of Medical Sciences and consultant psychiatrist at Apollo Hospital, averred, “Under such a scenario, crisis management is important. Focus on the goals, behaviours and tasks, which have to be accomplished. Use the lockdown to get in touch with friends, family members, loved ones and well-wishers through phone and social media. It is an opportunity to introspect, re-assess and come up with new plans for the post-crisis period.”

Dr S Radharani, medical superintendent of Government Hospital for Mental Care said, “Both the disease and the lockdown are adding to anxiety, depression and apprehension. Restlessness grips as people cannot go outdoors and are socially isolated. Their routine life is disturbed, for some, it is work from home, for some others without this opportunity, anxiety and fear about salary remains. The high chances of an economic slowdown, business breakdown is also affecting people’s mind. Overworked and exposed to the virus risk, police are becoming aggressive and stressed. The unending information on social media, whether fact or rumour is adding to the panic and anxiety. In the coming months, post-traumatic stress disorder is bound is increase.”

CCP, the first in the state to announce a home delivery system of essentials to its residents, came under fire from Kuncalienkar, who accused the civic body of clandestinely diverting rations from government stores to private stores and selling it to public at exorbitant rates. Tagging the chief minister in a tweet, Kuncalienkar requested him and Monserrate to “investigate and punish people who are cheating Panaji & making money in these times of crisis”.

Kuncalienkar also uploaded a picture of a sugar packet from Goa Sahakar Bhandar and claimed CCP was selling it at Rs 57.5.

319,['30/03/2020'],"Chicken, fish back in vogue as veggie prices touch sky","Vijayawada: People ignored social distancing norms at their peril while buying fish , chicken and other non-vegetarian items in the city on Sunday. Despite the lockdown, major markets selling non-vegetarian food remained open in the city on Sunday.

Chuttugunta, Patamata and other Sunday markets witnessed big crowds. The majority of sellers and buyers moved in the markets without wearing masks or using hand sanitisers.

The state government’s statements promoting poultry and aqua food might have led to the rush in markets. “A strong immune system is very important in the fight against coronavirus. Chicken and fish are cheaper protein providers and we prefer them,” said Goli Govardhan, a buyer at the Durgapuram market.

The public ignored the announcements made by VMC via public address system to maintain social distance at meat stalls. At a few markets, police were seen controlling the crowd.

VMC authorities had arranged hand sanitisers at multiple locations and educated the public about maintaining hygiene. The health wing of the VMC held inspections at a few meat markets in the city. They imposed fines on a few traders at Kothapeta fish market for unhygienic conditions prevailing at the shop.

VMC authorities said that they will implement a plan to regulate the crowd at Sunday markets.

Vijaywada Municipal Corporation (VMC) has set up 25 makeshift vegetable markets in the city and introduced door delivery of groceries.

Meanwhile, for the first time in recent times, chicken prices touched Rs 200 a kilogram in major cities of Andhra Pradesh on Sunday. Those in the business say the price is likely to rise further due to increased demand and shortage of supply.

With doctors advising protein-rich food to boost the immune system in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, and government dispelling rumours linking non-vegetarian food and coronavirus transmission there has been a surge in the demand.

The price of broiler chicken in Vijayawada touched a record high, since the coronavirus outbreak in the county, on Sunday, with prices rising to Rs 200 per kg. While country chicken (Natu Kodi) sold for Rs 650 per kg, said a retail vendor of Baaji Chicken Centre, Krishna Lanka.

“We expect the demand for chicken (broiler and country) at restaurants, which have been offering takeaway service, to go up in the coming days as people have realised that chicken is a protein-rich food, which can improve immunity,” said Sk Madina, a retail chicken vendor in Vijayawada. “Last Sunday, we managed to sell only 50 kgs of chicken, but this Sunday we sold over 150 kgs of broiler and 50 kgs of country chicken,” he added.

“Demand for the chicken has surged and we are happy. A majority of poultry farmers have cleared their stocks fearing losses. Hence, we are running short of live birds. It will take at least two months to boost production. The price of dressed chicken may touch Rs 300 per kg in the meantime,” said K Satish Reddy, a chicken vendor and member of Amaravati Poultry Traders’ Association.

“Be it because of panic buying or more awareness, people have been thronging meat shops, resulting in 100% price rise (from Rs 100 to Rs 200 a kg) within a few days. If the situation continues, we have to either be prepared to pay more or give up eating chicken, said A Tarun, a consumer. The price of eggs has also increased to Rs 5 from Rs 4 in the retail market.

326,['30/03/2020'],"No food in Goa, no aid from UK embassy, Brit tourists rue their fate","Panaji: The chaotic lockdown in Goa, marked by volte-faces and chronic mismanagement, is now bringing the state government international shame. On Sunday, AC Milan goalkeeper Asmir Begovic sent out a public plea on Twitter, seeking help for a 67-year-old British national stuck in Goa. The woman, a mother of his close friend and agent, has been struggling to get her hands on even food and water, he said.

She isn’t the only one. There are a thousand-odd individuals from Britain alone stranded in the state. After Goa, along with the rest of India, was abruptly thrown into lockdown, stranded tourists were left with no time to prepare for what is turning into a humanitarian crisis, and stranded foreigners are now left with no way to return home.

In Agonda in South Goa, Jewel Travis, 35, is stuck with nothing more than home-made bread bought from a friendly neighbour. “Initially it was announced that it would be a one day lockdown, so many of us went and got ourselves a bag of crisps (chips) and something to drink. Six days later, our food has run out. We need food, bread, milk and eggs,” said Travis.

Their plight is shared by stranded Brits across India. In Dehradun, 260km from New Delhi, 39-year old Jude Wight Nayar is holed up with his 71-year old aunt, surviving on biscuits, bread and any food provided by locals.

The resident of Earlsfield has desperately been trying to get the British Embassy to repatriate him.

“My aunt, Anne Bailey, 71, is with me and she is stressed out and worried about her 95-year old mum back home,” said Nayar, who works with a supermarket store in the UK.

“Other European countries have come in and taken their citizens out, and if you think about it, UK has done nothing to evacuate us. I have to say that they have been very, very slow.”

An online petition to compel the UK government to organise repatriation flights for those stuck in India has received support from 33,000 people.

With food, medicines and money running out, British tourists stranded in India feel that the UK foreign office has been unresponsive. With a week gone by, the Britishers have watched as citizens from Russia, Germany, Czech Republic and France have been rescued by their respective countries.

At 3am on Sunday, a relief flight took 29 passengers back home to the Czech Republic from Goa International Airport. Thousands of UK citizens are thought to be stuck in India, with the last return flight taking off from Goa in the wee hours of Wednesday.

“We are in a complete lockdown with no shops open. How are we supposed to eat and survive?” asked Jessica Mialee.

“We continue to work urgently on a plan to get you home — more information coming soon. Please be assured that if you have received an autoreply, my team is looking at your email and will respond ASAP. Please look after yourselves,” said acting British High Commissioner to India, Jan Thompson, in a statement to the stranded Brits.

The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in India has crossed 1,000, and many UK citizens are worried that as the number of positive cases rises, the UK may seal its borders.

327,['30/03/2020'],Mumbai: Housing societies cook extra for guards struggling to find food,"Dabba service has stopped and accessing transport is difficult for guards

MUMBAI: With the lockdown restricting movement and making access to groceries especially difficulty for those still working out of home, housing societies across the city are cooking extra meals for their security staff who otherwise depend on a now unavailable dabba service or home-cooked meal.

A Vile Parle resident spoke about how her building has even provided accommodation for a watchman within the building so that he does not have to commute to work and every flat owner takes turns to provide him with three meals and chai. Another housing society in Thane and some in Kandivli, too, have devised a rota which assigns cooking duty to different residents on different days.

The meals are simple but hearty, comprising dal, chawal, sabzi and the occasional regional delicacy.

At Dosti Imperia, Manpada, residents are taking turns to cook for over 50 watchmen who work in the complex.

“Each building has 11 watchmen who work in two shifts. Since everyone is rationing their resources, we decided to each take turns and cook for one watchman during every meal instead of one person cooking for all of them. This way, it will be more sustainable for them and us,” said a resident.

At another building in Thane, a watchman who lives in the premises is unable to buy his meals like he usually did. Ever since, members are cooking for hm to ensure he does not go hungry.

Artist Sukesha Chandarana, resident of Shree Balasinor Coop Housing Society at Kandivli (West) which comprises 67 bungalows, said the move came immediately after the national lockdown was announced. “We had a committee meeting and some of us youngsters suggested to lock down the society and restrict people from coming in and going out. So we requested our seven watchmen to stay back in the building itself. They agreed and we provided them with accommodation in the society office. We also assured them of all four meals,” she said.

Chandarana said the women in the society have a group and they decided the schedule. “While one each would be in charge of breakfast and tea, all others would take turns to provide lunch and dinner. The food comprises normal ghar ka khaana—khichadi, sabzi ,” she said.

Photographer Jui Patravali of Arco Coop Housing Society, Vile Parle (East), said this was quickest decision the residents of the five-year-old building have made. “Everyone reached a consensus in five minutes,” said Patravali. The seven-storey building housing around 20 families has one watchman, Ajay, who is in his early 20s. “We wanted him to stay inside the building to protect him from the virus so he was provided accommodation.

These labourers are among the nearly 12,000 migrant labourers from Bihar, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam who are left jobless due to the lockdown and are stuck and unable to return to their home towns.

On Sunday, A Sankar, a consumer activist from Tuticorin, noticed an audio message in a WhatsApp group with the contact number of labourer Shanthi from Pappapatti in Madurai who is stranded without food and is also finding it difficult to pay her house rent in Kochi due to the lockdown as she and her husband are left without jobs. They were among the many construction workers from the state who have been stranded in Kochi.

“I called her and said that we will not be able to bring her home, which is her main demand. I reached out to my Facebook friend K Karthick who is the Ernakulam district police superintendent. He said the place is not under his jurisdiction and also referred to G Poonguzhali the deputy commissioner of police of Kochi, who extended help to the stranded people,” said Sankar. Poonguzhali told TOI that there were 230 people from 55 Tamil families in the locality where Shanthi is stranded and that their city police team is helping out more than 1,500 such people from Tamil Nadu due to the lockdown. “The police are playing the role of the first responders,” she said.

Besides being faster, tests will also become cheaper The World Health Organisation (WHO) rules state laboratories should be capable of conducting real time polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) that involves converting virus RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA). This requires skilled technicians with knowledge of molecular biology and a number of lab accessories along with approved testing-kits. However, India has a limited number of RT-PCR instruments and only large government and private diagnostic labs have access to them currently.“We have received approval from competent authorities to allow us to work on Covid-19. To begin with, we will help NABL-approved laboratories to use our equipment to conduct tests,” said Prof Umesh Varshney, chairman of biological sciences division, IISc.With the scale of infrastructure available at IISc, the number of Covid-19 tests conducted in a day can be ramped up by 1,000. It is expected to boost the government’s ongoing efforts to curb the spread of the virus.Currently, eight labs in the state conduct about 600 tests per day, which experts say is too little to judge the gravity of the pandemic. So far, the government has conducted about 3,000 tests of which about 82 have returned positive. Experts say more testing is needed.“We suspect there are many more infected people. The only way to get them under the scanner is to scale up the number of tests,” said Dr CN Manjunath, director, Jayadeva Institute of Cardiology and nodal officer for Covid-19 lab tests.Manjunath said the government’s efforts to procure indigenously developed reagents (chemical compounds required to conduct tests) and rapid test kits is among other initiatives aimed at ramping up tests. He said with these rapid kits, test results would be known in 15 minutes, while the conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests take a much longer time.In another initiative, IISc’s instrumentation of applied physics division has proposed to develop mobile diagnostic laboratories capable of collecting and processing samples (BSL-2) and perform Covid-19 tests.“The turnaround time for 12 samples would be three hours. Also, it substantially reduces costs,” said Prof Sai Siva Gorti, associate professor at instrumentation and applied sciences division.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/iisc-equipment-to-make-testing-faster-cheaper/articleshow/74879570.cms

A source close to the CM’s office said the government had its “plate full” following the lockdown decision and wanted to “channelise energy” in providing relief to vulnerable people. The decision was taken by MHA and Delhi government was not even taken into confidence, he said.

“The Union home ministry is the cadre-controlling authority of bureaucrats in the capital and Delhi government has no role to play. It is the Centre’s prerogative to appoint or transfer IAS and DANICS officers in Delhi or take punitive action against them,” said an official on the condition of anonymity.

The officers who were suspended on Sunday evening with immediate effect are additional chief secretary (transport) Renu Sharma and principal secretary (finance) Rajeev Verma. Additional chief secretary (home) Satya Gopal and SDM (Seelampur) Ajay Arora have been show-caused.

Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal indicated during a meeting with Kerjwal on Sunday about the actions, the source said. Baijal himself wrote to the CM the same day expressing his displeasure over the way Delhi government handled the issue of migrant exodus and its failure to provide basic amenities to make them stay back.

Scores of workers started gathering at Anand Vihar ISBT on the Delhi-UP border in violation of the lockdown on Saturday. The decision to use DTC buses to ferry them to the UP border and ISBT has been at the centre of discussion.

Delhi government was accused by UP for not doing enough to hold back migrants, a charge that has been denied. UP government subsequently made arrangements to transport people to hinterland destinations to clear the logjam.

336,['30/03/2020'],Plea to reverse bifurcation of milk society: HC seeks govt response,"Madurai: Madras high court has sought response from the state government in a plea sought to reverse the bifurcation of Tirunelveli District Cooperative Milk Producers Union.

The petitioners – S Niraikulathan, U Natarajan, S Subbiah – stated that the daily average milk procurement from the societies to the union in both the districts stood at about 64,000 litres including 31,500 litres and 33,500 litres from Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts respectively.

Based on a GO dated August 22, 2019, the Tirunelveli District Cooperative Milk Producers Union was bifurcated and Tuticorin District Cooperative Milk Producers Union was formed.

They noted that the GO was passed without considering the opinion of the stakeholders and without even passing any resolutions in the general body of the union. The bifurcation would cause heavy loss and hardship to the members of the societies besides the financial burden already being faced by the union. They stated that if the bifurcation is permitted, then it would affect the milk producer’s societies.

Hence, the petitioners sought to quash the GO and also sought to reverse the bifurcation of Tirunelveli District Cooperative Milk Producers Union.

When the petition was taken up for hearing recently, Justice C V Karthikeyan sought the response of the state government and adjourned the case for further hearing.

While some have purchased cloud readers like Kindle to read e-books, with public libraries currently out of bounds; others had already picked up the books on their to-read list from bookstores ahead of the lockdown, in anticipation of the government move, said bookstore owners.

An assistant professor, Jyoti Kiran Pisipati, has a full-time job and a family to take care of on a regular day. But the lockdown, she said, has given her the opportunity to pick up and re-read her childhood favourites, something she always wished to do. “Reading has a calming effect on me. I am using my time at home reading new books, as well as my childhood favourites. I have old issues of Chandamama, right from the 1970s. It's so much fun reading them all over again. Next in line are Enid Blyton's ‘Malory Towers’, which I had read when I was in school,” said Jyoti, a resident of Taleigao.

She said that among the new books she had picked up to read ahead of the lockdown was Michelle Obama’s ‘Becoming’, which Jyoti calls a ‘light’ and ‘stress-free’ read.

“Now, with the lockdown, I have no access to public libraries or the library of the college where I teach. This was the main source from where I used to pick up my reading material. I recently purchased a Kindle and I am finding it very convenient to download books and read from,” said Jyoti.

The owner of Broadway Bookstore in St Inez, Khalil Ahmad, said there was a sudden surge in purchase of books from his stores just before the curfew.

“It looked like people were aware of the lockdown. Three to four days before curfew was announced, there was a sudden spike in footfalls. People purchased lot of books, mostly children's books and light reading, mainly fiction. Some foreigners who live in Goa bought books worth Rs 8,000 to 9,000 each, which is not something that we see on a regular day,” said Ahmad.

Chicalim-based artist Kaushalya Gadekar said she has a stock of Ruskin Bond books lined up for reading during the period of lockdown. But she is currently reading Bond’s autobiography ‘Lone Fox Dancing’, which she hopes will help her better understand all his children’s and other books she has previously read.

She said reading helps transport her into another world and forget reality, at least for a while.

A research scholar at the department of international relations at Goa University, Volvoi-resident Yugank Naik is reading through literature in regional languages to help him get a better grasp of Goa’s current political scenario.

“I am reading ‘Jaagaryaache Kukare’, a Konkani book by Dr Narayan Desai and ‘Sushegad’, a Marathi book by Raju Nayak. The perspective of a regional language book on political science is totally different from a book written on the subject by intellectuals in English. I am trying to relate what I am reading to the current political ongoings in the state,” said Yugank.

Three of the staffers were associated with Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL), while one was working with Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL).

In the latest incident that took place on Saturday, Pravin Bhalke, who was working with the MSEDCL on contract, was electrocuted while carrying out line-work in Jalna district on Saturday.

He was rushed to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Aurangabad, but declared dead on arrival.

In another incident on the same day, Vijay Patil, working with MSEDCL Jalgaon, died while carrying out troubleshooting work. Earlier, on March 26, Alim Shaikh, another contractual employee with the MSEDCL, also died due to electrocution in Satara area of the city while carrying out repair work.

The first incident took place on March 11 when Namrata Kulsange, an employee associated with MSETCL, also met with similar fate at Padegaon. The female employee suffered 95% burn injuries and died at a private hospital on March 19.

MSEDCL Aurangabad zone chief engineer Suresh Ganeshkar said all contractors who have been supporting the contract-basis workforce have been asked to beef up safety measures.

“These are unfortunate deaths and inquiries have been ordered into every incident. Only the inquiry reports shed light on the exact circumstances in which the employees lost their lives,” he said.

MSETCL authorities could not be reached for comments. Sayyed Jahiroddin, leader of technical staffers within the state power utility, said the MSETCL and the contactors concerned must compensate for the deaths.

“The chain of fatal accidents involving staff of the state power utility within 10 days is worrisome. The top-brass must look into these deaths. If any lapse is observed in the safety measures, strict action must be taken against those who are guilty,” he said.

NEW DELHI: After the city administration found it tough to manage the migrant labourers who had gathered at Anand Vihar interstate bus terminal to go to their hometowns recently, the civic body is now struggling with two major challenges—clearing the garbage and sanitising the entire area.

A East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) official said that a mega sanitation and disinfection drive is under way for the past three days. “We are clearing the waste and disinfecting the public places along the route till UP border so that possibility of any further outbreak is minimised. Ten auto tippers have been deployed to shift the garbage to Ghazipur landfill site,” said the official.

“Thousands of leftover packets and wrappers had created a sanitation crisis in the area. Special vacuum machines are being used to ensure minimum human contact while clearing the garbage,” he said.

A dedicated team of employees was deployed to disinfect the foot overbridge. “Its railings were touched by thousands of people, and hence no risk of transmission could have been taken,” the EDMC official said.

“Two trucks with fumigation sprinklers are deployed on the bus terminal premises to cover both the sides of the road from the bus stop till Kaushambi side. Two disinfectant pumps and four ""Jatayu"" litter pickers have also been deployed,” he added.

Jatayu works on the vacuum sucking principle and reduces the contact of sanitation workers with the garbage. This also lessens the risk of contamination.

For the first time in Ahmedabad, migrants walking back to their natives were booked for violating IPC Section 188 and Section 144 CrPC at three police stations in Ahmedabad. Two cases each were filed in Karanj and Paldi, and one person was booked in Naranpura.

At the main Chiloda and Odhav checkposts, many labourers were helped by police to board trucks heading to Rajasthan and MP.

The newly constructed EWS housing complex behind Rajpath Club is now empty as many of the 3,500 labourers who were housed in the 512 flats temporarily, insisted on returning to their residences in Ahmedabad.

“We arranged some 40 buses for these families and individuals and dropped them at their respective locations in the city. They have promised that they will not leave,” claims deputy municipal commissioner Mukesh Gadhvi.

But despite Gadhvi’s claims, TOI came across labourers headed back to their native states. Many labourers employed with companies located in industrial estates of Odhav, Vatva and Naroda too have begun leaving their workplaces .

Police and local body authorities were caught off guard at the overwhelming crowd at the fish markets and meat stalls.

What police could do was to make announcement using a public-address system asking people not get into crowded markets further in vain. Hundreds of people kept crowding the Nelpettai market since early morning. It left the narrow street more crowded than a normal Sunday. People have forgotten everything and focused only on purchasing their favorite non-veg items. Traffic police in East Veli Street had a tough time handling vehicle movement and restricting parking.

A police office said, “People developed the habit of enjoying Sundays with family at home by cooking sumptuous food, but these days people are confined to home through the week. One can purchase non-veg items on any week day, but people are flocking to markets as it is the last day of non-veg sales.”

P Pachaiappan, a resident of Tallakulam, said that fresh non-veg items such as fish are available only on Sundays. He came to the market thinking that there would be few people due to the restrictions.

All fish stalls, meat stalls and markets were overcrowded on Sunday. A large number of people gathered at Southgate Fish market and vegetable market in South Marret Street, forcing the police to close the road for traffic movement. Commuters had to use alternative roads. Similarly, Thayir Market and Simmakkal were also crowded as people gathered in large number to purchase vegetables and fruits.

Sources at Madurai Corporation said that they are planning to close down vegetable markets at South Marret Street and Thayir Market, while retail sales at the Central vegetable market at Mattuthavani has already been closed.

Madurai collector T G Vinay and corporation commissioner S Visakan inspected the market later in the evening. Corporation commissioner said that efforts are under way to decongest the market by spreading out shops to various areas.

CCP, the first in the state to announce a home delivery system of essentials to its residents, came under fire from Kuncalienkar, who accused the civic body of clandestinely diverting rations from government stores to private stores and selling it to public at exorbitant rates. Tagging the chief minister in a tweet, Kuncalienkar requested him and Monserrate to “investigate and punish people who are cheating Panaji & making money in these times of crisis”.

Kuncalienkar also uploaded a picture of a sugar packet from Goa Sahakar Bhandar and claimed CCP was selling it at Rs 57.5.

Meanwhile, on Facebook, Madkaikar challenged Kuncalienkar to prove his allegation or produce his informer.

Referring to Kuncalienkar as “Mr Twitter master”, he asked him to help people instead of sitting at home and engaging in cheap politics. . He shared a picture of Kuncalienkar relaxing on a chair and reading a book and accused him of resting at home and engaging in politics.

Madkaikar told TOI that Kuncalienkar has been accusing CCP from time to time. First of setting fire to the garbage centre behind Heera petrol pump, then of making money from the pay parking contract, and now of diverting supplies. “He has no bill for the sugar. He’s sitting at home while we are putting our lives in danger and helping people. It’s our duty,” Madkaikar said.

Kuncalienkar said there was mischief on the part of CCP that needed to be investigated. Asked why the party wasn’t working unitedly, Kuncalienkar said “Irrespective of political belief, we cannot support wrong. This needs to be investigated,” he told TOI.

The administration swung into action and process of contact tracing and active surveillance began immediately on Sunday. Entire Buldhana city has been taken under active surveillance.

The 45-year-old man from Buldhana, who died of pneumonia in District Hospital of Buldhana on Saturday, was detected positive for Covid-19 on Sunday. This is the first Covid-19 death out of Mumbai, and 8th death in Maharashtra. The man was a diabetic and has no history of travel even within the country in recent months.

“This patient was suffering from pneumonia. He was admitted in local private hospital in Buldhana from March 24 to 27. As his condition deteriorated on Saturday, he was brought to Buldhana District Hospital, where he died during treatment,” said Dr Riyaz Faruqui, Deputy Director of Health Services (DDHS), Akola division, under which Buldhana district falls.

As his symptoms were of Covid-19, doctors had immediately collected his swab samples after he was admitted in the isolation ward. The samples were sent to Nagpur IGGMCH Lab facility. The patient had died within two hours of treatment starting.

“In reports received on Sunday, the person tested positive for Covid-19. We have started active surveillance process. All his family members, contacts, and staff of the private hospital where he was being treated have been called for Covid-19 tests,” said Buldhana civil surgeon Dr Premchand Pandit.

The burial of the deceased was performed on Sunday afternoon and even after repeated instructions by health authorities, about 100 people attended the burial. Authorities have decided to conduct thermal screening of all of them. The private hospital where the man was admitted has been sealed, and all staff members and sanitary workers in this hospital have been asked to get themselves tested in the government hospital. All these contacts including family members will be screened.

A senior official of the health department said that the person could have been infected by an asymptomatic carrier of coronavirus. “The person may not have travelled himself, but due to his diabetic nature he was vulnerable to coronavirus. Any asymptomatic carrier could have infected him. This means, there are asymptomatic carriers in Buldhana. Only surveillance and contact tracing will clarify who they are,” said the official.

On March 14, a 71-year-old man had died in Buldhana of pneumonia and his samples had tested negative for Covid-19. But, there are many residents in Buldhana who had gone to Saudi Arabia on a religious trip. Some of them could be asymptomatic carriers. The deceased may have come into close contact with some of them. Being diabetic from several years, he was severely affected by the coronavirus.

361,['30/03/2020'],Struggling cotton industry braces for uncertain future,"Aurangabad: The ongoing lockdown and the absence of a fresh stimulus package so far could severely impact the agricultural sector, and especially the cotton industry, farmers’ groups have warned.

There have been no restrictions on transport or sale of farms produce like fruits, vegetables, pulses . But farmers said they have been hit by losses because of the curbs on movement of buyers. Exports have been shut and many of the Agriculture Market Produce Committee markets have closed.

According to Kailash Tawar of the Shetkari Sanghatna, the farming community has suffered a severe blow. He also slammed the government for not declaring a stimulus package.

“The only announcement for farmers was the advance payment of Rs 2,000 under the PM-Kisan scheme. But this works out to only Rs 500 a month for farmers. Also, not all farmers are covered under the scheme,” he said. The Shetkari Sanghatna has demanded that the state pay a compensation of Rs 25,000 per hectare.

Cotton farmers have been particularly affected. Mahesh Daga, the MD of Cottonguru LLP, which works with 50,000 farmers across India to improve yield and quality, said because cotton is a non-essential commodity, farmers growing the crop are extremely worried.

“As much as 15% of cotton produce, which includes the harvested and the non-harvested crop from the last season, is currently stuck with farmers as they are not able to transport or sell it. Limited farming operations to meet the minimum support price were on until last week. But they too have stopped now,” Daga said.

As far as the forthcoming kharif season is concerned, the production of cotton — a cash crop — remains in limbo because the seed packaging operations have ground to a halt.

A key amendment in a state government circular from March 27 includes logistics and packaging of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides in the list of essential commodities.

. “Retail of seeds was allowed, but there was no provision to manufacture or package these seeds. After Cottonguru made a presentation before the agriculture commissioner, the government allowed these processes in the seed industry ,” Daga said.

The byproducts of cotton ginning are essential commodities with multiple uses.

Hardly a few turned at the proposed places on Sunday despite a meeting involving representatives of vendors from central market chaired by corporation commissioner S Visakan at the corporation main building on Saturday. The shops were distributed as follows: 100 shops each for Melamadai Signal - Aavin Signal road in KK Nagar, Race Course stadium road, Mattuthavani-Surveyor Colony Road, 75 shops each at Armed Reserve Ground, Krishnan Temple ground in Iyyer Bungalow and 50 shops each at southern part of Teppakulam and Harveypatti, 25 shops at TB Road-Railway Colony compound wall and Fenner Junction-Muthaiah Temple in Kochadai.

There were only a few vendors at Teppakulam, around 10 at KK Nagar and less than five at Race Course stadium road. A large number of people who had thronged the markets to purchase vegetables for the upcoming week had to return empty-handed. The very little quantity of vegetables brought to these markets were sold off quickly.

“I came here after seeing news of decentralisation of central vegetable market in newspapers. But there are hardly any vegetables left to buy. Police deployment was made. There were markings too for each shop mentioning the numbers for the entire stretch, but vendors did not turn up. I am leaving without purchasing anything,” V Mariappan, a resident of Viraganoor said.

An official of Madurai corporation said the vendors did not turn up as they did not get adequate stock. They will start sales at these markets in a day or two. They have no choice since retail sale has been closed at the central market. They are considering closing down of Thayir market and South Marret Street markets too for better crowd management.

AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad district administration, which is attempting to stop the exodus of migrant workers, is faced with a new challenge. Migrant workers, especially those working in Surendranagar, Bhavnagar and Morbi districts, are using interior roads of villages to pass through, as the highways are manned by cops.

District collector K K Nirala said that while the highways connecting Ahmedabad district to other neighbouring districts are manned by police, migrant workers are using interior roads to pass through the district. “People working in Surendranagar, Bhavnagar and Morbi districts are using interior roads to pass through Ahmedabad district and reach their native places in other states and districts of Gujarat. They are travelling through fields and village roads. It is a challenge to track such persons, but this exodus will be brought under control within a day,” the collector said.

The administration has set up shelters in every taluka of the district. About 25 shelters have been set up in rural areas, while the AMC and collectorate have jointly set up shelters in Ahmedabad city as well. “The major influx of migrant workers is from the western side, and since cops are posted only along the main routes, we will accommodate them in shelter homes,” Nirala said.

Nirala said that the immediate aim is to stop workers wherever they are. “Once we can contain movement of workers along the interior routes, we will arrive at the number of people who have been halted in each district,” Nirala said. He added that since the workers are extremely well connected through mobile phones, they appear to be advising each other on routes that they can take to reach their native places.

367,['30/03/2020'],Kolkata Coronavirus Update: Test capacity set to double in a week,"KOLKATA: With two private hospitals — Apollo Gleneagles Hospital and Tata Medical Centre — receiving the nod to test samples of Covid-19 suspects, the city’s capacity to test samples is set to double in the next one week. While NICED, IPGMER and North Bengal and Midnapore Medical Colleges are already conducting tests, School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata is set to start on Monday. Each of these centres can handle 30-40 samples a day. At present, 50-60 samples are being collected on an average per day.According to health department sources, Institute of Child Health (ICH), too, has been approached by the Medical Council of India (MCI) and the state health department to start testing Covid-19 samples. ICH is ready to start once it is provided the testing kits, a senior health official said.With ICMR validating the use of rapid test kits for Covid-19, more centres could join the list, leading to a much-needed jump in the number of samples tested everyday. “Once rapid test kits are allowed, which could happen very soon, hundred samples can be easily tested a day. This will allow mass screening of Covid 19 suspects while the more doubtful samples can go the PCR labs which are already functioning,” said Peerless Hospital microbiologist Bhaskar Narayan Choudhury.Meanwhile, Tata Medical Centre — that got the nod to test samples on Saturday — is ready with an isolation centre spread across three floors at its new Phase-II building. A team of doctors, nurses and other health staff is being trained to attend to Covid 19 patients and suspects. The hospital has set up a control room to run the centre and the team will be on duty round-the-clock. The hospital has shut down its research centre – asking employees to work from home – to facilitate the setting up of the isolation unit.“We are ready to conduct tests and run the isolation centre. Our medical and support staff are now being trained and we have enough PPEs at our disposal. We have sought five kits and will receive samples from the ICMR,” said a Tata Medical official, adding that the charges for the test and other details were yet to be worked out.Since there has been a dip in the number of cancer patients due to restrictions on OPD, we have enough manpower at our disposal who are adequately trained to provide infection-control treatment. As far as the infrastructure is concerned, everything from housekeeping to waste management is ready to roll,” said the Tata Medical official.While STM has enough kits to conduct 800 tests, Apollo is set to procure its kits soon.According to virologist Amitabha Nandy, “We need as many test centres as we can set up. The greater the number of suspects can be tested the better. It will ensure that no Covid positive slips through the net and transmission is effectively curbed. I hope we are moving towards that.”",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74881672,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-121081,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/test-capacity-set-to-double-in-a-week/articleshow/74879949.cms

Koradi police detained 40 persons and their vehicles at the entry and exit in their daylong action.In the coming week, police action in the city is expected to scale up following the intervention of state home minister Anil Deshmukh, who on Sunday urged cops to enforce section 144 stringently across the city.On Sunday, city police stepped up action against motorists and bikers at nakabandis. Around 1,925 persons were fined at the nakabandi with their vehicles after being found moving out without valid reasons. Some 83 people were detained and 16 booked for violating the orders under section 144.In addition, seven other offences were registered during routine checking and patrolling, including one at Lakadganj police station, where cops seized around 30 litres of country liquor. They arrested three in this connection from Satnami Nagar under the supervision of Senior inspector Narendra Hiware.City police chief BK Upadhyay, who was supervising the bandobast on the road, also visited Koradi naka to check the entry and exit points of the city. He has added a second nakabandi at Mahadula point along with the Koradi naka. Upadhyay has also sanctioned additional 10 personnel to conduct checks at Mahadula point, which was earlier a fixed point deployment for just keeping watch.Upadhyay said if vigilance at the entry and exit point of the city is not made stringent then there could be unauthorized movement leading to a greater fear of infection travelling in or out of the city. “We have asked the policemen to be strict with vehicles coming inside the city or leaving the place,” said the CP, who had Zonal DCP Neelotpal along with him during the review at Koradi naka.Senior PI Vazeer Shaikh of Koradi police station said he has additional responsibility of keeping the checks at the entry and exit point foolproof so as to stop unnecessary travel, raising the risk of infection manifold. “If I fail to stop the influx of movement of vehicles the load would increase on my city counterparts. Unnecessary movement is dangerous, hence the documents and other credentials are checked thoroughly and only valid cases are allowed,” he said. Shaikh said he has already started detaining vehicles in large numbers.City police have also started increasingly focusing on slums and smaller lanes of colonies, where citizens rampantly violate section 144 by gathering at public places. TOI accompanied Pachpaoli police patrolling inside the colonies of Laskaribagh and also beyond the railway tracks at Barse Nagar.While many citizens fled through the lanes, and also withdrew inside their houses, some women came forward to share their concern regarding mobs gathering on the roads despite the lockdown order.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader Vilas Somkuwar and corporator Virankha Bhiwgade have been constantly trying to convince people in the colonies of Laskaribagh to remain inside, and not pay heed to rumours. “I have also alerted police a couple of times to disperse mobs in lanes and also in grounds,” he said.Apart from regular bandobast, senior officers like Joint CP Ravindra Kadam were engaged in supervising and coordinating the makeshift shelter homes for migrant labourers, who are now being held back in the city.",nagpur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74879946,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46685,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/police-step-up-checks-at-entry-and-exit-points-of-city/articleshow/74879947.cms

372,['30/03/2020'],GMCH starts testing swab samples for Covid-19,"Aurangabad: City-based Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) has started testing swap samples of coronavirus suspect patients at its Viral Research and Diagnostics Laboratory (VRDL).

On Sunday, the first day of the lab’s operations, four samples were tested and the result of all the samples came out to be negative. With this development, the administration will no longer have to send the swab samples to Pune’s National Institute of Virology.

Of the 4 samples tested on Sunday, two were sent by the district civil hospital while the remaining two are undergoing treatment at the GMCH. The GMCH was supposed to get the VRDL last year after getting the approval of the state cabinet. However, there was a delay in getting the necessary machine and equipment.

The hospital received the machine to the run the VRDL on Saturday along with the kits to carry out Covid-19 tests.

According to medical superintendent Suresh Harbade, the kit needs a minimum of 50 samples for one round of analysis otherwise the kit gets wasted. “On the first day, the test was carried out with only 4 swabs as the NIV accreditation was awaited. It takes 8 hours to complete the analysis,” he said.

“Samples from four districts under deputy director of health services Aurangabad division i.e. Aurangabad, Hingoli, Parbhani and Jalna will be tested at this facility,” he added.

Currently, there are 666 patients that are being followed up by the district health authorities. 12 people have been placed at Aurangabad Municipal Corporation’s (AMC) quarantine facility at Kalagram Exhibition Centre in Chikalthana MIDC.

“None of the 126 patients tested so far from the district have tested positive. One person who had earlier tested positive has recovered from Covid-19,” district civil surgeon Sundar Kulkarni said.

373,['30/03/2020'],"NMC warns of action against closed clinics, labs","Nagpur: Municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe has warned of action against private medical services that are shut during lockdown without any genuine reason. He made it mandatory for all private clinics, hospitals, labs and drugstores to remain open so people get services in their respective areas and there is no rush at some centers.

Mundhe on Sunday issued a notification warning of action against closed medical services under relevant sections of The Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 and Indian Penal Code. “It is very important for private medical services including hospitals, clinics, medical stores, radiology centres, pathology labs etc to remain open. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has received complaints from people that some private medical stores are closed since lock down. It will cause serious inconvenience to the people in getting medical services. Therefore, private medical service should not remain closed without genuine reason,” he said.

In the last few days, some clinics, medical stores, pathological labs had remained shut. This meant people needed to travel to other areas during lockdown and also be part of crowd where such services are open.

Maharashtra Medical Council (MMA) vice-president Dr Vinky Rughwani said, “MMC recently allowed telephonic consultations to medical practitioners. This doesn’t mean they should close clinics/OPDs. Due to Covid-19 situation, people are in fear and need consultations in case of symptoms like fever, cold etc. Therefore, all should keep services running,” he said.

Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also clarified it didn’t ask its members to stop practice or close clinics.

“On March 23 and 24, a detailed appeal letter with instructions was sent to all members of IMA in the state to continue providing medical services. They should examine and treat non Covid-19 emergency patients,” said Dr Avinash Bhondve, IMA state president.

As per guidelines, doctors should not allow more than four patients in waiting room, should provide liquid soap sanitizer to all patients, make them aware of hand washing techniques, and ask them to wear masks and encourage them to stay at home.

IMA also said, “Police had obstructed staff of several clinics on the first day of the lockdown. At many places, even before showing their identity card, our doctors and staff were beaten up. When they went home, their families were terrified and prevented them from going to work. Because there was no staff available for issuing case papers, assisting doctors, giving medicines, and cleaning, the facilities were affected,” Bhondve said.

Doctors are also seeing a shortage of N-95 masks and personal protection equipment (PPE) to be used while examining a patient, and thus feeling unsafe and unprotected.

“Many doctors are worried due to lack of PPE. Most are using simple cloth masks or disposable surgical masks. Some had to keep their clinic closed so as to avoid the chance of catching and spreading the infection,” said a leading private practitioner in Nagpur.

“We would like to take up some facts and the ground realities the doctors in the state are facing,” said Dr Kush Jhunjhunwala, president of Nagpur IMA.

374,['30/03/2020'],"Poor awareness, indifferent attitude leave slums dwellers vulnerable","Madurai: No disinfection measures or awareness drives and add to it the belief that they won’t be affected by Covid-19 - this is situation in most of slums in the city even as the lockdown is in place to combat the disease. At the slum in MK Puram, a dense residential locality, residents said their streets remain unclean and not disinfected, while in Melavasal residents say they “don’t have anything to worry about”.

“No one comes to the interiors in our area. Even now you can see bleaching powder spread on the main road but not anywhere near here. No official has come here to talk about Covid-19 or prevention. We learnt from watching news only that Madurai has some positive cases. Still, no one cares,” said Ranjit Kumar P, a resident of MK Puram.

He added that, like him, many in the area are sanitary workers for the Madurai Corporation. While the workers keep the city clean and continue to work hard to implement preventive measures for Covid-19 like cleaning and disinfecting, ironically, their own residential areas neglected.

Many of the spaces throughout the neighbourhood also had litter piling up despite efforts by residents. “Sewage water overflows from the manhole here, creating a stink in the area and we have to clean it up ourselves. We have many children living here too who are exposed. We have complained repeatedly but no one comes to help. We have always been neglected so it is not surprising we are neglected during these times too,” said Kamatchi M, a long-term resident.

At the slum in Melavasal, officials have carried out disinfection measures and awareness campaigns but the streets remain crowded apart from hygiene issues. Children could be found sitting outside eating food and playing games in groups. “Corporation officials came to disinfect with bleaching powder. They also told us to keep clean and warned about Covid-19. They did their duty but we have nothing to worry about. No one who returned from foreign countries live here,” said Meena G, a resident.

Like Meena, most residents of slums, including in MK Nagar, people believed that since there was no one who returned from abroad live in and around their areas, there was no chance of infection at all. A general lack of awareness about Covid-19 is prevalent among residents of slum areas leaving cause for serious concern as Tamil Nadu has already entered stage 2 of transmission. “If we don’t wear masks or touch someone, we’ll get Corona? It is all just hype. We have nothing to worry,” said a youth at Melavasal slum, even as the whole country is under lockdown for 21 days.

City health officials maintained that they have been continuing to conduct disinfection and awareness drives for Covid-19 throughout the city, including slum areas. They added that measures will be taken not to miss out on any areas.

375,['30/03/2020'],‘Central force not here to punish public’,"Panaji: Reacting to a viral video on Sunday showing personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) physically disciplining two youth found on the streets in violation of the lockdown, chief minister Pramod Sawant said that the CISF has not been stationed to punish people.

Sawant told reporters that the CISF was already stationed in Goa and that the government had not brought them from outside the state. “We have not brought them to Goa to punish public. We don’t want to harass or punish any one,” he said.

He, however, said that despite being told on several occasions to remain inside in light of the novel coronavirus pandemic youth were seen roaming around for no reason. “We have no problem if someone moves out of the house to get milk or groceries,” he said, adding that there should be some fear in the minds of people about policing. Inspector general of police (IGP) Jaspal Singh requested people not to assess the force by the action of an overzealous man for being harsh on two persons for loitering without a reasonable cause.

“The CISF has been inducted to lessen the burden on Goa police as we still have a long way to go. It is a thoroughbred professional force. Pertinently, the lockdown is to ensure safety of people,” Singh said.

Sawant once again underlined that the state government wants people to remain inside because they otherwise stand to put all their family members at risk.

Urging people to cooperate with police and not step out unless absolutely necessary and for an authorised and valid purpose, Singh said some youngsters have been seen taking joyrides at these critical times.

Singh said that Goa police and the CISF are committed to help citizens at this hour of distress, “but violation of law will definitely be dealt with strictly in the larger interest of the community”.

Following the video going viral, citizens drafted a letter condemning the actions of the central force for “treating a humanitarian crisis as a law and order problem” and appealed for a better approach and solution. The letter circulated on social media also raised concerns about the deployment of the central force in critical areas of the state.

“Deploying central force in Goa could lead to uncontrollable civil unrest if hungry citizens are met with by CRPF ‘disciplining’,” the statement read.

Citizens said that it was “lack of clarity and confusion due to constantly changing announcements about supply of essential commodities and services, with no real systematic access to food” that was causing anxious citizens to step out.

The letter appealed to people to e-mail on pplVoicesCOVID19@gmail.com “to protest the way this government is responding to the crisis”.

377,['30/03/2020'],"Over 1.5K wholesalers, retailers evicted from Cotton Market","Nagpur: On the day TOI reported about crowding at Cotton Market, a joint team of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) Dhantoli zone, NMC markets department and nuisance detection squad forcibly evicted over 1,500 wholesalers and retailers from the city’s biggest fruits and vegetables market where measures to contain coronavirus spread were coming undone.

This was the only major market open after the complete lockdown which led to closure of APMC Kalamna market and Phule market.

The eviction action not only led to fear among wholesalers and retailers about losing business but they also warned of sharp price rise in prices and acute shortage of essentials items. The civic body admitted that the items traded at the market fall under essential services but it was helpless in the face of non-compliance.

Dhantoli zone assistant commissioner Kiran Shrawanbagade said that for the last three four days the civic body had been keeping a close watch on the market and on Saturday several videos were received as complaints.

She said the NMC can’t allow crowding in any way during the lockdown period. “We tried to make them practise social distancing. But they didn’t listen. The vegetable-laden vehicles were brought to the parking ground behind the Phule market. This attracted over 1,500 people to one place,” she said.

Shrawanbagade said NMC was aware that fruits and vegetables come under essential services, hence they are finding ways to help them reach the citizens without any crowding. “Designating places in different areas will be allotted to farmers and vendors to sell vegetables and fruits. Also, many have agreed to provide home delivery,” she said.

Mataprasad Gupta, a vegetable seller from Ramdaspeth, said that the city was facing shortage of greens as the administration had closed down Kalamna and Phule markets. “Farmers had come with ample vegetables and those who had gone in early morning could buy them. However, retail sellers who went there late could not buy anything at all. This is the reason for the shortage,” he told TOI.

Sheikh Hussain, a wholesale vegetable trader, said that rates of vegetables had increased in the city because the administration had closed down markets. “If they close it for a day or two it is understandable but closing it indefinitely makes no sense. After all vegetables are essential commodities,” he said.

Ram Mahajan, secretary of Mahatma Phule Vegetables and Fruits Brokers Association, said they were initially told that the markets would be closed for only two days for sanitization. ""But a board was put up today announcing the market is shut till further orders. We met municipal commisioner Tukaram Mundhe. He assured us that markets will be re-opened. We also met guradian minister Nitin Raut who assured the same. If the NMC wan'ts to control crowds it must open all markets. Already, other markets are closed so the crowding took place here,"" Mahajan said.

In a press release, Mundhe said markets will remain closed till March 31 and farmers would be allowed to sell their produce in different parts of city.

Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary (health & family welfare), told media on Sunday evening that it’s been found that the centres such as Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot and Gandhinagar have more density of cases than other districts. “The cases spread from a nucleus. Thus, on Monday, we will be putting in motion a containment strategy with micro-planning and mapping of cases,” she said. “A meeting will take place with the commissioners and collectors along with health department officials.”

On Sunday, Gujarat recorded eight new cases – four from Ahmedabad and one each from Rajkot, Surat, Porbandar and Gir-Somnath. Ravi told media that out of total, a 30-year-old man from Ahmedabad and a 26-year-old man from Surat had Dubai travel history whereas a 37-year-old man from Rajkot had returned from Germany to India via Dubai. Other cases are of local transmission, she said, adding that the woman in Gir-Somnath got infection from her husband, who is already a positive patient.

Health department officials said that a special control room will be created at Gandhinagar to monitor implementation of the infection clustering and coordination with various stakeholders.

Ravi said that a special arrangement is made for people living with thalassemia in Gujarat in association with Indian Red Cross under which they will get treatment at their doorstep through government hospitals.

As on Sunday evening, Gujarat has 18,784 persons under home quarantine and 696 under government-run quarantine facilities. A total of 236 persons were booked for violation of quarantine rules so far in the state. Ravi added that door-to-door survey for Covid-19 has covered 5.65 crore persons.

380,['30/03/2020'],43 released on parole from central prison,"Aurangabad: Of the total prisoners at the Aurangabad central prison, 43 inmates were released on emergency parole for 45 days. The administration made elaborate arrangements to ensure that despite lockdown, these prisoners reach their respective homes.

A prison truck, an ambulance and a police van were deployed for dropping the inmates home, of which, 41 were released till late Saturday while a couple of them were released on Sunday.

Aurangabad central prison superintendent Hiralal Jadhav told TOI, “A total of 91 orders were received till Saturday evening. Many inmates were found facing second cases, hence a total number of 41 inmates were released Saturday while two more were released on Sunday.”

Prison authorities said that considering the restrictions imposed on the movement of vehicles, the inmates being released on emergency parole as well as regular bail were facing an uphill task in reaching their respective homes. As a solution, the state home department ordered the administration of each district as well as the prison and police departments to co-ordinate and make transportation facility available for those being released on emergency parole.

Three days back, home minister Anil Deshmukh issued a written communication stating that ‘there are 45 prisons in Maharashtra,] in which about 60, 000 prisoners are kept. This is a red flag and a potential flashpoint for rapid spread of Covid-19 as prisoners are living in a congested space. Hence, it was decided to release under trial prisoners and those serving up to seven years imprisonment.’

The communication specifically stated that ‘before their release, they will be subjected to thorough required medical check-up and will be issued the necessary passes which will facilitate them to go to their native places.’

381,['30/03/2020'],Docs’ anxiety is never greater than when one of their own is afflicted,"Bengaluru: Wash your hands. I’ve heard that phrase so many times these last couple of months that one more time is a drum stick clanging against my ear. Wash hands, sanitize. Repeat. Once every half-hour. Or maybe twice. With a doctor for a husband, you cannot be prepared enough in these Covid-19 times. Often it jars, sometimes it irritates, but that’s only one half of the story.

Doctors and health workers, whether their area of expertise is clinical, surgical or care-giving, are at the frontline of this battle. Before them is the patient who could be the carrier of the unseen enemy. They are governed by a guideline, but need to work with a certain sensitivity, at times with gloves and a mask, at others with make-do options in times of serious shortage of protective gear. Every patient, sniffling or coughing, is told to stay three feet way. “I don’t want you to catch any infection,” the docs tell you. Like they are immune to it.

For every smile sparked in the ward, for every word of hope exchanged in passing, there’s a look of despair at home, where unspoken fears express itself. Perhaps not so much in words – except with a fellow professional who has an equal understanding of a desperately dark time – but through other tangibles. The phone lines don’t stop ringing, mostly from senior citizens with a cold and a fever, who’d rather self-quarantine than wait for tests in hospital corridors. Calls of aches and pains are almost music to the ears – after all, they can be looked at, dealt with.

The anxiety is never greater than when one of their own is afflicted. A batchmate, also a friend, caught the infection from a patient and is in the ICU along with his family. The medical community is a tight-knit one, the bonds as strong as they are deep. The younger ones keep the high-risk older category away from the action, slapping them with curfews, forcing them to stay away from work, taking the knocks on the chin. So, while the rest of the world works from home, they leave for the front each day fully aware that, should the situation get worse, they might have to bed in in their workplace.

The give-and-take balance, sadly, is skewed. You want them to fight for you, but you don’t want them around you otherwise. When they return home after a long, draining day, they encounter hostile house owners who want them out because they are high-risk. Because they are the visible enemy. Worse, they have to deal with idiocy and misplaced bravado. ‘Lick a toilet seat, contaminate public transport with saliva’. Or, how about ‘Let's join hands, go out and sneeze with open mouth in public. Spread the virus.’ Really?

The carelessness of those they’re fighting for is quickly brushed aside as they brace to prepare with care. Best and worst case scenarios for India, 14,000 or 400 million infected, are just numbers in a milieu where hope is a scarce commodity. Against all odds, when you attempt to buoy spirit with an ‘it’s just a virus’, it’s a met with a nod that says, ‘not just’.

Every evening marks a quiet return home. No sit-down to even take off the footwear, no words exchanged before a shower. There’s the responsibility of protecting family after working to cure patients. These are challenging times for the health worker. If you want to really clap for him, do so from the confines of your home. Preferably with a prayer. They need it now more than ever, for you as much as for themselves.

382,['30/03/2020'],Water scarcity raises hygiene concerns in slums,"Madurai: Residents of MK Puram slum said they are facing a water crisis, particularly after the lockdown came into play. They allege that the corporation’s water tankers are not regularly supplying them.

“We have not got drinking water for more than seven days now. The water tanker used to come regularly close to the main road, which is far for us already. Nowadays, there has been no sign of the tanker,” said Ranjit Kumar P, a sanitary worker who lives in the area. Residents added that the only option they have now was to get water from those who pump water using motors in nearby areas.

“We have to travel far to get water in pots. We had one drinking water tap but it is no longer working. If that one tap worked, it would be fine. We have repeatedly complained but there has been no response,” said Sakthi N, a housewife. The residents are now buying drinking water and fetching them in pots for Rs 3, Rs 5 and even Rs 15 per pot, depending on the house they get water from.

As there has been an emphasis on washing hands as a preventive measure against Covid-19, with temperatures already going up to 40C, residents are fearing water scarcity. It is not an uncommon phenomenon in slums to face water shortage during summers.

Meanwhile, with most of the residents in the area being either sanitary workers or daily wage workers, many of the families of daily wage workers are struggling for survival since there is no income. “I’m a driver getting daily wages, but now there is no job for me. I’m taking care of my goats and trying to make ends meet. The government has not done enough for us during these times,” said Kalimuthu T, a resident here for more than 10 years.

A senior official from the corporation said that lack of pressure was the reason why there is no water supply in the tap, due to which they could not supply to around 20 houses in middle of the area. “The houses on both sides of the area get proper water supply. The problem has been there for long and it will be looked into only after the Covid-19 pandemic comes to an end,” he said. Water supply through tankers will be ensured for the time being, he added.

Data released in the Socio-Economic Review indicates that around 64% of the Gujarat population is using the internet.

The Socio-Economic Review for 2019-2020 states, “As on October 31, 2019 there were a total of 8,47,524 landline connections of BSNL in the state. According to data from TRAI there are about 6.92 crore GSM cellular connections (up to October 2019) and 4.26 crore internet subscribers in Gujarat (up to September 2019).”

Interestingly, officials said this figure was 10,49,720 landline connections of BSNL and 2.97 lakh internet connections in 2017. Also, according to data from the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), there were about 6.56 crore GSM cellular connections in Gujarat at the end of October, 2017.

An officer said that it appears that BSNL is losing a large number of landline subscribers. BSNL lost over two lakh connections while the number of internet users and mobile users is increasing. Internet users increased by 1.29 crore in two years while cellular connections increased by 36 lakh in the same period.

The officials said that the latest report of COAI states that wireline subscribers in the state, that is BSNL users, was 8.26 lakh as on December 31, 2019.

Officials pointed out that BSNL in Gujarat lost 21,000 connections in just two months, November and December.

According to officials, the number of cellular connections was 6.74 crore which means that in two months, November and December 2019, 18 lakh people got their cellular phones disconnected.

The senior officer said that in Gujarat there are several people who use at least two mobile connections and one was only to contact people while another one was for internet and social media sites and messaging.

An officer pointed out that the internet user base was increasing. He said that in September 2019, Niti Aayog data revealed that that were merely 42 internet subscribers for every 100 people in Gujarat, even though there was greater mobile penetration. By October end, this figure reached 64 for every 100 people in Gujarat.

Officials said that penetration of internet users was low because there are still many rural people and workers who use phones only to speak to others and have not internet connection.

VIJAYAWADA: The Human Rights Forum (HRF) on Sunday urged the governments of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to take over all private hospitals and nursing homes so as to meet the challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.

“They should be acquired along with all human resources, available medical resources and must be run by the government. Several State governments have already moved in this direction. In fact, the government of India must follow the example of Spain and nationalize all private hospitals across the country for effective mitigation of the pandemic,” VS Krishna and S Jeevan Kumar, members of the HRF AP&TS Coordination Committee, said in a press statement .

“One dreads to imagine what would happen in the event of a big outbreak. Will our public health system, as it exists now, be able to meet the contingency? We feel it cannot cope and will be completely overwhelmed if there is a huge breakout. Which is why all private health providers and their facilities should be placed into governmental control in order to enhance our capacity to deal with this crisis. Such a step would help us be better prepared,” they said.

They said that testing facilities are simply not enough and there is a pressing need to expand them massively at the earliest.

RAJKOt: Eight persons were made to clean the government quarantine facility in Bhavnagar’s Sir T Hospital on Sunday as a punishment for allegedly thrashing a doctor, who had given primary treatment to the Covid-19 patient who died on March 26.

On Saturday night, the eight persons allegedly attacked private doctor Girish Makwana, who is home quarantined, as he was part of team that had treated the coronavirus patient in a private hospital. The attackers were neighbours who feared that their children might get infected with the deadly virus. Makwana told police in his complaint that his nephews were also assaulted and sister abused by the group.

After being asked to stay at home, Dr Makwana went to live in Subhashnagar area of Bhavnagar at his sister Rasila Menia’s house which was vacant for the past few months. When Rasila’s nephews - Dharmesh and Mehul - came to give him tiffin on Saturday evening, eight persons living in the neighbourhood picked up a quarrel with them saying that the doctor should not be staying there. They then allegedly thrashed them with sticks and pipes. Rasila, who lodged the complaint, was also allegedly abused by the group.

They were called for questioning by the B-division police and then allowed to go. However, Bhavnagar district administration ordered them to clean the inside and outside area of the quarantine facility has punishment after the incident sparked anger among the doctor fraternity.

Talking to TOI, district development officer (DDO), V J Baranwal said, “When I visited a few hospitals on Sunday, doctors complained to me that such behaviour with medicos, that too at the time of the pandemic, was unacceptable and discouraging. So, we asked these eight persons to see how doctors worked in quarantine facilities. We did not want the attackers to repeat such an act.”

However, one of the eight also lodged a cross-complaint against Makwana’s sister Rasila, alleging that she thrashed them when they asked her not to keep a ‘suspected Covid-19’ person at her house. The complainant said they were scared that their children might get infected.

Surat: Ever since Novel coronavirus started spreading its tentacles in the state, the beggars in Valsad town of South Gujarat were left with no choice but to go hungry as people were scared of going close to them.

This grim situation caught the attention of young Gandhian Neelam Patel, who has dedicated his life to the upliftment of tribal people in and around Khoba village in Dharmapur taluka of Valsad district on Gujarat-Maharashtra border.

“My native Gundlav village is just 3 km from Valsad town. When I was in Gundlav I noticed that lockdown had left beggars in a worst situation as people were scared to offer food to them at their doorsteps. Hence, I along with some volunteers decided to start a kitchen in my village to feed these people in Valsad town,” Patel (35) told TOI.

“We feed them twice a day and ensure that they don’t go hungry. There are around 172 beggars. Also, there are around 30 construction labourers who are stuck in the town due to the lockdown. On an average, we provide food to 200 people in Valsad town,”' adds Patel.

On Friday, Patel along with a team of district health department carried out a health check-up of all the beggars to ensure that they were not infected with the virus.

“Even if they have money, they can’t buy food as all restaurants and lodges are closed. They have no cooking facility. Hence, we have decided to give priority to these needy people,” Patel explains.

“Neelambhai and his team are doing a commendable work to help those in need in Valsad. Our district administration is helping them amid the lockdown situation,” said C R Kharsan, Valsad district collector.

Patel, a post graduate from Gujarat Vidyapith in Ahmedabad (2007), decided to go to a remote village (Khoba) and started work on education, health and environment in tribal areas, practising Gandhian principles. Two weeks ago, he along with others were felicitated by Gujarat Vidyapith and the US-based Gandhian Society for his exemplary work at the grassroots level.

The awards were conferred by Elaben Bhatt, chancellor, and Anamik Shah, vice-chancellor of the Gujarat Vidyapith.

Rythu bazaars have already been decentralised with some farmers’ markets being shifted to open grounds and mobile units selling vegetables. Now, the administration is using bamboo rings so that people maintain a minimum distance between each other.

Talking about this newly-adopted method, Vizianagaram district collector M Hari Jawaharlal said, “The idea is to ensure that people don’t jump the line or crowd in shops. Most importantly, this is self-induced and does not involve coercion by law enforcement agencies.” The collector said that this method makes people feel responsible and conscious.

Joint collector G Ch Kishore Kumar said, “We did not want to use aggressive methods to enforce discipline. We tried this model where people don’t feel that they are being disciplined. Instead, the public has now become conscious. People are not just watching themselves but others as well.”

Sources said that this has not only ensured distancing but has also brought down panic buying.

The GoM, led by defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by home minister Amit Shah , I&B minister Prakash Javadekar and petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan among others, also expressed concern at the movement of migrant workers and their gatherings at various state borders.

“The states have been asked to make arrangements for sheltering the migrant workers at temporary camps, with provision of food and other amenities for them. Adequate funds under SRDF (state disaster response fund) are available for this purpose,” said an official.

“The GoM was also briefed about the availability and supply of essential commodities such as food and medicines, which are satisfactory and no major issues are envisaged in this regard,” he added.

Similarly, petroleum products are available in adequate quantities in all parts of the country. “It is being ensured that supplies for a minimum of 10 days are being maintained. Cargo movement of essential commodities by train, air and road is also being carried out. Any issue that may arise locally will be resolved,” he said.

Over 700 people aboard the luxury liner had contracted the virus then. After spending 23 days of the quarantine period on the ship, he was allowed to return to India. But soon after landing, Piyush was taken to a government facility in Manesar for another 14 days. That was not the end of it.Piyush returned to Meerut and was advised to spend another fortnight locked inside his house.

On the avoidance list is Kalaburagi, where the first coronavirus death in India was reported, Ahmedabad, which saw three deaths, Indore in Madhya Pradesh and some of the metros. Even places like Kanyakumari , the southern most tip of India, is being avoided despite the local district administration clarifying that some three deaths that occurred this week were unrelated to Covid-19.

Shanmugavelan P, 42, owner of Sri Lakshmi Logistics, with four trucks says, ""My driver took the truck filled with bananas from Sivaganga ( Tamil Nadu ) to my friend's office in Nagercoil . He parked it there and refused to go further saying people are dying in Kanyakumari.""

Bal Malkit Singh , chairman, All Indian Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC), says most of their drivers have worked with them for over a decade, but are now declining duty. ""They don't even want to travel to big cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru with the loads as they are also getting news on their mobile phones as to the number of cases in each of these cities,"" he says.

Currently driving from Nashik in Maharashtra to Delhi, truck driver Rehan S, 32, says, ""I have a wife and two kids. My father manages my farm alone in Bhokarhedi, UP. My family really fears for my safety. Other drivers abandoned the vehicles but I haven't. I don't know what will happen to my family if I get corona. But I fear losing my income, so I am staying on. I know it won't be a good year for farming and I can't depend on my dad.""

Bangalore Wholesale Food Grains and Pulses Merchants Association general secretary Ramesh Chandra says ""it's a perception battle.""

Farmer Amresh K Diwedi, who has a 15-acre farm in Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, says. ""The harvesters haven't come from Punjab and Haryana. We depend on them to bring the harvesting machines (worth Rs 8.5-10 lakh) and labour to harvest our pulses, grains and wheat crop. And this wheat crop has to be harvested in the next 45 days or I will be staring at a dead loss. If it rains in the interim also I will lose my crop.""

Exhausted after the strenuous journey, mainly during nights to evade police vigil, Sheikh collapsed before he could reach home. His brothers managed to rescue him. A daily-wage labourer in Patna, Sheikh had to flee his workplace following countrywide lockdown in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.

“Had he stayed there, he could have died of hunger even before the virus attacked him. The day after lockdown, his employer said he could not provide for their food. He had no option left,” said his wife Selina Bibi.

Over the past three days, at least 300 migrant workers tried to reach out to the Murshidabad administration for help. More than 3,500 workers from the district — which has one of the highest numbers of migrant labourers in West Bengal — have come back home after their employers failed to provide food following the lockdown.

Thousands, mostly engaged in unorganised sectors, starved through the first few days of lockdown and desperately sought help. Most pleaded on social networking sites while some managed to get in touch with the state administration.

Although there is no official estimate of migrant labourers from Bengal, state home department sources pointed out that over 1.16 lakh of them are at work outside the state at present. Primary estimates show that only 1.5% of workers could return home.

“In many cases, the state administration has directly got in touch with the respective chief ministers and made arrangements for relief. There are hundreds of cases being reported each day,” said Bengal labour minister Malay Ghatak.

On Saturday, Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, an organisation working closely with the state government on issues related to workers’ migration, submitted a list of more than 10,000 local workers who have reached out on social media for help. “Most are stranded in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. The numbers are increasing each day,” said Mancha secretary Tanmoy Ghosh.

In Bengaluru’s Doddabeli Labour Colony, nearly 189 workers from Malda and South Dinajpur are stranded. Their family members have reached out to North Malda MP Khagen Murmu.

The Nadia administration has so far received nearly 150 requests from local workers in other states. Similarly, more than 200 workers have reached out to the Purulia administration for help. Workers who entered Bengal till Sunday morning were made to undergo thermal screening. In West Midnapore alone, nearly 5,000 workers crossed interstate borders for Bengal.

State chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, in a note to DMs, said such landlords may face action under the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

The order also says that wages of such employees should not be deducted during the lockdown period on the ground that the shop or establishment had to close down.

Moreover, the administration has been asked to be vigilant about migrant workers or those who have returned from overseas and if they are not properly following the norm of home quarantine, then the administration should place them in government quarantine. Similarly, migrant labourers who had returned during lockdown and are not following home isolation norms too need to be put in quarantine in government facilities. Sinha also mentioned that DMs could check the option of using the services of NGOs to provide shelter to homeless people.

Earlier, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla held a video-conference with chief secretaries and asked them to arrange food and shelter for stranded migrant labourers and other people stuck in different states due to the lockdown. Bhalla also wrote to Sinha on Sunday that movement of all goods without distinction between essential and non-essential be allowed. He also advised the state government to utilize funds from the state disaster relief fund for homeless people and migrant labourers who are stuck. Bhalla also urged Sinha to issue directives to DMs to stop the movement of migrants and provide them with food and shelter.

Police said the deceased and his elder sister were living at the aforesaid address and both were unmarried. Barna, a diabetic petient, was bedridden since long.

414,['30/03/2020'],Kolkata doctors protest after given raincoats as protective wear,"KOLKATA: Desperate times have necessitated some desperate innovations but, on the ground, some of the intended beneficiaries have not been impressed.The state health department, aware that it is woefully short of gloves and masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors and other healthcare workers, has started arming them with raincoats at some places, including the Medical College Hospital and the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beliaghata.The innovative approach to solve the problem has run into hot weather at both MCH and ID Hospital with doctors and healthcare workers. The ID Hospital is at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19 in Bengal and MCH has been earmarked as the state’s first speciality Covid-19 hospital.Experts do not seem to have anything against the innovation. “There is no harm in using plastic raincoats since the material is a good one and offers sound protection against viral contamination,” said virologist Amitabha Nandy. “But raincoats must be tailored to ensure that they cover the neck and upper portion of the shoulders that tend to remain exposed in the conventional ones. More importantly, they must be discarded every 4-5 hours if they are being used indoors to treat Covid-19 patients or suspects.”Clinics at government hos-pitals, where Covid-19 suspects are screened, are mainly run by junior doctors. Some of them have resented that they are having to don raincoats instead of proper PPE.Doctors, especially at MCH, are apprehensive about their personal protection. “We are raring to go and realize that there is a scarcity of PPEs. But if even one of us is infected, it will be a blow to the morale of the healthcare fraternity. Most of the PPE components are available and garments manufacturing units can produce them, like they did in China. We appeal to corporate bodies in the city to come forward and make this happen,” said a doctor who is part of the Covid-19 team at MCH.“PPEs are also made of plastic material but need to be very tough and thick. Given the scenario, we can improvise. Though not ideal, raincoats will provide some protection, since they are also made of plastic. But these should be made from thicker plastic,” said Bhaskar Narayan Chaudhury, a microbiologist at Peerless Hospital.KK Aggarwal, president of the Confederation of Medical Association of Asia and Oceania (CMAOO), agreed. “Several countries are using innovations to fill the gap between demand and supply of PPEs. Since mid-February, Indonesia’s health workers, doctors and nurses have been working overtime to treat COVID-19 cases despite many of them having inadequate protection. Many of the medical workers wore only plastic raincoats modified to approximate hazmat suits,” he said.Microbiologists suggested a surgical gown be worn underneath and the buttons of the raincoats be stitched at the back. The surgical gowns should be disinfected with either sodium hyprochloride or bleaching power solution before it goes to the laundry.“Raincoats are no substitute for PPEs. But, given the scenario, options are too few. The raincoats should at least be of quality and proper size to ensure maximum protection,” said Sumon Poddar, microbiologist, Institute of Child Health.Nandy, however, added that plastic raincoats should be seen as a stop-gap arrangement. “Also, other than raincoats that can be used as an alternative to protective suits, gloves, masks and face protection gear are more important. It must be ensured that all healthcare workers have enough of them,” said Nandy.Others, like Narayana Health medic Kaushik Chaki, felt using raincoats violated the WHO guidelines on PPE and put doctors at great risk. “There are specific guidelines on the material of protective suits and their weight. You can’t ask doctors to wear raincoats while treating Covid-19 patients. If we get infected, the virus could be transmitted to hundreds of other patients across hospitals,” said Chaki.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74881309,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-420162,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/raincoat-shield-idea-finds-expert-support-docs-see-red/articleshow/74880274.cms

NEW DELHI: Mother Dairy , one of India’s leading dairy companies, has written to major food e-commerce players, including Bigbasket, Milkbasket and Supr Daily, to operate as a team to maintain a smooth supply of milk .

Senior executives at Mother Dairy said the dairy giant is ready to increase production and use the distribution network of the online players to reach consumers at locations that do not have milk booths.

“We are ready to operate at our fullest capacity. Currently, we are operating around an average of 35 lakh litres a day. If e-commerce players are experiencing surged demand in some areas, we can increase our capacity by over 10%, with backing of smooth distribution,” said a Mother Dairy spokesperson.

Earlier, both Amul, India’s largest dairy player, and Mother Dairy had said milk procurement has increased after the lockdown, with no imminent chance of a short supply for consumers.

The consumer demand of varied categories of milk products has been as usual, except for ice-cream, which has been hit badly, the dairy player said.

It has also doubled its supply of fruits and vegetables through Safal brand to more than 300 metric tonnes in the Delhi-NCR region amid the ongoing lockdown.

“Milk and its products, along with fruits and vegetables, come under the essential goods category and are covered in the list of exceptions issued by various states and central government authorities, and accordingly movement of stakeholders is being managed with the help of local enforcement agencies,” said the Mother Dairy spokesperson.

The only exception to the scheme will be filing of documents related to creating a charge for purposes of loans and those on enhancement of authorised capital. “This is a one-time option for all companies and LLPs. There is no time bar, so they can go back in time and cure all their compliance-related issues,” said a source, requesting anonymity.The message to the industry was that there is no need to worry as the immediate concerns related to filings and other compliances have been eased. At the same time, the ministry has made it clear that companies should not use the coronavirus crisis to seek relaxations in long-term compliances. Besides, the government wants to ensure that corporate governance standards are not compromised.For instance, during the interaction with industry groups last week, one of the large corporate houses sought a relaxation in norms for overall borrowing limit and suggested the bar should be raised as it intended to raise money over the next few days and undertake significant capital expenditure. The government, however, turned down the request, arguing that in these times, when there is a complete lockdown across the country, fundraising and capex were difficult to make. “This is not business as usual, we need to ensure that people are safe and compliance issues do not hobble them,” said a government source.

And with at least 20 more people in their contact chain showing symptoms of the novel coronavirus infection, health department officials said the Covid-19 thread emerging from Cease Fire had likely set off local transmissions.The total number of Covid-19 cases in Noida now stands at 32, of which 19 are linked to Cease Fire, the company which has an office in Sector 135 in Noida. The source of the infection, according to health department officials, is believed to be an auditor from Britain the company had earlier this month, John Humphreys.Humphreys, however, told TOI on Sunday over the phone from the UK that he was completely healthy and unaware of the infection link drawn from him. “If anything, I’m scared now that I may have contracted the disease from the company, factory and its sites,” said Humphreys (71), adding he had no symptoms and had not been tested. It also came to light on Sunday the company’s MD, who was asymptomatic and tested positive only on Saturday, had also been to the UK. The health department had on Saturday ordered an FIR against the company for not disclosing Humphreys’ visit.A list of 161 employees of Cease Fire has been drawn up for screening, of whom 46 are based in Noida. The man who tested positive in Bareilly, officials said, is also a Cease Fire employee and had gone there from Noida on March 21.The new cases to emerge in Noida on Sunday included four employees of Cease Fire in sector 135, a 32-year-old man in Bishnoli (Dadri), a 19-year-old woman in Sector 27, a man in Wajidpur near Sector 135 and a 37-year-old man in a housing society in 137. The other are a couple that had come into contact with the Sector 137 resident. All six have been admitted at GIMS in Greater Noida, which now has 18 Covid patients.The two who tested positive in Ghaziabad are also a couple — the woman is a part of Cease Fire’s HR team. They live in a housing society in Mohan Nagar. The health department has so far traced more than 100 contacts of the couple, of which 20 are showing symptoms. Chief medical officer (CMO) NK Gupta said all of them were being admitted to the isolation ward of MMG District Hospital while the remaining ones, who are asymptomatic now, would be kept in the isolation ward of Santosh Hospital.A 32-year-old man living in Shalimar Garden Extension 2 who had tested positive last Thursday is also a Cease Fire employee, officials said. He was admitted to the district hospital on March 24. His family — parents, wife, child and domestic help — and a colleague are all under home quarantine.Noida’s chief medical officer Dr Anurag Bhargava said, the contact chain of the Cease Fire MD, who is a resident on Sector 44, is being tracked down. “He returned from the UK on March 1 but showed no symptoms of Covid-19, hence had not got tested (as per government guidelines). He, however, got himself tested on his own from a private lab when he suspected some symptoms and tested positive,” said Dr Bhargava.Health department officials said all connections of Cease Fire and its employees would be screened over the next few days. They believe the infection source is Humphreys, who was in Noida from March 15 to 19.

NOIDA: John Humphreys , a 71-year-old auditor from the UK whose visit, health department officials suspect, set off the chain reaction of the novel coronavirus infection among employees of the Sector 135 company, is healthy back home and has not shown any symptoms of coronavirus yet.Humphreys spoke to TOI over the phone and said he did not feel the need to get himself tested after his return from India because he had not shown any symptoms yet. “If anything, I’m scared now that I may have contracted the disease from the company, factory and its sites,” he said.Humphreys is an external auditor who had visited the office of Sector 135-based Cease Fire earlier this month. Soon after he left, an employee who was in primary contact with Humphreys tested positive for Covid-19 . The employee’s wife also had the infection.Humphreys said he had landed in Delhi on March 11 and taken a flight directly to Dehradun. From there, he had to visit the town of Selaqui, where Cease Fire manufactures its fire safety equipment. From Selaqui, he had come to Noida on March 15 and left for the UK four days later. “While in Noida, I visited their office on March 15 and another site where special fire safety equipment was being installed. The next day, I visited another site — a Chinese restaurant — to check a kitchen suppressant system. I would have directly met about 10-20 people in the office during meetings. But there were more people whom I had met at the factory in Selaqui,” Humphreys told TOI.Health department officials in Noida had earlier said they had information that Humphreys was symptomatic. “Employees of the company had said he had fever and cough when he had come to Noida,” Dr Anurag Bhargava, the chief medical officer, had said.Humphreys, however, said he was fine in Noida and the cough may have been because of food he didn’t like. “The food in Noida wasn’t really good and may have made me cough a bit. But every time I entered the hotel, the thermal gun showed my temperature at 96 degrees,” he said.Asked if he was aware of the infection chain being linked to him, Humphreys said he wasn’t, but added: “It’s very similar to what happens in our country. If anything goes wrong, we blame the foreigners.”While Humphreys’ visit to Cease Fire remains the period they are focusing on, there are other employees in Cease Fire who had travelled abroad. “There are three persons with recent travel history in the company, including the man from the UK.

423,['30/03/2020'],"Diesel Cars in India: Over 40 diesel cars, SUVs to go off road in April","NEW DELHI: Come April and diesel versions of over 40 cars and SUVs will be phased out from the market as companies shift their focus completely to petrol models and cleaner CNG and electric versions, with the onset of the BS6 emission norms era.The move comes at a time when dealerships are stretched due to closures related to the coronavirus outbreak, and there is not much hope to clear the idle BS4 inventory by the March 31 deadline after the national lockdown was ordered. The petition of dealers and some companies to give them more time to dispose of the BS4 inventory has already been dealt with by the Supreme Court, and they have been given permission to only sell 10% of the pending stock.Many companies have decided to move out diesel versions from their line-up as they would have required heavy investments to upgrade to the stricter emission standard, and thus would become highly expensive for consumers. The diesel models to move out include popular ones such as Maruti’s Brezza mini SUV and Dzire entry sedan, Renault’s Duster, Skoda’s Octavia, Maruti’s Swift, Volkswagen’s Polo and Audi’s Q3 and Q5 SUVs.“Of the 86 diesel models currently selling in the country, a total of 42 will be discontinued, including seven from Maruti,” Shashank Srivastava, director (marketing & sales) at the country’s biggest carmaker Maruti Suzuki , told TOI.Justifying the move, companies said higher upgrade costs would mean that consumers will no longer be open to buying diesels. The theory gains more strength as the gap between the fuel prices of petrol and diesel has come down significantly, taking some of the sheen off the diesel variants. Also, with diesel vehicles carrying a life-span of 10 years against 15 years for petrol models in markets such as Delhi-NCR, many consumers tend to opt for the latter.Maruti was among the first ones to announce their intention to move out of the diesel segment around one year ago. “In small cars, the cost of upgrading diesel engines to BS6 standards will be substantial. With the price increase, these vehicles will become unviable for customers. We will completely stop selling diesel vehicles from April next year,” Maruti chairman R C Bhargava had said.Maruti’s move has been followed by others such as Renault, Nissan, Volkswagen, Skoda and Audi, even though many others are yet to give up on diesels. Those still betting on diesel include Hyundai and group company Kia, Tata Motors , Mahindra & Mahindra and Toyota, Ford, and Mercedes-Benz. Srivastava said the share of diesel will progressively come down as buyers are increasingly opting for petrols, even in the SUV segment where diesel had held a strong sway. The trend gets clearer when one looks at the falling share of diesels in SUVs, hatchbacks and sedans.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74881250,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-716946,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/over-40-diesel-cars-suvs-to-go-off-road-in-april/articleshow/74880556.cms

Aimed at ensuring that essential service providers get their passes quickly that will help them move about their job without any hindrances, almost 80% of those who applied turned out to be those who either do not need this pass or don’t even qualify for the same.Till 3pm, Lalbazar reportedly issued barely 250 passes after a thorough check. “Further screening is on with a special team dedicated for this purpose. We plan to clear maximum passes so that they can be issued on Monday morning,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.Police said among those who have applied for the same, several have stated that they needed the pass to buy groceries or medicines. “We are replying to each one and explaining why it is not possible to issue them such passes,” said an officer at Lalbazar.

439,['30/03/2020'],"Donald Trump: US President Trump extends virus guidelines, braces US for big death toll","WASHINGTON: Bracing the nation for a death toll that could exceed 100,000 people, President Donald Trump on Sunday extended restrictive social distancing guidelines through April, bowing to public-health experts who presented him with even more dire projections for the expanding coronavirus pandemic.It was a stark shift in tone by the president, who only days ago mused about the country reopening in a few weeks. From the Rose Garden, he said his Easter revival hopes had only been ``aspirational.''The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government expires Monday and Trump had expressed interest in relaxing the national guidelines at least in parts of the country less afflicted by the pandemic. He instead decided to extend them through April 30, a tacit acknowledgment he'd been too optimistic. Many states and local governments have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings.Trump's impulse to reopen the country met a sober reality check Sunday from Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, who said the U.S. could experience more than 100,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic. That warning hardened a recognition in Washington that the struggle against the coronavirus will not be resolved quickly even as Trump expressed a longing for normalcy.``I want our life back again,'' the president told reporters in the Rose Garden.Trump, who has largely avoided talk of potential death and infection rates, cited projection models that said potentially 2.2 million people or more could have died had social distancing measures not been put in place. And he said the country would be doing well if it ``can hold`` the number of deaths ``down to 100,000.`` He said the best case for the country would be for the death rate to peak in about two weeks.``It's a horrible number,`` Trump said, but added, ``We all together have done a very good job.''Brought forward by Trump at the outdoor briefing, Fauci said his projection of a potential 100,000 to 200,000 deaths is ``entirely conceivable`` if not enough is done to mitigate the crisis. He said that helped shape the extension of the guidelines, which he called ``a wise and prudent decision.''Americans are now being called on to prepare for another 30 days of severe economic and social disruption, as schools and businesses are closed and public life is upended. One in 3 Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus.Trump acknowledged that he may be forced to extend the guidelines again at the end of April, but expressed hope that by June 1, ``we should be well on our way to recovery.''The federal guidelines recommend against group gatherings larger than 10 and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home. People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, non-essential travel and shopping trips.For more than a week, Trump had been bombarded by calls from outside business leaders who urged him to begin re-opening the nation's economy and warned of catastrophic consequences that could damage his re-election chances if it remained shuttered for much longer.``The president is right. The cure can't be worse than the disease, and we're going to have to make some difficult trade-offs,`` Trump's top economic adviser Larry Kudlow had said last Monday, reflecting the thinking of his economic team.That talk alarmed health experts, who urged Trump to keep encouraging people to stay home. The virus was still spreading, with the peak still weeks away, the experts warned.In the end, Trump, in the face of dire projections and increasingly alarming images out of New York, sided with his health experts and backed off the idea of loosening recommended restrictions on less impacted parts of the country.``They're the best in the profession and they didn't like that idea,'' he said of Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, head of the White House coronavirus task force.Trump was clearly moved by the scenes from New York, particularly hard-hit Elmhurst Hospital in his native Queens.``I've been watching that for the last week on television,`` he said. ''Body bags all over, in hallways. I've been watching them bring in trailer trucks _ freezer trucks, they're freezer trucks, because they can't handle the bodies, there are so many of them. This is essentially in my community, in Queens, Queens, New York,`` he continued. ``I've seen things that I've never seen before.''Phasing out the recommendations would have been a symbolic nod to business and an affront to public health experts, but may have had little practical impact. States across the country already have their own restrictions in place that, in many cases, are far stricter than the administration's, and those would have remained in place.Birx and Fauci said even those areas yet to face a significant outbreak must prepare for the eventuality that they will.``This can happen anywhere,`` Fauci said. ``And that's really one of the issues that we're concerned about and why we were so reluctant to pull back at a time when we need to put our foot on the gas as opposed to on the brake.''The U.S. had more than 139,000 COVID-19 cases reported by Sunday evening, with more than 2,400 deaths. During the course of the Rose Garden briefing, reported deaths grew by several dozen and the number of cases by several thousand.Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies.Fauci's prediction would take the death toll well past that of the average seasonal flu. Trump repeatedly cited the flu's comparatively much higher cost in lives in playing down the severity of this pandemic.Trump's change in tone was previewed Saturday, when the president suggested then backed away from instituting an ``enforceable'' quarantine of hard-hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey. Instead, the White House task force recommended a travel advisory for residents of those states to limit non-essential travel to slow the spread of the virus to other parts of the U.S.The quarantine notion was strongly opposed by the governors of those states, who argued it would cause panic.Even as he opted against the quarantine, Trump on Sunday suggested without evidence that hospitals and hospital systems were ``hoarding'' ventilators and other medical supplies that were needed in other areas of the state. He also encouraged the Food and Drug Administration to streamline approvals for companies seeking to sanitize badly needed respirators so they can be reused.For weeks, Trump minimized the gravity of the pandemic, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Sunday accused Trump of ``denial'' in the crisis and called it ``deadly.``Asked whether she believes that attitude cost American lives, Pelosi told CNN: ``Yes, I am. I'm saying that.``Former Vice President Joe Biden , the likely Democratic presidential nominee, said he wouldn't go so far as to lay the blame for deaths on the president. ``I think that's a little too harsh,`` he told NBC.",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74880612,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-221745,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/us/trump-extends-virus-guidelines-braces-us-for-big-death-toll/articleshow/74880608.cms

The city saw a huge influx of perishable items. For the first time during the lockdown period, in many wholesale markets, there were no takers for 10% of vegetables on Sunday.

State government has started a transport control for coordination with other states for cargo that either originates from Bengal or is scheduled to come here.

For the first time since March 20, the day Janata Curfew was announced by the Prime Minister, grocery stores witnessed a respite from panic-buying. Stabilized supply has instilled confidence among buyers and panic-buying has largely diminished.

Posta Merchants’ Association general secretary Biswanath Agarwal said: “70% of the wholesale shops kept their doors opened. Even on Sunday, a weekly closure day for Posta, we managed to run 30% shops for keeping the the supply chain to retail markets alive.”

There is a shortage of staff and porters, who load and unload items. An association member said: “We have arranged for food and accommodation for staffers, who could not return home and ‘mutias’, who managed to come walking from their distant homes.”

From 12pm till 4am, Koley Market, one of the biggest wholesale markets in the city, saw tremendous influx of vegetables. “Koley Market received 170 trucks of vegetables. This is almost one-and-a-half times more than the usual supply. On Sunday, supply surpassed demand and 10% vegetables had no takers,” said Kamal Dey , president, West Bengal Vegetable Vendors ’ Association.

The price of potato has plunged but there is a yawning gap between the wholesale and retail price. The Jyoti variety was sold at Rs 13/kg in Hooghly, where it is produced in large scale. The wholesale price was Rs 15. “Potato should have been available in Kolkata markets at Rs16-18/kg. But it is selling at Rs 20-23/kg,” said Hooghly Potato Traders association secretary Lalu Mukherjee.

Following a series of measures adopted by the state government, the supply chain assumed the robustness. The state government is closely monitoring the markets. The Enforcement Branch, too, has been carrying out necessary raids. “We hope that if there is any demand-supply gap, it will be completely eliminated from Monday,” said a source.

KOLKATA: On Saturday, Moushumi Ghosh made an online bank transfer of salary to her driver. That was almost a fortnight after she went into home quarantine after the outbreak of Covid-19. But as month-end approaches, she is worried about how to pay the salary of her domestic help. Neither is the latter conversant with online banking nor is the branch of the bank close to her house open for withdrawing money .

Ghosh is not the only one who is facing this problem. Lockdown has compelled most Kolkatans to grant paid leaves to domestic helps and drivers. As month-end approaches, paying salaries to helping hands is another worry plaguing many. Online transfers are easier option for those familiar with digital money. But the problem is with the rest who either don’t have the accounts or do not have branches close to their residence. In the absence of public transport, reaching banks to withdraw money is no less a challenge. In times of social isolation, there is also a fear of large crowd not being allowed at banks to withdraw money in the beginning of the month.

Both the driver and maid of retired professor Tapati Sengupta , who stays in a city highrise, had called her up to assure that she shouldn’t worry about paying their salaries now. While Sengupta is moved by their gesture, her son will do a bank transfer of her driver’s salary. “One of the part-timers, who stays in a nearby slum, may come to the reception and collect the money after seeking special permission,” Sengupta said.

However, the greater problem is with the one who has to take a train and travel for over an hour to reach this highrise. Neither does she have a bank account nor a smart phone. “I have spoken to her. She is ready to collect it after 15th. The bigger worry also is accessing ATMs by us and them,” she added.

Ghosh too has similar problems. “Being on home quarantine, we have absolutely no physical connection with the outside world. I am worried about my maid since there is no use transferring the money to her account. She said the bank close to her house will only open after April 14,” Ghosh added.

Champa Srinivasan’s domestic helps stay close by but the problem that’s making her anxious is the availability of hard cash. She lives in a highrise along with her husband while her children are out of town. The elderly couple has decided to pay an advance of two months’ salaries to their domestic helps. “All this while, we have been using plastic money for transaction. I can’t drive and for cash, my husband has to drive to an ATM to withdraw sufficient cash,” said Srinivasan, anxious about whether or not the nearest ATM outlet will be open and sufficient funds available for withdrawal.

With a three-week lockdown and work from home mandatory for most people, the state administration has tasked the managing committees of housing societies to ensure that residents do not step outside their homes unless essential. On Thursday, the deputy district registrar of co-operative societies issued a detailed dos and don’ts to housing societies to combat the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.

The order, issued on behalf of the collector, also requires the provision of sanitiser, soap, and water for every person entering the society gate. Members have been directed to collect demands of grocery, vegetables, etc from each member on the intercom and place orders with the nearestgrocery store or vegetable vendor.

‘Deliveries at hsg society gate only, ensure social distancing’

The managing committee also has to ensure that the delivery is made at the society gate, directs the order issued on behalf of the collector. It is then to be delivered to every flat by the security or by calling one member from every family to come to the gate and collect the provisions. However, if the distribution is at the gate, then social distancing has to be ensured.

The committee members even have to verify that those returning from abroad are strictly quarantined and health check-ups are done as per medical advice.

Office-bearers have been made responsible to ensure residents do not step out of the society gates unless absolutely essential.

They also have to enforce that senior citizens and children do not come in contact in common open spaces, like the club house or garden. Most societies have already shut these amenities and proactively put in place restrictions to ensure that residents stay completely under lockdown. Some have also ensured that senior citizens who live alone are taken care of by neighbours in turns.

Additionally, all help, including maids, drivers, caregivers and newspaper vendors, have been banned from housing societies, with only the conservancy worker and milk delivery person allowed entry beyond the gates.

Ruchir Bansal, a Churchgate resident, said their building has minimised movement of vehicles. “Provisions and medicines are to be collected at the gate. We have banned the entry of help, except those catering to senior citizens who live alone.” he said. The landlady of a residential building near Mantralaya in south Mumbai said they too have placed restrictions. “Today, I shot off a letter to one or two residents who would not listen. Deliveries are to be collected at the gate; service staff has been minimised. How long it will hold out I do not know,” she said.

444,['30/03/2020'],Social distancing: Only 10 to attend soccer legend’s shraddh today,"KOLKATA: The Covid-19 scare and the ensuing lockdown protocol to stop the spread of the disease has forced the kin of football legend PK Banerjee to invite only 10 family members on his shraddh ceremony in Salt Lake on Monday, with a strict diktat that no other people should enter their home and that even those performing the ritual should maintain the requisite distance among each other in accordance with the social distancing practice.

“My father had always been very health conscious and a responsible citizen. In his death, we cannot entertain a large number of guests violating the lockdown and social distancing protocol that we have been asked to maintain. Hence, we have been pleading with folded hands to our relatives and well-wishers to kindly pay homage to my father from the safety of their homes and not to come to our place to attend the function. It will be a very low-key affair with only immediate family members and we will try our best maintain the social distancing protocol even while performing the rituals,” said Paula Bandyopadhyay, Banerjee’s elder daughter.

She added that those who would still drop in can pay homage and put a garland on a photograph of PK Banerjee that would be kept outside their home at DH 131 in Salt Lake, but none will be allowed inside.

Pradip Kumar Banerjee, a footballing colossus of his time died on March 20 at the age of 83 at a Salt Lake Hospital, where he was admitted for about three weeks. He was suffering from respiratory problems due to pneumonia and had an underlying history of Parkinson’s disease, dementia and heart problem.

He was captain of the Indian team that last played the Olympics in Rome in 1960. A member of the holy trinity, that also included Chuni Goswami and Tulsidas Balaram , Banerjee was the last surviving scorer of the 1962 Asiad gold-winning team. He retired as a player in 1967 after suffering recurring injuries. But he then went on to accumulate a staggering 54 trophies as a coach.

“My brother has a number of admirers spread across the nation. Many of them, including ace footballers, cricketers, politicians and intellectuals of present and past generation had expressed desire to attend the ceremony but we have requested them not to come. I have even asked my own brothers and their children to stay away from the function as that is the call for the current situation we are in,” said Prasun Banerjee, former footballer, Banerjee’s youngest brother and a member of Parliament from Howrah.

The family had initially planned of making a seating arrangement of around 150-odd mourners who will be made to sit at a gap of 2 to 3 feet at a park outside the house. But after the lockdown protocol was laid down, even that idea was scrapped.

Among all the difficulties of conducting a ritual during this state of emergency, the one problem that the family faced the most was to arrange flowers and sweets — both must-haves in a Hindu shraddh ritual.

“My brother loved sweets, particularly rasagolla. But I have called several of my contacts but could not arrange it for the day. I even failed to arrange flowers and was in a fix as in how to manage the shraddh. But then my party colleague and local MLA Sujit Bose came to my rescue. He has promised to arrange the flowers and some boxes of sandesh from some place. He will send it to our house on Monday,” said Banerjee.

The family says once the lockdown is lifted and the situation normalises they will arrange for a large-scale ‘smaransabha’ for the legendary footballer. “If we don’t arrange a remembrance function, it will be unjust even for his followers. But all of them will be done only after the situation normalises. Currently, we citizens need to stay at home and maintain the social distancing protocol to defeat the virus. Had my brother been alive, I am sure, he would have told us to do the same,” Banerjee said.

445,['30/03/2020'],Retail chains in talks with food app aggregators,"KOLKATA: Amid the Covid-19 lockdown, leading retail chains such as Spencer’s, Big Bazaar and Reliance Fresh have initiated discussions with food delivery apps such as Swiggy and Zomato for possible home delivery of grocery items. The idea was first mooted in a state government meeting on Saturday at Nabanna, following which the retail chains have reached out to the food delivery aggregators.

Meanwhile, e-grocery firms, who were earlier stuck amid irregular supply and restriction, claim to have resumed services in select areas. An official said it’s a win-win situation for both e-grocers and food delivery services as food apps are not getting adequate business. The apps could partner with at least 10,000-12,000 delivery firms in the city.

Associations of various wholesaler markets in Posta and Burrabazar, e-commerce firms Amazon and Flipkart, e-grocers BigBasket and Grofers and hypermarts like Spencer’s and Big Bazaar had attended the meeting.

Business head of Future Group (east), Manish Agarwal, said, “We are discussing with them (Swiggy and Zomato) and trying to arrive at a solution.” A spokesperson of Spencer’s said it’s exploring possibilities (tie-up with food apps). Agarwal pointed out it is catering to people under several constraints.

Sandip Agarwal, additional general secretary of Posta Bazar Merchants’ Association, also feels that only customers will be benefited from the move.

A Zomato spokesperson said they did not have anything to add to Saturday’s development. Swiggy’s comment, too, was not available till the report went to the press. Since Sunday morning, customers have started getting texts and calls from e-grocers that previous orders would be delivered first and they would begin taking fresh ones within a day.

Currently, 90% of Grofers warehouses are operational and it has deployed 50% of delivery partners. Rohit Sharma , head of supply chain, Grofers, said: “We have ramped up supply chain capabilities to secure sufficient stock. Delivery, though, may take time.” BigBasket said: “We are operational in Kolkata. We are creating a focused programme to bring back on-field workforce. For a huge backlog, prepaid order will be prioritized.”Amazon India is only delivering existing prepaid orders of essential products .

HYDERABAD: Scores of classrooms that normally echo with academic lectures and discussions will become stocking centres for paddy and other agriculture produce in Telangana.

With a bumper crop of over 1.05 crore metric tonne of paddy alone expected in April and farmers in Telangana barred from moving out of their villages due to the lockdown, chief minister KCR has now zeroed in on empty schools to save the agri produce. As a result, paddy and other agri products would be temporarily stored in government schools and junior colleges until the stocks are transported out.

Telangana does not have warehousing capacity for such huge stocks and this was the first time that paddy alone has been sown in over 38 lakh acres to make up for losses in the past few years. ""All crops put together are in over 51 lakh acres. We have chilli, maize and other crops as well that need to be purchased from farmers and stored,"" said a top government official.

""The state government requires Rs 35,000 crore to procure paddy and other agriculture products from farmers and to make transportation, storage and other logistic arrangements. Farmers need not panic. The government will buy every grain and other agriculture produce of farmers by going to their respective gram panchayats,"" KCR said on Sunday.

""Don't rush to towns to sell your produce. Every street and transport facility has been locked down. You will not be allowed to move out of your villages,"" KCR said.

CM assures farmers, government will offer MSP, buy paddy

Agriculture activity has almost doubled in Telangana due to 24x7 power supply, Rs 10,000 per acre per annum government sop to farmers towards crop input and water availability from various irrigation projects.

The chief minister assured farmers that the government will offer a minimum support price and purchase paddy. KCR also said that farmers were at liberty to sell their produce to either government that would set up procurement centres in all the villages or to private merchants, but only at minimum support price to be fixed by the government.

“The state government will deposit cheques for the paddy purchased from farmers into their bank accounts directly,” KCR added.

But a 39-year-old city-based dentist’s ordeal to find out if she is infected or not shows that Gurgaon, like many other parts of the country, is turning back patients with symptoms of the disease, causing them extreme anxiety, and increasing the chances of community transmission.The dentist, who was discharged from Medanta hospital on Saturday, shared on Facebook how she was pushed to a delirious state by extremely strong antibiotics after she developed Covid-like symptoms, while the only government testing centre in the district refused to analyse her sample.“On March 18, I got high fever, dry cough, headache and fatigue. I might have come in contact with international patients,” she began her post.When the fever did not subside in three days, she was asked to get a chest X-ray done. All through this period, she had isolated herself from her family and shut down her practice because the doctors she was in touch with about her condition had not ruled out a coronavirus infection.Getting an appointment for the X-ray was the beginning of her agony as the emergency ward of Artemis hospital turned her down when she called them. “They said I sound like a Covid suspect and hence, should go to Civil hospital or RML for my X-ray,” she wrote.The next day was the nationwide ‘janata curfew’, and panic-stricken, she drove alone in the middle of the night to ensure the chest scan is done before that. Two hours and a trip to Fortis hospital later, she managed to get hold of the chest X-ray results.Before going to bed that night, she feverishly sent screenshots of the report to her friends in the medical fraternity. The morning of the curfew, she opened her eyes to responses from two of the doctors saying the X-ray plates clearly show she has pneumonia. “While I was contemplating what to do next, I got a call from one of them saying that she spoke to a chest specialist and a radiologist. Both of them had the same thing to say: The symptoms are suggestive of Covid,” she recalled. She was asked to get herself admitted to a hospital immediately.Later that day, she got a bed at Medanta and was one of their first local Covid suspects with no travel history. “The protocols to treat Covid suspects were being established as I entered,” she observed before being taken to an isolation room. The hospital ran several tests and her throat swab was sent to the government facility in Rohtak the following morning, since the city doesn’t have a testing centre.While they waited for the result, the hospital started treating her for coronavirus infection, swine flu and bacterial pneumonia with the strongest of antibiotics, and that night, she experienced painful side-effects of the stiff concoction. “I thought I could die from nausea and headache rather than Covid. I threw up several times, and begged the nurses to give me anti-emetics and paracetamol,” she remembers vividly.She felt better the next day but the long night’s exhaustion had taken a toll. “The intravenous lines ended up getting blocked and new veins had to be found to inject more,” she shared.To add to her suffering, two days into this experiment, she was told that the Rohtak lab had rejected her sample as she did not fulfil the criteria for conducting the Covid-19 test. She broke down on hearing the news and implored to find an alternative.The doctors decided to send her sample to the private lab, Dr Lal Pathlabs, which has been authorised to run Covid-19 tests.“She is not Covid-19 positive,” said Dr Sushila Kataria, an intensive care expert, Medanta, confirming that she was admitted.Talking about the stigma associated with this disease, the dentist said, “Nobody wants to visit this floor.”Her conclusion from her experience was that, “The government doesn’t give a damn about its doctors.” Although in her first post, she called out the Centre for not providing enough testing kits to the labs she claims are ready to handle the tests, a toned-down follow-up piece explained that her post was not political.“If I, as a doctor, could not ascertain that mine was a case of bacterial pneumonia and not Covid 19, how will the common man be able to do this?” she said, urging the government to do something about the shortage of kits and to ensure those experiencing complications like herself at least be tested.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/gurgaon-dentists-harrowing-experience-to-get-tested-for-covid-points-at-the-acute-anxiety-among-those-showing-symptoms/articleshow/74879956.cms

The sister, a 22-year-old student of London university, tested positive on March 18 and was admitted to the Civil Hospital in Sector 10 and later shifted to Fortis. Her 16-year-old brother had also tested positive and was admitted to same private hospital on March 21.The hospital said both had fever and cough when they were brought in and were treated in the isolation ward as per their symptoms.

In mild cases, this might simply mean rest and fever-reducing medications such as paracetamol. Oxygen therapy is the intervention for patients with severe infection. Mechanical ventilation may be necessary when oxygen therapy isn’t successful. Support for other failing organs such as dialysis may also be required.”He shared that the process of preparing the staff to fight the pandemic and treat patients, was time-consuming.“When doctors are in the isolation ward, they can’t use washroom or can’t have water for more than six hours,” he added.“I have a wife and son (19) at home.

GURGAON: Residents of DLF-3 have been grappling with hygiene and sanitation issues for the past three-four days. While they blamed both civic bodies and waste management agency Ecogreen for their “apathy”, Ecogreen said it has lost a chunk of its manpower to the mass migration of panic-struck workers to their hometowns.

Health expects have been stressing on the importance of waste management during the Covid-19 outbreak. In DLF-3, as garbage piles up, anxieties mount.

Residents said while garbage collection was always infrequent, it has stopped altogether now.

“For the past three-four days, nobody has come to pick up garbage. Residents are leaving their waste, tied up in polybags , in front of their homes, and it’s been piling up,” said Vidya Deshpande , a member of DLF-3 RWA.

Other residents said they are extremely anxious about the matter as these aren’t normal times, since the country is battling with a pandemic. “There is a chance of the spread of vector-borne diseases if the garbage isn’t cleared soon,” a resident said.

Officials from DLF, the developer, said garbage collection was handed over to MCG and Ecogreen. “We are responsible for sewage and drainage work, and that we are taking care of. Also, the sweeping of roads had become a challenge as a few workers haven’t been reporting to work since the lockdown. We’ll resume it on Sunday,” a DLF official said.

Ecogreen officials said new drivers are being called, however, and services will be restored from Monday onwards.

Meanwhile, MCG said it will send its workers to clean the area till the time Ecogreen restores its services. “We’re facing this challenge because workers of the third party that was looking into waste collection have left,” an MCG official said.

“We’ve deployed our staff and vehicles to clean up the area. We’re also distributing food and preventive gear to the workers so that they don’t shy away from work or try to leave the city,” the official added.

BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday said the government would arrange shelter for those stranded at the state borders and provide facilities to conduct medical examination on them.

About 1,000 migrant Kannadiga labourers are stranded along the Goa and Maharashtra borders with Karnataka. During an all-party meeting on Covid-19 pandemic chaired by the CM, the opposition parties attacked the government for its failure to provide transportation to migrant labourers from Karnataka working in other states.

Citing the home ministry's directive that the stranded migrants should stay put, Yediyurappa said the government, instead of making arrangements to bring them back, would ensure required amenities for them till the coronavirus crisis defuses. ""These are difficult times,"" the CM said.

A lucky few managed to reach home hours before the Centre issued the order. The Karnataka government arranged 70 buses to ferry 3,000 migrant labourers to their hometowns in Maharashtra and Rajasthan.

In Nangali of Kolar district, Andhra Pradesh sent 50 buses to pick up 1,400 stranded fishermen. The move came after it got the fishermen, who worked in Mangaluru and Udupi, medically examined and found them fit.

In the letter, Punjab’s director of health services stated that patients were facing difficulty in reaching outpatient opioid-assisted treatment (OOAT) clinics, government-run and private de-addiction centres. The department contended that chances of patients relapsing increases if they miss their daily dose of detoxification medicine and can be fatal as well.All deputy commissioners have been asked to give relaxation at their level to such under treatment addicts to visit centres to take medicine. They have been asked to direct centres in their jurisdiction to ensure that precautions are taken to avoid spread of coronavirus infection. In each centre, only one or two staff members equipped with protective mask and gloves will be deployed. Such centres have also been asked to ensure that there is no overcrowding and proper distance is maintained between patients and staff.

Many of these marchers have been left with no money and they hardly have any backup to sustain a living.On Sunday, hundreds of migrants labourers were seen walking in rows through agricultural fields near Shambhu border and crossing over into Haryana after walking through the Ghaggar riverbed.While security personnel continued to man state borders, labourers, who were seen carrying a few bags of clothing and other essentials, entered Haryana through rough patches and agricultural fields. The Haryana government has set up shelter homes in Ambala to accommodate these marchers and prevent them from moving ahead. Ambala Sadar police station SHO Nikita said elaborate security arrangements had been made to seal state borders. “All marchers coming from Punjab are being given two options- go back or stay at shelter homes set up by the state government,” she said, adding that under no circumstances, movement of people would be allowed as it would be a violation of the protocol set in place to contain the spread of coronavirus.She said force had been mobilised to check incoming marchers through agricultural fields. “All who will reach Haryana will be rounded up and taken to shelter homes,” she said.While thousands of job;es marchers are thronging the national capital in an attempt to go back to their homes, workers left with no money in Punjab said they would prefer walking back home rather than heading for Delhi. They said there was no system in place for them to go back home.Pappu, a marcher near Shambhu, said they would try to take a lift from trucks when possible to reach home.The Patiala administration had on Saturday sent five buses to transport Kashmiri workers to Jammu and Kashmir. But, so far, no such provisions have been made for workers who came to Punjab in large numbers for employment in factories, agricultural fields and construction projects. An officer, who did not wish to be named, said sending back a large number of migrant labourers would put them at the risk of contracting coronavirus and it was not feasible during the lockdown as all transport services were suspended.

He directed the officers to set up ‘shelter or relief camps’ and ensure that proper food and staying arrangements for the migrant labourers staying in such camps and if anyone still opposes staying, then strict action should be taken against him. He directed a nodal officer for every camp in each district should be appointed who will ensure lodging, food and medical facilities of the workers.

LUDHIANA: Around 50 travellers are still untraced in Ludhiana, and the health officials said this is because people fear social ostracism. To tackle this, the city administration has set up a new helpline, 0161 4622276, where neighbours and family could inform the authorities if they identify anyone with symptoms or have had travel history but not isolated.

The commissioner of police (CP), Rakesh Agrawal said, so far the police have traced 5,296 people. According to him, 95 teams have been tasked with tracing the people coming from abroad, along with with officials of district administration and health department. “We have found 5,296 people so far and health department’s rapid response team has tested them for symptoms of Covid-19.”

Besides the police, more than 350 officials from Khanna and Jagraon are involved in this process of tracking them. Police officials received a list of people who returned to India from the deputy commissioner (DC) and have been tracking them down.

The DC shares the details with the police officials about the traveller and if the traveller is traced, then police officials are sent to verify the details. If not, it is reported to higher authorities of state administration.

The CP said, “When we do trace them, we question them whether they have flu-like symptoms. In any case, they are recommended home quarantine. There is no question of humiliation here, it is for the welfare of everyone.”

More than 6,000 people, who had travel history or were in contact with people travelled to red-listed countries, have been recommended home quarantine by health department.

“One of the major reasons that the officials aren’t being able to trace them is wrong address and phone number mentioned in the passport. Yet, our teams are active and searching for them. They will be traced soon via phone numbers. If they are outside Punjab , we will share the information with the other state authorities so that they can follow up,” added CP Agrawal.

Chief medical officer Dr Rajesh Bagga said the people are not coming forward in telling the travel history due to social stigma. However, neighbours of the travellers keep a track and help and share information.

“Travellers are hiding their travel history. Thus we have launched a new helpline number where neighbours or the family can report to the health department about them,” added Dr Bagga.

LUDHIANA: Amid the coronavirus gloom, some Ludhianvis are scripting heart-warming tales that will make you smile and hope.

From shrines, groups to individuals, many have come together and ramped up their efforts to help those in need.

Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib, Field Ganj, is organising community kitchen every day. The gurdwara management president, Pritpal Singh Pali, said, “The langar service was not discontinued even once despite the lockdown. It continues, albeit with a difference: the devotees are seated at a distance. Following the lockdown, we are receiving more people than before and they are served langar thrice a day. Besides, many people are taking food from here for distribution among the needy.”

Gurdwara Manji Sahib, Alamgir, too, has joined the altruist efforts. Apart from giving food packets to almost 10,000 people every day, the gurdwara team is also helping the administration serve the slum dwellers. The gurdwara manager, Resham Singh, said, “Our team tours Ludhiana and hands over food packets to the needy wherever they find them. There are many who need help at this time. Our endeavour is to reach out to them.”

The Muslim community, too, is helping the poor. They have distributed groceries to more than 200 families. “And now, we are making more packets of grocery to distribute among the needy. I appeal to the business community to donate for public help,” said Shahi Imam Maulana Habib Ur Rehman Sani .

Stories of communal harmony, too, are lighting up many lives.

“While we are distributing essential items to the underprivileged, Gurdwara Dukhniwaran Sahib is serving food to those living in Jama Masjid,” he added.

Sanglan Wala Shivala temple on Sunday gave wheat flour, rice and other essential things to more than 200 families. Neeraj Verma from the temple management said, “With the Central and the state governments working hard to stem coronavirus, the religious organizations, too, should come forward to perform their duties. If we will not help the needy at this time of crisis, then people will lose faith in God and not visit shrines.”

Gurdwara Bhaini Sahib has also upped its efforts to help humanity. Its volunteers are visting slums and other places to give food to more than 15,000 people every day.

Namdhari Sangat Sasrali Colony, too, has chipped in by providing food to at least 7,000 people daily.

468,['30/03/2020'],Non-essential factories in state get green signal to resume work,"LUDHIANA: At a time when other northern states are feeling helpless and unable to find a solution to the problem of mass exodus of migrant workers back to their homes, the Punjab government on Sunday took a major decision and gave a go-ahead to factories producing non-essential goods to resume operations, subject to fulfilment of several conditions. Some of the conditions include free lodging, food, and medical facilities to workers by factory owners, and ensuring all measures, including social distancing, are followed by workers.

The decision comes in the wake of a hue and cry raised by several business associations, which had warned the government that if workers leave the state, they will never be able to re-open their factories, as almost 90% of the labour they employed is from other states, mainly Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and West Bengal .

State industries minister Sundar Sham Arora said, “The problem of exodus of migrant labourers from Punjab is getting serious, and the movement of workers in such huge numbers is not just a cause of concern for Punjab’s industry alone, but also dangerous for workers.”

He added, “In the wake of the outbreak of Covid-19, workers are putting their lives at risk by moving out of developed cities like Ludhiana, and setting on a journey to their home states, that too on foot. So, in an effort to put an end to this humanitarian crisis, we have decided that factories in Punjab will be allowed to operate, subject to certain conditions, including providing in-house free lodging, and free medical check-up to their workers. Factories interested in operating must comply with all the parameters set up by the health department with regard to Covid-19, like social distancing, use of masks, and hospitalisation of persons showing symptoms of the virus.”

Arora further added, “Since lakhs of workers are employed in brick kilns spread in different districts of Punjab, we are also permitting brick kilns to resume partial operations, subject to fulfilment of all conditions, as laid down in the case of factories. However, I want to make it clear that kilns will not be allowed to do the firing process, but they can get workers to do other processes, like forming, cutting, and drying.”

Meanwhile, industrialists seem to be divided over the decision of the government, as some of them welcome it, while others are of the view that the conditions laid down by the government for permission to begin operations cannot be fulfilled by a majority of industries. Besides, there are other reasons too because of which this permission would be of no use.

According to CII Punjab chairman Rahul Ahuja, who played a crucial role in convincing the government to take this decision, “Thousands of migrant workers in Ludhiana alone have embarked on a journey by foot to their homes in Bihar, UP, and other states. The situation has taken place due to fear and confusion prevailing among them due to the lockdown. Some of them are leaving because they feel they will be safer if they return to their villages, while others are of the view that they will not be able to get any work now.”

He added, “We met the general manager of the District Industries Centre (DIC), through whom we got our proposal sent to the state government, and we are happy it has been accepted and implemented promptly. The factories which fulfil the requirements can obtain permission from the DIC’s office, and start their factories right away.”

Opposing the decision, Charanjit Singh Vishivkarma , former president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), said, “This is not the proper time to open factories, as this decision should have been made in consultation with all industry associations, after discussing all the pros and cons. It should not be made by any individual, and this is not the right environment to run a factory.”

He added, “Even if we decide to start units, from where will we get our raw material? We do not even have any orders, nor do we have any means to supply the products to our dealers. Moreover, the markets where our products are sold are closed, then what is the purpose of running the factories and producing goods, even if we are able to.”

Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) state officer in Punjab, Kimti Lal Bhagat , has urged the Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to ensure that these animals do not die for want of fodder and essential medicines. He told TOI that since the curfew has been imposed in the state, various volunteers who used to donate fodder and medicines in these cattle pounds are also helpless in coming to the rescue of these speechless animals.

Bhagat has requested the chief minister to issue directions to all the deputy commissioners to provide the required fodder and medicines in all cattle pounds as well as cow shelters under their respective jurisdiction. Bhagat, former chairperson of Punjab Gau Sewa Commission , has apprised the chief minister that after imposition of curfew, these animals run the risk of starvation deaths as many cattle pounds facing shortage of fodder.

He added that as per the reports gathered from various cattle pounds across the state, he had come to know that there are a number of deaths of cattle in government cattle pound in Lalru.

LUDHIANA: Looks like the fear of coronavirus is finally being distilled pure into the hearts of city’s residents. They are beginning to take the lockdown announced by the Prime Minister seriously. In many areas of the city, people have locked down their localities to prevent outsiders from entering the streets even.

In many areas people have either closed their gates or they have closed down the entrance to the colony. Huge banners tell people to stay away and not spread coronavirus. Some people are afraid to the extent that they have pasted papers outside their houses with a message that nobody should visit their house till the curfew is on.

A resident of Durgapuri in Haibowal, Shakti Sharma, said, “We have closed down all four gates to the locality so that no outsider can enter. It is advisable to stay inside. The government is trying to prevent the spread of this disease and it is our duty as citizens to help the government in this task by staying inside.” He said when curfew was imposed in the beginning, many two-wheeler riders were moving about in the locality, but since March 24 they closed the gate permanently so that nobody can come inside.

Another resident from Sector 32, Harish Kumar , said, “My son had put up a poster outside our house for the people and friends that due to coronavirus nobody should visit our house. Now, some of my relatives also implemented the same outside their houses.” He said it foolhardiness to go outside, even if to check if police was there or if anybody else was moving about in roads. He claimed that at the moment every person should think about his or her family nothing else. “Only that person, who will stay at home no matter, will win this game,” he added.

Meanwhile, residents in Lohara Colony , Giaspura, have closed the entry of their street for the outsiders. One of the residents, Jeet Singh, claimed that when they all are staying at home there is no reason why they should allow others to come. He said they have closed the entrance for outsiders because they do not know who is a carrier of this disease.He also said there is nothing wrong in being extra cautious.

Another resident from Kailash Nagar, Sanjay Kumar , said, “If we will not control this disease here then our situation will also be like Italy and other affected countries. Foreign countries have better health facilities even then they are unable to control this disease. If this disease spreads in our country, it will be a disaster as we do not have enough health facilities.” He said in his colony, all residents decided to keep the doors closed even for relatives.

The TOI came across several groups of labourers walking home on GT Road and along railway lines. The workers were mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and employed at Ludhiana factories. They said they were leaving the city as they were now without work.

Some of the workers were of the view that they were worried for their families back home, who too were now under lockdown. They said as there was no alternative to reach their villages, they were forced to take the journey on foot.

According to another group of workers who left the city on bicycles on Saturday night, they would be able to reach their villages in Uttar Pradesh in about three days.

Rakesh Kumar of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, who worked in a hosiery unit, said he along with his wife and two children had to leave for his state because of no work due to closure of the factory where he worked. He said though they would suffer, they had no option than to cover such a long distance on foot, as they would at least get something to eat there.

Another daily-wager from Bareilly in UP said he has expended all his resources and with the remaining money he could at least reach his village and spend time with his dear ones. He added that without work it was very hard to survive in the city.

With the administration issuing orders for conditional restart of the units, some migrant workers said they might cancel their plans to return home. “We are ready to follow all the norms if factories are allowed to work in a way that the disease does not spread. The government should set up a monitoring system to ensure that norms are followed by all units,” said a migrant worker, Suresh Paswan .

LUDHIANA: The police on Sunday arrested a man for killing his wife in Gahi Bhaini village of Koomkalan . According to police, the man suspected his wife of having illicit relations with someone. It is alleged the man was in an inebriated condition when he killed his wife with the wooden leg of a cot.

The accused has been identified as Sukhbir Singh (25), a labourer, who had married Kamaljit Kaur (22) three years ago. The couple has a one-year old son from this marriage.

Kamaljit’s brother Beant Singh of Bhagpur village of Machhiwara said Sukhbir was a habitual drinker who used to thrash Kamaljit Kaur in an inebriated condition. The family had intervened several times when they fought, and also warned him, but to no avail.

He added that on Sunday, Kamaljit telephoned him and complained that Sukhbir was thrashing her. After receiving the call, he — along with his mother Balwinder Kaur — rushed to her house.

“When we reached there, the neighbours and villagers were already gathered there. Sukhbir’s brother Jagtar Singh said his brother had murdered Kamaljit, and when he tried to intervene, Sukhbir thrashed him too,” added Beant.

Thereafter, Beant called the police. Sub-inspector Paramjit Singh, SHO at Koomkalan police station, said, “The accused used to suspect his wife of infidelity. On Sunday morning, he indulged in a spat with her and murdered her with the wooden leg of a cot.”

The police have arrested him when he was trying to escape.

SHIMLA: With people within the state and those stranded outside desperate to reach their homes, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has requested such people to remain stationed wherever they are as the state government was not allowing any intra-state and inter-state movement in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

He said the movement of people within the state from one district to another and also from outside the state must be checked at any cost. He said those persons who had already entered the state must be kept in quarantine centres established in the border areas, so that they do not mix with other people.

Thakur said this while interacting with DCs through video conferencing from Shimla on Sunday to take stock of the situation in wake of curfew in the state.

He said adequate arrangements must be made for proper food and shelter to the stranded people. He added the district administration must ensure that there was no inconvenience to the people and sufficient essential commodities were made available to them.

He asked the DCs to motivate such people to remain stationed wherever they were and ensure proper arrangement for their food and shelter. The CM said they should also be motivated and assured that the government was committed to taking their care and they need not to worry. He said there was no dearth of funds for providing adequate relief to those stranded.

Thakur said in order to facilitate the people of the state stranded in Delhi or Chandigarh, control rooms had been established in Himachal Bhavans in New Delhi and Chandigarh. He said as far as possible, efforts would be made to provide food and shelter to them in these bhavans.

Chief secretary Anil Kumar Khachi asked the DCs to discourage exodus from one district to another and also from other states. He said labourers and other workers from the other states must be discouraged to travel outside the state and should be kept in the camps.

DGP S R Mardi said no vehicle carrying people from other states would be allowed to enter Himachal Pradesh and strict action would be taken against the violator.

Stray dogs and other animals are dying because of hunger and lack of medicine. We had sought permission to give food to the stray animals twice a day. But we have been given a go-ahead of once a week for two hours (from 6pm to 8pm). And only four of the 200 members of the society have been given the passes. It’s of little help.”

Now, the society has decided that teams of two-member each will help stray animals in their respective areas. “This will enable us serve the animals while following the curfew restrictions. Residents who want to donate food for these animals can contact at these numbers: 9814714698, 7888754036, 98788838788 and 843777008,” he added.

The Animal Welfare Board of India had instructed the authorities to take care of the stray animals but it seems they are not worried about them, he said.

The chief secretary said a nodal officer should be appointed to track the number of migrant labourers staying in shelter or relief homes. She informed officers that according to the directions issued by National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), stay and food arrangements of labourers under the authority would be made by them. Thereafter, all district administration officers will coordinate with the NHAI to provide stay and food arrangements for such labourers.
