Tell us about your love for visual effects ( VFX )?

What’s your trick to wade through negative thoughts?

Do trolls affect you?

Things you value most in life…

Who are your favourite stars in Sandalwood?

Your Bengaluru connect…

A look at actor-producer Rana Daggubati ’s journey is bound to be inspiring. Especially for the many students who are grappling with exams this season. During his chat with us, Rana tells us how he overcame academic setbacks to find his true calling. Excerpts:I had failed Class 10, and it obviously felt like a huge set back at that time. Sadly, that’s how we are conditioned to think — if we don’t do well in our studies, it’s the end of life. But amid the failure and all the confusion it led to, I sat back and tried to understand what I really wanted to do in life. And I realised that I wanted to pursue a career in the performing arts, particularly in movies. Of course, there was a lot of uncertainty during the initial phase, but now when I look back, I feel that I did the right thing.I am fascinated with movies like Star Wars. It was my dream to bring VFX to Indian cinema. Even though I was not good at studies, I loved computers and technology. In fact, my career began at a VFX company. Cut to films , I always felt that epic tales can be portrayed in a spectacular way via visual effects. More than technology, VFX is an art form that I find very intriguing.Like everyone else, I, too, had my share of ups and downs in life — be it in terms of my emotions or my health. But, overall, I think I have been fairly solid as an individual. My personal goals have kept me motivated throughout. I wanted to make really cool films, and that aim is bigger than my personal struggles. There were times when I was depressed and had negative thoughts, but I managed to overcome that by constantly focusing on my dreams.Trolls don’t affect me at all. I don’t care about what they say.Relationships. I feel that people should make an effort to ensure that they are consistently in conversation with people they value.I am a huge fan of the late Dr Rajkumar. Currently, I am working on Hiranyakashyap and for reference, I keep going back to his 1983 film Bhakta Prahlad. I have also known his son, Puneeth Rajkumar for a long time, and enjoy watching his films. Among independent films, I really liked Lucia.

1,['10/02/2020'],The Thayir Sadam Project’s new track is about the lack of peace in the pursuit of excellence,"The next track from The Thayir Sadam Project — comprising Bindu and Ambi Subramaniam Mahesh Raghvan and Akshay Anantapadmanabhan — will see the band collaborate with a 16-year-old pianist. The track, titled Never Sleep, sees the band perform with Vishwajeet Avinashilingam , who won a music competition recently. Ambi says, “It is always exciting for us to work with young musicians, because they have a different take and a fresh perspective when it comes to music. Vishwajeet is a pianist and has been influenced by jazz music. So, we wanted to do something different that suits Vishwajeet and our style. While Never Sleep is in The Thayir Sadam Project signature style, it has a lot of jazz influence.”The track, he adds, is different from what the band has attempted so far. The song has two distinct sections — a virtuosic segment, which is instrumental and a melancholic, intense segment, which has been sung by Bindu. “It’s an intense take on what children go through to excel in any field. The lyrics are about excellence and no peace of mind. It’s an interesting take on the issues that youngsters go through. This is something very different from what we usually perform, so it’s a first for us as well,” says Ambi.Vishwajeet, who is also working on his own compositions, says that working with The Thayir Sadam Project has been fruitful and has given him an insight on how the music industry works. “This is the first time I have collaborated with professionals and it felt phenomenal. The band’s take on music and how we introduced two different genres to create a new sound was a great experience,” he says.“The track is about issues that youngsters go through and I could relate to it on a personal level. Not just the lyrics, but the emotions and the vibe that the track eludes... I could understand what we were trying to convey. I’m also at a stage where I’m trying to strike a balance between my studies and my music,” he says, adding, “When youngsters listen to Never Sleep, they will be able to relate to the message that we are trying to convey through music.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74044177,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-160178/74044177.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/english/music/the-thayir-sadam-projects-new-track-is-about-the-lack-of-peace-in-the-pursuit-of-excellence/articleshow/74044142.cms
2,['10/02/2020'],"As a woman, I’m proud that even at 40, I have a career: Isha Koppikar","With a project as huge as these, there is always hope that it would see the light of the day. There is AR Rahman’s music, Sivakarthikeyan sir, and the production house is well-known… so, actually, the chance of this project not materialising was grim. I wouldn’t say I was disappointed (over the delay), but I believe in God’s timing, and know that whatever happens, happens for a reason. And it has happened at the right time now. 2020 is looking to be a great year for me.I really regret that. Being from Bombay, it is really difficult to come and settle here. I couldn’t do that. Also, I started getting offers in Hindi.Not at all. I was absolutely convinced. It’s a femme fatale role, something that I’ve always been waiting for. It is full of action, and I love the Lara Croft kind of roles. I think I have that kind of a strong image and this role falls completely in my scheme of things. I always believe that there cannot be an effective protagonist without a strong antagonist. In this, Sivakarthikeyan sir is the protagonist and I am the antagonist. For me, it is a fantastic opportunity, especially an actress gets to play such a role opposite such a huge star.The response from fans and the industry people has been overwhelming. I received a lot of love even then, and that continues even now. Tamil Nadu has been very warm in welcoming me. I felt like I was back to my En Swaasa Kaatre and Kadhal Kavithai days when everybody around me would be talking in Tamil. I was just telling this to my director that while I’m very fast at learning languages, by the time I start picking up Tamil, it is time to go back home, to Bombay. And once I’m there, I have no one speaking to me in Tamil there. And the best way to pick up a language is by speaking it more than just hearing it, and who do I speak to in Tamil there? I’ve made it clear to everybody on this film’s set to speak to me in Tamil so that it’s easier for me. That said, this role doesn’t have a lot of dialogues. Eliza, my character, is an assassin, more like a machine. She doesn’t speak much, and her actions will speak louder than her words. That’s what Eliza is all about.I’ve been training in martial arts for 18 years. I first learnt Taekwondo and then Hapkido (a Korean martial art). When you are a martial artiste, you automatically exude that kind of confidence. You appear a certain way that normal people do not. I carry a do-not-mess-with-me demeanour, which comes from my 18 years of training. I think I’m a fighter, mentally. Nothing comes easy in life. I don’t come from a filmi background. My parents are doctors. Martial art, to me, is a physical way of training your mind. By practising it, you learn to deal with life — the disappointments, the struggles and the challenges. This automatically reflects in your demeanour. That’s why I think I’ve been getting about half-a-dozen cop roles in the last few years. And this role is strong in its own way. It is that of an assassin, completely negative and full of action.Martial arts is not just about fighting, it also trains your system. It makes you stronger. Things like running, jumping over something, being on a harness… normally, women refrain from doing these things. But they are no big deal for a martial artiste.Nooooo. We have a proper alien character.No. I am not here to make a career out of politics. I’m in it to do something that I genuinely want to do. Right now, there is no other agenda, like contesting in elections. It’s now more about helping people, women especially. This is one sphere where I feel our government is lacking.It’s not easy, but maybe we need to create small session trial courts, appoint good lawyers and have trials on a day-to-day basis when it comes to crimes on women. The punishments have to be with immediate effect. We need to get our law and order in place and ensure cases don’t drag on and on. It’s like people aren’t scared of anything these days. We are talking about a country whose holy scriptures talk about women as incarnations of Gods, and today, women are battling for their security. When we are talking about development in many spheres, I think this is the most important. Women should feel safe and secure. Otherwise, it positions the country in a very regressive way. Every woman should be educated. And every man should be taught to respect women. Unfortunately, from day one, the men are taught that women are somehow inferior, that they are meant to be indoors, that if a woman dresses in any other way, it is provocative. And the list goes on and on. We live in a country where such attitudes have been prevalent for centuries, so those have to change. And that might not happen overnight. In interior India, a girl is married off when she is 14 or 15. She is looked at as someone who is there only for procreation. But that’s not it, and we all know that. We have to teach that men and women are equal. That’s the first thing that has to happen. Even when we hurt ourselves, the first thing we say is ‘Amma’. Appa’s contributions are very important, but our instinct is to say Amma. And who is Amma? A woman, right? As a woman, I’m proud that even at 40, I have a career. I have a daughter, I’m taking care of my house, I run a catering unit, I’m into politics.It’s all about time management. It’s all about how much time you can give to each of these roles, and what is important at that particular moment. It’s open day at my daughter, Rianna’s school today, but I’m here, in Chennai. I am shooting for a film and I cannot ask them to stop the shoot for a day just for my personal reason. It is not right. So, I told my daughter’s teacher that I’d meet her when I’m finished with my schedule. You have to address the issue depending on its importance. If I had had a business meeting in Bombay that could have been pushed, I’d have attended to Rianna. It’s all about prioritising, and I think it’s possible.I’d say I’m both. I don’t believe in giving in easily. I’d say ‘no’ 75 per cent of the times. A child needs to understand that nothing comes easy. If you keep saying ‘yes’ to every demand of the child, by the time they grow up, it will not be easy for them to fight when facing odds.There is one more schedule in March, and the shoot will be done. But there are so many months of post-production work to be done that it would be like making another film.The team is fab. My director is very calm. I’ve never seen him get agitated or angry or shout. He is so paavam. He is like a detox therapy. Sivakarthikeyan sir is also very calm, very sweet and friendly. He knows that I love food; I’m very particular about my food, so he told me about a few places where I could get salads and stuff like that.I don’t know how to get in touch with him. I’d love to meet him. He’s a superstar now. I know!Not really. I respect and love the people I work with more for who they are in real life than for their professional side. What you are as a person is what matters to me.I met Arvind sir the last time I was here. In fact, it was on the same day I was interviewed by Chennai Times last year. I met him in the same dress I was wearing for the photoshoot. I had called him a couple of months ago as well, but because of our schedules, we couldn’t meet then. He had told me then, ‘The next time you are here, you better tell me in advance.’ I met him and his family for tea.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74045233,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-485219/74045233.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/as-a-woman-im-proud-that-even-at-40-i-have-a-career-isha-koppikar/articleshow/74045233.cms

12,['10/02/2020'],I-League: Chennai stun Churchill Brothers 2-1,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Margao: Churchill Brothers FC suffered another reverse at home as Chennai City FC secured a 2-1 win in a I-League clash at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Sunday.

Churchill controlled most of the proceedings but had themselves to blame in a dramatic game where all the action unfolded in the final 10 minutes.

With just five minutes left to be played, the teams were locked goalless and the organisers didn’t have any hesitation in announcing Churchill’s Glan Martins as the Man-of-the-Match. However, at the same moment it seemed Churchill’s world would come crashing down when Japanese Katsumi Yusa broke the deadlock for the visitors with a clinical finish. Substitute Lalkhawpuimawia, however, put Churchill back into the game as he equalised within two minutes.

The two-time former champions should have been content with a point but instead lacked concentration in added time which proved costly. Switzerland striker Jan Muzangu made the most of the situation and moved swiftly inside the box to score the match-winner with only a minute left to be played.

The 19-year-old who joined Chennai from FC Basel’s U-21 side scored his first goal in the league after four appearances and it could prove to be an important one in the resurgence of Akbar Nawas’ side.

It was Churchill’s fourth defeat in nine matches and they have now lost three of their six games at home. They have dropped to seventh in the standings with 13 points. Chennai’s second consecutive win helped them climb to the fifth spot with 14 points from 10 games.

The looked on to carry on the momentum after winning their previous matches. Captain Abu Bakr was back from suspension and gave stability at the back for the home side. Coach Bernardo Tavares made just one change to the team which defeated Neroca FC 4-1 at home.

Churchill had the edge right from the start and created several opportunities but none that troubled Chennai’s Spanish custodian Nauzet Gracia.

Dawda Ceesay whipped in a dangerous cross early on but it missed most of his teammates including Ponif Vaz, who was in an ideal position.

Glan Martins and Quan Gomes made desperate attempts to feed Ceesay and last season’s join top-scorer Willis Plaza , but the striker was heavily marked.

Before the half an hour mark, Socrates Pedro moved dangerously on the left and played a delightful one-two with Glan. The Portuguese winger found space inside the box, but his grounder missed the target narrowly.

Chennai were content with their defensive approach and showed very little intent to test rival goalkeeper James Kithan. They came closest before the break when they won a freekick at the edge of the box after Jovel Martins brought down Jockson Dhas. However, Adolfo Miranda’s left-footer hit the side-netting.

Churchill started brightly in the second session but were unlucky. Quan worked a set piece as Bakr headed towards Plaza but the Trinidad and Tobago forward saw his header hit the horizontal.

Chennai mostly attacked on the counter and in the 85th minute, Adolfo found Katsumi through for the opener. Churchill responded two minutes later when Lalkhawpuimawia headed in a cross from Poniz Vaz.

However, it was Muzangu who stole the limelight in added time as he dribbled past two rival defender and beat Kithan for the match winner.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/i-league-chennai-stun-churchill-brothers-2-1/articleshow/74051305.cms

I did a few episodics, music videos and commercials but didn't do a proper daily. The year 2019 started on a great note as I got the confirmation for my film 'Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan'. The months of September, October and November was blocked for the film and a few months back only I got this call for 'Yeh Rishta...' It was a perfect three months cameo which was fitting in best with my schedule. I met Rajan (Shahi, the maker of the show) and my character sketch in the serial was really beautiful. Though my character in the show turned a bit grey later, initially it was planned to be really positive. The best part is that because of the popularity of the track, it was extended from three months to eight months.My track in the serial was really liked by the viewers and so it was extended, to which I was initially sceptical. I didn't intend to play a negative character as before this I had never played one. For the last 15 episodes, I was made to sit with the creatives who explained to me why they were turning my character negative. For me, I was not initially convinced as this is not something which I was told. But then the makers tried to convince me, although I wasn't. I had a choice to quit the show but then I didn't want to leave the show mid-way that too on a sour note. Then they gave an emotional angle to my negative shade and thankfully didn't make me a Komolika in the serial.Pankhuri Awasthy in Lucknow (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad Siddiqui)Towards the end of my character, I actually liked the grey shade in my character. My comeback depends on what the makers want to do with the show and my availability at that point of time.

How did that happen for you?I had auditioned for the movie long time back but then at that time I didn't know the complete concept of it. I was in Kerala when I got a call confirming my character. Even though it is my Bollywood debut, I didn't mind playing just a character in it. I am there in the film throughout. But if you talk about meaty scenes and dialogues, they are not that much. I know an Ayushmann Khurrana film is an ‘Ayushmann’ film but then it is also about the ensemble cast. In an Ayushmann film even the character with the smallest screen space leaves an impact. Take for the example of Bala, you will have recall value for all the characters. But if an actor does a typical hero-heroine film, the ensemble cast might not have that much of role, but in his movies it is guaranteed.Motherhood is going to happen eventually, but not in immediately in the near future. Initially we had planned for parenthood after two years of our marriage, which we will be completing soon. But career wise I have just started and I am very career oriented. Having said that, I always think there is a specific time for one to start the family. You can't expect to be 70 and your kids in their teens. You can't enjoy that then. I want to be there for my kids and understand them and not be too stubborn. And the older we get, the more difficult it is for us to change.

Representative image

PATIALA: A 52-two-year-old man on Sunday allegedly committed suicide in Patiala by consuming some poisonous substance two days after he appeared in the police station to join the investigation in a case related to dowry and breach of trust.

The deceased has been identified as Jagdish Singh . The police have booked Jagdish's distant relative Lalit Kumar, 38, of Dhamoli village, an employee in private industry, under sections of abetment to suicide at Banur police station.

Deceased's family alleged that Lalit Kumar somehow developed an extramarital affair with Jagdish’s 21-year-old unmarried daughter. They added that around six months ago Lalit’s wife came to know about the illicit relations and got annoyed and then she managed to get registered a case of dowry against her husband Lalit, his family members and Lalit’s relatives including Jagdish and his 21-year-old daughter.

“Only two days before committing suicide Jagdish has appeared before the court and also visited the police station as he joined the investigation in a case registered against him under sections of dowry. He was a distant relative of the complainant and it seems that he was wrongly implicated in this case by my predecessors but we are investigating into the matter thoroughly,” Banur police station SHO Subash Kumar said.

“Lalit’s wife earlier also landed in a mutual compromise in dowry case after both Lalit and Jagdish’s daughter had assured her not to continue their illicit relations. However, both of them allegedly continued their affair and this remained the bone of contention between the Lalit’s wife and Jagdish and his family. Jagdish appeared before the court in this case and I had assured him to get him justice. He has written this in his suicide note too. We are verifying all the facts and will also probe that how a case of dowry was registered against him despite the fact that his involvement does not seems to be”, said Subash Kumar.

Deceased’s relative Amarjit Singh , who lodged the complaint, said, “I was stunned how the police had falsely implicated Jagdish and his daughter in a dowry case. He was already facing economic distress. Jagdish was twice married and both his wives died in the past.”

CHANDIGARH: Amid protests by Haryana Roadways staff , Jhajjar GM flagged off five buses under the per kilometre scheme on Sunday morning.

Much to the surprise of many, soon after bus started the ignition, an employee of Haryana roadways laid down before the buses. Later more employees joined him and raised the anti-roadways and the anti-government slogans.

All this went on for an hour before police removed the agitating employees and allowed the buses to go out of the bus stand.

Notably, after hiccups and controversies, the Haryana transport department has agreed to run buses under the per kilometre scheme. With these five buses, total of 90 buses out of the 510 have come out on the roads.

Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has already ruled out the withdrawal of scheme, especially under the protests by Roadways employees.

Roadways employees are demanding withdrawal of buses as this has hit the state exchequer.

Notably, in a bid to bail out the contractors who have bought the buses two year ago, the government had decided to put the buses on road in case they agree to the terms and conditions of government.

21,['10/02/2020'],Delhi assembly elections: How eroding share of Congress may further boost AAP,"File photo

NEW DELHI: A further decline in the prospects of Congress in Delhi, though not unexpected, seems to be powering AAP ’s success, as has been predicted by various exit polls. Most polls forecast zero seats for Congress though one has given it four, with a vote share of 8.8%.In 2015, Congress had a vote share of 9.8%. Psephologists don’t seem to believe that the party can match even that figure this time round. Unlike BJP, which mounted an aggressive campaign, the grand old party was largely missing in action. AAP claimed that a major chunk of late voting had gone in its favour even though BJP maintained that the reality was quite the opposite.Congress’ loss is being seen as AAP’s gain, as any vote-split would have helped BJP make deeper inroads.Sources said among a few constituencies where Congress ran a strong campaign were Kasturba Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Seelampur, Mustafabad, Badli, Sultanpur Majra, Chandni Chowk, Hari Nagar, Dwarka, Kalkaji, Sangam Vihar and Kondli. However, with party bigwigs conspicuous by their absence for most of the campaigning, it was left for the candidates to fend for themselves. To their credit, many of them conducted door-to-door meetings and made extensive use of social media, besides holding small public meetings on their own, the sources added.But for most parts, the campaign failed to generate a lot of excitement. While BJP and AAP ran high-octane campaigns, Congress adopted a laid-back approach, with not many senior party functionaries hitting the ground in support of its candidates. In the last week of electioneering, several star campaigners, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and ex-PM Manomohan Singh and chief ministers of Chhattisgarh and Punjab CM, did address public meetings, but it all appeared to be too little too late.“Congress doesn’t appear to be very strong this time. When it was in office in Delhi, the party carried out a lot of development work,” said Hiten Sharma, a voter at Chanakyapuri. The party, too, chose to harp back on its past record, often invoking the tenure of three-time CM, the late Sheila Dikshit.While some candidates blamed the delay in distribution of tickets for the lackadaisical approach, others claimed that there was a lack of coordination from the central office. A candidate, requesting anonymity, said that the party had failed to back the contestants on the ground. While the more resourceful candidates could still power their campaigns, the newcomers fought lone battles.In contrast, sources in AAP said, the party had managed to project itself as an alternative to people who previously voted for Congress. “A large chunk of Congress voters shifted to AAP across various assembly segments. It will significantly increase our vote share and lead to the party breaking its own record of 2015,” claimed an AAP functionary. In 2015, AAP had won 67 of the 70 assembly seats.Even though Congress failed to match the electioneering blitzkrieg of AAP and BJP, the chief of the party’s Delhi unit, Subhash Chopra, claimed they would surprise everyone with their performance when the results finally came out.

Chinese ambassador Sun Weidong had briefed foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla on Friday about Chinese efforts to deal with the crisis.Sun had sought a meeting with Shringla immediately after the latter took over as foreign secretary last month. “Received condolence letter from Indian PM Narendra Modi to Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding nCoV outbreak in China.

24,['10/02/2020'],"Madhya Pradesh: In MP, 4.5 lakh Swachh toilets disappear in Rs 540cr scam","This story is from February 10, 2020

Representative image

BHOPAL: Call it the vanishing-toilet scam. More than 4.5 lakh Swachh loos have been flushed into oblivion in Madhya Pradesh , along with the Rs 540 crore it took to build them.

The toilets may never be found — though the administration has GPS-tagged photographs of each of them — but the government aims to recover every paisa spent on them. It’s a reminder of the toilet door scam unearthed in Guna district in 2017, where the iron doors of 42,000 toilets were built 10kg lighter, leading to siphoning of crores.

The ‘vanishing’ toilets were supposed to have been built — at least on paper — between 2012 and October 2018. But they don’t exist. Officials believe that the photographs submitted as proof of Swachh toilet construction were actually clicked elsewhere, perhaps at neighbours’ homes as proof of money spent.

Some villagers blew the whistle in Betul’s tribal Lakkadjam panchayat and complained to officials. A probe quickly found that four Swachh beneficiaries — Chaitram, Ram Kishore, Kansraj and Shambhudayal — were not even aware that toilets have been built in their name. On government records, not only do their homes have toilets but the government portal has pictures of them before loos as well. Officials found that all four were photographed in front of a neighbour’s toilet.

“A detailed probe was conducted in Lakkadjam panchayat, and the complaints were found to be true. For these toilets and other similar anomalies, a recovery of Rs 7 lakh was imposed on the accused. They appealed against the recovery order, but the penalty was upheld. Once recovery is done, we will initiate action under IPC . I have ordered investigation of all the other work done in the panchayat,” chief executive officer (CEO) of Betul panchayat ML Tyagi told TOI.

It set alarm bells ringing and the panchayat and rural development department has since identified 4.5 lakh such missing ‘paper toilets’ across the state. In monetary terms, toilets worth Rs 540 crores are missing, said an official.

“In 2012, a baseline survey was conducted and 62 lakh above-poverty-line households without toilets were identified in the state. On October 2, 2018, construction of all these toilets was complete. But to ensure that these toilets are actually present and 100% complete, we conducted a survey and physical verification using 21,000 volunteers. During this survey, around 4.5 lakh toilets were found to be missing,” deputy director of Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural) Madhya Pradesh, Ajit Tiwari, told TOI.

A second physical verification is under way. “It is being conducted by district-level officers. We hope it will be complete in a couple of months. Then, we will have a cleaner picture of the numbers of Swachh mission toilets. Our objective is to ensure that the toilets or assets built by the government are actually present,” said Tiwari. The data will be put in public domain so that the beneficiaries can check for any anomaly, he added.

“There were two processes of making payments. Panchayats were provided money upon completion of toilets in households, or the government transferred Rs 12,000 to beneficiaries’ accounts once they built the toilets. In both cases, it is clear where the money went. So, people responsible for the missing toilets will have to build them for real, or the face music. The sole objective is to ensure 100% completion of the target identified in 2012,” Tiwari said.

Asked how the scamsters beat technology since Swachh toilet photographs are geo-mapped, Tiwari said: “The GPS is accurate up to 6 metres. Most probably, pictures of toilets within 6 metres were uploaded in the name of the beneficiaries or pictures of toilets built prior to 2012 were uploaded. Things will be clear once the second survey is complete.”

MOHALI: A day after a triple-storey building with a basement collapsed in Sante Majra village on Kharar-Landran road here on Saturday, the preliminary investigation found that the basement of the adjoining plot was dug up beyond the sanctioned depth. As a result, it exposed the foundation of the adjacent three-storeyed building, leading to its collapse.

The builder also did not inform the Kharar municipal council before digging up the basement. Secondly, the owner of the building that collapsed failed to produce requisite structure stability report for erecting two mobile towers atop his property. “These matters will be investigated once the debris is removed,” said deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan.

He said as per preliminary inquiry, while the building plan was sanctioned by Kharar municipal council, the builder did not intimate the MC about starting the basement digging work, which is mandatory. He said it was alleged by the builder that the contractor started digging without his consent and dug more than the sanctioned depth, which could have resulted in the collapse of the adjacent building.

Dayalan said, “A thorough report will be prepared by an additional district magistrate-level officer and all parameters, including structure stability report, permissible limit for digging of basement and foundation strength of the building, will be considered. The report will be submitted to the chief minister. But one thing is clear that the earth was removed beyond permissible limit, which exposed the foundation of the three-storey building.”

He said out of the two mobile towers, permission for one was granted in 2016. Officials of Kharar MC said they were checking their records for permission to the second.

PATNA: Purnia district is set to celebrate its 250th anniversary in the coming week. A host of events will be organised on February 14 and 15 to mark the occasion.

The district administration has appealed to all residents to decorate their houses and business establishments with lights and rangolis and also participate enthusiastically in the events to be held on the occasion of anniversary celebration. The best three decorated premises would be awarded by the district administration.

Purnia DM Rahul Kumar on Sunday said that a special memorial march, ‘Smriti Yatra’, would be taken out in the district headquarters as a token of tribute to the first civil surgeon Dr Pikachi, who revolutionised the healthcare system in 1770, by undertaking horse rides to remote areas for treatment of ailing people. An exhibition of his services will be also organised near the old dilapidated house of Dr Pikachi.

The district administration has sought public opinion through the social media as to what more events could be organised to add value to this celebration. With the appointment of George Ducrail as its first supervisor collector, Purnia got the status of a district on February 14, 1770, said the DM.

A festival named as ‘Purainia Mahotsav’ being organised during the anniversary function will have a flower show competition for encouraging people to grow flower plants in and around their houses. “Gardening helps to maintain the ecosystem,” said Rahul.

Other events slated for the occasion include free screening of two films— Dangal and Panchlat—hockey and football competitions, cultural functions and panel discussion by experts on various topics.

Abhiyan Kitab Daan, another initiative launched on January 25, as a part of the anniversary celebration to build up libraries in 2,255 government schools with enrolment of six lakh students, has also evoked good response and over 2000 books donated by locals reached the officials till Saturday.

“We want to make it a historic event and the ‘Donate Books’ initiative aimed at collecting at least one lakh books by March end for developing libraries in all schools, will boost school education in the district,” the DM said.

PATNA: Former Kerala cadre IAS officer Kannan Gopinath, who is campaigning against implementation of National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the country, on Sunday urged CM Nitish Kumar to withdraw the notification regarding implementation of NPR in the state, as NPR and NRC are inter-related and their implementation would result in deprivation of citizenship to lakhs of people. While state assemblies of four states have already adopted resolutions against the implementation of CAA, NPR and NRC, the Bihar government has already issued a notification regarding the implementation of NPR in the state. Though the ruling NDA partners – JD(U), BJP and LJP -- had supported the CAA Bill, Nitish had expressed his reservations about the NRC, but maintained that the NPR could be implemented, pointing out at the same time that the questionnaire regarding NPR should be revised and four to five questions listed in the questionnaires needs to be scrapped. “NPR is the first step towards NRC. If you are not implementing NRC, then what is the point in implementing NPR in the state?,” Gopinath asked, adding that rich and resourceful people would not be affected by NRC and NPR, but the poor would definitely be affected

29,['10/02/2020'],PU to reclaim land from NIT-P for development of own campus,"This story is from February 10, 2020

PATNA: Even as Patna University (PU) has, of late, decided to reclaim its land, National Institute of Technology-Patna (NIT-P) does not appear to be in a mood to vacate its present campus.

The decision to ask the NIT-P administration to return the university’s land acquired by it was taken by the PU syndicate at its recent meeting held under the chairmanship of vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh. The syndics felt the necessity of reclaiming its land in view of the expected loss of the portion of its land on account of the ongoing Metro project. A good portion of PU’s land lying north of Ashok Rajpath is likely to be taken over by the said Metro project and, hence, the university, which is already facing acute space crunch, would be unable to complete many of its campus development schemes, they observed.

The syndicate further pointed out that since NIT-P has already been allotted 125 acre land adjacent to IIT at Bihta to develop its new campus, there was no justification for it in continuing to function from its present campus.

It may be mentioned here that as early as in 2004, the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering (BCE) was upgraded to NIT-P by the Union HRD ministry. Then, the college was running as a constituent unit of PU. Ultimately, the entire college was handed over to the union government following an MoU signed between both the parties. It was then decided that NIT would be shifted to a new large campus having about 300 acres of land. But, after much persuasion, the state government sanctioned land to the institute in 2012.

However, due to delay in acquisition of the allotted land at Bihta, the NIT-P started the expansion of its existing campus with the sanction of necessary funds from the union government. The construction of additional hostels for boys and girls, which include G+10 and G+5 buildings, separate residential blocks for teaching and non-teaching staff went on its Ashok Rajpath campus. Also, the construction of separate electronics department, students’ activity centre, nanoscience department, auditorium and new incubation centre is going on.

Hence, handing over PU’s land along with this huge infrastructure, including the newly constructed buildings, would not be so easy for the authorities, said a senior faculty of NIT-P. Moreover, development of a new full-fledged campus at Bihta will take its own time.

Meanwhile, PU VC, when contacted, said the university is seized with the problem of space and it would soon write to both the state government and the chancellor, requesting them to expedite reclamation of its land occupied by NIT-P. The university is contemplating to set up some of its study centres on this land, he said.

30,['10/02/2020'],"Experts welcome Rs4,614cr budgetary allocation for ECR","This story is from February 10, 2020

PATNA: Technical experts and senior railway officials have welcomed the allocation of Rs 4,614 crore in the Union Budget for East Central Railway (ECR) for the 2020-21 fiscal. The budgetary allocations, they feel, will expedite various railway projects in the region.

Describing the allocations as growth-oriented, former railway chief engineer G N Sahay said of Rs 4,614 crore allocated to ECR, it is expected that a big chunk of Rs 3606 crore would be spent on laying new lines, track doubling and gauge conversion work.

“Railways is keen to introduce semi high speed trains in Bihar for which the ECR has got a major share of Rs 580 crore for track renewal work,” Sahay said, adding Union finance ministry has, however, remained silent on the issue of laying a third line between Mokama and Buxar to cope with huge traffic flow on this route.

The ECR had got budgetary allocations of Rs 3,696 crore in 2017-18 fiscal, Rs 4,014 crore in the 2018-19 fiscal and Rs 4,560 crore in 2019-20 fiscal.

ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar said the thrust would be on development of railway network in the state. “Allocation of Rs 838 crore for the Koderma-Ranchi and Koderma-Tilaiya new rail lines, a stretch of about 257km, will give a boost to both passenger and goods traffic. Hajipur-Sugauli new rail line, a stretch of about 148km, has also got of Rs 1,006 crore in this Budget,” he said.

The CPRO said the Kiul-Gaya track doubling work would be completed within the stipulated time as the Budget has allocated Rs 280 crore for the project.

Similarly, adequate funds have been allocated for track doubling work on Hajipur-Bachwara (72km), Muzaffarpur-Sugauli (100km), Samastipur-Darbhanga (38km), Patratu-Dhanbad (291km), Ramna-Singhrauli (160km), Karaila-Sakhtinagar (32km), Daniya-Ranchi Road (25km), Garwaha Road-Ramna (33 km) and Gomoh-Khanudih flyover route, the CPRO said.

“The ECR has also been allocated Rs 250 crore to complete pending gauge conversion work on Sakri-Loukha Bazar (206km) and Jayanagar-Bijalpura-Bardibas in Nepal (69 km) routes,” Kumar added.

31,['10/02/2020'],Power engineers’ body splits over Feb 11-12 strike,"This story is from February 10, 2020

PATNA: The Power Engineering Service Association (PESA) is divided over the 24 hours’ symbolic strike called on February 11 and 12, as a section of engineers of Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited (BSPHCL) as well as its subsidiary companies has decided to stay away from it.

An urgent meeting was called by engineers, civil engineers, officers of the accounts, HR and IT departments of power companies on Sunday to discuss the issues behind the strike and recent clarifications by Union power minister RK Singh and BSPHCL CMD-cum-principal secretary of energy department Pratyaya Amrit that there was no move to privatise power holding companies.

Around 300 officials from various circles of state attended the meeting and showed disappointment towards the alleged arbitrary orders of PESA general secretary Surendra Kumar.

Vinod Kumar, executive engineer, said Surendra is involved in self-motivated acts in the name of PESA. “This has tarnished the image of not only PESA but the entire electrical workers and caused mutual disenchantment among the ‘power’ family,” he said and added: “We have already asked the engineers to submit their applications if they want to join the strike. Alternative arrangements will be made as we will not let the common people suffer due to the illegal strike called by PESA.”

Meanwhile, PESA general secretary sacked chief engineer Dilip Kumar of PESU, superintendent engineer Chandrashekhar and executive engineer Vinod Kumar from the union for not supporting the strike. Some other members also left the union.

When contacted, Dilip said PESA is not a registered body, so they are going to form another union. “In our next meeting, we will hold the elections of the new body. We will not be the part of strike,” he said.

Chandrashekhar said Surendra has created a state of fear and confusion in the ‘power’ family by spreading unfounded rumours of privatisation of power companies.

However, Surendra told this newspaper that it was an illegal meeting convened in the name of BSPHCL and the CMD. “We will hold our strike from 6am on February 11 till 6am on February 12. When the PESA already exists, how can they form another union in the same name,” he said.

PATNA: Library scientists and conservation experts here on Sunday highlighted the importance of manuscripts in preserving the intellectual heritage of mankind and stressed the need of their preservation and conservation.

Addressing the participants of a five-day workshop on ‘Preservation and Conservation of Manuscripts’, organized by Patna University (PU) library in collaboration with the National Mission for Conservation of Manuscripts they narrated the details of various traditional and modern techniques of conservation.

Reserve Bank of India (Pune) chemist Sarvesh Kumar Singh said that initial treatment and protection of manuscripts from harmful agents like dust, moisture and moths would save them from decay and enhance their life. He presented the details of chemical techniques of preservation of manuscripts.

National Museum coordinator Kriti Srivastava enumerated different methods of conservation of manuscripts and answered the questions asked by the participants. He opined that the government must initiate necessary steps for conservation of all our manuscripts lying in precarious condition in different parts of the country.

National Mission for Conservation of Museum conservator Archana Gehlot apprised the participants with various forms of manuscripts and proper use of chemicals for their preservation.

PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh said if due attention is not given for conservation of manuscripts, there is every possibility that our cultural heritage and nation's collective memory available in the form of manuscripts may disappear. He pleaded for digitization of all rare and valuable manuscripts for the benefit of future generation.

PU library incharge Rabindra Kumar welcomed the guests. Deputy librarian Ashok Kumar Jha proposed the vote of thanks. The workshop will conclude on Monday.

Ishwarsinh Patel, minister of state for youth, sports and culture along with Bharuch MLA Dushyant Patel flagged off the cyclo walkathon.

The cyclo walkathon which is organised every year by Ankleshwar Bicycle Club is getting overwhelming response.

“The number of participants are increasing each year. The participants spread the message of fitness, health, saving fuel and protecting environment by reducing fuel emission,” said Naresh Pujara, convener of Ankleshwar Bicycle Club.

The initiative taken at Ankleshwar has become an inspiration for other smaller towns. “Many leading industrialists are also going to their factory on bicycle. It is truly a laudable initiative,” said Ishwarsinh Patel.

The participants completed 11 km route that covered Gattu Vidyalaya, police station, ESIC hospital, Jaldhara and returned back to the starting point.

Eleven bicycles were sponsored by various corporates. These bicycles will be put up at Jogger’s Park against which users will be charged a token fee. “This will help those who do not have bicycle and want to use it,” said Pujara.

36,['10/02/2020'],Kolkata Metro: East-West Metro’s Phoolbagan station ready for final nod,"The interior of the Phoolbagan Metro station

TimesView We must push for the Phoolbagan and Sealdah stretches to be operational as early as possible. This will benefit thousands of commuters and make the project more viable.

KOLKATA: East-West Metro’s Phoolbagan station is now ready for an inspection by the commissioner of railway safety (CRS), which is likely to be carried out sometime this month. The 1km Phoolbagan stretch will be added soon after the inauguration of the first phase of East-West Metro on February 13.The East-West line’s first phase was originally planned till Phoolbagan, but delay in building the station has made the inaugural run shorter. The authorities feel that the truncated operations can be somewhat viable if services are extended to Phoolbagan, where the underground station has been built and a 1km tunnel has been dug till Sealdah . The stretch till Salt Lake Stadium , which is ready to run, is elevated. From there, a ramp at Subhas Sarovar leads the tracks under ground.The now-complete Phoolbagan station has all the advanced features of the six elevated ones that dot the Salt Lake stretch. Alongside the large staircase, there is a ramp for the differently abled which connects to an elevator to the non-paid area on the concourse level. Another elevator from the paid area goes to the station 18m below, where passengers will take the BEML-make trains. On the safety front, the 229mx25m station has passenger screen doors, CCTV cameras, neon signs, digital information display boards, ticket-vending machines, automatic fare collection gates, customer care booths and a hi-tech station control room. Tactile paths have been laid at entry and exit points for visually impaired passengers.Apart from being the city’s first underground Metro station to be built in 25 years, Phoolbagan station is also the first of the six underground stations of East-West Metro that is ready to function. Though Howrah Maidan , Howrah and Sealdah stations are structurally complete, they cannot start functions until the last leg of tunnelling between Esplanade and Sealdah is complete.Work for the Phoolbagan station started in 2011 with a 2013-14 deadline. It ran into an obstacle due to delay in site handover. Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation, the implementing agency of the Rs 8,575 crore East-West line, received the last tranche of land only in 2014.Other features at the station include three pairs of staircases, leading to the three entry-exit areas on either side of the crossing. ITD-ITD Cementation, contracted to build the Sector V-Esplanade leg of the East-West Metro, could, however, accommodate only one opening on the Narkeldanga side for want of space. The marble-floored platforms measure 140mx12m, 30m shorter than the North-South ones to accommodate the six-coach rakes instead of the eight-coach ones.Another interesting feature is the concrete beam jutting out of the overhead exhaust duct that will ensure that cool air circulating in the platform does not escape into the tunnel.

SURAT: The cybercrime police arrested a woman lecturer of a college in Thara in Banaskantha district on Saturday for allegedly conspiring to break the engagement of a businessman.

The lecturer Dolly Shaha, a resident of Thara, shared fake details about the businessman to his fiancée on Instagram chat. After seeing the details, the girl called off the relationship with the businessman in August last year.

Shah had planned to break the relationship since her talks of engagement with the complainant businessman did not work out in the past. The businessman deals in auto parts.

The businessman, who lives in Adajan, had approached police after getting to know that someone had tarnished his image on the social media, which led to his engagement being called off. Even as the crime was committed last year, the complaint was lodged on Friday.

“The accused lecturer told police that she defamed him to take revenge. In the past, her and the businessman’s family had been discussing their arranged marriage. As first step, their engagement was planned but due to some unknown reason it was cancelled,” said a police officer of cybercrime police station.

Later, Shah started keeping a watch on social media updates of the businessman. When she came to know that he had got engaged to another woman, she decided to break their relationship.

“She created an Instagram account with fake details,” said police.

According to the complaint, Shah sent messages to complainant’s former fiancee on Instagram that the businessman lived with a woman from Maharashtra at his home when his parents had gone to Rajasthan . Following these messages, the businessman’s engagement was cancelled. The businessman was not aware who was behind the messages hence he approached police.

BENGALURU: Rebel Foods , which runs cloud kitchens like Faasos , Oven Story Pizza and Behrouz Biryani , is eyeing a valuation of about $1 billion as it looks to mop up a new round of funding of $100-150 million. The move comes as investor interest in the space ramps up, said three sources familiar with the development.Rebel runs over a dozen virtual restaurant brands where it sells directly through its own application besides platforms like Zomato and Swiggy. The new funding follows less than six months after the Mumbai-based company raised its previous round of $125 million, which valued it at $525 million.The contours of the deal are still being discussed and the numbers could change, said the sources. “There has been inbound interest over the last few months to invest in the company, which has prompted Rebel to raise the new round,” said one of the sources mentioned earlier.The fresh round could see existing backer Coatue Management — a US-based hedge fund — invest about $50 million, while the remaining capital is raised from other new and existing investors. Financial services major Goldman Sachs and Indonesian ride-hailing giant Gojek were some of the other new investors in Rebel, while its early backers include Sequoia Capital India and Lightbox Ventures.Japan’s SoftBank Vision Fund has also recently expressed interest in the company again, though it is not clear if those talks have progressed. SoftBank had also held discussions with Rebel last year, but these did not fructify as its portfolio company Oyo was also making an aggressive push in the category. Although recently, Oyo has been cutting costs and has laid off significant staff in its kitchens business, according to reports.An emailed query to Rebel Foods CEO Jaydeep Barman and Coatue did not elicit a response till the time of going to press. A SoftBank spokesperson “declined to comment on market speculation”.What is attracting global interest in the category is the increasing spends on home delivery with the proliferation of online food delivery applications. The US has seen companies like DoorDash and UberEats come up, while in China, Meituan Dianping has become one of the most valued listed internet companies in the country after Alibaba and Tencent.The cloud kitchen segment has also attracted entrepreneurs like Uber’s Travis Kalanick, who started City Storage Systems, which is creating an infrastructure for kitchens, after his exit from the ride-hailing company. Kalanick had also picked up a small stake in Rebel last year. Rebel has seen its growth explode over the last few years. The company is expected to close the year ending March 2020 with total revenues of Rs 600-650 crore and is currently doing monthly revenues of Rs 75 crore, according to two sources mentioned earlier. Rebel already has about 325 cloud kitchens across India and has also started overseas expansion into Southeast Asia, Middle East and Europe.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74056586,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147608,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/rebel-foods-targets-1bn-valuation/articleshow/74050811.cms

However, coronavirus epidemic in China has cast a dark shadow over the prospects of the diamond industry, reeling under recession for a long time now. Hong Kong International Diamond, Gem & Pearl Show and Hong Kong International Jewellery Show, which were scheduled in the first week of March, have been postponed until May due to the outbreak of coronavirus.Industry sources said over 300 Indian diamond and jewellery companies from Surat, Mumbai, Antwerp and Hong Kong participate in the gems and jewellery events in Hong Kong. The events attract tens of thousands of international buyers from across the world, which give a fair idea to diamantaires about consumer demand.Nilesh Bodki of FamAsia Limited, a diamond company based in Hong Kong, said, “The March events in Hong Kong are a gateway to consumer demand in the world. Since the shows have been cancelled due to coronavirus, it is a wait and watch situation in the diamond industry. This is the year’s first largest jewellery event to spur the diamond demand in the world. Unfortunately, India’s diamond industry is going to be a big loser due to coronavirus.”Hitesh Patel, managing director of Dharmanandan Diamonds, said, “From Hong Kong shows, we get a fair idea on consumer demand and we manufacture the goods accordingly. For Surat, these are important shows as majority of diamonds displayed are of 30 cent to 1.50 carats.”Industry leaders have predicted that coronavirus epidemic in China is set to reduce exports of polished diamonds to Hong Kong by over 20%. Hong Kong is second largest polished diamond export market for India after the US, with annual exports to the tune of over $8 billion. Aniruddha Lidbide, diamond industry analyst, said, “The diamond industry was hoping to recover after facing challenging 2019, but cancellation of Hong Kong show is going to have a huge impact in the coming months.

40,['10/02/2020'],"Headless, PCB unable to proceed against local bodies","This story is from February 10, 2020

Kochi: For the past several months, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) had been at the forefront of disciplining the local bodies, including Kochi corporation, for their failure to adhere to statutes of Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016 by imposing heavy penalties under the polluter pays principle.

But with the resignation of board chairman Ajit Haridas on January 22, ironically over the enthusiasm he had shown to take penal action against erring local bodies, the entire exercise has hit a wall. According to sources, the board would not be able to take further action in the notices issued unless a new chairman is appointed.

“Only the board chairman has powers to issue directives under Section 5 of the Environment Protection (EP) Act. So further action on the notices issued by the board is not possible,” said KSPCB member secretary Sreekala S. Board chairman was vested with powers to issue notices as per a central government notification.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had recently permitted PCB to recover environment compensation to the tune of Rs 1.12 crore from Kochi corporation. The board had issued show cause notices to the local body after it failed to set up leachate treatment at Brahmapuram and biomethanation plant, which is mandatory as per the SWM Rules, 2016.

Sreekala said the board has so far issued directive to pay compensation only to Thrissur corporation. “For all other local bodies, we have issued only show cause notices, asking them to inform why penalty should not be imposed for violating SWM Rules,” she said. Board has slapped a fine of Rs 4.5 crore on Thrissur corporation.

Thiruvananthapuram corporation had obtained a stay against the PCB directive for compensation from the Kerala high court in December 2019. PCB pulled up the corporation for not complying with the directives of the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC).

“We are hoping that a decision on appointing a new chairman would be taken without further delay,” said Sreekala. According to PCB sources, the list of candidates for selection of chairman from which Ajit Haridas was chosen is still valid. “Government can choose the next eligible candidate from this list as it is only a year old,” said an official.

The SLMC appointed by NGT is expected to submit their report to the tribunal this week. “The absence of PCB chairman would affect further action against local bodies . NGT may have to issue directives in each case to overcome this,” said SLMC chairman Ramakrishna Pillai.

43,['10/02/2020'],Live-the-faith msg: Churches to reach out to people,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Kolkata: It is not enough to read religious texts and voice out gospels, unless one is able to translate them into daily action. This message will be highlighted at parishes of the Roman Catholic Church from Tuesday. A special programme has been designed for the Small Christian Community (SCC), a group of “doers” in every parish, who takes up different responsibilities given to them by their respective priests.

The programme has been christened ‘Live the Faith’, where SCCs will be told to identify the helpless and sick of all communities in the neighbourhood irrespective of religion and stand by them. On Tuesday, the first training will be given at Church Of Christ the King at Park Circus. There will be a sermon where the priest will pick up teachings from the gospels and tell parishioners how to transform them into real life situations. The church feels that too many differences in the name of religion are cropping up these days and they need serious ironing out. The parishioners will be encouraged to intermingle outside their community because tendencies to limit oneself to one’s own religious boundaries are creating barriers.

“The circumstances are changed today and only if we are able to encourage people to forget religious divides and come together as one humanity, problems will be solved. The efforts should start at the micro level so that the rhetoric of understanding, love and mercy replaces that of intolerance and hatred,” said Dominic Gomes, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Kolkata, who heads the SCC programme of the Roman Catholic Church.

The next two trainings will happen at Queen of Peace church at Tollygunge and Holy Family Church at Kestopur. There are 65 parishes that are within the purview of the archdiocese of Kolkata and 470 SCCs that will get trained under the programme. “We are doing this to revitalise our SCCs. Till the time different religious communities in every neighbourhood are able to intermingle freely, problems will irk us. I am trying to re-energise the SCCs to the best of my ability,” the vicar general said.

Every SCC will be encouraged to come back to the church and discuss the pressing issues of the neighbourhood with the priest, who will then take leadership in sending help wherever required across religions. “I think basic human interactions can do magic. We hope after we are able to fully translate what we learn in the scriptures to “doing them” or “living them”, we will be able to see the differences ourselves,” the vicar general said.

44,['10/02/2020'],SPCA gets functional after delay of 19 years,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: Almost over 19 years after central government’s order, the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has started functioning in the district.

On top agenda are effective implementation of sterilization of strays, curbing illegal breeding of dogs, mandatory licensing of pet shops and creating mass awareness on animal welfare.

Two years back, TOI reported that in 2001, the union government had directed all states to establish SPCA in each district within six months from the date of commencement of rules. The society’s main intention is to prevent cruelty to animals and execute welfare schemes of Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI). However, Nagpur district had failed in doing so.

Following pressure from citizens and animal welfare groups, the district administration finally formed the society which consists of 11 government and non-government members each. Nagpur is now among the few districts of the state to have a registered society.

In a recently held workshop, state commissionerate of animal husbandry Laxminarayan Mishra directed the society members to initiate action against illegal pet shops operating in the city.

Non-government member and animal activist Karishma Galani highlighted that illegal breeding of dogs is getting rampant in the city. “We will be creating public awareness on buying pets only from licensed shops,” she said.

Apart from this, the society also aims to implement better animal birth control (ABC) programme in the city.

TOI has been repeatedly reporting about the increasing menace of stray dogs in the city. In August, 2017, the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had filed a complaint with state chief minister Devendra Fadnavis stating that there were over 90,000 dogs in the city.

In October last year, a pack of five stray dogs brutally injured a seven-year-old boy at Bhange layout in Jaitala. In the last few months, TOI received many complaints regarding increasing stray population in many areas.

While a sterilization programme is being carried out, activists pointed out that it was not done in a scientific manner. “ABC operations should be carried out ward-wise, keeping in mind proper relocation of the operated dogs. Apart from this, a city like Nagpur should have at least four operation centres,” said Galani.

As per the Centre’s norms, the state government has to provide adequate land and other facilities for constructing infirmaries and animal shelters to the society. The members need to submit its annual report to the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) incorporating the activities undertaken by it.

Minimum temperatures are likely to be in the range of 9 to 13 degrees C till February 13

PATNA: Sunny days notwithstanding, night temperature is likely to remain below 10 degrees C in Patna and most parts of the state this week as well.

Patna Meteorological Centre claimed that though weather is expected to remain dry, cold westerly winds coming from the snow-laden Himalayan peaks will keep the mercury in night and early morning hours below 10 degrees C at least till February 13. The daily weather bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre on Sunday afternoon stated that fall in night temperature is expected by two to four notches over Bihar during the next 24 hours.

An extended weather bulletin on February 6 stated that minimum temperatures are likely to be in the range of 9 to 13 degrees C till February 13.

Even on Sunday, the minimum temperature at Patna stood at 8.4 degrees C, which was three notches lower than the corresponding normal. Gaya remained the coldest place in the state in the morning with minimum temperature at 6.8 digress C.

“The cold northwesterly winds will continue to blow in the region, keeping a check on rise in minimum temperature till February 15. Maximum temperature is, however, expected to be in the range of 23-25 degrees C till then owing to the clear skies allowing warming up of lower level of atmosphere due to direct solar rays,” an official at Patna Meteorological Centre said.

He said dry weather prevailed and shallow fog was observed at one or two places over the state during last 24 hours.

Meanwhile, a western disturbance is very likely to affect western Himalayan region from February 11 onwards. Met officials, however, ruled out any significant impact of the upcoming western disturbance on the prevailing weather in Bihar.

“Any western disturbance henceforth will not have much impact on weather in Bihar, in terms of significant rainfall or variation in temperature,” the meteorologist said.

The western disturbances are low pressure area or extra-tropical storms originating from Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause snow and winter rainfall in north-western Indian subcontinent. Normally, there are six to seven western disturbances in January, but meteorologists claimed this time there were around 10 such weather systems and most of them affected Bihar.

PATNA: Despite the education department’s warning, around 4.5 lakh contractual teachers have decided to go on an indefinite strike from February 17 in support of their 8-point demands, including equal pay for equal work and old pension scheme.

Niyojit (contractual) teachers of government and government-aided schools will not join the teaching and invigilation duty of matriculation examination to be conducted by Bihar School Examination Board from February 17.

The teachers will protest under the banner of Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti (BRSSSS).

Bihar State Primary Teachers’ Association president and convener of the samiti, Brajnandan Sharma, said, “Through videoconferencing, we have asked all the teachers to support the strike. We will not get scared of ‘tughlaqi farman’ of education department. This time, we will fight for our rights and the state government has to compromise with us,” he said and added: “We will lock the gates of the schools and there will be no classes. The teachers will also boycott invigilation duty.”

Education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma told this newspaper on Sunday that the teachers’ protest may cause inconvenience to department and the examinees. “We are trying to sort out the issues with the teachers by holding dialogues. The department cannot fulfil their demands. Even the Supreme Court has rejected their demand,” he said.

He added: “By holding protests, the teachers are blackmailing the department. They should do their duty diligently. However, the department will not let the teachers cause inconvenience to the teachers. We will make alternate arrangements in their absence from duty.”

Additional chief secretary of education department, RK Mahajan, on Friday directed the DMs, district education officers and deputy development commissioner to obtain a written declaration from such teachers, who have been deputed for the invigilation of matriculation examination but want to join the indefinite strike.

“Accordingly, special arrangements should be made, so that the Class X board exams should not get affected. The protesting teachers will be marked absent and their salary will be deducted on the principle of ‘no work no pay’. if the teachers tried to cause hindrance during the examination, strict action would be taken against them, including suspension,” says the notification.

PATNA: The Danapur division of the East Central Railway ( ECR ) has started using an old and abandoned railway coach as a canteen for its staff.

According to Danapur divisional railway manager (DRM) Sunil Kumar, the railways had declared a 1994 Integral Coach Factory coach (ECG 94504) “unfit” for running on tracks in September last year.

“The innovative idea of renovating the abandoned coach and converting it into a canteen came to the minds of some senior railway officials of the division. A team was formed that gave a facelift to the coach at the Danapur depot yard and made all kinds of facilities available,” Kumar told this newspaper and added the personnel department of the division was running the canteen.

ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar claimed that the concept of converting a coach into a canteen had been hailed in other zones of the railways. “The canteen, which can accommodate 40 people at a time, is likely to serve the needs of around 400 railway employees, who work around the clock. They can eat snacks and light meals and also drink tea,” he said.

The CPRO added, “The railways is trying to ensure that fresh and hygienic meals are served to the staff inside the canteen. Depending on their response, Bihari delicacies will also be added to the menu in future. Besides, more such canteens or cafeterias are likely to be developed at other places under the five divisions of the ECR.”

The Danapur railway canteen was recently inaugurated by the president of ECR’s women welfare organization, Kaumudi Trivedi.

51,['10/02/2020'],Shantibagh anti-CAA dharna enters 43rd day,"This story is from February 10, 2020

GAYA: The ongoing dharna in Shantibagh locality of the town entered 43rd day on Sunday and the protest continues with patriotic songs, frequent recital of the Constitution’s preamble, speeches by activists with non-right background and a resolve to take the fight to its logical end.

Teenagers try to emulate Kanhaiyya through his high decibel ‘azadi’ slogans. Every now and then full throated slogans are raised. “Kanhaiyya and not Owaisi is my role model,” said Danish, who got a soar throat via Kanhaiyya’s favourite slogan. During his January 21 visit to the dharna site, organisers got scared as selfie-seeking youngsters came close to crushing the JNU students union former president.

According to Satish Das, an Ambedkarite and co-convener of the Samvidhan Bachao Morcha, besides staging dharnas, Morcha activists, in smaller groups have launched an outreach programme to create awareness about the overall implication of the CAA-NPR-NRC on undocumented population irrespective of its religious affiliations. “CAA route to citizenship was available only for non-Muslims coming to India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,” Das tells people during the outreach programme.

“Undocumented Indians remain vulnerable to exploitation by the lower bureaucracy,” Das and other members of the group tell people. The Morcha co-convener claimed that the group visits 3-4 villages everyday and returns to the dharna site in the afternoon. They have so far visited villages located in Manpur, Bodh Gaya , Bela, Paraiyya and Sherghati blocks. All these blocks except Sherghati are within a 15 km radius from the dharna site located in the northwestern part of the town.

Asked about the criteria for selecting villages, Das said that they pick up villages with a mixed population of Dalits, Muslims, OBCs and EBCs. Besides the Muslims, a large number of Dalits realise the consequences of CAA-NRP-NRC. The activist admitted that convincing the OBCs and EBCs was somewhat difficult. “Ultimately, the OBCs and EBCs too will see through the RSS game,” hoped Satish Das.

Asked about how long the dharna will continue, Omair Khan @Tikka Khan, convener of the Morcha said that they were waiting for the SC response. He was very hopeful about a positive outcome from the SC. The dharna issue will be reviewed in the light of the SC response and also the outcome of similar protest in Shaheenbagh and elsewhere in the country. He favoured coordination among protesters across the country.

Mushtari, a domestic help who regularly sits on dharna after doing her part time job in several households in the neighbourhood, says that the dharna inconvenience is nothing as compared to jail.

Surat: Police arrested an 18-year-old boy on Sunday for allegedly murdering a 17-year-old Class XII student in limits of Udhna police station on Friday. The accused was caught from Dindoli area based on specific information.

“The accused youth has been arrested and police will share more details after preliminary questioning. He was caught from Dindoli area,” said a senior police officer.

Police earlier booked, Mukesh Pimple, a resident of Nagsen Nagar, for allegedly killing Rohit Baviskar. The complaint was lodged by Dashrath, father of the deceased. Pimple suspected that Baviskar met his sister often during the past couple of years. The duo had heated heated arguments in the past over this suspicion, police said.

On Saturday, a group of over 100 including family and friends of Baviskar sat on dharna at New Civil Hospital and refused to accept his body after postmortem. They later arrived at police commissioner's office and brought the body in morgue van to the campus. They demanded quick action and immediate arrest of the accused.

On Friday, when Baviskar came out of tuition classes at Vishnu Nagar 1 in Udhna, the accused stopped and stabbed him multiple times. The victim was stabbed five times in the back, head, near the ear and twice in the chest. His heart got punctured due stabbing, said police.

Surat: The city BJP unit was in for some embarassment after a party worker reportedly shared some obscene videos in the Whatsapp group of Limbayat ward 24.

As soon as the party worker, Kishore Solanki, uploaded the videos, women members of the group were left fuming and demanded that he be removed from the group. Even as Solanki deleted the videos after the uproar, the screen shots of the group chat also went viral on various other social media platforms.

City BJP leaders have not taken Solanki’s action kindly and have warned him of strict action if he repeats such an act. The issue reached city BJP president Nitin Bhajiyawala who asked Solanki to come in person and give a clarification.

""I had called Solanki to find out the truth and found that he shared the videos. I warned him of suspension from the party if he repeats. Solanki is not an office bearer in the party but a worker,"" said Bhajiyawala.

The incident comes days after videos of BJP municipal councillor Piyush Shivshaktiwala dancing while being in an inebriated condition near Nargol beach of Valsad.

54,['10/02/2020'],Patna zoo to spend Rs 2.2 crore on enclosures for its new inmates,"This story is from February 10, 2020

The zoo director said a separate enclosure would be made adjacent to Reptile House for rhino iguana

PATNA: The officials at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, aka Patna zoo , are busy developing new enclosures and modifying some existing ones for the new inmates likely to arrive from abroad by April and June.

Officials said the zoo is to spend estimated Rs2.2 crore on the modification and development of new enclosures to be ready by March-end.

Patna zoo will get a pair of two-horned rhinos from Vietnam in lieu of pair of one-horned rhinos under the animal exchange programme of the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) by April first week.

The city zoo will also get a pair each of green anaconda, Nile crocodile, royal python and rhino iguana from Denmark in exchange of one male and seven female gharials.

Amit Kumar, Patna zoo director, told this newspaper on Saturday that enclosures are being modified as per the requirement of new guests. “We have to consider the geological, psychological and basking requirements of the new inmates. Fountains and green cover will be prepared for the snakes. In Reptile House, two snake enclosures are undergoing modification to house green anaconda and royal python,” Amit said.

He further said that the natural habitat and diet of the new snakes — anaconda and royal python — is different from the snakes at Patna zoo. The coming snakes need a bigger enclosure measuring 40X30 feet because they can easily grow up to 1,500mm, he said.

“Besides glass terrariums, they require wooden chips, bulbs and warm basking area inside the enclosure. For diet, these reptiles eat chicken, rodents, fish and lizards,” he explained.

The zoo director said a separate enclosure would be made adjacent to Reptile House for rhino iguana. “They need space to climb, hide and bask. Iguana eats fruits, vegetables, leaves and insects. They need natural surroundings. Strong well-fixed branches or logs, fountain and rocks add a more naturalistic look to the enclosure along with some foliage,” Amit said.

The zoo administration is also creating a small pond of fresh water near the Rhino Breeding Centre for the pair of Nile crocodile. The pair will get beef, chicken and fish in their diet. The inmates from Danish zoo will be here by June.

“For two-horned rhinos, we are making few modifications in the existing enclosure of one-horned rhinos. We will keep the new inmates at display, while the one-horned rhinos will be kept in Rhino Breeding Centre, which will be ready by March. A bigger night house is being prepared for two-horned rhinos and as they prefer less swampy area. They will be here by first week of April,” he said.

The breeding facility under construction for one-horned rhinoceroses is spread over an area of 2.5 acres between new lake and jungle trail area on the zoo premises. It is being developed with an estimated outlay of Rs4.11 crore. The centre would have facility of a night house, a shaded area and an open area. The breeding area would also have a lake and grassland to stimulate natural habitat for rhinos and help in mating.

56,['10/02/2020'],‘70 per cent of water bodies vanished in three decades in Bihar’,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Unnatural death of thousands of water bodies and considerable decline in the area of wetlands during the past few decades have led to the present drinking water crisis in different parts of the state.

Experts point out that almost 70% water bodies in the state have vanished during the last three decades. There were more than 2.50 lakh ponds in the state till the late eighties, but the number has reportedly declined to less than one lakh today. All these ponds, which were essential to store rainwater during the eight dry months of the year, have disappeared across the state owing to the alleged government apathy and increasing real estate activities. These ponds and wetlands have been encroached upon by the vested interests for construction purposes, they alleged.

There were nearly 1,000 lakes in Patna but their numbers have come down to a little over 200. Several residential localities have been developed after big ponds were filled. Patna’s ponds, including Kachchi Talaab, Sachivalay Talaab, Manikchand Talaab and Adalatgannj Talaab may not survive for long.

Expressing serious concern at the neglect of most water bodies, Patna University geology teacher and JD (U) MLC Ranbir Nandan told this newspaper that almost 90% of the drinking water requirement of the people, particularly of urban area, is met through groundwater. “The groundwater is recharged by ponds, canals and all other wetlands, but with the disappearing of water bodies the groundwater level at most places has gone down to greater depths,” Nandan said, adding consequently, dug wells, hand pumps and shallow tube wells have dried at many places.

Nandan, who has done extensive work on the groundwater resources of Bihar , further pointed out that satellite data indicate the presence of as many as 27,931 water bodies having an area above 0.5 hectares in the state. “However, only 14% of them are perennial. Small water bodies are mostly seasonal and contribute very little to the sustainable water resource development,” he said.

In 2016, the state revenue and land reforms department had undertaken a project to make all water bodies encroachment free and renovate them so that they are fit for rainwater harvesting and water conservation. It had also directed the officials concerned to lodge cases against those who have encroached upon ponds, lakes and rivers in the state.

Under the water bodies' conservation project, which is part of the disaster risk reduction road map (2015-30) of the state government, the department was first supposed to identify all community water bodies in the state and then remove encroachments, if any. Finally, all water bodies were to be renovated under various schemes of the government and made fit to conserve water. The department sources said, this was also supposed to help in groundwater conservation.

Nandan, however, asserted that the ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan’ launched recently by chief minister Nitish Kumar would go a long way in reclaiming most of the encroached ponds and other water bodies, thereby, enhancing the groundwater level. Besides, it would also take care of all other problems related to climate change, he added.

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Udaan , the online business-to-business (B2B) commerce platform valued at $2.8 billion, has made its first startup investment in Ahmedabad-based restaurant billing platform PetPooja , according to regulatory documents sourced by TOI.

Udaan’s investment in the two-year-old startup indicates its aspiration to build a larger fresh foods and vegetables supply business to small and medium enterprises, or restaurants in this case. This further intensifies Udaan’s competition with Walmart and Tiger Global-backed Ninjacart and online wholesale marketplace Jumbotail as it has been building the ‘Fresh’ vertical for the foods and vegetables supply business.

“More than the capital investment, PetPooja’s data will help Udaan to understand the fresh supplies business better. They (Udaan) have been looking to scale up that line of business,” a source aware of the goings-on said. PetPooja has over 12,000 restaurants on its platform, another person aware of the matter added.

The Bengaluru-based B2B unicorn’s Singapore-based arm Trustroot Payments invested around $2 million in PetPooja, started by Parthiv Patel and Apurv Patel. The investment was made in December, the documents showed. This investment will help China’s Tencent-backed Udaan to get a closer look at the data on what restaurant order cycles look like and build its Fresh business accordingly.

Both Udaan and PetPooja confirmed the development to TOI.

“PetPooja team has done a great job of empowering restaurant owners across India. As strong believers in the power of our country’s unique B2B ecosystem, we’re happy and proud to support them in their journey,” said Udaan co-founder Amod Malviya.

Patel said he will use Udaan’s investment to scale up operations. “Our mission is to digitise restaurants by building technology to streamline their operations to scale and make them more productive,” he added.

KOLKATA: Thousands in the city braved the early morning chill and gathered on Red Road to run for a cause in the inaugural edition of the Apollo Gleneagles Times Half Marathon on Sunday. The build-up to the event, which included planning, registering and practising for several days, culminated in a morning filled with enthusiasm and excitement.

More than 5,000 people participated in the event and there were a lot of non-runners who turned up to cheer their friends and family on. “I woke up at 4am so I could be here by 5.15am. I have been preparing for the half marathon for nearly a week by going for morning walks to build up my endurance level. I even made my friends register for the run,” said Kriti Pachisia, a college student from Lake Town who finished the 10k run in a little over two hours.

The 21k event, which was flagged off at 6.30am, had several marathon veterans as participants . For those who were not experienced, but registered to give it a try, the cool weather kept the discomfort index in control. “It feels great to run at the Times Half Marathon. I was not sure I would be able to complete the 10k run, but the weather was good and I did not sweat much. And the organizers were always at hand to offer help,” said Rajan Thapa, a retired para-military personnel who completed the 21k run in less than three hours.

Before the events started, fitness instructors at warm-up stations shared tips with participants on how to keep injuries at bay. There was an Apollo Gleneagles zone in the activity area with 10 beds and three tables, and three ambulances were kept on stand-by.

The 3k run, which witnessed the maximum participation, was flagged off by actor-MP Nusrat Jahan, and actors Prosenjit Chatterjee and Ritabhari Chakraborty at 8.30am.

Many participants appeared to have forgotten they were there to run as they crowded around the stage where the actors stood, clicking photographs and selfies on their phones. The space around the stage became so crowded at one point that the cops and volunteers had to intervene to urge the runners forward.

“It is very encouraging to see that so many people have turned up early on Sunday morning to be a part of a noble cause. This shows we are aware and alert,” said Chatterjee.

Rajender Singh Lahauria, general manager (ATC), Kolkata airport, completed the 10k run in 58 minutes. “The message of the Times Half Marathon is to keep our city clean so we can breathe fresh air every time we step out of our homes. Running is the best and most affordable exercise.”

59,['10/02/2020'],"Kolkata Airport: The Authorities at Kolkata airport,airlines officials to discuss roll-out of inline baggage scan","Inline baggage screening through a CTX machine

KOLKATA: The authorities at Kolkata airport will meet airlines’ representatives next week to discuss the preparedness for the roll-out of the much-awaited inline baggage screening (ILBS) system. Once it is introduced, passengers will be able to drop their checked-in bags directly at the check-in counter instead of first getting them scanned at standalone X-Ray machines.While Airports Authority of India (AAI) officials in Kolkata are keen to introduce ILBS at the earliest following the nod from Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee said the roll-out could happen in phases between October 20 and 28, with portals dedicated to airlines being commissioned one at a time. In the international wing, though, all portals — F, G and H — will be commissioned at one go since they follow dynamic allocation and are not dedicated to any carrier.“We know there is a lot of interest in the introduction of ILBS as it will eliminate one queue and save flyers 5-15 minutes. But we have to consult the airline and find out if they have any concerns or issues before finalising the commissioning schedule. Of the five portals in the domestic wing, four will get ILBS while all three portals in the international wing will get the facility,” said Bhattacharjee.Portal A, used by GoAir and AirAsia, will get the system at a later date as it will require the Spanish baggage handling system supplier to rework the software. The other seven portals — B to H — are managed by German firm Siemens.According to airport officials, portal D, which caters to SpiceJet and Vistara, and portal E, which has Air India, could be commissioned separately. But portals B and C, which cater to IndiGo, will have to be commissioned at the same time.The migration to the new system will be tricky as it requires baggage handling discipline by airline staff and rigorous screening by AAI’s baggage screeners. Airlines will have to ensure a minimum separation between two bags placed on the belt and put small bags, duffel bags and rucksacks that have belts in trays for the system to work seamlessly.Of the 80-plus screeners, 50 have received certification by BCAS. The rest are expected to be certified before ILBS is commissioned. While they have been trained to detect explosives and other dangerous materials, a security expert warned that the initial baggage rejection rate could be high as the system could flag innocuous items, like pickle.“The CTX registered baggage explosive detection system will flag many suspicious items. Most of them will be harmless stuff, primarily edible items typical to Indian cuisine. Screeners will learn what to override through experience. Till that happens, there will be higher rejections, requiring passengers to be summoned to the basement to explain what the suspect item is or to open the bag for inspection,” the security expert said.In airports that have ILBS, passengers are required to sign a declaration that they do not have prohibited items, including lithium-ion batteries or wet cell batteries that could explode in the air due to heat build-up. “While the bag rejection should happen within 10 minutes of it being dropped at the check-in counter, if there are too many rejections, airlines could get harried and decide to leave the bag at the airport instead of summoning passengers and delay flights. Thus, it is important that passengers get educated on what they should not carry in registered bags,” said an airline official.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74057849,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-146231,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/airport-authority-airlines-officials-to-discuss-roll-out-of-inline-baggage-scan/articleshow/74051216.cms
60,['10/02/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: 4.5 lakh ‘paper toilets’ vanish in Rs 540 crore scam,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Representative image

BHOPAL: Call it the vanishing-toilet scam. More than 4.5 lakh Swachh loos have been flushed into oblivion in Madhya Pradesh , along with the Rs 540 crore it took to build them.

The toilets may never be found — though the administration has GPS-tagged photographs of each of them — but the government aims to recover every paisa spent on them. It’s a reminder of the toilet door scam unearthed in Guna district in 2017, where the iron doors of 42,000 toilets were built 10kg lighter, leading to siphoning of crores.

The ‘vanishing’ toilets were supposed to have been built — at least on paper — between 2012 and October 2018. But they don’t exist. Officials believe that the photographs submitted as proof of Swachh toilet construction were actually clicked elsewhere, perhaps at neighbours’ homes as proof of money spent.

Some villagers blew the whistle in Betul’s tribal Lakkadjam panchayat and complained to officials. A probe quickly found that four Swachh beneficiaries — Chaitram, Ram Kishore, Kansraj and Shambhudayal — were not even aware that toilets have been built in their name. On government records, not only do their homes have toilets but the government portal has pictures of them before loos as well. Officials found that all four were photographed in front of a neighbour’s toilet.

“A detailed probe was conducted in Lakkadjam panchayat, and the complaints were found to be true. For these toilets and other similar anomalies, a recovery of Rs 7 lakh was imposed on the accused. They appealed against the recovery order, but the penalty was upheld. Once recovery is done, we will initiate action under IPC. I have ordered investigation of all the other work done in the panchayat,” chief executive officer (CEO) of Betul panchayat ML Tyagi told TOI.

It set alarm bells ringing and the panchayat and rural development department has since identified 4.5 lakh such missing ‘ paper toilets ’ across the state. In monetary terms, toilets worth Rs 540 crores are missing, said an official.

“In 2012, a baseline survey was conducted and 62 lakh above-poverty-line households without toilets were identified in the state. On October 2, 2018, construction of all these toilets was complete. But to ensure that these toilets are actually present and 100% complete, we conducted a survey and physical verification using 21,000 volunteers. During this survey, around 4.5 lakh toilets were found to be missing,” deputy director of Swachh Bharat Mission (Rural) Madhya Pradesh, Ajit Tiwari, told TOI.

A second physical verification is under way. “It is being conducted by district-level officers. We hope it will be complete in a couple of months. Then, we will have a cleaner picture of the numbers of Swachh mission toilets. Our objective is to ensure that the toilets or assets built by the government are actually present,” said Tiwari. The data will be put in public domain so that the beneficiaries can check for any anomaly, he added.

“There were two processes of making payments. Panchayats were provided money upon completion of toilets in households, or the government transferred Rs 12,000 to beneficiaries’ accounts once they built the toilets. In both cases, it is clear where the money went. So, people responsible for the missing toilets will have to build them for real, or the face music. The sole objective is to ensure 100% completion of the target identified in 2012,” Tiwari said.

Asked how the scamsters beat technology since Swachh toilet photographs are geo-mapped, Tiwari said: “The GPS is accurate up to 6 metres. Most probably, pictures of toilets within 6 metres were uploaded in the name of the beneficiaries or pictures of toilets built prior to 2012 were uploaded. Things will be clear once the second survey is complete.”

61,['10/02/2020'],Sales execs quit companies to log onto gig economy,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: The perennially high demand for sales talent has made these jobs ‘recession-proof’. Frontline sales jobs have always been in demand, given the high attrition levels.Earlier, sales people were largely rotating between traditional industries like banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI), FMCG and pharmaceuticals companies every year or two. However, today, a significant chunk is said to be moving out of traditional jobs to operate in gig roles.Other than the growing opportunities in sales within the traditional sectors, multiple avenues have opened up in the new-age economy as well. In an internal survey of Axis Bank, it was found that 45% of employees who had quit the sales function a year ago were not engaged in any major job and were instead doing multiple gigs.Axis Bank HR head Rajkamal Vempati said, “The psychology of a job seeker has moved from a scarcity mindset to that of abundance. The young talent is willing to take risks with small organisations and make money doing different kinds of jobs. This is the talent that falls under Rs 3-lakh earning bracket and it’s difficult to retain them.”The BFSI industry is hiring a slew of people in sales to compensate for the high attrition levels. However, given the trend of talent moving to gig jobs, Axis Bank has made a shift in its policy. Around 60% of its frontline sales hires are now experienced sales professionals instead of freshers.PNB MetLife director & HR head Shishir Agarwal said, “Alternative jobs are emerging and people are seen shifting out of sales. However, I believe 80% of the people who exit remain within the same ship. Around 20% would be jumping to the gig roles.”In pharma, the scenario is not very different. RPG Life Sciences MD Yugal Sikri said, “The shift in trend is about the kind of talent that is getting into sales. Earlier, we used to get science and pharmacy graduates, hailing from middle-class, relatively well-off family backgrounds. Now we get talent from humble backgrounds as well, and this is the talent that stays on with us for longer as they value the job more. The talent with science/pharmacy and management background stays for 1-1.5 years, but moves to product management role or even to FMCG.”According to the company’s findings, 10% of the people who move out do so to other jobs/industries. “Earlier, it used to be the BPO industry that attracted sales talent. Today, new-age gig economy is the new BPO,” said Sikri.With capabilities that cut across industries, TeamLease Services executive VP & co-founder Rituparna Chakraborty said sales people are the ones who can ride a two-wheeler, they are outbound and have good capability of interacting with customers. Substitutable roles for sales include e-commerce delivery boys.“They are happy with the pay package and they are in control of the hours they keep. These roles did not exist earlier. For the 20-29-year-olds, it’s an itch they need to scratch. The divide emerges only later when they feel the need for developing career paths,” said Chakraborty.A key reason why sales professionals stay with a company is salary and compensation, and the variable pay is usually greater than the fixed salary. Chakraborty said companies should invest in apprenticeship schemes to fill frontline jobs, as these have a lower risk and higher returns than the costly lateral hires.Interestingly, while organisations are going all out to build their employer brand, the younger generation of sales talent does not appear to be convinced. “Good amount of disposable income with minimal responsibilities gives them the confidence of not worrying about continuity in the job. They are not afraid to quit and try something different. Thus, working in an organisation that understands their needs and provides flexibility of working is higher in the pecking order over brand,” said Agarwal.A TeamLease Services report said the sales domain in India has the potential to create more than 2 million jobs over a few years, without any major structural reforms. The potential could be realised through a combination of macro-economic, strategic and technological factors that would give further growth impetus to enterprises in India, while boosting domestic consumption.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74057053,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1041285,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sales-execs-quit-cos-to-log-onto-gig-eco/articleshow/74050857.cms
62,['10/02/2020'],Turkey’s Koc eyes Indian consumer durables market,"This story is from February 10, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Turkey’s largest business house, Koc Group , is betting on the Indian market, which is being seen as one of the bright spots in the world despite the current slump.

Koc, owner of consumer durable brands like Grundig and Beko, will roll out made-in-India refrigerators, washing machines, microwave ovens and dishwashers to take on the well-entrenched Samsung, LG and Whirlpool in the country. Controlled by Istanbul’s wealthiest family, Koc is hoping to replicate its European success in India.

Though Koc has a diversified portfolio such as financial services, energy and tourism, it will begin in India with consumer durable brands Beko and later Grundig. The Turkish business house has partnered with the Tata Group for the home appliances business in India. The 50:50 partnership, however, does not cover air conditioners (ACs) as Tata has its own play in that space.

The joint venture has invested $180 million in setting up a manufacturing facility in Sanand, Gujarat, to manufacture washing machines and microwaves, among other products.

India is a rare market where Koc has a joint venture for consumer durables, said one of its top executives. The home appliances arm of Koc — Arcelik — is a leading player in Europe, the heartland of kitchen appliances. And in the UK, one in five appliances sold is a Beko. India, however, is a difficult market to foray into without a local partner, said the company’s CEO Hakan Bulgurlu.

Koc identified India as a growth-potential geography in 2010, following which it started gauging the size of the market and meeting prospective partners. In 2017, Arcelik inked an agreement with Tata Group company Voltas. Arcelik’s greenfield factory in Sanand follows its refrigerator plant in Thailand.

For Voltas, the joint venture marks a re-entry into kitchen appliances, a segment it has visited multiple times in the past. A couple of years after India’s economic liberalisation in 1991, Voltas had acquired Allwyn refrigerators. In 1998, it sold Allwyn to Sweden’s Electrolux.

63,['10/02/2020'],CII: Fear of criminal tag among companies,"This story is from February 10, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: The Confederation of Indian Industry ( CII ) has said that there is a fear factor among directors, young entrepreneurs and foreign investors over increasing incidents where commercial and civil disputes are being treated as criminal complaints. The industry body has petitioned the Prime Minister and the finance minister, calling for steps to decriminalise provisions in several business-facing laws and Acts to improve investor confidence.

CII’s recommendations cover 37 laws and Acts, ranging from the Partnership Act of 1932 to the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code of 2016. It has said that offences that are technical or those that do not affect public interest prejudicially should be decriminalised. The confederation has said that there are 23 offences under the Companies Act that could be shifted to an adjudication mechanism, and seven offences where penalties can be omitted as they pertain to orders of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). “The NCLT may use its contempt power in such cases,” the representation said.

During the Union Budget 2020-21 speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had emphasised that criminal liabilities for civil Acts will be amended in the Companies Act and other laws would also be examined. In this context, the CII has identified many of these Acts where criminal provisions exist.

For instance, under the Sebi Act, the maximum punishment for non-compliance is imprisonment up to 10 years, or fine of Rs 25 crore, or both. “Mere errors of non-disclosure or late disclosure, which are not significant in nature, may be made punishable with penalties that are not substantial in monetary terms or do not include the possibility of imprisonment,” the CII said. The confederation has recommended 12 alternative ways to work towards decriminalisation of laws and amend legislation to change criminal penalties to civil penalties.

“A change in the nature of penalty provisions in business and economic laws represents the next stage of reforms in ease of doing business. Divesting criminal penalties from business laws — unless well-defined criminal actions are found — will strengthen confidence among young entrepreneurs and investors in doing business,” CII president Vikram Kirloskar said.

Besides these laws, CII has highlighted sections of competition law, partnership Act, labour laws, environment laws and FMCG laws that required amendment. “Inadvertent errors or technical deviations may not be tried as criminal offences, and the director of the company not to be tried before the remote magistrate courts but by the respective controller of legal metrology where the registered office of the company is situated,” the representation said.

Earlier, the government had sought to criminalise failure to meet targets for spending toward corporate social responsibility. However, following protests from industry, the government said that it is not going ahead with the provision.

64,['10/02/2020'],Chandigarh’s second medical college to be on 15 Sarangpur acres,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Representative image

CHANDIGARH: Finally, the city will have a second medical college, for which administrator V P Singh Badnore has consented to allot 15 acres in Sarangpur’s Education City. Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, will run this affiliate institute of Panjab University .

The college’s estimated annual expenditure on salary and related components is Rs 13 crore. Its 50 seats will be expanded to 100, later. For the first two years, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, will conduct the classes, and when the new building is ready, GMSH-16 will take over from the third and fourth years. The new college will follow the GMCH’s admission and reservation policy.

The urban planning department wanted a site in Sector 53 of south Chandigarh but the administrator, highest authority, found Sarangpur more suitable. The land approval, a copy of which is with TOI, says: “The case is submitted to the UT administrator with reference to a demi-official letter from Union health minster Dr Harsh Vardhan and a meeting held in the UT secretariat. Held under the chairmanship of the administrator and attended by the UT adviser, the meeting was to seek administrative approval for 10 to 15 acres, keeping in view the future expansion and increase in the MBBS (bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery) seats, so that a DPR (detailed project report) can be submitted at the earliest.”

Besides the creation of teaching posts for the new college, members of the clinical faculty and the resident doctors of GMSH can be adjusted for clinical subjects, if they fulfil the MCI (Medical Council of India) norms. Since it is UT’s own project, the authority won’t have to bear the cost of land, which is about Rs 750 crore. The engineering department is yet to prepare the financial component but sources said the construction cost will be Rs 400-500 crore.

Box:

Minister wrote to Badnore in 2019

In December 2019, Union health minster Dr Harsh Vardhan wrote to UT administrator V P Singh Badnore for building a medical college in the city. The letter reads: “My ministry is implementing a centrally sponsored scheme, namely ‘establishment of new medical colleges attached with existing/referral hospital’. Phase III of the scheme has been approved in August 2019 to build 75 more medical colleges, with preference to aspirational districts. All states and UTs were required to identify the district/referral hospital… for the scheme… and submit proposal along with detailed project report (DPR). The ministry intends to make the college functional by the session 2022-23. Kindly look into the matter personally and arrange to expedite submission of proposal along with DPR.”

65,['10/02/2020'],Kashmir nursery student’s art shares space with MF Hussain,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Chandigarh: A national obsession with big names and VIPs has not spared public displays of Indian art. But a novel art exhibition, Innovative Vibes-II, broke the “monopoly of big names” by allowing a nursery school student of Kashmir, Thyaim Akira, to showcase her painting in a space shared with the works of legends such as MF Hussain, Dhanraj Bhagat, Kishan Khanna and Jatin Das. The authentic works of the masters were largely unknown to the public, were created in Kashmir and held in the private collection of the Gayoor Art Foundation Trust, Kashmir.

As many as 45 artists from Kashmir displayed their paintings, sculptures and photographs at the Artspace Gallery, Mohali. The refreshing content, style and sparks of originality displayed by budding artists and students are reflected in the fact that some of them hail from lesser-known areas of the Valley such as Kulgam, Salaam Charar-e-Sharief, Handwara, Dalwan, Wahpora Budgam, Harwan, Mattan Anantnag, among others. “In contrast to some of our students from urban centres, students from rural areas and mofussil towns display a great eagerness to learn when they come to study at the Institute of Music and Fine Arts, Kashmir University. Kashmir has been a favourite destination for artists across India. In the mid-twentieth century, SH Raza’s frequent sojourns in Kashmir and later Ghulam Rasool Santosh’s idea to host art camps brought reputed modern artists in direct contact with aspiring local artists. These early interactions shaped the modern art practices of local artists,” Naushad Gayoor told the TOI.

Innovative Vibes-II has been curated by Gayoor and Bengaluru-based Jeetin Rangher, the latter having worked for 10 years in Kashmir promoting local artists. Innovative Vibes-II was staged under the aegis of the Gayoor Foundation and Master Sansar Chand Memorable Charitable Trust. “The exhibition allowed Kashmiri artists to merge with those from all over India and from nations such as Tunisia, UK, China and South Africa. There are a total of 141 artists participating in Innovative Vibes-II. Such an exposure to audiences outside Kashmir allows us to promote and nurture fresh artistic talent from the troubled Valley,” Rangher told the TOI.

One of the Kashmiri artists, Azhar Rafiq, painted a man collecting fish from the waters flowing into the Dal Lake. “Recently there was an episode of fish having died in the lake due to a toxic spillover. I also heard that human bodies were dumped in the lake. I merged the two into a painting that symbolises blood flowing in the waters and a man collecting fish in a red bowl that depicts unnatural death,” Rafiq told the TOI.

Mehak Mubeen’s two-part painting has her poetry and a vivid depiction of barbed wire strung with chinar leaves encircling a beautiful Kashmiri girl like an eerie necklace. “I created this painting in the three months following the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5, 2019. Curfew meant we were bound down to our homes. But I do not only depict a life of barbed wires in Kashmir but also my personal struggles and a resilient spirit to rise from the ruins and hopelessness,” said Mubeen.

Innovative Vibes-II is dedicated to the memory of Naushad’s late father, Gayoor Hassan, whose contribution to the development of modern art in Kashmir, both as an artist and academician, is peerless. Hassan took charge as principal of the Institute of Music and Fine Arts when the Valley was witnessing the worst period of violence. It is difficult to imagine a functional art institute in the midst of insurgency. His contribution lies in his unflinching and unwavering determination to run the institute and maintain a prolific artistic engagement.

66,['10/02/2020'],IOCL’s Mathura refinery starts producing 100% BS-VI fuel ahead of deadline,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Agra: Indian Oil Corporation’s Mathura refinery completed the revamp of its all units to produce BS-VI level fuels ahead of the deadline for the roll-out of newer emission norms from April 2020.

The refinery had undertaken projects to upgrade its diesel and gasoline units for bringing down sulphur level by nearly 80%, said Mathura Refinery executive director Arvind Kumar. He added that this would make environment substantially cleaner.

With the commissioning of these facilities, Mathura Refinery is now supplying 100% of its MS (petrol) and HSD (diesel), meeting BS-VI norms, said Kumar. IOCL’s Mathura Refinery has achieved the distinction of becoming first refinery in the country to supply BS-VI compliant fuels, containing less than 10 ppm sulphur with existing units, well ahead of deadline set by the government, he said.

According to officials, Bharat stage emission standards (BSES) are standards instituted by the central government to regulate the emission of air pollutants from motor vehicles. The standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the Central Pollution Control Board under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.

Kumar told media that since October 2010, Bharat Stage (BS) III emission norms have been enforced across the country which allowed sulphur content in MS (petrol) and HSD (diesel) up to 150 parts per million and 350 ppm respectively. He said, emission norms were further tightened in the subsequent step in the form of BS-IV emission norms which were made effective from April 2017. These norms allowed sulphur in MS (petrol) & HSD (diesel) u pto 50 ppm level.

At a time when all the Indian refineries were producing BS-IV compliant fuels, IOCL’s Mathura Refinery was the first refinery to take up the challenge to meet the requirement of supplying NCT region with BS-VI compliant fuels (sulphur less than 10 ppm) with its existing facilities.

Kumar further said that as a major step towards reducing air pollution, in January 2016, Government of India (GOI), through a historic decision announced not only to skip the BS-V emissions norms but also decided to implement BS-VI norms on Pan-India basis wef April 1, 2020. “A deadline was also set for rolling out cleaner (BS-VI compliant) fuel across the National Capital Territory (NCT) by April 18 & National Capital Region (NCR) by April 19,” he added.

Sri Lankan prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa offers prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath temple

VARANASI: Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa offered prayers at the Kashi Vishwanath Temple in Varanasi before heading to pay a visit to Buddhist shrines in Sarnath on Sunday. Rajapaksa’s is on a fiveday visit to India.

Rajapaksa reached Kashi Vishwanath temple and performed the ‘ shodashopchar pujan’ in the sanctum sanctorum as priests chanted Vedic mantras. He then went to the ‘mandap’ of the neighbouring Tarkeshwar Mahadev Temple, where UP tourism minister Neelkanth Tiwari felicitated him. Divisional commissioner Deepak Agrawal and district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma showed the Sri Lanka PM a map of the ongoing Kashi Vishwanath Dham (corridor) project and apprised him about the worldclass facilities which will be on offer for pilgrims once the project is completed.

After spending 40 minutes at the two temples, Rajapaksa reached Kaal Bhairo temple and performed various rituals. After a brief halt at a hotel, the Sri Lankan PM and his team set out for Sarnath. He was greeted by people waving flags of the two countries on the roadside.

Rajapaksa lit a lamp at the Moolgandha Kuti Vihara and performed the circumambulation of the Bodhi Tree, where Gautam Buddha had given his first sermon. He then visited temple of Mahabodhi Society of India, where Buddhist priests blessed him with Buddha’s relics. Bhikshu Medhankar Thero also performed a ‘paritran deshna path’ for him.

In the visitors’ book of Moolgandha Kuti Vihara, Rajapaksa wrote, “I am happy to visit the pilgrimage site of the followers of Lord Buddha. I feel fortunate. I got inner peace.” He also went to Dhamekh Stupa and performed various religious rituals. He also toured the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) museum in Sarnath. ASI officials showed him the ruins excavated from the site between 1835 and 1929.

68,['10/02/2020'],Solar storage tariff spells trouble for coal,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: When solar power tariff dropped to Rs 2.44 per unit for the first time in May 2017, it set a record for cheapest electricity, busted the myth of renewable power being unaffordable and opened a Pandora’s box for conventional power plants by challenging coal’s dominance as the primary source of energy.

In an eerie feeling of deja-vu some 20 months on, the latest auction of storage-based solar project with assured peak-hour supply may have driven another nail into the coffin for coal by setting a world record for cheapest solar storage power — with the added commitment of almost round-the-clock supply costing 8% less than thermal power to break the affordability barrier for storage-based energy solutions. In the latest instance, Hyderabad-based GreenKo won 900MW of the 1,200MW solar storage project auction by SECI Ltd.

In the latest instance, Hyderabad-based GreenKo won 900MW of the 1,200MW solar storage project auction by SECI Ltd, the entity under the renewable energy ministry implementing the Modi government’s solar 175 GW renewable capacity plan. Goldman Sachs-funded ReNew Power bagged 300 MW.

GreenKo quoted a peak tariff of Rs 6.12 per unit and average tariff of Rs 3.89 for 100MW and Rs 3.93 for 800MW. ReNew offered a peak tariff of Rs 6.85 a unit and average tariff of Rs 4.07. A SECI executive said ReNew was opting for battery-storage and GreenKo for pump-storage backup in Andhra Pradesh , Madhya Pradesh , Karnataka and Rajasthan .

SECI will pay peak power at the average of the quoted tariff of the total bids and a trading margin. This works out to an effective peak tariff of Rs 6.37 per unit and off-peak rate of Rs 2.95. The average tariff of both peak and non-peak hours will work out to Rs 4.04, including trading margin.

These compare well with the Rs 4.24 per unit tariff discovered at a recent auction of stressed thermal capacity auctioned for a tenure of three years by PFC and Rs 4.34 in a bidding round conducted by NHPC earlier. In peak hours, discoms pay up to Rs 6.5 to buy power from the open market or peaking sources, mostly gas-fired plants, to meet demand.

“This tender brings storage-based renewable power within reach and allows India to plan giga watt-size projects. The tariffs for storage-based solar power is within touching distance of the average pooled cost of power purchased by various discoms,” a SECI executive said.

Indeed, it is the assured tariff at a reasonably affordable rate that can really spell trouble for coal in the coming days. The auction makes it mandatory for winners to meet six hours of peak demand as per choice of time windows allowed to discoms. This feature of the solar storage project removes a key hurdle — intermittency and ability to supply peaking power — in making solar mainstream.

This provides discoms a financially viable alternative for meeting renewable energy obligation. They can tap solar storage for meeting peak demand, especially in the evening hours, and also fulfil the green commitment.

In addition, solar tariff is levelised for 25 years, while thermal power tariff is for 3-5 years and becomes costlier every time coal prices rise. “This project also has assured supply commitment, including peaking power. These factors give it a huge advantage over conventional power,” the SECI executive said.

Kochi: There are 450 aloe vera saplings here, said an inmate of the district prison dressed as a farmer, as he pointed to the garden in the jail compound.

Farming is now a common task assigned to inmates to help them earn while in prison and as a training module for a vocation they can take up when they are released. However, the district jail has taken the mission a notch higher by making inmates try out different farming methods.

“We will install about 30 beehive boxes on the premises. There is a rubber plantation near the prison so we expect it to facilitate apiculture. Aloe vera plants have already been planted. We had been farming fish like tilapia and nutter. Now, we are planning to farm pearl spot fish,” said K V Jagadeeshan, superintendent of the district prison.

The event on Monday saw the launch of the sale of ready-made clothes made by women inmates, Milma products, beekeeping , aloe vera farming, second phase of fish farming and sale of stationery items made by inmates. Well-wishers donated a refrigerator, five sewing machines, a water purifier, 25 chairs and clothes.

Rishi Raj Singh, head of the prisons department, launched the initiatives.

The event also felicitated Jagadeeshan who received the President’s medal for meritorious service this year. A logo of the band, Correctional Voices, was launched.

paying homage: Ambulance carrying mortal remains of P Parameswaran at RSS Karyalayam in Kochi on Sunday

Kochi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi in two separate tweets condoled the death of RSS ideologue and director of Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram P Parameswaran , who passed away on Saturday. “An institution builder, Parameswaran Ji nurtured eminent institutions such as the Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram, Vivekananda Kendra and others. I am fortunate to have interacted with him many times. He was a towering intellectual. Anguished by his demise. Om Shanti,” the PM tweeted.

In another tweet, Modi said, “Shri P Parameswaran was a proud and dedicated son of Bharat Mata. His was a life devoted to India’s cultural awakening, spiritual regeneration and serving the poorest of the poor. Parameswaran Ji’s thoughts were prolific and his writings were outstanding. He was indomitable!.”

Parameswaran, 93, popularly known as Parameswarji, was undergoing treatment at an ayurvedic hospital at Ottappalam. Death came while he was at the house of K Sasikumar, secretary of Nila Seva Samithi, around midnight. His body was kept at the RSS state karyalaya in Kochi from 6am to 4pm for the public to pay homage. Later, the body was taken to Thiruvananthapuram where his mortal remains will be kept at Samskrithi Bhavan Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram for public to pay last respects. Funeral will be held at his home in Muhamma in Alappuzha on Monday afternoon.

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan in his condolence tweet said, “Deeply grieved by the sad demise of P Parameswar-Ji, Director, Bharatiya Vichara Kendram. With endearing politeness and accomplished scholarship, he inspired society through insightful speeches and writings on Indian thought. My heartfelt condolences.”

“Parameswaran was a philosopher who dedicated his life to the ideology he believed in,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in his condolence message.

BJP leaders, including P K Krishnadas, Congress leader K V Thomas, CPI Rajya Sabha member Binoy Viswam, Vypeen MLA S Sarma and others paid homage to Parameswaran.

VIA power expert RB Goenka told TOI that the present tariff for such industries was Rs6.30 per unit. “It will go up to Rs8.98 per unit if MERC accepts MSEDCL’s petition. This translates into a hike of 42.55%,” he said.

VIA has objected to several aspects of MSEDCL’s petition. One of them is the proposal to introduce KVAH billing. Goenka pointed out that despite strong opposition from consumers, MSEDCL wants to introduce this type of billing without providing any reason. “MSEDCL purchases power in kWh but wants to bill its consumer on KVAH basis. This makes no sense,” he said.

The Association has objected to the methodology of calculation of fuel adjustment cost (FAC). It has demanded that MSEDCL levy FAC on the basis of the extra cost incurred that month and not pertaining to three months ago. This upsets the economics of industries.

MSEDCL has proposed sharp hike in demand charges. VIA has pointed out that this will sharply increase the tariff of industries working in one or two shifts. Ideally, MSEDCL should reduce fixed cost component instead of increasing it. A consumer should be billed only for the power he consumes.

MSEDCL’s proposal to levy astronomical grid support charge (GSC) on solar rooftop consumers has been strongly opposed. VIA has pointed out that if proposed GSC rates are levied solar power will become costlier than MSEDCL power. This is against the central government’s policy of promoting renewable energy.

VIA pointed out that such consumers are captive generators, who produce power for their own consumption and hence cross subsidy surcharge (CSS) can’t be levied on them. MSEDCL has also not taken into account the renewal purchase obligation (RPO) benefit due to solar rooftop.

Goenka has calculated that if all norms are followed GSC for residential consumers having consumption above 500 units should be 57 paise per unit instead of the proposed Rs8.33 per unit.

On schedule of charges, VIA has contended that MSEDCL wants to recover the cost of infrastructure under the name of premium service. This is nothing but service line charge (SLC), which was abolished by MERC many years ago.

The Association pointed out that only the residential, commercial and industrial (RCI) consumers of MSEDCL bear the burden of supplying cheap power to farmers. This should not be the case and consumers of other licensees like BEST, BSES and Tata should also bear the burden. This can be possible if a separate distribution company is created for supplying farmers and its deficit is loaded on all licensees in the state.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra offers prayers at Ravidas temple in Varanasi’s Seer Gowardhanpur area on... Read More

VARANASI: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the teachings of 14th century saint Ravidas and his dream of a society without any discrimination on basis of caste and religion are most relevant and needed today when hatred and violence are being fanned.

Attending the 643rd birth anniversary celebration of Sant Ravidas at his birthplace in Seer Gowardhanpur area on Sunday afternoon, Priyanka utilised the opportunity to target the government without making a mention.

“Sant Ravidas dreamt of a society where everyone is equal and honoured. Our Constitution is also based on the same philosophy and this should be the practice in country. No differences should be created on religion or caste basis,” she said in her brief address.

“Sant Ravidas taught that Ram and Rahim are not different. We all are creation of one god and hence there should be no difference on basis of caste and creed. He dreamt of a place like Begumpura where everyone is honoured and live without any discrimination,” she said adding that his teachings should be spread in society today when hatred and violence are being fanned.

Earlier, Priyanka reached Ravidas temple amid tight security and was felicitated by Mahant Sant Niranjan Das on the dais. She garlanded the statue of Sant Ravidas at his birthplace and then visited main lobby of the temple. She also joined seers and dignitaries for ‘prasad’ at the langar (community kitchen) and left for airport after spending an hour at the temple. The Seer Gowardhanpur area was flooded with followers of Sant Ravidas.

Earlier, Priyanka was accorded a warm welcome by UP Congress president Ajay Singh Lallu, former minister Ajay Rai, party’s city unit chief Raghvendra Chaubey at LBS International airport.

The temple of Sant Ravidas has been attracting many politicians. In 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal attended Ravidas Jayanti celebrations.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also visited the temple in November 2011. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati had addressed a huge gathering on Ravidas Jayanti in 2008 in the capacity of chief minister.

Sant Ravidas, born in Varanasi, was a leading figure of the Bhakti Movement and is revered in Buddhism, Sikhism and Hinduism. He left behind a great legacy and a 21st century cult called Ravidassia follows his teachings.

75,['10/02/2020'],"BJP MLA demands separate Vindhya state, threatens stir","This story is from February 10, 2020

Bhopal: Controversial BJP legislator Narayan Tripathi has on Sunday advocated for a separate Vindhya state, a demand pending since 1956, alleging poor development in the region. The MLA represents Maihar assembly constituency.

Tripathi, had kicked a political storm by defying BJP diktat and voted in favour of Kamal Nath led-Congress government in the Madhya Pradesh assembly during an amendment bill and shocked BJP leaders by speaking out against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The BJP legislator has urged that Congress government should moot a proposal for statehood to Vindhya region in the budget session of the state assembly scheduled next month and forward the same to the Centre.

Meanwhile, minister Kamleshwar Patel rejected the demand, saying Vindhya region has witnessed a significant development during the Congress rule.

“I have written letters to Prime Minister, chief minister and all public representatives of Vindhya region to take up the proposal for a separate Vindhya state. We will soon launch an agitation from Vindhya to Bhopal to press for our demand. We will talk to all leaders to raise above party politics and support this move,” said Tripathi on Sunday.

The BJP MLA who had been praising chief minister Kamal Nath for his commitment towards public, attended a meeting of Vindhya Mahotsava preparations here, along with public relations minister PC Sharma, panchayat minister Kamleshwar Patel, former deputy speaker Rajendra Singh and BJP MLA Vishwas Sarang among others.

Justifying the statehood demand, Tripathi said, ""Those who support the formation of a new Vindhya state, public will support them. Who do not support the demand, public will boycott them. After the formation of Madhya Pradesh, Vindhya region has remained undeveloped. ""

The BJP has however, distanced itself from Tripathi's statement. Sources said BJP leadership is surprised as Tripathi did not discuss the issue of dividing MP on the party forum before raising it in public. Former minister and MLA Vishwas Sarang said, ""Demand for a separate Vindhya state is an old issue. In Congress rule, Vindhya has been left undeveloped. The ministers of Vindhya region should come clear on these allegations.""

Thiruvananthapuram: The road to Samskrithi Bhavan in GPO Lane, where one of the noted institutions ‘ Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram ’ established by veteran RSS pracharak P Parameswaran functions, wore a deserted look on Sunday morning. Many representatives of the institute had left for Palakkad after they came to know about the demise of Parameswaran and a few who left behind were busy with preparations to accord a final reception to their leader at the institution, which he established in 1982.

Friends and followers of Parameswaran recollected their association him. “Even during his last days, he was very much active in the programmes of Vichara Kendram. He had visited the institution in January and had recently participated in a convention held in Kannur, after which he fell ill. I started associating with Parameswarji after I joined the city unit of Vichara Kendram. It is his simple yet powerful words that inspired everyone. An example for his dedication towards a cause would be the Bhagavad Gita campaign, through which he wanted to spread the message of Gita to the masses,” said Rajan Pillai, treasurer of Vichara Kendram.

His demise came when Parameswaran, who frequently travelled to various branches of Vichara Kendram, was scheduled to visit the centre in the city on February 14.

K C Ajayakumar, writer and translator, who has a 30-year association with Vichara Kendram, became an active member in 2012 after he met Parameswaran. “Parameswaranji had once asked me to translate a speech by Mohan Bhagwat. Not only in public conventions, even during causal talks, he discussed only social issues. Parameswaranji had an extensive plan for research work at Vichara Kendram, which he wanted to upgrade as an international institute of research,” said Ajayakumar, who is the state committee member of Vichara Kendram.

A recipient of the Padma Vibhushan award, Parameswaran has over 20 books ranging from philosophy, essays and poems to his credit.

Pointing at the collection of books authored by Parameswaran, BVK representative Ajayykumar R S recalled Parameswaran’s creative talent to pen poems at any moment of inspiration. “I had travelled with Parameswaranji for around four years. I remember one day when we were going for a morning walk, after observing the place, Parameswaranji wrote a poem then and there. He was always open to our suggestions like changing some words in his poems while we were editing his works. It is his poems that we sing at the Vichara Kendram units every day,” said Ajayykumar.

Chandrashekhar Azad

VARANASI: Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad , aka Ravan , on Sunday said he would soon launch a massive agitation in Uttar Pradesh against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“No court has barred me from holding agitation. In a democratic set-up, I am free to go anywhere I want. I am frequenting Shaheen Bagh (in Delhi) and Bhim Army volunteers are there for the security of women protesters,” Azad, who was in Seer Gowardhanpur to attend Ravidas Jayanti celebrations, said.

Talking to reporters after offering obeisance at the temple, he said, “We are ready to launch a massive agitation against CAA and NRC in UP. The chief minister who threatens to speak not with words, but bullets, must know that those sworn to save the Constitution are not afraid of bullets.”

Azad said he wished for a government of ‘Bahujans’ in the state. “I promise you that in 2022, the state will get a CM from Bahujan society,” he said.

On the purpose of his visit, he said it was unfair to say that he had come to take political mileage. “Those thinking that way are insulting over 30 crore followers of Sant Ravidas. I have come to seek blessings of Sant Ravidas for peace, prosperity and harmony in the country,” he added.

Nagpur: City police chief BK Upadhyay has created a special team under Senior PI Satyavan Mane to probe the firing on mayor Sandip Joshi on December 17, 2019. Mane was earlier leading the probe as the in-charge of Unit 4 of crime branch.

The firing on Joshi, while on way back home in his official car after attending his anniversary party, has become a major challenge for the cops. The incident, which created ripples, had left the city police red-faced during the winter assembly session. Despite several teams being pressed into action, the probe did not move further.

Around a fortnight ago, Upadhyay shifted the responsibility of Unit 4 from Mane and handed it over to Senior PI Ashok Meshram. Mane was given the sole responsibility of probing the firing on Joshi. He is conducting the probe under the supervision of DCP, detection, Gajanan Rajmane.

Mane has been reporting the progress of the case to top cops, Upadhyay and Joint CP Ravindra Kadam, on a regular basis. Apart from city, the special teams have so far visited other states too in connection with the probe. Special cyber cops, under experts, have also been working on the case to support Mane and his special team.

Devotees offer prayers on Magh Purnima on the Magh Mela ground on Sunday

Allahabad: For Madhukar and his wife Archana, the commute from Magh Mela ground to their home in Pratapgarh was a journey from one home to another. The couple were among the hundreds of kalpwasis who headed back home on Sunday after living frugally along the banks of Ganga on the Magh Mela ground for a month.

“It’s like leaving one home for another. We met many devotees here and we got along just like a family. We are taking back soil from the Ganga’s banks and intend to return next year too,” said Madhukar, who is in his 40s.

As per tradition, kalpwasis give up comforts to lead an austere lifestyle for a month and camp along the banks of Ganga to gain salvation. Their period of penance comes to an end with the Hindu month of Magh. Kalpwasis, who had put up tents on Kali Marg, said they are taking back cheerful memories and stories to share with their family members.

One of the kalpwasis Ghanshyam (35) touched the feet of his elderly neighbour Dashrath before leaving the Magh Mela ground. “I assured him that we will meet again during next year’s Magh Mela. We didn’t just share our joys and problems, but also sat together to perform rituals and attended religious discourses. As we spent more time together, we started treated each other as extended family.”

“In the past one month, we developed special bonds with other devotees, despite the fact that they belonged to different districts and states,” said Mamta, a kalpwasi from Mirzapur.

“Most of us had tears in our eyes while leaving the Magh Mela ground,’ she added. The women among the kalpwasis claimed that spending month together makes people come closer, irrespective of age and class.

“When the weather was cold, we used to take care of each other. If a devotee fell ill, one of us would be tending to him/her round the clock,” said another kalpwasi.

83,['10/02/2020'],Andhra Pradesh government suspends DGP rank officer on charges of treason,"This story is from February 10, 2020

AB Venkateswara Rao

VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh government suspended former chief of Intelligence AB Venkateswara Rao on charges of treason and misconduct while discharging his duties.

Authorities said the DGP-rank officer colluded with a foreign defence manufacturer by disclosing security protocols and put national security and police personnel at risk by trying to procure sub-standard equipment from Israel in a multi-crore contract for a firm owned by his son in 2017. Rao, in his defence said the allegations were baseless. “I am exploring all legal options and soon people would know the truth,” he said.

AP chief secretary Nilam Sawhney issued orders placing Rao under suspension pending an inquiry into the allegations. The orders came after DGP Gautam Sawang submitted a letter with details of preliminary inquiry that established prima facie evidence against Rao.

He has also been barred from leaving Vijayawada without permission.

According to government sources, Rao colluded with M/s RT Inflatables Private Limited, an Israeli defence equipment manufacturer, to illegally award critical intelligence and surveillance contract to M/s Akasam Advanced Systems Private Limited owned by his son Chetan Sai Krishna. Akasam Advanced Systems was the primary bidder on behalf of RT Inflatables in the contract that was worth Rs 25 crore.

“This is grave misconduct and irregularities were wilfully committed by Rao resulting out of a conscious and premeditated act of treason towards the state and nation,” a source in the government said.

Sources in the police department told TOI that follow-up action would be initiated in accordance with law.

“In view of the gravity of the case, it is yet to be decided whether the case will be handled by the state police or it would be transferred to a central agency. The decision will be taken after consulting with home and defence ministry, DGCA and other central government agencies,” the source added.

A senior cop probing the case said disciplinary action would also be taken according to All India Service (AIS) rules as Rao is alleged to have disclosed intelligence protocols and procedures of police to a foreign defence manufacturing firm without acquiring necessary permissions.

It has been alleged that Rao ignored the clarification sought by the then additional director general of police (ADGP) for operations Nalin Prabhat over technical, financial, licensing and procedural aspects.

As the intelligence protocols are standard throughout the police force in the country, the actions of Rao were a direct threat to national security, a source said.

Rao faced severe criticism from the then opposition YSRC and present ruling party for snooping on their functionaries and helping the then ruling TDP by going out of the way. They have also alleged that Rao played a key role in horse-trading of YSRC MLAs during the TDP regime. As many as 23 YSRC MLAs switched loyalties and Rao was in the middle of the political controversy.

85,['10/02/2020'],AB Venkateswara Rao: Andhra Pradesh government suspends DGP rank officer on charges of treason,"This story is from February 10, 2020

AB Venkateswara Rao

VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh government suspended former chief of Intelligence AB Venkateswara Rao on charges of treason and misconduct while discharging his duties.

Authorities said the DGP-rank officer colluded with a foreign defence manufacturer by disclosing security protocols and put national security and police personnel at risk by trying to procure sub-standard equipment from Israel in a multi-crore contract for a firm owned by his son in 2017. Rao, in his defence said the allegations were baseless. “I am exploring all legal options and soon people would know the truth,” he said.

AP chief secretary Nilam Sawhney issued orders placing Rao under suspension pending an inquiry into the allegations. The orders came after DGP Gautam Sawang submitted a letter with details of preliminary inquiry that established prima facie evidence against Rao.

He has also been barred from leaving Vijayawada without permission.

According to government sources, Rao colluded with M/s RT Inflatables Private Limited, an Israeli defence equipment manufacturer, to illegally award critical intelligence and surveillance contract to M/s Akasam Advanced Systems Private Limited owned by his son Chetan Sai Krishna. Akasam Advanced Systems was the primary bidder on behalf of RT Inflatables in the contract that was worth Rs 25 crore.

“This is grave misconduct and irregularities were wilfully committed by Rao resulting out of a conscious and premeditated act of treason towards the state and nation,” a source in the government said.

Sources in the police department told TOI that follow-up action would be initiated in accordance with law.

“In view of the gravity of the case, it is yet to be decided whether the case will be handled by the state police or it would be transferred to a central agency. The decision will be taken after consulting with home and defence ministry, DGCA and other central government agencies,” the source added.

A senior cop probing the case said disciplinary action would also be taken according to All India Service (AIS) rules as Rao is alleged to have disclosed intelligence protocols and procedures of police to a foreign defence manufacturing firm without acquiring necessary permissions.

It has been alleged that Rao ignored the clarification sought by the then additional director general of police (ADGP) for operations Nalin Prabhat over technical, financial, licensing and procedural aspects.

As the intelligence protocols are standard throughout the police force in the country, the actions of Rao were a direct threat to national security, a source said.

Rao faced severe criticism from the then opposition YSRC and present ruling party for snooping on their functionaries and helping the then ruling TDP by going out of the way. They have also alleged that Rao played a key role in horse-trading of YSRC MLAs during the TDP regime. As many as 23 YSRC MLAs switched loyalties and Rao was in the middle of the political controversy.

86,['10/02/2020'],"15 inmates of hostel for socially backward extort funds from food contractor, go on jaunt to hill stations","This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: Around 15 students belonging to the socially backward categories are under investigation by the state social welfare department for taking around Rs85,000 from their hostel mess contractor and spending it on vacation in hill stations of Kullu, Manali besides undertaking expeditions such as river rafting in January.

Speaking to TOI, the students said two different issues — food quality complaint and the tour — are being clubbed to malign them while their tour was a lifetime opportunity to seek inspiration and learn new things which they may not be able to afford for years. “Our family income is below Rs40,000 per annum. None of us would be able to afford to visit these places. Our aim is to see Indian culture, landscape and people from whom we can draw inspiration,” said the inmate who arranged the tour.

A law student living at the hostel admitted that the picnic was uncalled for but it has been a trend at all such hostels. “This is a much-needed break after exams. We don’t get money for tour directly from the government so this is a mutual agreement between the warden, contractor and students,” he said.

Students alleged the contractor is conspiring now when they complained of poor quality and contaminated food being served them. “We never suspected he would use the letter he sought and the cheques in such a manner,” they said.

The mess contractor M/s Tiger Saoji Caterers complained among several other issues about money being frequently demanded by inmates on some or other pretext. An inquiry panel was set up by the social justice and special assistance department after over 100 students from its Manish Nagar hostel staged a protest demanding removal of the contractor on January 31.

Those on-tour had posted their photographs enjoying in picturque destinations on social media which led to discontent among others who started demanding money from the contractor and agitated when he refused.

The proprietor in his submission before the inquiry panel stated that the students had made a written application seeking the cash for which they were ready to forego non-veg food from January 4 to January 25.

In their letter dated December 24 last year, all the inmates had asked the mess contractor to hand them over Rs135 per student for a period of 21 days so that they could fund their tour after winter exams. The government allocates a monthly Rs4,800 per socially backward student towards mess expenses in addition to a monthly Rs800 stipend.

Propritier Prashant Irkhade said he incurs around Rs12,000 to Rs15,000 on one time non-veg meal. He issued a sum of Rs85,000 vide two cheques that was saved on chicken and mutton served on Wednesdays and Sundays, respectively. Irkhade attached his bank account statement showing the name of student who withdrew it on January 1 and 10. The tour commenced from January 11 for next seven days.

The student said the inmate who coordinated the tour furnished all the expenditures and bills after returning before the hostel committee. The same inmate had withdrawn the Rs85,000.

Contrary to Irkhade’s complaint, the law student said 35 students had preferred the tour to Kullu, Manali and Delhi. “Rest didn’t go as we were busy with further studies,” he said.

The tour coordinator inmate said 50% of the expenses were borne by the students.

The panel is likely to submit its report to the divisional commissioner of the department Siddharth Gaikwad this week.

Aurangabad: Two tigers from the Siddharth Garden Zoo, which is run by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), will be sent to Mumbai’s Veer Mata Jijabai Bhosale Zoo on Tuesday.

In return, the AMC zoo will get a pair of cheetahs, zoo director B S Naikwade said. After tigeress Samruddhi gave birth to four cubs in April, the total number of tigers in the Siddharth Garden Zoo had gone up to 12.

However, according to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), a maximum of nine tigers can be kept at the zoo at a time. Earlier, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had asked for two tigers from the AMC. Solapur had also sought tigers from it.

The proposal to send the tigers to the Mumbai zoo was placed before the AMC general body and former municipal commissioner had sent two AMC officials to check whether the BMC zoo in Mumbai had adequate infrastructure to house the big cats. All the necessary background work was completed in January.

Naikwade said the AMC has received the permission from the forest department to transport the tigers to Mumbai. The tigers — named Veer and Karishma — are aged 4 and 6 respectively. The pair were born in the Siddharth Garden Zoo. The zoo director stated that the AMC will receive a pair of cheetahs, but the process may take some time.

The earlier plan to bring colourful birds from the Mumbai zoo may also take time, he added. The AMC is planning to bring 10 colourful exotic birds from Mumbai’s zoo. However, it has not yet received the approval from the CZA.

88,['10/02/2020'],Workers seek easing of welfare board registry rules,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Aurangabad: The state-level body of building workers will hold a protest on Monday at the divisional commissionerate to push for their demands which include relaxing terms and conditions for online registration for the workers welfare board.

Maharashtra Rajya Sanyukt Kamgar Mahasangh has called for the protest, which will beheld at 10am. Ganesh Bhonsle, the president of the workers' body said that the criteria for one to register as a construction worker in Maharashtra Building & Other Construction Workers Welfare Board is too stringent. The state government had formed the board in 2011 as per the Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers (Employment Regulation and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2007.

According to the 2011 Census, the population of construction workers in the state are expected to be 17.50 lakh. The welfare board aims to provide improved service for the workers and seeks benefits under government schemes.

“For example, the workers have to produce a certificate to show they have worked for a particular contractor for 10 days and the contractor has to be registered with the board. The contractor is not liable to give the workers a certificate nor do the workers have a choice. This condition is unfair,” Bhonsle said.

The workers’ body demands the removal of mandatory ration card condition. They said that many of them do not have a ration card or do not have it updated. There is a one-time password that is delivered on the registered mobile number during the registration process but since many people have changed their mobile numbers, they cannot complete the registration.

The workers’ body has also said as 80% of the workers are illiterate, they are unable to handle the online system. In addition, to that the workers have to register afresh as the board office has been shifted from the previous location.

89,['10/02/2020'],How Shaheen Bagh is teaching its children,"This story is from February 10, 2020

New Delhi: Kehkeshan Riyaz helps a five-year-old hold a crayon on a sheet of paper, one among about 40 who come to a new ‘ school ’ at the Shaheen Bagh protest site — a space set aside for children of protesters, adding to the library that was started on January 17 near the main tent.

As the women’s resistance to the revised citizenship law completes 57 days at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, the presence of children has invited both criticism and acclaim. However, women at the protest are at peace when their children are with them. With the new ‘school’, women are confident children will not be exposed to negativity. Here, children sing, play, read books, wait for storytelling sessions, draw — all activities coordinated by mothers and volunteers.

Joan, a teacher, came to the capital from Bengaluru about two weeks ago and helped set up the ‘school’ for the youngest kids who come with their mothers from poorer neighbourhoods. “We teach poems, songs, tables and sounds. Even lessons about sharing and hygeine are important,” she said. Razia Shaheen, who also helps manage it, said mothers sign a register when they drop their kids and sign again when they collect them at 4pm, when the ‘school’ closes.

A new worry is a plea in court to ban children from the site. Earlier, the national child rights body NCPCR had cautioned against “trauma” to children at the site, throwing mothers in a dilemma. Some left their children home against instincts, but soon changed their mind.

“I came home one day to hear my twins chanting a hateful slogan, asking me what gaddar means. I know what taleem (education) I want to impart to them instead of hate,” said Riyaz.

This taleem also caught the attention of educationist Poonam Batra from Delhi University’s department of education. “A Class IV student at the site informed me that the Constituent assembly of India went on for 2 years, 11 months and 17 days. The kids’ curiosity and questions show they’re far more engaged wanting to know about the Constitution than a child would usually be,” said Batra.

The makeshift library called Read for Revolution was set up by Usama Zakir, a research scholar at Jamia. Alina, 9, visits it every day after school and draws whatever she likes, which usually involves a tricolour. A 13-year-old visits for the stories. Zakir said it's important to give children activities they enjoy, adding that drawing and storytelling resonate, the national flag a top choice to draw. “Questions are being asked about the presence of children at the sit-in. So, we started the library to provide a safe space,” Zakir said.

On a discussion about children in the resistance, Dr Amit Sen, a child psychiatrist said that children would likely feel the mothers’ anxiety about the protest as they can sense discord. “But what can be a safer place for a child than by the mother’s side, especially when the resistance is a nurturing space,” said Farah Faruqui, faculty at Jamia Millia Islamia. Joan added the ‘school’ helps ease any anxiety children may feel with police around.

On NCPCR’s earlier caution, its former chairperson Shanta Sinha said children also have a right to be heard, which is the core of all child rights. “The commission should have first listened to the children. Yet, the body acted on a mere complaint without even visiting the site,” she said.

Sinha also refers to police questioning 85 children in a Karnataka school five times over nine days. “In both places, children are expressing themselves. In one, it is misunderstood as trauma, while in Bidar, the situation traumatised the children,” she said.

91,['10/02/2020'],Tankers stop supply to ‘no pipeline’ areas over dues,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Aurangabad: The tanker service provided by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) to areas without piped water supply has been shut for the past four days because of non-payment of dues to the operators.

Residents of Jai Bhawani Nagar, Mukundwadi, Chikalthana, Satara, Deolai, Harsul, Jatwada and certain areas in Padegaon that are in AMC jurisdiction are still not linked to a water pipeline. Similarly, many other areas have been waiting for water from the Jayakwadi reservoir for many years now. These are the neighbourhoods that the AMC supplies water to using tankers. The vehicles are hired via a contractor.

A set of 20 families pool the money required for an AMC tanker in their lane. Each family pays Rs 1,100 (in advance) for three months. Tankers supply about 200 litres of water to each family on alternate days. Sometimes, the supply gap increases by more than a day.

Sarika Samendre, a resident of Vishanti Nagar, said there has been no supply for the past four days. “Our calls to the AMC staff have not helped. We earn a daily wage. We cannot afford to skip a day of work to fetch water,” she said.

When asked, the tanker contractor said because of outstanding dues of Rs 80-90 lakh, the fuel pump is not allowing credit. “The AMC has to pay us Rs 3.7 crore, which has been pending for the past seven months,” the contractor said. The AMC has outsourced 80 tankers for its supply service.

Incidentally, the AMC had recently recorded a healthy tax recovery. So its delay in payments to the tanker operator is questionable. According to Rahul Ingle, a resident of Shahar Parivartan Aghadi, nearly 2.5 lakh people rely on the tanker service for water.

“The AMC is charging these people, who are mostly daily wage workers, higher charges compared to the tap water supply. The AMC charges Rs 4,400 annually for the tanker supply while the water tax for a pipeline supply is Rs 4,050. The municipal commissioner should ensure these marginalised people do not suffer because of administrative apathy,” Ingle said.

When asked, Raju Sandha, who heads the waterworks department of the AMC, said all outstanding dues to the tanker operators will be cleared soon. “The tanker service will begin in two days,” he said.

A NGT-appointed panel said an independent agency should test the water quality

NEW DELHI: Allay public fear regarding the quality and odour of the treated water, a National Green Tribunal-appointed expert panel has told Delhi Jal Board (DJB).

Mentioning this in a report submitted to the tribunal on Wednesday, the Yamuna monitoring committee has pointed out that “the bad odour from the treated waste water, high mineral content and presence of faecal coliforms, which are harmful to plant growth and human health, become the bone of contention”. Asking DJB to address public fear properly through the district magistrates and the municipal corporations, which are in charge of conservancy, the panel said a direction was essential as “this becomes no man’s land and results in the park-owning agencies refusing to use the water”.

The panel said an independent agency should test the water quality, which would remove public resistance and end the disputes about the quality of water being supplied to the parks.

The report stressed on installation of de-centralised modular sewage treatment plants near parks and gardens, as has been done by South Delhi Municipal Corporation in Vasant Kunj and a few other areas.

Aurangabad: A survey carried out in four districts of Marathwada by five non-government organinsations (NGOs) found that 26.7% of the women participants experienced domestic violence in the last 12 months.

As many as 2,360 women in the age group of 13 to 49 from 100 villages in Beed, Hingoli, Latur and Osmanabad districts participated in the survey.

It also came to the fore that only 9.2% women were aware of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. And few were aware of the role of the court and the protection officer in helping rehabilitation of the victim.

Switzerland-based NGO Swissaid facilitated the survey with the help of four local NGOs — Ugam Sanstha (Hingoli), Gramin Mahila Vikas Sanstha (Deoni-Nagpur), Manavlok Sanstha (Ambajogai) and Halo Medical Foundation (HMF) (Osmanabad).

The result of the survey was shared by during a programme held at Mahatma Gandhi Mission (MGM). According to Swissaid, the study collected baseline information for an intervention to address domestic violence experienced by women.

Kashinath Ahinkari, president of HMF, in his introductory speech said that for gender equality in society men need to get rid of their ego. The survey result was presented by HMF trustee Kranti Rayamane and researcher Gopal Kulkarni.

As per the findings, 38.3% women said they have experienced domestic violence at least once. Of this, 33.9% encountered physical violence, 24.1% faced emotional violence and 12.2% faced sexual violence.

The survey defines emotional violence as being insulted or made to feel bad about oneself, being belittled in front of others or being intimidated for a purpose.

Early marriage, low literacy, poor economic status, marginalised social status, substance addiction, polygamy and financial or health problems emerged as the key factors that were associated with domestic violence.

Secunderabad: Barely 30 mm of rainfall on Saturday evening reinvigorated the stench originating from Jawaharnagar dumpyard. Within an hour after the rainfall, the stench engulfed areas up to Sainikpuri, forcing residents to keep their doors and windows shut.

Several areas of the northern-eastern corridors of the city received light rainfall during the weekend. The stench from the dumping yard worsened after the rainfall with residents living in areas within 10 kms of radius such as Malkajgiri, Yapral, Kapra among others gagging during night time.

“While rainfall brought relief from dry and hot weather conditions, we could not enjoy the pleasant weather due to the acrid stench that emanates from the dumping yard,” said Geeta Kalukuri, a resident of Chandrapuri Colony in Kapra.

Residents claim that while the stench from Jawaharnagar dump yard has reduced substantially in the last few weeks following Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s ( GHMC ) capping work, it only worsens after a brief spell of rainfall. With the India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad forecasting rainfall to continue for the next few days, residents are worried over the unbearable stench that is likely to engulfs areas surrounding the dumpyard .

“Even two centimetres of rainfall is enough for the stench to engulf areas up to 10 kms of radius. It’s high time the GHMC finds a permanent solution to this issue for which residents have been fighting and protesting for the last one decade,” said T Raghunath, a resident of Malkajgiri.

The city generates close to 7,000 metric tons of waste every day which is transported to Jawaharnagar, that has been the only dumpyard for years. However, the dumpyard can only process 5,500 metric tons a day with excess garbage being stacked up.

It may be noted that the a petition by aggrieved residents of Sainikpuri, Kapra and other nearby areas seeking solution on Jawaharnagar dumping yard issue is pending in the High Court.

Aurangabad: A room where an individual becomes taller as well as shorter within a moment and anti-gravity room that defies the laws of physics are some of the key attractions one can enjoy at the illusion museum that has been set up at the APJ Abdul Kalam Astrospace Science Centre here.

The first-of-its-kind science lab in the country has around 21 different entities that offer a peek into the fascinating world of illusions.

Centre director Shriniwas Aundhkar said there are illusion museums built at 16 places in the world.

“Illusion can be defined as the perception that occurs when a sensory stimulus is present, but is incorrectly perceived and misinterpreted by the brain. The scientific principle of illusion can be aptly used for entertainment and educative purposes,” he said.

Ames room, where a person walking back or forth either grows or shrinks due to illusions and it seem like a person’s head is on a platter, as the body is hidden

Mirrors have also been used to bring out the illusion. Such exhibits include ‘anti-gravity mirror’ which feels like flying or swimming through the air and crawling on the wall like a lizard, ‘self-centred mirror’ which involves an arrangement of 28 vertical panes of the mirror provides reflection on 14 panes and ‘swap mirror’ which creates a false impression of different movement of two halves of the human body.

Rotating room gives a perception of a tilt of almost 90 degrees. The vortex tunnel in motion makes it really difficult to take a step forward through a rotating cylinder on a stable and flat surface. It also has pyramids, cubes and paintings which offer different illusions along with a ‘shadow room’ based on the spectrum principle of light.

The museum has been developed as a part of ‘Mamacha Gaon’, a dream project by Ankushrao Kadam, secretary of Mahatman Gandhi Mission (MGM) which is the parent body of APJ Abdul Kalam Astrospace Science Centre. Aundhkar, centre coordinator Dhanashree Kasar – Akkar and the construction department at MGM has been credited for the successful experiment of the illusion lab. It has open to all on weekdays except Monday during office hours.

IIT-Kanpur

KANPUR: IIT-Kanpur and TurboTech Precision Engineering Private Limited (TurboTech), an aerospace and defence company entered into an MoU at DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow on Saturday.

A team of researchers from IIT-Kanpur, including Prof Santanu De as principal investigator and Prof Shantanu Bhattacharya as one of the co-investigators, is developing an upscaled version of Micro Gas Turbine (MGT), which is envisaged to fuel the automotive and aerospace sectors in addition to the power generation.

While IIT-Kanpur will work on designing the sub-sections of the projects, TurboTech will be responsible for physical realisation of the designs and a complete assembly of the envisioned technology.

Group captain and chief operations officer Prakash Angadi VSM (Retd) signed the MoU on behalf of TurboTech. The project will be financially supported through a project under the IMPRINT scheme of the ministry of human resources development (MHRD) and the ministry of power, said IIT-Kanpur’s media cell.

According to IIT-K , Micro gas turbine (MGT) is a leap towards decentralisation of power generation and distribution strategy, which is an important need for the current power scenario. Also, it is a step towards eco-friendly, green energy production.

98,['10/02/2020'],Centre to generate whole-genome sequences of selected bird species,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Aurangabad: The environment, forest and climate change ministry has decided to generate the whole-genome sequences of selected bird species in India.

Some of the birds categorized under rare, endangered and threatened (RET) species will be covered under the initiative, which is a part of the draft visionary perspective plan (VPP) for 2020-2030. Around 270 species (21%) of Indian avifauna fall under the ‘rare’ category and these include raptors, pheasants, bustards, hornbills, cranes, storks and others — together called RET bird species.

The draft also mentions the development of a state-of-the-art genome resource banking facility at the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History for cryobanking biomaterial from RET species as a long-term measure.

Cryobanking — the process of storing cells, tissues or organs at very low/freezing temperatures — is considered an important conservation tool. Of the 1,317 bird species recorded in India, 72 are endemic. As per an assessment of the International Union for Conservation of Nature 2018, 100 Indian species are classified as ‘threatened’, of which 17 are ‘critically endangered’, 20 are ‘endangered’ and 63 are ‘vulnerable’.

The draft calls for identifying and prioritising RET species that need conservation intervention and asks for conducting population, habitat and threat assessments. The environment ministry said birds perform various ecosystem services such as control of insect pests in agriculture and forestry, rodent control, pollination, seed dispersal, forest regeneration, scavenging services etc.

The VPP has envisaged 15 major programmes and various thrust areas for implementation over the next 10years. These are to be implemented over short-term (2020-2024), medium-term (2024-2027) and long-term (2027-2030) periods and extended beyond 2030 based on the evaluation.

Environmentalist Kishor Pathak, talking about the draft, said: “The document is very well-drafted and takes care of challenges encountered in conservation of varied and rich bird population in India. We hope all words get translated into action and render tangible benefits to birds.”

There are 870 protected areas (national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, community reserves and conservation reserves) in India, many with avian diversity; 554 sites have also been designated as “important bird and biodiversity areas (IBAs)” of which 219 are outside the protected areas network and under anthropogenic pressure. There are 2,01,503 wetlands (above 2.25 hectare) in the country, most of which are under stress due to urbanization, agricultural runoffs which require specific management plans, VPP says while underling the need of conservation.

NEW DELHI: An unemployed man allegedly killed his six-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter at their residence in northwest Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh on Sunday. The accused, identified as Madhur Malaani (44), then jumped to his death in front of a metro train at Haiderpur Badli Mor station.

The cops said, prima facie, it appeared that the man was depressed.

According to police, they received a call around 7pm on Sunday from the mother of the kids, informing them about the murders. The deceased were identified as Siransh and Sumiksha.

While Sumiksha’s body — found on the bed — had froth coming out of her mouth and blood near her face, Siransh’s body was found in another room.

Malaani’s wife, Rupali, told the cops that she had left home around 3.30pm for some work. “Both the children were alone with their father,” she said. When Rupali returned, she found the house locked. After knocking on the door and receiving no response, she asked the house owner to provide her the spare keys and opened the door.

Rupali told police that she suspected her husband of killing their kids. The cops formed a team to track the accused. They received information that Malaani was seen moving towards Haiderpur station.

Around 6pm, Malaani jumped in front of a metro train at Haiderpur Badli Mor station on the Yellow Line. Probe revealed that he was under depression and had been jobless for months.

“We have registered a case of murder and investigations are going on,” said DCP (northwest) Vijayanta Arya.

The stretch near Eco Park where the art street will come up

KOLKATA: The city will soon have a unique art street in New Town . A stretch of road adjacent to Gate No. 1 of Eco Park is being developed where artisans and artists will be able to showcase their creations and sell them. The initiative is likely to start next month.

Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) has initiated the process to empanel artists and allied organisations who would display their works.

An official said, “There are such streets in many European nations where artists showcase their works. Some artists have shown interest in such streets where they can show their creations, like paintings, drawings, handicrafts and sculptures, to the people.”

Initially, artists will be able to showcase their products only on weekends as the Eco Park opens. A token payment of Rs 1,000 will be charged. The art street will be divided into two zones. The empanelled artists and organisations will be allocated display rights by rotation in either of the two zones every few months.

Hidco had earlier organised a design hackathon and a number of street art furniture were installed on important traffic intersections on the Main Arterial Road. As part of this, two owl sculptures were fixed on the Main Arterial Road near Eco Park. Now, it is known as Pnechar More (the Owl Crossing).

Protest in front of the VHP pavillion on the last day of the International Kolkata Book Fair on Sunday

KOLKATA: Distribution of Hanuman Chalisa by the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) on book fair grounds led to an altercation, which snowballed into a high-decibel fight late on Sunday afternoon. This zone, the foyer outside the BJP mouthpiece “Jana Barta” stall, had become a battle zone for the past few days as BJP workers were seen clashing with anti-CAA/NRC protesters comprising of students and some Left-backed citizen’s forums. Interestingly, on Sunday, the face-off was between the Bidhannagar Police and the VHP workers.

In the afternoon, when VHP workers started distributing Hanuman Chalisa outside the “Jana Barta” stall, some senior police officers tried to stop them. This led to trouble as VHP workers challenged the cops and dared them to stop the free distribution of a prayer book. They argued that if Koran and Bible could be distributed inside the fair, why should the cops stop the distribution of Hanuman Chalisa. “This is unfair and so we challenged the police. We said come what may, we will go on with our distribution, which we did despite police interference,” said Amitabha Roy, a VHP spokesperson.

Students and anti-CAA protesters, on the other hand, sat on the ground near the Subhas Mukhopadhyay Mancha to write posters and participate in silent and peaceful demonstrations. They moved out in a file once in the afternoon, following the ring road, but were guided back by the police soon. “We were instructed to keep peace at the fair and not to allow any kind of protests. So we guided them back,” said a police officer. Unlike on Saturday, when 10 persons were arrested, no one was even detained on Sunday.

Addressing the media, the president of the Publishers and Booksellers Guild, Tridib Chatterjee, said everyone is free to have his/her political opinions, but no one will be allowed to use the book fair as a platform for disrup-tive activities.

The fair otherwise ended on a high note. At least 3,00,000 people visited the fair on Sunday itself, taking the total number of visitors to 25 lakh, up by 2,00,000 from last year. “This number would have been higher, but rain played spoilsport at the beginning,” said general secretary of the guild, Sudhangshu Dey. The sales have approximately touched Rs 23 crore this year, up from Rs 21 crore last year.

Next year, the book fair will celebrate the centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman and the theme country would be Bangladesh. Several ministers from Bangladesh were present at the closing ceremony.

VADODARA: A 17-year-old student of diploma engineering of a private college at Savli ended his life at his hostel on Saturday afternoon.

Deceased Ronak Vashi , a native of Dahod, studying in the mechanical branch at a private college was staying at the college hostel. On Saturday, sometime between 2 pm and 5 pm Vashi went to the neighbouring room of the hostel and hanged himself from the ceiling fan using a nylon rope.

Vashi’s room partner learnt about the suicide when he went to the neighbouring room to hunt for him.

The friend then alerted the college management which informed the police . The institute also called Vashi’s parents to inform about his extreme step. But as the family members asked the cops to keep the hostel room sealed till they arrived, cops could not take possession of the body.

It was only after the kin reached Savli late in the evening, that the cops could bring down the body and send it for post-mortem. The police have registered a case of accidental death, while the kin suspect wrongdoing. “It is unbelievable that he killed himself. He was not someone who would take such a step. The police should conduct an in-depth investigation,” said a relative, Dilip Baman.

Members of a wedding procession pelted stones at the GSRTC bus

Vadodara: Violence erupted at Eral village in Panchmahal on Sunday evening as a Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) bus brushed against a tractor carrying DJ and loudspeakers in a wedding procession.

Members of the wedding procession argued with the bus conductor and later resorted to pelting stones on the bus injuring two passengers.

According to the police, the bus brushed against the tractor when the driver was trying to bypass the wedding procession. While the bus was going to Kadwal in Chhota Udepur from Vejalpur in Panchmahal, the wedding procession was entering Eral village. As the revellers were dancing on the DJ’s tunes blocking the road, the bus driver stopped the bus on the side of the road. However, when the procession failed to move forward for a long time, the driver tried to bypass it by taking the bus from the side of the road.

In this attempt, the bus brushed against the tractor and the baraatis got into an argument with the bus conductor and driver. they even pelted stones on the bus, breaking the windshield, rear glass and a window glass. Two passengers also suffered minor injuries in the stone pelting, and had to be taken to a private hospital.

Soon, police including senior officials reached the village and controlled the situation. Later at night, the police initiated registration of offence at Vejalpur police station and also called in the groom’s father to identify all those who had pelted stones at the bus. All members of the procession were from Baska village of Halol taluka.

“We will be registering an offence of rioting, injuring a public servant and causing hurt,” said superintendent of Panchmahal police Dr Leena Patil.

“I have driven the bus on this route several times but never experienced this kind of a situation,” said the bus driver Karamsinh Zala.

105,['10/02/2020'],More hits than misses for innovative city corpn,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Trichy: Trichy City Corporation has earned the applause of many for being a pioneer in implementing many innovative projects, though it has of late been receiving brickbats for a few projects that have turned out to be a damp squib.

While projects such as ‘the wall of happiness’ and ‘street library’ earned much acclaim for the corporation, initiatives including food bank and e-waste centre have failed to yield any desired results. Here is a list of hits and misses, the civic body pioneered in recent years.

The innovation started with ‘the wall of happiness’ initiative in December 2017, which has been successfully operating on the Allithurai Road. While other cities including Tirunelveli had failed to implement the initiative, Trichy is successful in its attempt due to the choice of location, near the government hospital. The success story pushed the civic body to emulate the initiative at Srirangam to help the economically weeker sections of the society.

The street library initiative is another such successful project. Launched at Officers Colony, Puthur in December 2018, the library caters to the needs of 30-35 people every day. It serves as an exchange point for residents to hand over books they read and collect new books. ""While the habit of reading books is taking a dip due to the penetration of smartphones, such libraries are the need of the hour,"" 64-year-old K Manoharan from Puthur told TOI. The street library, which functions on a vacant space along a walking track, was expanded to Ariyamangalam in March 2019.

Plogging, a physical activity combining litter collection and walking, is another novel initiative launched by the civic body in April 2018. Subsequently, it was emulated by other civic bodies. Latest to join the list was Miyawaki forest, a Japanese method of raising dense forest in the city. Around 10,000 saplings of native trees were planted in a day at Srirangam to encourage afforestation.

Though the corporation can take the credit for the innovations, there are also a few projects that fell flat. E-waste (electronic waste) collection centre is one of the expensive projects that failed to take shape. An e-waste collection centre was established at Thennur at an estimated cost of Rs 20 lakh to collect electrical and electronic waste separately from residents. However, the centre still awaits clearance from Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) to become operational. ""TNPCB says that segregating electronic waste should not happen inside the centre, it is difficult to oblige,"" a corporation official said.

Another innovative project that has flopped is QR (Quick Response) code enable waste collection. The ambitious project launched in October 2018 at a cost of Rs 3-5 lakh per ward distributed custom QR code cards to all households and shops. To ensure day-to-day waste collection, the QR code cards should be scanned by sanitary workers while collecting waste. The initiative failed as those engaged in the work rarely scan the QR code.

The food bank initiative launched in September 2019 remains an underutilized initiative. Since cooked food was not allowed in the bank, the racks of refrigerators remain empty. Residents have urged the civic body to handover the food bank to voluntary organisations for better handling.

Aurangabad: A special rally organised on Sunday between Selu and Pathri towns of the Parbhani district, to press for the demand of speedy development of Saibaba’s birthplace in Marathwada, witnessed huge response.

Over 10,000 people took part in the rally which was deliberately organized on Sunday to ensure maximum participation.

While Pathri is revered as the birthplace of Saibaba, Selu has a temple of Keshavraj Babasaheb Maharaj, who is hailed as Saibaba’s spiritual guru. The rally began after performing an aarti at Selu temple in the morning and reached Pathri by evening where similar rituals were performed at the local Saibaba temple.

BJP MLA Meghana Bordikar, who led the rally, said it was crystal clear that Pathri is the birthplace of Saibaba and the town must be developed on the lines of other pilgrim sites in the state.

“The temple trust and scholars have proof and piece of evidence to substantiate the fact that Saibaba was born in Pathri. His spiritual guru Keshavraj Babasaheb Maharaj was from Selu, and many evidence exist to prove this fact. Therefore, the government must not make any inordinate delay in releasing the funds for development of Pathri,” she said.

Baba Jani Durani, NCP MLC and president of the action committee for Pathri temple development, said the government must not test the patience of devotees.

“Chief minister Udhhav Thackeray had announced funds for developing Pathri and we demand release of the same at the earliest. The government must not halt development of Pathri due to opposition from certain elements in Shirdi,” he said.

Thackeray, on January 9, had announced Rs 100 crore for development of Pathri referring that the Marathwada town as the birthplace of Saibaba. The statement did not go down well with a section of residents and political elements in Shirdi.

One month after the announcement, the state government has not released any money for the development of Pathri.

Surge in demand: In a bid to boost use of hygienic sanitary pads, the government had slashed the price of the ... Read More

Mangaluru: Two months after subsidised sanitary pads went off the shelves of PM Jan Aushadhi Kendras, fresh stock has arrived and is being distributed to the centres. The biodegradable Suvidha napkins cost just Rs 1 apiece and are available in a pack of four.

Six of the 24 Jan Aushadi Kendras in Dakshina Kannada, which are recognised as A+ performers, said supplies have been trickling in over the past 15 days.

In a bid to boost use of hygienic sanitary pads, the government had slashed the price of the Suvidha pack from Rs 10 to Rs 4 in August last year. This led to a five-fold increase in demand across the country, says one estimate. “It came to our notice that the Kendras started getting bulk orders from individuals and non-governmental organisations,” said Anila Kumari, senior marketing officer of Jan Aushadhi Kendra and nodal officer for Karnataka. “Some people were also donating these napkins in large numbers to slums and government schools. We have now requested Kendras not to supply bulk orders.”

The surge wiped off stocks in November and the Union government is now gradually regularising supply. Dhiraj Sharma, general manager of marketing of Jan Aushadhi Kendra, who is based in New Delhi, said the jump in demand was much more than expected, causing an upset. “The regional warehouse in Chennai and distributors of Bengaluru and Mysuru have enough stock now. The gap is about reaching the stock to locations. We have instructed store owners to keep 100-1,000 units available,” he said.

Jan Aushadhi Kendras in the district are receiving supplies in batches. “I was told on Friday that the sanitary pad stock has arrived. I will be placing an order soon” said Chandra Mohan K of Attavar Jan Aushadi Kendra. Kiran of the Officials of the Mallikatte centre said they received adequate stock about 10 days ago. Shivaranjan of Puttur said his unit was fully stocked now.

“We received 60,000 packets about 15 days ago,” said Abhishek, managing director of Bengaluru-based Mahaveer Drugs Plus which is an authorised distributor for Jan Aushadi Kendras, said There was a deficit about two months ago, it is being rectified now,” he said.

Aurangabad: A day after a group of 16 farmers were caught lifting water from Jayakwadi dam and its backwater in an unauthorized manner, mixed reactions started pouring from all quarters in connection with the unusual crackdown on Sunday.

Acting on a complaint from the Water Resources Department, the Paithan police on Saturday registered offences against a group of farmers for illegally stealing water.

Nathsagar, the dam reservoir has scores of unauthorized electric pumps that are used to lift water without due permission.

While water management experts and activists have welcomed the crackdown, the farmer activists and political elements have expressed dissent against such action.

“Jayakwadi dam was built for irrigation purposes originally and therefore farmers have a legitimate right over its water. However, the water must be drawn legitimately by following a due procedure. We are against encouraging farmers to opt for illegal means for drawing water,” said water activist Abhijit Dhanorkar.

Notably, the issue of rampant illegal lifting of water from the Jayakwadi dam was raised before the Supreme Court by stakeholders from Ahmednagar and Nashik in recent past through petitions related to the release of water in downstream areas from upstream areas.

Farmer activist Jayaji Surywanshi said such crackdown against farmers was something uncalled for. “The farmers are forced to lift water from the Jayakwadi dam in an unauthorized manner. The process of allowing the water-lifting must be made farmer-centric,” he said.

TimesView The message that the Narol denim factory fire sends out to industrial workers in Gujarat is chilling: that their lives do not matter. Across industrial estates in the state, licences are granted to factories without adequate inspection of their safety measures. This problem only aggravates by a shortage of inspection staff with the industrial safety and health department. For too long now, Gujarat’s industries have been lax about following safety norms. Neither the government nor the public have held them adequately accountable for the loss of lives. The problem will only worsen if the government sleeps over implementing compulsory safety audits for its economic power engines.

AHMEDABAD: Bags of humans bones, skulls and ash. This was what 150 firemen salvaged from the charred remains of a denim factory in Narol which was till a few hours ago a burning cauldron. The worst Ahmedabad has seen in last 15 years, in which seven people lost their lives. It took the firemen of Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services (AFES) 15 hours to douse the fire but could not save these precious seven lives who struggled to get out of this three-floor factory made of metal shed with only a single entry and exit. The ordeal for the relatives of the dead was even more. They now wait for DNA tests to be carried out on the charred remains so that they can carry back with them their loved ones in bags of bones.The fire incident at Nandan Denim Ltd on Narol-Pirana Road at Piplaj is a story of neglect, apathy on the part of the industrial safety and health department of the state government besides the civic body. How such a dangerous set up was allowed to come up that employed 200 people in a hazardous environment? The bodies were trapped underneath rows of large metal racks that had twisted under heat and fell on the victims. The bodies — four of them were recovered on Saturday and three on Sunday — were sent to the VS Hospital for postmortem.Narol police on Sunday afternoon filed an FIR against six promoters and employees of the firm under IPC Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Those included in the FIR included Jyoti Chiripal, MD; Dipak Chiripal, CEO; P K Sharma, full-time director; B C Patel, general manager of shirting division; H M Patel, deputy general manager; and Ravikant Sinha, fire safety officer. R B Rana, ACP J Division, told media on Sunday evening that three of the accused including B C Patel, H M Patel and Ravikant Sinha, were apprehended in this connection.Police officials are yet to get forensic science laboratory (FSL) report to identify origin of the fire. “It’s likely that it started from the ceiling of the shirting division of production department on the first floor and spread to other parts of the building. The spread was very quick. Several of the employees managed to make a dash to safety, those on the first floor could not make it.Investigators said that as there was no other way to identify the deceased, they would get their DNA sampling done with help of their relatives. The relatives refused to accept the bodies till the management of the firm approaches them. They accused the officials of evading their responsibility of ensuring safety of the employees.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053148,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-143941,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/death-toll-in-narol-fire-reaches-7-three-held/articleshow/74051282.cms

113,['10/02/2020'],Gadchiroli frontline staff gets lessons in wildlife management,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: Perhaps for the first time, frontline staff in Gadchiroli got lessons in wildlife management with an aim to equip them with biodiversity knowledge, camera trapping, signs, surveys, animal behavior and tracking.

Though Gadchiroli forest circle is more in the news for wrong reasons, the tribal-dominated district has huge potential to restore wildlife and tigers. The Sironcha division is already known for its presence of vultures and pure breed of wild buffaloes. The Allapalli division has most number of giant squirrels in the state. The district was in news for recent dispersal of tiger K7 from neighbouring Telangana.

To ensure capacity-building of the frontline staff, Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), one of the leading NGOs in Central India, along with Maharashtra forest department conducted a two-day training workshop for the staff in Gadchiroli.

The two-day workshop was held at Sironcha and Allapalli recently. A concluding function of the workshop was held on Sunday at Repanpalli in Pranhita range. In this function at least 80 staffers who were trained were distributed kits by the NGO, which included jackets, torches and water bottles.

“The workshop gave lessons in importance of biodiversity and forest management, animal behaviour and monitoring, sign surveys and tracking, camera trap monitoring, use of GPS and mobile applications in monitoring,” said Shrikant Pawar, assistant conservator of forests (ACF).

“The staff learnt basics of human-wildlife conflict and how various types of cases can be handled. Staff was also told about snakes and their identification, and myths related to reptiles. As Gadchiroli is known for snakes, training was given on dos and don’ts about snake bites and safe rescue methods,” said Pawar.

“With wire snares emerging as one of the biggest threats, the staff was told about types of snares and importance of anti-snare walks. The staff was introduced to these topics through a detailed power point session. A field session was also held where the staff was given first-hand experience of GPS, sign surveys and identification and basics of camera trapping,” said WTI’s regional head Prafulla Bhamburkar.

“Gadchiroli recently experienced tiger movement followed by livestock depredation and also keeping in mind that most of the staff will now be a part of Pranhita sanctuary, understanding the basics of animal signs, tracking and monitoring is absolutely important,” says ACF Suhas Badekar, Sironcha.

“It proved to be a good platform for frontline staff to discuss their problems in animal tracking and learning camera trapping following the recent movement of tiger in this area,” said Amrut Dagade, RFO, Pranhita.

The workshop was attended by 47 staff from Sironcha and 40 from Allapalli. Those who attended included round officers and forest guards of six ranges. WTI’s field biologist Nikhil Dandekar conducted indoor as well as field sessions.

The workshop was attended by ACFs Shrikant Pawar and Suhas Badekar, RFO Amrut Dagade, WTI field officer & sociologist Mahendra Raut, and field assistant Noor Ali and assistant field officer Vibhor Choudhary.

AHMEDABAD: Stooped shoulders, the neck thrust forward, and the back hunched. If these are your postures while working on your computers, chronic back and neck pains loom for you. Recently, a public hospital in the city analyzed neck and back pains of 512 patients to record the causes.Among reasons for the nagging neck pain were prolonged computer usage, chairs whose backrest did not fit the the natural back curve of the individual, and unsuitable height of chairs. The researchers were V R Dave, H J Khanpara , R P Shukla, K N Sonaliya, J Tolani, and R Patel of GCS Medical College Hospital and Research Centre. They found that 50 (9.8%) patients used computers at their workplace for more than four hours. The researchers gave a ‘pain score’ on the scale of 1 to 10 to patients while conducting detailed interviews on their postures. Of the total, 89 (17.4%) patients were included in the mild (1 to 3) pain score category; and 286 (55.9%) and 137 (26.7%) were included in the moderate (4 to 6) and severe (7 to 10) categories.When probed further about neck positions during work (more than four hours without rest), about 114 (22.3%) said that their necks were flexed, 72 (14.1%) said that they were straight, 312 (61.0%) said that they were either flexed or straight most of the time, 5 (1.0%) said they were extended, while 9 (1.6%) said that they were flexed or rotated most of the time. “On being asked about maintaining the ideal body posture of forward head and shoulder position at work, 67 (13.1%) patients said that they were able to follow the ideal posture,” the research paper said.In the case of the body mass index, the severity of pain was higher among obese people compared to other two groups, which is statistically significant. This supports various studies showing that spine problems affect more obese people compared to normal or overweight people.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74057705,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32137,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/your-work-is-a-pain-in-the-neck/articleshow/74051335.cms
115,['10/02/2020'],Defence ministry gives Rs 6.5cr service charges to cantt board,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Pune: The cash-strapped Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) got a shot in the arm from the defence ministry, in the form of service charges of Rs6.5 crore as services charges from the Ministry of Defence recently.

PCB officials said these funds would allow them to pay salaries and pension bills for the month of March, which would have been difficult otherwise.

“The ministry has released service charges to five financially weak cantonments. This ‘help’, albeit a small one, was much needed,” a senior PCB official, who did not wish to be named, said.

The board has monthly expenses amounting to Rs7 crore, which comes to about Rs84 crore per annum. According to board officials, PCB earns only around Rs45 crore, placing it in a precarious position.

“Apart from basic civic amenities, such as garbage collection, road repairs, water, etc, we incur spend on health care and education. We cannot afford to compromise on any of these things,” PCB CEO Amit Kumar told TOI on Sunday, adding, “Unless we get our Goods and Services Tax (GST) share from the government, our fiscal health will not improve.”

The Ministry of Defence is supposed to release Rs97 per crore per annum to PCB. Also, the state government collects about Rs1,000 crore in GST from traders and businesses in cantonment limits. About 15% of this share was to come to PCB. However, apart from Rs3 crore in 2017 and the current Rs6.5 crore, the MoD has not released the rest of the money, while the PCB has not received GST share since it was implemented. This amounts to a revenue loss of close to Rs250 crore per annum, a board official said.

A section of PCB officials and elected members called the disbursed amount “paltry”. “Service charges worth Rs590 crore are pending with the ministry for the past few years. If we get this money even in phases or instalments, it would be a big relief. We can at least meet the board’s monthly expenses. But the ministry has been ignoring this demand over the years. Unless the ministry earmarks a special budget to cantonments, the situation across the country would remain grim,” a senior Director General Defence Estates (DGDE) official said.

The official added that thanks to the reduced budget this year, cantonments will have to fend for themselves. The boards in Maharashtra — Pune, Khadki, Dehu Road, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Deolali and Kamptee — will be worse hit because cantonments are not recognized as urban local bodies under the state’s tax laws.

“The ministry could merge facilities like hospitals and schools with municipal corporations to reduce the burden on cantonment boards,” another DGDE official suggested.

Pune: Four students from Victorious Kidss Educares cleaned up parts of Kharadi near Fountain Road within two months and planted saplings in the area.

The school is affiliated to the International Baccalaureate (IB) board. The four eighth grade students Aadi Karnavat, Aaryan Dharani, Neel Jain and Yuvraj Bhosale said they had noticed filth covering open plots in the middle of residential areas while going to school everyday. So, they decided to clean it up, as part of their community project.

Karnavat said, “We found a resolution to tackle garbage dumping spots in various parts of the city and started working towards converting this land into a beautiful park.”

Dharani said their objective was to reduce the waste dumping and make the area garbage-free so that it could be utilized by kids and adults. Jain said the group created a proposal for the beautification of the area, which included a 3D model on plantation, created a beautiful walkway, added benches and some garbage bins.

“We met with Sushma Mundhe, the health and sanitation inspector for Kharadi, and sought her guidance and support. The area was cleaned up and an awareness drive was carried out on waste segregation for residents and local shopkeepers,” Jain said.

The students took commitment from a local nursery to donate 55 plants. They reached out to the Pune Municipal Corporation’s garden department to deliver soil for the project. Simultaneously, they sent messages on a Kharadi Swachhata group to seek help of volunteers and support for the first plantation drive, which was conducted in December.

Bhosale said, “The second plantation drive was in January, for which Vimannagar biodiversity park donated around 35 herbal plants. We also conducted a fundraiser at school by selling shakes, sandwiches, soft drinks and managed to collect about Rs8,000. We even reached out to Adar Poonawalla foundation to get their commitment for installing trash bins.”

Robbin Ghosh, the president of Victorious Kidss Educares, said, “The teaching and learning pedagogy of our school is coupled with the IB curriculum and Vedanta. These students become strong leaders of family, community and the world through these teachings.”

120,['10/02/2020'],HC recognizes victim’s right to appeal under amended criminal law,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Pune: The Bombay high court has held that a victim’s right to appeal against any order of acquittal of the accused, whether passed by the trial or appellate court, is absolute and unfettered as per amended provision of Section 372 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

Justice Sadhana Shinde and justice N B Suryawanshi recently admitted for final hearing an appeal by Pune resident Ramdas Nivrutti More against a Pune sessions court’s order that acquitted five persons on the latter’s appeal against a magisterial court’s order convicting them for unlawful assembly and causing grievous hurt to him with deadly weapons.

More’s lawyer Aniket Ujjwal Nikam told TOI, “Before the amendment to CrPC Section 372, the remedy of appeal was provided under CrPC Section 378 and the same could be filed on a police report only at the instance of district magistrate or state government. The aggrieved victim or complainant had no right to appeal and he could only prefer a revision.”

Nikam said, “The revision would be a cumbersome process as the revision court has no powers to convict an accused in case it finds that the latter has been wrongly acquitted. At the most, it could remand the case back to the trial court. This involved wastage of time and money _ as has been observed by the Law Commission on whose recommendation an exception was added to CrPC Section 372, providing right of appeal to the victim against any order passed by the court acquitting the accused or conviction for a lesser offence or an inadequate compensation.”

On More’s appeal in the HC, the lawyer representing the five acquitted men challenged the maintainability of the appeal on the grounds that Section 372 CrPC did not provide a right of appeal to the victim. Moreover, the victim’s right of appeal co-existed with a similar right of the accused, who filed the first appeal before the sessions court and the same resulted in their acquittal. The lawyer argued that More could have at the most gone for a revision of the acquittal order.

The bench, however, held, “We are unable to accept the interpretation canvassed by the counsel for the original accused as the said interpretation would defeat the very object, with which the said (amended) provision was introduced. The right which is granted to the victim to file an appeal against any order would be rendered nugatory, if the interpretation.....is accepted.” It further noted that the legislature had introduced the said proviso to carve out an exception to the main provision to CrPC Section 372. It relied on a 2019 ruling by the Supreme Court in support of its conclusion.

The atmosphere was electric on a cool Sunday morning filled with dancing, art, fitness and creativity for participants of various ages.

Happy Streets is set to be held at Undri this week onwards.

At the front lawn and activity space just off the entrance of the sprawling Corinthians Club, people of all age group joined in on the fun.

The activities structured and planned for the day were well-designed, particularly for the younger crowd.

A flat, rectangular surface allotted for roller-skating and skateboarding was ideal for enthusiasts. A substantial number of children utilized the space to practise and strengthen their skill.

There were plenty of bicycles available for non-skaters to enjoy a ride along the course. This was a free service available for all, similar to last week.

An arts and creativity corner was set up mainly for children. Artists taught them how to make pinwheels using simple stationary such as paper, glue and sticks.

On the grassy bank, children assiduously followed instructions, and happily returned home with working pinwheels.

""I brought my brother here to indulge in some fun after I came to know that Happy Streets was coming to our area. Not only did my brother have fun with arts and Zumba, even I enjoyed myself a lot. I rode around the course on a bicycle and followed it with a visit to the open-air gym,"" said Aparna Tiwari, who drove to the venue from her NIBM Road residence.

The Zumba was a fast-paced exercise which drew all kinds of people to break a sweat with upbeat and energetic music.

The Zumba exercise, conducted at a consistently high tempo for nearly three hours by Raahil Chouhan, remained a top draw for people of all ages, as was the case with the adjacent open-air gym.

The gym was well equipped with weights and others instruments ideal for people seeking some early morning exercise.

Happy Streets is an initiative of The Times of India, in association with the Pune police and the Pune Municipal Corporation, powered by Nyati.

NHAI has asked traffic department to allow diversion for one or two days in the area to complete the work. Once it is completed, NHAI will open the flyover to two-way traffic. Currently, traffic is allowed only from Enchakkal-Chackai side of the flyover.

After opening the flyover for two-way traffic, NHAI will start work on the service road under the flyover. It also plans to utilise the area under the flyover for paid parking.

“There is concern in allotting the area for parking as drains are located close to the area. However, there is a proposal for a paid parking slot under the flyover,” sources said.

Another pending work – construction of the service road and drain at Gurunagar near Infosys – is stuck due to opposition of local people, who have sought a pedestrian underpass in the area. NHAI officials said that they would restart construction in the area within a week. Local people led by Poundukadavu councillor Medayil Vikraman has stopped work in the past demanding a pedestrian underpass. Currently the area is a major road safety concern, as vehicles have direct access to the national highway due to the absence of a retaining wall.

NHAI sources said that they could divert buses along the service road after completing construction. Currently movement of buses is causing traffic congestion in the national highway.

NHAI has to complete some work near Kovalam which was disrupted following demand to provide direct access to the NH. Construction of a vehicular underpass at one end of Akkulam bridge is progressing. The authority is now constructing drains in the area.

KNR Constructions began work in June 2015 with completion set for July 2017. Following various hurdles, NHAI revised the date of completion to August 2018. By that time, KNR submitted completion report for 22km out of the total 26km of the Kazhakoottam-Mukkola stretch.

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has ordered a Surat-based gynaecologist to pay Rs 6.85 lakh to a woman for forgetting a mop in her abdomen after her C-section surgery.

Dr Meena Vankawala will be paying the amount to one Bhavi Mehta, who was admitted to her hospital in March 2012. She delivered a son after undergoing surgery. She complained that her baby swallowed fluid during birth and hence suffered various health problems. The baby’s treatment lasted long at different hospitals.

After C-section surgery, the woman continued to feel pain in her abdomen. She consulted other doctors, but did not get any relief. Finally, on May 14, 2012, she was hospitalized and sonography reflected a foreign body in her abdomen. She was operated upon and a mop of the size of 15x12 mm was found in her stomach.

Mehta sued Dr Vankawala, her hospital and the insurance company in the consumer commission for medical negligence.

She also supplied a medical report saying that Dr Vankawala did not remove the mop during the surgery. The case lasted for seven years and the commission accepted the patient’s claim that it was a case of medical negligence.

The commission said, “This is a case of medical negligence which is highly difficult to establish... There is no dispute that the cotton mop was left during the operation in the body of complainant No. 1 (Mehta)... doctor had not taken any care to remove the mop from the body of the complainant, otherwise, she might not have suffered such severe and unbearable pain for long. This itself suggests to conclude that doctor was careless and negligent at the time of performing the operation on her.”

The complainant had sought ha efty amount of over Rs 90 lakh towards compensation for the trouble she and her son had undergone. But the consumer commission said that she was entitled to get Rs 5 lakh towards compensation, and Rs 1.5 lakh for the medical expenses she had incurred. The doctor and her insurance company were also ordered to pay Rs 25,000 to the patient for mental agony caused to them besides Rs 10,000 towards legal expenditure.

Agro-tourism workshop organized by Vidarbha Economic Development Council, on Saturday

Nagpur: Agro-tourism is limited to day trips and does not have scope for overnight stays. It is about observing how agriculture is done and an ordinary day in a farmer’s life, said Prachiti Bagade, assistant professor at the department of geology, LAD College, on Saturday.

She was speaking at a workshop organized by the Vidarbha Economic Development Council (VD) and Smart Welfare Foundation. The daylong workshop was on ‘Opportunities and challenges in agro-tourism’.

Speaking on the problems faced by agro-tourism industry, she said, “Infrastructure is not properly developed at some agro tourism centres (ATC) because of lack of adequate capital. Labour management, lack of awareness among tourists, extreme weather conditions and conversion of ATCs into overcrowded resorts are some of the main problems.”

Bagade stated that agro-tourism aids in generation of rural employment . “Using waste water from swimming pools and rain dance for farms at a few ATCs is a good environment initiative.”

Prasanna Shembekar, associate professor, Tirpude Institute of Management Education, spoke on hospitality and marketing in agro-tourism industry. “Most people don’t know the difference between a farmhouse and an ATC. Agro-tourism is done on a working and functional farm.”

Shembekar pointed out that observation, demonstration, participation and recreation are the main ingredients for a proper agro-tourism destination. According to him, one should figure out how to make customer come to you, make him turn up again and to ensure that he spreads the word.

He said 15% of people don’t know what agro-tourism is. Over 85% think that it means visit to a farmhouse. Using digital marketing can be used as a tool to promote ATCs, Shembekar said.

Amol Khante of CAC-AllRounder and Roshan Daga, Ranwara, shared their success stories about agro-tourism. Prashant Sawai, director of MTDC, spoke about investment opportunities and services in agro-tourism while Anup Ghumare, CEO, Cenin Tours and Travels, highlighted the role and support from tours and travel agencies to agro-tourism.

Sunil Mankikar, president of Smart Welfare Foundation, spoke on how to start new ATCs with minimum investment.

Agra: To save power and promote use of green energy, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) administration is planning to set up a high capacity solar plant at its head office on MG Road. The installation of the 325-kilowatt capacity plant is estimated to cost Rs 15 crore. The contract for the solar plant has been awarded to a private company.

With this move, AMC also hopes to cut down on its power bill which is around Rs 1 lakh per month. In addition, Rs 50,000 is spent on operating generators. The solar power besides cutting down on electricity bills will also provide relief from power cuts that affects official work.

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “We are planning to use solar power as the main source of electricity at the head office. For this. a 325-Kw solar power plant will be set up. Following tender process, a private company has been assigned the task for setting up the plant. The company will also look after the maintenance of the plant for 25 years.”

After installing the solar power plant at its head office, AMC administration plans to switch to green energy at the zone offices as well. The Hariparwat zone office is located in the AMC head office. It is proposed to set up solar power plants at the zonal offices in Chatta, Lohamandi and Tajganj in the second phase.

In Agra, the Dayalbagh Educational Institute (DEI) has already set an example of harnessing solar energy and saving power. The university has been successful in meeting a major part of its electricity demand on its own and also succeeded in distributing surplus energy to colonies in Dayalbagh.

On a daily basis, DEI produces up to 2,500 to 2,800 units of electricity. The varsity has a grid tie-up with Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam (DVVNL) to whom it sells its surplus power.

Agra: The Agra Development Authority (ADA) administration has not been able to set up the proposed facilities around the Inner Ring Road even after much delay. However, toll tax is being charged. The Inner Ring Road has no restroom, restaurant, petrol pump or a parking space. ADA’s plan to make a selfie point also remains on papers.

The Inner Ring Road is planned to connect National Highway-2, Agra-Lucknow expressway and the Agra-Noida Yamuna expressway with the Gwalior road. Work on the project was started in 2015.

Proposed to be 24 km, the road will be completed in three phases. The idea behind construction of the highway is to streamline traffic movement towards the Taj Mahal.

The first phase of Inner Ring Road which is 11km has been completed. Work on the second phase is in progress. So far, a detailed project report for the third phase has not been prepared.

Construction of the third phase of the Inner Ring Road will be done by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI).

The first phase of the Inner Ring Road was made operational on December 14, 2017. ADA was supposed to make arrangements for the required facilities within two years. Despite the ADA getting Rs 18 crore toll tax per year, these facilities are yet to come up.

ADA vice-chairman Devendra Singh said, “The required facilities will come up very soon. A detailed plan will be prepared in this regard.”

Meanwhile, a kilometer of the service road of the first phase has not been completed as the ADA has not been able to acquire the required piece of land.

Of the total 80 wards of BMC, the service is available in only 30-40 wards. Among the worst-affected areas are Nekpur, Jagatpur, Old City, Madinath and other pockets, where garbage continues to be littered on the roads.

Residents allege that despite repeated complaints to the civic authorities regarding garbage, nothing much has been done to address the problems they face every day.

According to BMC sources, the door-to-door garbage collection is currently functional in a limited number of wards such as Indira Nagar, Janakpuri, Awas Vikas and Civil Lines. But it is yet to begin in most of the wards. including Gulab Nagar, Gadhaiya, Alamgiriganj, Jagatpur and Old City.

Shameem Ahmed, a resident of Nekpur, said, “Piles of garbage are a common sight here. In the absence of proper garbage disposal system, it is difficult to walk through the streets.”

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: Jyoti Joshi ’s desperate efforts to get more maintenance from her husband have landed her in jail for six years. A court in Amreli punished her for giving false evidence and making a false statement before the court, during proceedings on her plea seeking more maintenance money.

Last month, a magisterial court in Amreli sentenced her to three years’ rigorous imprisonment for supplying false evidence in court under Section 193 of the IPC. It punished her with equal jail term under Section 199 of the IPC, for giving a false statement in declaration which is by law receivable as evidence. The court ordered her to undergo both terms consecutively.

While Joshi got six years in jail, she succeeded in her bid to increase the maintenance amount – from Rs 2,000 to Rs 6,000 in December 2013. However, seven months before she got this relief from the court, the court ordered registration of a complaint against her under Sections 193, 199 and 200 of IPC.

In this case, Jyoti married Yogesh Joshi in 1987 and the couple lived in Chalala town. After matrimonial discord, Jyoti approached the court in 2003 and secured monthly maintenance of Rs 1,100 by way of a settlement in 2004. The maintenance amount was later increased to Rs 2,000.

In 2007, Jyoti filed an application for enhancement in maintenance to Rs 6,000, claiming that her husband was an accountant with the animal husbandry department in Rajkot drawing a salary of Rs 12,000. To show that she needed more money due to her dire financial status, Joshi claimed that she was living in her aunt Saguna Madhak ’s house by paying Rs 2,000 rent. She thus needed more than Rs 2,000 maintenance from the husband.

The husband, on the other hand, complained before the court that his wife was lying on oath. The court ordered an inquiry and found substance to the husband’s claim. The judge ordered the court registrar to file a complaint against Jyoti for supplying false evidence in court.

In 2014, the trial against Jyoti began. Last month, the court delivered its verdict holding her guilty of telling a lie to the court because it was established that she was not paying any rent to her aunt, because the aunt did not own any property at all.

135,['10/02/2020'],Dudhwa’s Jhadi Tal to be developed as Sarus habitat,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Bareilly: Jhadi Tal which is situated in Chhairasi beat under Bhira range of buffer area of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) will be developed as a Sarus habitat for conservation of the bird. The state bird of Uttar Pradesh, Sarus crane is considered vulnerable in theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red list.

The Sarus Conservation Society recently approved the project of developing Jhadi Tal site as Sarus habitat. The society also sanctioned a budget of Rs 17 lakh for the same.

It may be noted that Jhadi Tal, which is proposed to be developed as Sarus habitat, should not be confused with another wetland of the same name located in Kishanpur Wildlife Sanctuary of DTR.

Forest officials said nearly five Sarus cranes were spotted at the site in the past. After developing the site as Sarus habitat, the forest department will try to increase the number of birds here as it is an ideal place for birding.

“The site, spread across 25 hectares, is ideal for conservation of the bird because it is surrounded by forest on three sides while one side is agricultural land and it also has a small wetland. The site is a mosaic of woodland, grassland and wetland. As paddy and wheat is mostly grown on the agriculture land, it is an ideal foraging site for the Sarus,” said Anil Patel, deputy director, DTR (buffer areas).

Though Jhadi Tal is located in the buffer areas of DTR, the way to reach the site from entry gate is after crossing dense forest of sal, teak and other trees for nearly 5 km. “We believe that environmentalists, tourists and children will enjoy the route to reach Jhadi Tal and also the Sarus crane. Developing the site will create awareness among people about the need for conservation of Sarus and other birds,” said Patel.

Forest officials have proposed setting up of two wooden watch towers, wooden benches and view shades at the site for facilitating the tourists here.

According to experts, the Sarus crane is considered the tallest flying bird in the world. Its height when standing is approximately 156 cm (5’2”). They are usually found in pairs. The bird lives in open wetlands and marshes, foraging for roots, tubers, insects and small prey. The Sarus crane is easily distinguished from other cranes in the region by its overall grey colour and contrasting red head and upper neck. The crane builds its nest in June-July in marshy areas by using paddy straw, leaves and twigs. The breeding period is August-September, and the female crane usually lays two eggs at a time.

136,['10/02/2020'],Temporary ban on trekking to Meenmutty,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Following the drowning death of a 25-year-old physiotherapist at Meenmutty waterfalls in Neyyar forest range, the forest department authorities have temporarily stopped the Meenmutty trekking package. The department will also install more warning boards at vulnerable spots.

Neyyar forest range officer J Suresh said that all bookings for the next two weeks have been cancelled. No new bookings are being allowed either. The move will result in huge monetary loss as the department charges Rs 965 per head for one-day trek and Rs 1,100 per head for trek with one-night camping in the jungle.

“We are not much bothered about the financial loss as the safety of trekkers is more important,” said the forest range officer. During the two-week break when trekking won’t be allowed, the officials will inspect the route, identify dangerous spots and install new warning signs. It has also been decided to increase the number of guides provided to each trekking group based on the strength of the group.

“Henceforth, we will provide one guide for each five persons in a group,” Suresh said. On Saturday, there were nine members in the group that went to Meenmutty, but, they only had one guide.

The range officer added that entering the waterfall was not part of the trekking package offered by the department. If there were more guides to manage the group, perhaps the tragedy could have been averted, he said.

Anandhu M S, a physiotherapist hailing from Pirappancode, had drowned in the Meenmutty waterfalls on Saturday afternoon. A week ago, an NRI from the United Kingdom had drowned in the Kallar River on the foot of Ponmudi hills.

Divisional forest officer K I Pradeep Kumar said that as the number of domestic tourists to waterfalls inside forest area is expected to increase in the wake of ensuing summer season, all tourist guides have been directed to intensify their vigil.

Rural SP B Ashok said that police personnel in such tourist destinations have been told to check the tourists thoroughly to prevent them from taking liquor to the water bodies as consumption of liquor was a reason for most drowning cases reported in the forests.

Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) plans to merge its postgraduate department of law with its Babasaheb Ambedkar College of Law has courted a major controversy.

Vice-chancellor SP Kane has made a U-turn after issuing directives in September last year and forming a committee led by himself and college principal Shrikant Komawar as member-secretary following objections from a section of NU as well as former statutory bodies.

While the committee members are viewing the move as beneficial for students, the opponents have expressed concern over loss of jobs to teachers at the PG department and disturbance to the roster. The formation of committee and the directives too have come under scanner.

Opponents called the committee and Direction 40 of 2019 as “illegal” and “arbitrary”.

VC Kane didn’t respond to TOI’s calls. Acting pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande said no decision has been taken so far regarding merger issue. “A committee under my chairmanship is constituted to study the issue. We will be seeking opinion of stakeholders, social thinkers, etc. It is a proposal. Legal issues if any will also be taken into account,” he said.

In September last year, the committee ‘RTMNU Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar College of Law Management Committee for Management and Maintenance of the College’ was formed. Besides Kane and Komawar, the committee comprises two management council members, a retired judge of SC or HC within NU jurisdiction, a senior advocate, one full-time teacher of the college, joint director and internal quality cell officer.

Among the key functions of the committee is to suggest amalgamation take over or merger of the college with any other postgraduate teaching department of the university to create a new teaching and research institution with new suitable names. Also, it has been mandated to prepare an overall comprehensive plan for the growth and development of the college, covering infrastructure, and academic programmes.

Ex-management council member Mahendra Nimbarte said NU has no powers to form such a committee as per the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016. “It is illegal. Every one was kept in the dark. If this merger happens, then teachers will lose jobs. When we spoke to the VC, he denied having any knowledge of the direction. It suggests he signed it without reading or maybe he was misled,” Nimbarte said.

138,['10/02/2020'],Travel bookings hit after GSHSEB realigns academic schedule,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Ahmedabad: With the state education board announcing alignment of its academic schedule with that of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), travel bookings are expected to take a hit. Tour operators said that as families align their holiday plans with their kids’ vacations and international tours are booked in advance, the last-minute change in academic schedules may disrupt plans. Estimates by travel agents indicate that bookings may be affected by at least 15% this summer.

“Leisure travel bookings for summer are usually made by December and January. With the recent announcement by government of Gujarat, there is serious confusion among parents, who are inquiring about cancellations and rescheduling of their trips. This may impact bookings by at least 15% if the schedule remains unchanged for the upcoming academic year,” said Anuj Pathak, secretary, Tour Operators and Travel Agents’ Association of Gujarat (TAG).Since visa processing takes time, tourists for both leisure travel as well as those who are visiting their kin abroad tend to make bookings in advance, said tour operators, as they get cheaper deals. Apart from international tour bookings, even in domestic tourism, many tourists travel to hill stations in April. “Prices of hotels and tickets shoot up tremendously in May, owing to tourist rush. Besides, availing cancellation for peak season travel will mean customers not getting refund and rescheduling coming at a dearer cost,” Pathak further added.

Tour operators also said that due to recession and financial crisis, the inquiries for both international as well as domestic bookings are down by 20-25%. “Such last-minute decisions by the state government have disrupted travel plans of holidayers. The government must take into consideration these finer aspects and not announce any decision overnight. At a time when bookings are already in low gear, such an abrupt decision will mean further denting of tour bookings,” said Manish Sharma, secretary, Travel Agents’ Federation of India (TAFI).

Thiruvananthapuram: A father and two sons drowned in a temple pond at Kadakkal in Kollam district on Sunday. Selvaraj, 49, of Kariyamonickapuram near Nagercoil in Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district, and his sons Sunder Raj, 22, and Sounder Raj, 17, had stepped into the pond for a swim.

According to Kadakkal police, the tragedy occurred around 6.30pm. Selvaraj and family had arrived at Kadakkal to attend a relative’s wedding, which was scheduled to take place on Monday.

They were staying with Selvaraj’s cousin Murukesh here. On Sunday evening, both families set out to visit the Kadakkal Devi temple nearby. The father and two sons entered the pond for a swim while the others, including his wife Subbalakshmi and Murukesh’s family stood on the bank to feed the fish in the pond.

According to the statement given by Murukesh before the police, they stood on the west bank of the pond while Selvaraj and sons stepped into the pond through the eastern bank, which has a bathing ghat. The exact circumstance under which the three drowned are not known. They saw the three struggling to stay afloat and heard them screaming for help.

By the time they reached the east bank, the three had sunk to the bottom of the pond. The bodies were fished out by personnel of the Kadakkal fire and rescue station. Though they were rushed to the government taluk hospital at Kadakkal, the doctors declared them dead on arrival.

The police said the pond was relatively very deep. Three years ago, temple authorities had cleaned the pond, removing silt and slush deposits, which made the pond deeper.

The bodies of the deceased were shifted to the mortuary. They will be released to the family on Monday after postmortem. tnn

BCA management claims it has got 23.78 crore for the project

VADODARA: Decks will soon clear for building an international cricket stadium in the city. The Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) is expecting to get Rs 100 crore grant from the Board of Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) this year. BCA management said that it has already got Rs 23.78 crores from the BCCI recently.

“We got Rs 18.66 crores towards ad hoc grant from the BCCI for the 2014-15 AGM and Rs 1.83 crores that was pending since 2013-14 AGM apart from Rs 3.69 crore goods and services tax (GST),” said Satyajit Gaekwad, chairman of press and publicity committee, BCA.

The BCA management said that it is soon going to organize the three pending AGMs including 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. “Once we organize these AGMs, we will get another Rs 100 crore from the BCCI. We will then have Rs 175 crores in our kitty. This will help us kickstart our international cricket stadium project,” Gaekwad told TOI.

The BCA had been facing stinging criticism over last few years due to pending AGMs as the association couldn’t avail of the grants worth hundreds of crores. The association has been promising an international cricket stadium to Barodians for the past two decades. But the project never took off due to land issues and internal bickering in the association.

BCA president, Pranav Amin , however, has promised to take up the stadium project on priority. A piece of land has already been bought in Kotambi and Amin has said that the project will be executed in different phases.

141,['10/02/2020'],No love lost between VNSGU &amp; literature,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Sursinhji Takhatsinhji Gohil, popularly known as Kalapi

SURAT: Love is in the air with the countdown to Valentine Day beginning. But there is no love lost between Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) and some of the greatest literary works.

In a move that has enraged littérateurs, VNSGU has decided to chuck out an entire book of poetries of Kavi Kalapi, one of Gujarati’s most celebrated poets known for this romanticism, from BA syllabus. Further, the university has also removed the Gujarati translation of Bhisham Sahani’s ‘Tamas’ from the first-year MA course.

Kalapi’s 25 poems ‘Aapni Yadi’ compiled by Harikrushan Pathak has been replaced with poetries of Harischandra Bhatt. Tamas’ translation by Narayan Desai has been replaced with ‘Arogya Niketan’ by Tarashankar Bandopadhyay.

The decision was taken in a meeting of Board of Studies (BoS) late last month with majority of the members supporting it.

And, the reason for this is even more shocking. An assistant professor in Gujarati department reportedly felt Kalapi’s poems were just full of “love, love, love”.

“I am not against any poet, but Kalapi poems were being taught for many years. It was discussed in the meeting that works of other poets should also be taught. Equally good books are included in the syllabus and all the members agreed except one,” said assistant professor Bharat Thakore, who was nominated by VNSGU vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta to attend the meeting.

Language academicians vented their anger at the move on social media. MSU’s Gujarati department professor Bharat Mehta said the decision was as encroachment on freedom of expression and thoughts.

“These two books which are in UGC’s list of textbooks were included during the previous BoS meeting,. But they are removing it under some kind of pressure. VNSGU’s Gujarat department head Sharifa Vijlivala was the only member who objected to this decision,” Mehta told TOI.

Chairperson of Gujarati BoS, Rujuta Gandhi, said, “VC and others asked me to make changes in the syllabus as per outcome of Gyan Sangam and government’s guidelines. So I suggested them to bring it in BoS. I was against some changes but I also believe that both sides have their reservations and ultimately it is the loss of students. Both sides are trying to play politics.”

A BoS member added, “They called the meeting specifically to make these changes and many members were not from Gujarati subject in BoS of Gujarati. They took the decisions by majority and there is no one to stop them.”

Ketan Desai, a professor of science and VNSGU syndicate member, said, “It was discussed in Gyan Sangam an event held in university few months ago to revise existing syllabus. I was sent by VNSGU V-C to convey the outcome of Gyan Sangam in the BoS. Some books are being taught for many years, so we proposed that new Gujarati writers should be included.”

Sursinhji Takhatsinhji Gohil (1974-1900), popularly known as Kalapi, was ruler of Lathi state currently in Amreli district of Gujarat. In a short life, his creations are considered as greatest contribution to Gujarati literature .

Tamas is a novel on backdrop of communal violence during India-Pakistan partition.

AHMEDABAD: Though the academic fraternity is confused about the implementation of the new academic calendar, the state government said it is prepared to ensure smooth implementation. Secretary, primary and secondary education, Vinod Rao, said that elaborate planning is in place. “There will be no dearth of textbooks,” Rao said. “The printing of textbooks for Classes IX to XII is complete and they will be distributed in March. Almost 70% of printing of textbooks for Classes VI to VIII is complete. The printing for Classes I to VIII will finish by mid-March.” The state education department has printed almost 50% extra books to meet the demand.However, confusion still prevails following the announcement of change in the academic session to April-March from June-May. Educators say that the circular lacks clarity on multiple fronts. Moreover, parents have had to cancel their vacation plans. In the circular, the education department has asked schools to start the new academic session from April 20 this year and from the first week of April from 2020-21. The circular also says that to reduce the stress, there will be only two exams — in October and March.Most schools say the change should have been introduced as a pilot project this year and across state next year as it will be tough for schools in rural areas to make the switch. The biggest challenge is that exams conclude in the second week of April. Schools will have limited time to declare results if the session commences from April 20. Besides, teachers will have to deal with invigilation of exams, checking of papers, and teaching. “The students fail to get books till June,” an educator said. “How will they arrange for them in April?”Citing the scorching heat of April, Prutha Desai, the mother of a Class V student, said: “My daughter is in the afternoon shift. How will she endure the heat?” However, some in the education fraternity see the positive side. Preeta Pillai, another educator, said: “The move will bring us on a par with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). With only two exams, the stress on students will be reduced.”“Vacations have not been curtailed,” Rao said. “Schools were functioning, and we have now included teaching.” As for cancelled vacations, he said: “The academic calendar was declared last year.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053311,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-195038,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/schools-set-for-new-academic-calendar/articleshow/74051450.cms

HYDERABAD: The long-pending demand of Telangana farmers of getting minimum support price ( MSP ) for turmeric may be delayed further as nine other states have also joined the spice bandwagon.The National Task Force, constituted after Nizamabad farmers took up an agitation, is assessing prices quoted by different states and the highest was sought by Tamil Nadu at Rs 12, 500. The variation, in prices quoted by the states, might delay any announcement on MSP, highly-placed sources said.Apart from Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and a few north eastern states were involved in consultations with the Task Force committee. Farmers, various stake-holders and state governments had represented before the panel. Sources in the Union agriculture ministry told TOI that the Telangana government reportedly recommended Rs 9,000 per quintal as the MSP. Curiously, the state government has given three different prices before three different central teams.Apart from the Task Force committee, two central teams from the ministries of commerce and agriculture also visited the turmeric-growing states. The state government had recommended between Rs 6,500 and Rs 12,000 before the central teams. The sources said the farmers of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra expressed satisfaction with the Rs 9,000 per quintal, but Tamil Nadu farmers wanted Rs 12, 500 per quintal as the production cost was high in their state.Though turmeric was part of the spice board along with 57 other crops, it was not included in the list of crops for which MSP was being declared, as it was considered a perishable crop. “The final decision will be delayed though getting MSP for turmeric is most likely,” the official said.Meanwhile, the TRS government refused to send any letter as sought by Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal on MSP recommendation.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74057650,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-318588,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/t-farmers-wait-to-get-turmeric-msp-may-get-longer/articleshow/74051465.cms
146,['10/02/2020'],Smokers must go for screening to detect lung cancer early: Doctors,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: Most people are aware cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer. Still, not many are ready or able to quit smoking. Doctors advise that such people should at least get themselves screened regularly for lung cancer to ensure early detection.

“No doubt treatments are getting better but lung cancer still kills more men and women than any other type of cancer,” said Dr Subhrajit Dasgupta, director of Rashtrasant Tukdoji Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, on Sunday.

“Lungs are internal organs and there are no visible symptoms like lumps in case of lung cancer. Still, smokers must understand that they are at risk. They must not ignore any cough that stays more than three weeks even after taking medicines,” he said.

He was speaking at ‘Update on lung cancer’, organized by RST Cancer Hospital and Indian Medical Association (IMA) Nagpur branch. Expert pulmonologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, and surgeons discussed various aspects of lung cancer which has highest rate of mortality in all cancers.

According to pulmonologist Dr Rajesh Swarnakar, majority of patients with lung cancer die within a year of diagnosis and only 17% of them can survive for five years. “This is because lung cancer patient report at advanced stage,” he said.

Doctors also said that there is no screening programme for lung cancer in India so far. “A person who is smoking from a significant period should meet doctors and go for CT Scan. Early detection and quitting smoking may add some more years to your life,” said pulmonologist Dr Sushant Meshram.

Dr Deepak Muthreja spoke about endobronchial ultrasound trans-bronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) which is initial diagnostic and staging procedure in patients suspected with lung cancer. “This technique is faster, cheaper and effective than CT or PET scan. It provides real-time imaging of the surface of the airways, blood vessels, lungs, and lymph nodes,” he said.

Histopathologist Dr Kamayani Deshpande spoke on challenges in diagnosis of lung cancer. Dr Vaibhav Chaudhary and Dr Parag Ingle elaborated on current trends. Joint director of RST Hospital Dr Prasanna Joshi coordinated the interactive session while Dr B K Sharma conducted the proceedings.

Lung cancer: Who needs screening

Lung cancer is deadly because it usually does not show any symptoms

It gets diagnosed mostly in advanced stage when it is difficult to cure

People above 50 years of age who currently smoke should be screened for lung cancer once a year

Even those who have quit smoking need to be screened once in a year up to 15 years

Smokers should go for screening even if they are not experiencing clinical signs or symptoms

Screening includes a low dose CT scan and a clinical evaluation which is painless and fast

Thiruvananthapuram: Dismissing allegations that the state budget failed to give due consideration to the needs of the state capital, Kadakampally Surendran, the only minister representing the district, said the government was implementing ‘unparalleled’ development works in Thiruvananthapuram.

“It’s been a deliberate campaign which began on social-media platforms, where the BJP now has a big influence. However, the people are convinced about ongoing developmental activities in Thiruvananthapuram,” the cooperation and devaswom minister told reporters here on Sunday.

Elaborating on various ongoing and proposed works in the state capital, Surendran said the only shortcoming was the procedural delay, which needs to be addressed efficiently. “The government has adopted a comprehensive development policy for the capital district considering its future possibilities.”

The 2020-21 budget has proposed PWD works worth an estimated Rs 1,696 crore in the district for which Rs 42 crore has been earmarked as token advance, Surendran said. “An amount of Rs 3,008.20 crore has been sanctioned by KIIFB for implementing 96 projects, which can change the face of the state capital,” the minister asserted.

A major project approved in the budget is the development of Kattakkada Junction, for which Rs 100 crore has been earmarked, while a total of 48 projects , estimated between Rs 10 crore and Rs 50 crore, have been allocated Rs 969 crore for this year alone, Surendran said. This is apart from the Rs 350 crore set apart this year for Vizhinjam seaport, besides Rs 21.5 crore for Travancore Titanium, Rs 13.6 crore for Kerala Automobiles, Rs 6 crore for Thiruvananthapuram Spinning Mill and Rs 5 crore for Handicrafts Development Corporation in the industry sector.

“At least half of the Rs 153 crore announced for the handloom sector is for Thiruvananthapuram, besides the Rs 1,000 crore earmarked for the coastal zone package. The district will also have a good share in the west coast canal and coastal and hill highway projects,” he said.

Under KIIFB projects, a total of Rs 1,133.63 crore has been sanctioned for 24 roads, Rs 65 crore for five bridges and Rs 316 crore for four flyovers including Ulloor, Pattom and Sreekaryam, the minister said. Thiruvananthapuram has been sanctioned Rs 209 crore under the hill highway project, Rs 544 crore for drinking water projects, Rs 141 crore for development of hospitals and Rs 100 crore for IT Park at Techno City, he added.

Surendran, who also holds the tourism portfolio, said tourism projects worth Rs 450 crore were being implemented in the district. “An amount of Rs 317 crore is being spent for development of destinations including Kovalam, Shankumugham, Veli, Akkulam, Varkala and Kappil. The first phase cleaning work of the Kovalam-Varkala stretch of the Kovalam-Bakel national waterway is nearing completion,” he said.

Referring to BJP workers burning effigies of the chief minister, the finance minister and himself on Saturday, Surendran said, they (the BJP workers) should have burnt effigies of Prime Minister Modi and other representatives of the central government instead for ‘the anti-Kerala stand’ they have adopted.

151,['10/02/2020'],Toxic waste in stream: Firm gets closure notice,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala water authority (KWA) temporarily stopped pumping from its Kundamankadavu pump house following chemical contamination in a stream near its source. The health wing of the city corporation has slapped closure notice on an electroplating unit in Vayalikkada in this regard. The action was taken after finding that employees of the unit dumped chemical waste in a drain leading to the stream.

KWA officials said that they have resumed pumping by Sunday night after finding that samples taken from near the KWA source were not contaminated.

Residents had noticed floating dead fish in the stream that leads to Karamana River at Vayalikara, around 2-3km away from the pump house on Sunday morning. Following the complaint, corporation officials visited the area and found that a local firm – Matha Industries, which is engaging in electroplating works – has dumped chemical waste into the drain on Saturday evening.

Health standing committee chairman I P Binu said that a team of officials from corporation, including three health inspectors, reached the spot on Sunday morning. He said that samples collected will be sent for testing on Monday.

“We got complaints that people spotted dead fish in the stream near Haritha Nagar at Vayalikkada, Vazhottukonam. In the preliminary investigation, we found that the staff had dumped a chemical named ‘Surfolin sk 40’, an alkaline soak cleaner, into the drain, which seem to have caused the contamination. We have collected samples from the firm, drain and the stream,” he said. Binu said that people depending on KWA water should use only boiled water for drinking purpose.

“The firm has been asked to arrange three tanks to purify water. It has been directed to release water to drain only after purification,” said health inspector S S Minu.

The Vattiyoorkavu police have registered a case suo motu in connection with the incident, invoking relevant sections for polluting water sources of the public. “The health department officials have collected samples from the stream to find out the nature of toxic material dumped into the stream,” said Vattiyoorkavu sub-inspector D Suvarnakumar.

As KWA stopped pumping for several hours, water supply was disrupted in areas such as Vattiyoorkavu, Thirumala, Poojappura, Karamana, Valiyavila and Vellayambalam. KWA officials said that water supply will be normalized in these areas only by Monday noon.

Madurai: Madras high court has directed officials to continue paying monthly pension to an elderly woman from Theni district saying the reasons cited in the order to stop the pension are not sustainable.

Petitioner Lakshmi, 80, who lives separately from her two sons and daughter was sanctioned monthly pension by the special tahsildar for social security scheme under the Indira Gandhi National old age pension scheme at Andipatti on March 13, 2012. However, it was withdrawn suddenly from October 2013. Since there was no response to her petitions, she moved HC Madurai bench in 2019 following which the court directed the officials to consider her representation and pass orders on merit. Thereafter, the special tahsildar passed an order dated July 30, 2019, stopping monthly pension to the petitioner. Lakshmi moved the court again this year seeking to quash the order. Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana observed that the rejection order passed by the officials stated that the petitioner is the owner of two acres of land and has two sons. The order also says that the sons who are 62 and 58 years have no jobs and the land has been partitioned among the two. The petitioner is also hearing impaired and unable to do any work by herself. The judge noted that the special government pleader submitted that they are willing to continue paying pension of Rs 1,000 considering the petitioner’s age. The judge observed that there is no reason for withdrawal of the monthly pension from October 2013 and the officials are dutybound to pay the arrears to the petitioner. Though the special government pleader submitted that it would be difficult to heed the request as it will lead to many petitions claiming arrears, she submitted that arrears would be paid to the petitioner for 2019 by treating it as a special case. With the petitioner’s counsel also agreeing, the judge directed payment of Rs 12,000 arrears to the petitioner for 2019 in four weeks.

The special tahsildar was also asked to pay monthly pension of Rs 1,000 from January 2020 throughout her lifetime.

Bareilly: A 40-year-old farmer was gored to death by a stray bull in Tilhar area of Shahjahanpur district on Sunday afternoon. The victim was keeping his crop when a herd of stray cattle barged into his farm. When he was trying to shoo them away, a giant bull charged at him and gored him to death.

After the incident, locals gathered and caught the bull and handed it over to nagar panchayat officials. Police sent the body for autopsy.

Victim Virendrapal was the eldest among his five brothers and used to live in a joint family.

Virendrapal’s father said Virendra had died before farmers came to his rescue.

Tilhar police station SHO Sanjay Rai said, “A team of the administration will visit the bereaved family and initiative the process for granting ex gratia in accordance with law.”

154,['10/02/2020'],University of Hyderabad fails to conduct audit for admissions,"This story is from February 10, 2020

University of Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: Despite the 84th Academic Council (AC) of University of Hyderabad ( UoH ) passing a resolution to audit all admissions at the university to find discrepancies in seat allotment, the varsity failed to conduct an audit in the past year.

The decision to audit was taken after students alleged that the varsity was discriminating against reserved category students, especially at Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) level.

“ In the last AC meet, it was resolved that UoH would initiate an audit of admission in all departments to ensure that seat allotments are happening as per regulations. However, for some reason the audit did not happen,” said a senior professor of UoH, who was part of the meet in March, 2019.

Teaching faculty said that the issue cropped in only after the University Grants Commission (UGC) came up with a limit on number of research scholars a professor, associate professor, or assistant professor can have. “Earlier, a professor could guide unlimited students. But later, UGC said a professor can guide a maximum of eight students. Soon students started alleging about discrepancies,” a professor said.

Vinod Pavarala, chair of the admission grievance committee 2019-20, who inquired into the issue during the August 2019 session after students submitted a petition, said that at least seven students benefited after the committee redirected department heads to reconsider recommendations.

“In some cases there were no candidates in a category and in other cases even when students were available, a department did not fill seats. That is when we asked them to reconsider their decision,” Vinod said.

“Had they done the audit it would have given us a clear picture,” said Iniyavan M, president, Ambedkar Students Association.

155,['10/02/2020'],Send sexual harassment plaint to police: HC to MSU,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Madurai: Madras high court has directed the registrar of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University (MSU), Tirunelveli, to forward a sexual harassment complaint against an assistant professor to the police. Justice G R Swaminathan passed the order while hearing the plea filed by a victim seeking a direction to the university to lodge a complaint with the police.

The petitioner said that Vinod Vincent Rajesh, an assistant professor in the history department, committed acts of sexual harassment when she was a student of the university. Based on the complaint lodged by her and other victims, an inquiry committee was constituted. The judge noted that the petitioner’s counsel submitted that the committee found the assistant professor guilty of acts alleged against him. The university syndicate also passed a resolution in 2016 accepting the committee’s report and resolved to treat his period of suspension as punishment and stoppage of two increments with cumulative effect was also ordered.

However, the grievance of the petitioner is that the action taken by the university is wholly insufficient. The petitioner’s counsel drew the court’s attention to section 11 of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, which mandates the committee to forward the complaint to police for registration of case under IPC section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) or any other provisions within seven days if a prima facie case exists. The judge noted that the university has failed to forward the complaint to the jurisdictional police in this case. Though the standing counsel for the university stated that he would get instructions as to whether such action is taken, the court said it is of the view that it is not necessary to adjourn the case for the purpose.

It is seen that the cause of action arose in 2015 and the complaint was made in July 2016. The judge observed that though the petition was filed way back in February 2016, the case had been taken up for final disposal only in January 2020. “It is seen that the offence under IPC section 509 is punishable only up to three years. Therefore, neither the police nor the jurisdictional magistrate will close the complaint on the ground of infraction of the statutory mandate under Section 468 Cr.P.C. This is because, the petition filed by the petitioner has been pending before this court for four full years,” observed the judge.

Hence the judge directed the registrar to forward the complaint along with the committee’s report dated August 14, 2015 to the police in three weeks. The judge further directed the inspector of police of Pettai police station to register FIR on receiving the complaint and conclude the investigation in three months.

HYDERABAD: City police on Sunday slapped a case of rioting against several people for holding flash protests against CAA in Mallepally area during night time.

Police invoked stringent sections under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property (PDPP) Act against the agitators in order to curb the increasing number of flash protests being held at night.

Mild tension prevailed near Riyan Hotel under Habeeb Nagar police station limits on Saturday night after a large group of protesters, including women activists Khaleda parveen and Sheeba Minai, staged a flash protest against the CAA, NRC and NPR.

Sleuths from the police commissioner’s task force, quick reaction team and local police were pressed into service. As many as 34 protesters, including 22 men and 12 women, were arrested from the protest site. Most of them were detained at Goshamahal police stadium while the women were taken to the women’s police station at CCS.

Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Addressing the demand for additional parking space in Thampanoor, the railways has expanded parking facilities at Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station. The area near Thampanoor flyover has been cleared for parking four-wheelers.

Central station director Ajay Kaushik said the extended parking area can accommodate 70 cars.

""Passengers have been demanding additional car parking facilities and the available space was proving inadequate. The land near the flyover had become a dumping ground for construction debris and other waste. An authorised agency was handed over the construction material and plastic bottles collected from the area were sent to a shredding unit. Some vehicles were found parked or abandoned in the area, which will be auctioned as per procedure. A 2,000 sqm area has been cleared and made available for four-wheeler parking at the entry to the station,"" said Kaushik.

Normal parking fees will be charged in the extended area.

The Central station only had parking space for 75 cars. There is space for 20 cars in the premium parking area. Parking at the Power House Road entry can take 30 cars. Also, 500-odd two-wheelers can be parked next to the main entry and around 400 two-wheelers on the Power House Road side.

Railway also proposes to close the staff parking space under the flyover. “Illegal parking is rampant here and this affects the revenue of the railways. So, it has been decided to relocate staff parking to the main parking yard and make it a people-entry gate,” Kaushik said.

Around 400 parking passes have been issued to railway employees working at the station.

Bijnor: After a spurt in locust attacks in Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Gujarat and other states recently, Uttar Pradesh agriculture department has issued a high alert in the state in this regard. Locally called ‘Tiddi Dal’, locusts are known to attack healthy crop on farmlands. According to experts, this time of the year is highly sensitive because locusts reproduce during this month. All the village pradhans and farmers have been alerted about the locust attacks and have been asked to inform the district authorities if they spot any such incident.

The state government has issued advisory to all district magistrates, especially districts bordering Haryana where advent of locust swarms was reported.

Bijnor DM Ramakant Pandey said, “We have sounded alert among all farmers, revenue staff and village heads about potential invasion of locust swarms here. Locusts have been wreaking havoc in Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan and now Haryana too, which borders west UP.”

“Spring season has begun which is conducive to locusts for breeding and reproduction. Locusts thrive and flourish in loam soil. Farmers should regularly plough such type of farmland. If villagers spot swarms of locusts, they should immediately inform the administration, so that appropriate steps could be taken,” Pandey said.

Deputy director, agriculture, JP Chaudhary said, “Farmers can scare away locusts by beating the drum. Besides, they can take chlorpyrifos 20% EC insecticide from us and spray it on their crop. Grasshopper swarms can cause an epidemic if farmers show negligence and do not take measures at earliest. Locusts subsist on green leaves and are able to destroy crops very fast, particularly potato, wheat, mustard and sugarcane crops. In Punjab, fire brigade was used to curb locusts. We can also apply that method here.”

More than 1.68 lakh hectares of farmland in the country has been affected by locusts with Rajasthan and Gujarat taking the worst hit. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had recently told Rajya Sabha that 88% of total 1,68,548 hectares of affected farmland witnessed severe crop loss of more than 33%.

Madurai: Madras high court has sought a counter from the state government on a petition seeking to safeguard the ornaments of Adikesava Perumal temple in Kanyakumari district. In his petition, N Thangappan, the president of Sree Adikesava Seva Trust, stated that the temple situated at Thiruvattar is one of the 108 divya desams. Though it is under the control of HR & CE department since 1960, no proper records have been maintained by the officials about the jewels and ornaments of the deities.

Due to this, the temple employees including archakars started to loot the ornaments. After the people staged a protest and submitted complaints repeatedly in 1992, CB-CID officials from Tirunelveli conducted an inquiry and subsequently several people including three archakars were convicted. He stated that though archakars of the temple were convicted for looting the ornaments of the temple, their successors are still allowed to perform pujas at the temple.

It was in this context that the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking to publish the list of ornaments and also display them to the public by adorning the deities with them. He further sought to remove such archakars whose family have bad antecedents from the temple. To this, a division bench of Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice T Ravindran directed the state government to file a counter and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Hyderabad: The plastic industry in the state is expanding, say experts who feel the region is well on the way to developing into a plastic manufacturing hub. Industries secretary Jayesh Ranjan said, “We have a 1,500-unit strong industry, located in and around the city.”

Vimalesh Gupta, president, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Plastic Manufacturer’s association, said that in the past five years, an equal number of new units have been established in Telangana. Both said the figures are conservative estimates as the unorganised sector is largely unmapped. Ranjan said several big players are setting up shop in the state at the proposed plastic park. Addressing the issue of single-use plastics, Ranjan said though 60-65% of plastics produced are the single-use variety, he said efforts were being made to phase out their production.

Gupta said, “Rs 1,500 crore investment has been made in single-use plastic sector in five years. The average turnover from single-use plastics Rs 40-45 crore per day.” While Kattedan sill remains a hub for plastics, Gupta said newer areas were emerging such as Chandrayangutta and the area around Zoo park. tnn

Meerut: Nearly a week after a newborn was stolen from Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical (LLRM) College here, police are yet to trace the woman who was seen allegedly fleeing with the baby boy by his father.

Police have set up several teams to crack the case and various angles are being probed. Sources say a Bihar gang may be behind kidnapping the baby.

Akhilesh Singh, Meerut SP city, said, “We have got inputs from reliable sources that the accused might be a part of a Bihar-based gang. However, we are yet to confirm these facts and are investigating all angles.”

Earllier, TOI had reported how a newborn boy was stolen allegedly by a woman in her forties from LLRM College on February 3. The baby’s family mistook the woman as hospital staff when she started helping them. She allegedly stole the baby by asking his father to dispose of a diaper. As soon as the man went near the dustbin, the woman fled with the baby. He tried to chase her but she melted into the crowd.

The baby was stolen from outside the nursery. However, the CCTV cameras were not working near the spot. It was only after hospital authorities checked other cameras in the vicinity that the woman could be spotted.

“We have set up different police teams and have also pasted pamphlets with the picture of the woman at different spots. Efforts are being made to arrest the accused at the earliest,” said Kulveer Singh, station house officer, Medical College police station. An FIR has also been filed in the matter.

The baby was kept in the nursery for observation for two hours. During this time, a mysterious woman struck up a conversation with Sumaiya’s husband, Asif. She helped him as men were not allowed in the ward where his wife was admitted. Later, she accompanied him to the nursery when he went to take the baby. The woman then volunteered to change the baby’s diaper and asked Asif to throw away the used one in the dustbin. According to the inquiry, it has been found that in the few seconds that he turned away to throw the waste in the bin, the woman fled with the baby. He even tried to follow her but failed.

Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) plans to merge its postgraduate department of law with its Babasaheb Ambedkar College of Law has courted a major controversy.

Vice-chancellor SP Kane has made a U-turn after issuing directives in September last year and forming a committee led by himself and college principal Shrikant Komawar as member-secretary following objections from a section of NU as well as former statutory bodies.

While the committee members are viewing the move as beneficial for students, the opponents have expressed concern over loss of jobs to teachers at the PG department and disturbance to the roster. The formation of committee and the directives too have come under scanner.

The opponents have called the committee and the Direction 40 of 2019 as “illegal” and “arbitrary”.

VC Kane didn’t respond to TOI’s calls. Acting pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande said no decision has been taken so far regarding merger issue. “A committee under my chairmanship is constituted to study the issue. We will be seeking opinion of stakeholders, social thinkers, etc. It is a proposal. Legal issues if any will also be taken into account,” he said.

In September last year, the committee ‘RTMNU Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar College of Law Management Committee for Management and Maintenance of the College’ was formed. Besides Kane and Komawar, the committee comprises two management council members, a retired judge of SC or HC within NU jurisdiction, a senior advocate, one full-time teacher of the college, joint director and internal quality cell officer.

Among the key functions of the committee is to suggest amalgamation take over or merger of the college with any other postgraduate teaching department of the university to create a new teaching and research institution with new suitable names. Also, it has been mandated to prepare an overall comprehensive plan for the growth and development of the college, covering infrastructure, and academic programmes.

Former management council member Mahendra Nimbarte said the university has no powers to form such a committee as per the Maharashtra Public Universities Act, 2016. “It is an illegal committee. Every one was kept in the dark. If this merger happens, then teachers will lose jobs while the roster will get disturbed. When we spoke to the VC, he denied having any knowledge of the direction. It suggests he signed it without reading or maybe he was misled,” Nimbarte said.

Speaking to reporters in Madurai on Sunday, BJP National Secretary H Raja said DMK and its allies were trying to create unrest in Tamil Nadu in the name of religion. “Will these parties which are demanding that rituals be performed in Tamil in temples also demand that it be followed in mosques, instead of Arabic?” he said.

He said that the protest in Neyveli was held because filming had been banned there following an accident that occurred previously at the site during the shooting of another movie. “The protest was not against the actor, but filming in a sensitive region,” he said.Raja added that the Tamil Nadu BJP chief would be appointed soon and that the BJP was not a party which went back on its promises. He also condemned the attack on Theni MP P Ravindranath Kumar for his pro-CAA stand. He said that the exit polls should not to be taken seriously.tnn

Hyderabad: Though the industry is batting for single-use plastic, environmentalists feel that reduction of plastic use and consumption is the only way ahead.

“The restrictions put on sale of plastic below 50 microns is not enough. Users can’t judge how thick their bags are. The government should at least have a colour code to help distinguish between different grades of plastic,” said Subba Rao, green activist.

Environmentalist Kajal Maheswari said, “While we can go on debating whether paper cups are better or plastic ones, one needs to understand that the solution lies in reduce of consumption.”

Dishit Rajput (L) training the others

VADODARA: It’s her daily morning routine — get up at dawn and get ready to visit residential colonies in Gotri with her group seeking alms — a ritual that Aradhyaa, a eunuch , has been doing for years now. But that’s about to change. Aradhyaa will soon see a new dawn in her life after she completes her beautician course and starts her own business. All that she now begs from life is to give her the strength to fulfil her dream.

Thanks to 30-year-old Dishit Rajput, a transgender, many more like Aradhyaa will soon see a sea change in their ‘socially excluded’ lives. Rajput’s mission is to take these eunuchs off the street and give them a chance to eke a decent living.

Rajput, who has done diploma in fine arts from Vidyanagar, told TOI, “Since childhood, I have seen eunuchs begging for alms to survive. With ‘them’ being ‘unacceptable’ in society, I wanted to usher in a change in societal perception by including eunuchs in mainstream society. And what can be a better way than to train them with skills that will help them earn self-respect and money too?” After pursuing a beauticians course about 19 years ago, Rajput today runs two salons – one in Wadi and the other in Waghodia — where he employees 45 women.

He has decided to enrol people from the third gender in beautician’s course, teaching them basic skills in facial, manicure, pedicure and applying mehendi — sans payment of any fees or other charges!

He will impart the training at his new parlour in Waghodia. “With some hard work and focus, they will soon pick up the skills and start their own business,” he said. He has already received inquiries from 25 transgenders and 10 have already begun their training in the course which has been kept completely professional, replete with identity cards and parlour rules.

An ebullient Aradhyaa exuded: “I am very excited to learn the new skills and to change my life forever. I am sure people will support me.”

Bijnor: Following threats of conversion by hundreds of Dalit residents of Shyamiwala village in UP's Bijnor district, local administration conceded to their demand for taking out a procession on the occasion of Ravidas Jayanti on Sunday. The procession was stopped by the district administration in 2013 after people of the minority community, who account for 70% population of the village, objected to it.

The ‘shobha yatra’ in honour of Sant Ravidas was taken out on Sunday afternoon amid tight security at Shyamiwala village, 40 km from the district headquarters. Later, cultural programmes depicting Sant Ravidas were held.

Before permitting the procession, police held a meeting with villagers and warned against attempts to disrupt peace. Before the ‘shobha yatra’, police personnel also took out a march through the route to be taken by the procession. Drones were deployed to keep an aerial vigil over the procession.

Lakshmi Nivas Mishra, city’s superintendent of police, said, “We held several meetings with villagers here. The procession was taken out unanimously. Two platoons of PAC and over 150 police constables, sub inspectors were deployed there. Villagers maintained peace.”

IIT Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: For the first time in the history of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), IIT Hyderabad has decided to allow its students to take up a six-month internship beginning from the academic year 2020-21.

Director of IIT-H, BS Murthy, said that the proposal was passed by the senate, which comprises of all heads of the departments and senior faculty members of the institute, recently. He said it will be implemented from August 2020. Until now, students are allowed to do only summer internship in IITs.

“Time and again students have complained that the summer internship is not just enough for them to get industry exposure. So, we have decided to allow them to take up a six-month-long internship,” said Murthy. He said that an option to opt for the internship will be given during the sixth semester to interested students.

The IIT-H director said they are also mulling awarding six or seven credits to internships and the remaining credits of the sixth semester will be adjusted in remaining semesters.

He said they are planning to give a one-year sabbatical to students who want to pursue their ideas in the near future. He said that the proposal is yet to be placed before the senate. “The one-year sabbatical will most likely be offered to second year BTech students. Initially, we will ask them to pursue their idea on the campus and funds will be allotted, if needed, by the institute. Subsequently, based on merit, we will allow students to take a sabbatical,” told Murthy to TOI.

The notes were of high quality, incorporating seven of nine security features.The accused told the police that they were printed in Pakistan and sent to Dubai, with India intended as the final destination. The denomination, when issued in 2016, was touted as highly se cure, but RBI said in October that no Rs 2,000 note was printed in 2019 as NIA had found high-quality fakes.The passenger, Javed Shaikh (36), a Kalwa resident, had been to Dubai and Bangkok in the past and may have brought in many such consignments. Police are questioning him about who the present consignment was meant for.“An average person will not be able to identify the fake notes. Shaikh walked away at the airport’s security check. He was caught at the bus stop outside the international terminal,” said joint commissioner of police (crime) Santosh Rastogi, who did not rule out a terror link. He said Shaikh was caught because of a CIA tipoff.“The counterfeit currency was smartly stuffed in one of his trolley bags. The notes were scattered inside a cushion, which was stuffed into a gap between the bag’s wall and a cloth liner. It took us over an hour to locate the money,” Rastogi said.“A scanner identifies notes if they are kept in bundles. It’s the edges of the bundles that get detected. As opposed to this, Shaikh was carrying the notes in a scattered format, making machine detection difficult,” Rastogi said.On the quality of the notes, a crime branch officer said that the two security features that weren’t copied properly were ‘optically variable ink’ (ink that changes colour with changing angles) and ‘see-through register’ (hidden features that are seen only if a note is held against light).In Video: Mumbai: ‘Pak-made’ fake notes with face value of Rs 24 lakh seized",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74052927,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-154839,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pak-made-fake-rs-2000-notes-with-face-value-of-rs-24-lakh-seized/articleshow/74052928.cms

Meerut: The UP director general (prison administration and reform services), Anand Kumar, recently inaugurated an in-house radio station in Meerut district jail, making it the 26th of 70 jails in UP to be equipped with a fully functional radio station operated by jail inmates. Senior departmental officials claimed all 70 jails in the state will have similar radio stations by end-2021.

Apart from playing songs on request, the radio jockey also reads out information on legal and human rights help for inmates. Announcements related to court hearings of individual inmates and other recreational activities inside prison are also made on radio.

“Lots of inmates suffer from depression. We thought to have something that will provide some entertainment which can help them fight depression to some extent. We’re involving inmates to run the station,” DG (prison) Kumar said.

Unlike normal radio stations, which work on a particular frequency, customised public address systems are used in jails. A room is allotted for the radio jockey and the station, which includes relay and amplifiers. Speakers are mounted in every barrack. Inmates can put in written requests for songs, which the radio jockey plays after announcing the name of the inmate who made the request.

KOLKATA: With the sun emerging out from the cloud cover , the mercury went down a notch below the normal mark on Sunday. Met officials have ruled out the possibility of rain as of now, saying the mercury will plunge further by another two or three degrees by Monday.

The cloud cover, drizzle and light rain in some places in the past few days dragged the day temperature down while pushing up the minimum temperature. The minimum temperature had shot above 17°C on Saturday. It receded to 15.6°C on Sunday, which was one degree below the normal mark.

“The chill-bearing north- westerly wind has started breezing in. The mercury will fall further on Monday. At present, there is no major weather system that will disrupt the path of the northwesterly . Hence, the chill will persist for the next few days,” said GK Das, director (weather) at Regional Meteorological Centre Kolkata .

Two cyclonic circulations — one over Bihar and the other over Vidarbha — had brought the hope for rain on Friday and Saturday. But the city was spared of downpour, though the sky remained overcast. According to Met officials, the clouds that reached the city sky were of medium height and the absence of convection caused little rain. “For now there is no weather system that can bring rain in the city,” said Das.

With the dry and cold northwesterly reaching the city from Sunday evening onwards, the mercury could touch down the 13°C mark by Monday and go slightly further by about a degree on Tuesday.

NEW DELHI: Anand Vihar in east Delhi is one of the city’s biggest transport hubs with the presence of a railway station, two Delhi Metro corridors and two inter-state bus terminals on either side of the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border. A new addition to the hub is going to be the underground Anand Vihar station of the 82-km long Delhi-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) corridor, which will also seamlessly integrate these different modes of transport.The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is building India’s first RRTS corridor, said a key aspect of the planning was the integration of its stations with other modes of transport such as metro train network, bus terminals, airports and Indian Railways through walkways, lifts, escalators, foot bridges and underpasses.An NCRTC spokesperson said, “Anand Vihar is one of the busiest public spaces linked by several modes of public transport. Lakhs of people, among them senior citizens and children, use these transport modes daily, often with heavy luggage. The lack of adequate integration leads to unsafe road crossing and numerous level changes, making the journey unsafe, time consuming and inconvenient, and ultimately forces people to shift to private vehicles.”Of the 22 RRTS stations on the Delhi-Meerut corridor, four are underground, with just the Anand Vihar station among the four in the Delhi stretch of the corridor. The underground station will have some unique features, according to NCRTC. “Only one level will be below the ground,” the spokesperson disclosed. “The platform will be underground but the concourse will be at the ground level.”He pointed out that a typical underground Delhi Metro station was constructed two levels under the ground, with the platform usually located at a depth of 20 metres. In the case of Anand Vihar RRTS station, however, the station will be located just eight metres below ground, and the cut-and-cover method will be employed to construct it.“The construction of this station will be technologically complex as RRTS trains will pass underneath the Delhi metro Blue Line (Dwarka-Vaishali),” the spokesperson said. But he also said that the station design would allow safe, convenient and faster movement of commuters from Anand Vihar RRTS station to the public transport modes and vice-versa. The spokesperson claimed, “Such a design is not only commuter-centric, but will significantly reduce the construction cost of the station.”The idea is that the station design will allow commuters to avoid having to step on the roads while moving from one mode of transport to another. This will be a comparatively safer, more comfortable and hassle-free travel experience for commuters.The spokesperson also said, “Around 11.5 km of the Delhi-Meerut corridor will be underground, of which 5.8 km from the elevated New Ashok Nagar RRTS station to BEL, Ghaziabad, will be in Delhi,” he said. NCRTC has floated the tender for the design and excavation of underground passages by tunnel boring machines in the Delhi segment.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053376,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/rail-road-metro-rrts-station-to-connect-3-modes-at-anand-vihar/articleshow/74051544.cms

Trichy: The private agencies that were entrusted with the task of maintaining the bus shelters in the city by the Trichy City Corporation are turning a blind eye towards the upkeep and the needs of the bus passengers.

Across the 65 wards of the city corporation, there are more than 200 bus shelters. Besides those, few other bus stops were built and maintained by the MLA constituency development fund. Of which 167 shelters have been handed over to private advertisement agencies for maintenance.

In return, the agencies were given the rights to display advertisement hoardings in the bus shelters for a price. While some of the bus shelters are maintained well, the bus stops near schools continues to be in bad shape.

The Cantonment and Palakkarai localities, home to private offices, banks and schools are deprived of a proper bus shelter . While advertisement hoardings atop the bus shelters are brightly illuminated, the seats of the shelters are either broken or missing. Route charts of city buses are also absent. “Newcomers to the city are not aware of the bus stop names. The civic body should ideally name the bus stops for the convenience of passengers,” S R Kishore Kumar, advocate wing, Makkal Needhi Maiam, said.

As the advertisement agencies focus only on the illuminating the hoardings, which brings them revenue, they ignore providing other basic amenities.

Some of the bus shelters in Palakkarai and Williams Road have broken steel chairs, forcing passengers, mostly school students, to stand outside. The bus shelter at Melapudur lacks both the stone bench and steel chairs.

“We will strictly insist the advertisement agencies to provide seating arrangements or we will cancel the agreement with them,” a corporation official said.

Madurai: Despite assurance from the city corporation to block the sewage flow into river Vaigai by constructing a wall along the bank, an NGO found the river still being polluted by the effluent from the same source in a field survey on Sunday.

M Rajan, co-ordinator, NGO Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam, said that 20 members of his team conducted a study on the riverbed from Vilangudi to Viraganoor along the riverbed and found sewage flowing into the river. “We saw the sewage discharged via large pipes running through the newly constructed walls at Aruldosspuram and near the Thiagarajar Arts college,’’ he said.

The NGO said that it saw sewage flow into river in six places, after it was discharged from Government Rajaji Hospital. It kept flowing into the river. “They now claim to have stopped it. However, the hospital has no treatment plant, and the site where the effluence was earlier found is now dug up. You can still see water and sewage there. We suspect the sewage is being discharged through an underground pipe,” said Rajan. He said the discharge of sewage into the river will remain unresolved without a proper action plan. They have decided to submit a report on their Sunday’s finding to the Madurai District Collector T G Vinay on Monday.

A committee appointed by the Madras high court had also confirmed that sewage was indeed being discharged into the river. Meanwhile, Madurai corporation has started work on the Sewage Treatment Plant at Alwarpuram, which is expected to solve the problem completely.

Discounted monthly and yearly passes will be issued to those interested, including shop owners. “We have fixed the rate for monthly passes at Rs 150 for two-wheelers. The rate for four-wheelers will be decided in the next few days,” Juwarker said, adding that an app is being developed to make the pass system paperless.

Once charged, parking fees will be considered valid for any other parking location within CCP’s jurisdiction for that time slot. Government vehicles will be exempted from paying for parking.

Trichy: A four-year-old male sambar deer that fell into a 16 foot-deep well near Manikandam of Pudukottai district was rescued on Saturday.

The rescue operation, which lasted for over a couple of hours, left a couple of forest department personnel injured. However, the animal was captured and safely released into Pachamalai reserve forest.

The incident happened on Saturday morning. The locals alerted forest department about a sambar deer falling into an open well in an agriculture farm behind the office of block development officer in Manikandam.

The forest department team along with volunteers reached the spot and pulled the deer out of the well using ropes. After the deer was rescued from the well, it ran into a nearby canal and was taken out of the canal after a brief rescue effort.

Trichy forest range officer, R Gunasekaran, who was leading the rescue team, said that it was a tedious task as the deer was weighed over 200 kg. “We decided to release the deer in Pachamalai forest,” said Gunasekaran. “Usually success rate of rescue mission is very low in case of spotted deer as these are very timid and often die out of shock during rescue. However, sambar deer are ferocious like bulls. Once we covered its eyes, it was quiet and we could translocate it to Pachamalai hill,” said honorary district animal welfare officer, G Ramakrishnan from animal welfare board of India (AWBI), who was part of the rescue.

There were not many sambar deer recorded in the recent time in Manikandam area. Besides, Thuvarankurichi reserve forest is the nearest forest to Manikandam at about 40 km.

While the forest officials, too, were puzzled over its appearance in Manikandam, range officer said that it could have travelled from Pudukottai or Sivagangai forest and entered Thuavarankurichi forest.

Panaji: Speedy compensation, tiger conservation awareness and efforts to formulate a relocation policy for people living near forest areas, are some of the measures the state forest department is going to adopt to deal with the man-animal conflict in Goa.

“There is a Dhangar community residing in the areas where the tigers frequent, and they only own cattle for their livelihood. So obviously they will attract tigers. We need to develop a relocation policy so that the people benefit more by coming to the town area,” state’s chief wildlife warden, Santosh Kumar said.

“The compensation process is also being sped up so that they receive the money within two to three days. Thirdly, we have to sensitise people about tiger conservation,” he said.

The forest official further informed that the tiger nails that were found have been sent to forensic labs outside Goa. “The matter will go to court after we file a chargesheet based on the reports we receive,” Kumar said.

Following the death of four tigers in Goa within a span of less than a week, the department is maintaining round the clock vigilance.

“We’re monitoring the situation and trying to work with people so that we can minimise the man-animal conflict as well as attacks on cattle,” said principal chief conservator of forests, Subhash Chandra.

Trichy: Directorate of vigilance and anti-corruption (DVAC) in Ariyalur nabbed two employees of Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation ( Tangedco ) for demanding and accepting bribe for obtaining electricity connection on Saturday night.

Sources said that a farmer, identified as Dharmalingam of Karkudi in Ariyalur, approached the Tangedco office in Suthamalli seeking electricity connection to operate a borewell in his agriculture field.

Though the farmer paid a sum of Rs 2.45 lakh to Tangedco, two employees of Tangedco, identified as one assistant engineer Rajiv Gandhi and a foreman Sarvanan with Suthamalli Tangedco substation, sought Rs 10,000 as bribe to facilitate the electricity connection.

Unwilling to pay the bribe, the farmer Dharmalingam approached DVAC Ariyalur and registered a complaint. As per the directives of DVAC, the farmer on Saturday night handed out a few chemically laced currencies to the two Tangedco employees. Subsequently, the duo was caught red-handed by the DVAC sleuths. The accused employees were remanded under judicial custody on Sunday.

190,['10/02/2020'],Cannot afford to lose coal block again: CM,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Panaji: While admitting that Goa lacks the fiscal space to pay the performance guarantee for the Dongeri Tal-II coal block in Madhya Pradesh, chief minister Pramod Sawant told Goa Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC) that the state cannot afford to lose out on the coal block for a second time.

Sawant asked GIDC to explore “various options” to raise the funds required to develop and mine the coal block. GIDC now plans to either take a loan or ask the mine developer operator (MDO) to make the payments on behalf ofGoa. “As far as performance security and other financial commitments are concerned, GIDC may explore various options. In any case, GIDC cannot afford to lose the coal block allocation,” Sawant wrote in his file notings.

Goa is running out of time to pay the performance guarantee for the coal block, with Coal India limited (CIL) serving an ultimatum to GIDC to make the necessary payments within the next three months. “One thing is certain, if we delay again, they will cancel the allotment ,” industries minister Vishwajit Rane said.

According to the industries department, the capital cost to develop the coal mine is Rs 500 crore while Rs 196.5 crore has to be paid upfront as performance security.

GIDC sought the funds from the finance department which rejected the proposal due to lack of funds. “There is no fiscal space available under State Guarantee Act to provide performance guarantee. Grant of guarantee of Rs 196.5 crore is a potential risk adding to our liabilities,” the finance department said.

The allotment of Dongeri Tal-II coal block is for the purpose of sale of coal and not for power generation and GIDC could stand to benefit from the revenues generated from the coal block.

GIDC has already received the mine plan and mine closure plan. The environment clearance (EC) for open cast, mining lease and consent to establish have been obtained, but a detailed report on the mine’s potential has yet to be prepared.

“A proposal for appointing monitoring committee to monitor the development of coal block and a screening committee for evaluation of the consultant is under consideration of the government. A consultant and a MDO has to be appointed at the earliest,” Rane said.

Justice (retd) Z K Saiyed

Vadodara: Adopting an interdisciplinary approach in education, city-based Parul University (PU) blended science and law streams to provide practical solution to some of the lacunae in the criminal justice system.

University’s applied science faculty organised an expert lecture on the ‘judicial perspective of investigation and evidence’ on Saturday. It was delivered by one of the most notable legal luminaries of the state, justice (retd) Z K Saiyed.

Justice Saiyed, former Gujarat high court judge, shared his insightful perspective on forensic handwriting expertise as well as on the significance of post-mortem and inquest panch-nama, strangulation, among various other topics.

Over 150 law and forensic science students attended the lecture, where Saiyed shared his expertise on various landmark judgments, which he had delivered over time on this subject, along with other concepts pertaining to test and investigation of samples examined by forensic laboratories and cross examinations.

Additionally, a book titled ‘Rule of law and the conscience balance in Ethiopia’ authored by PU’s PhD law student Wolle Abegaz Yesuf was also unveiled by the retired judge and university’s dean of law Dr Akil Saiyed.

The varsity has been engaging with various notable experts within the field of law including justice Ravi Tripathi, justice K A Puj in the past too to help students learn more. “Hosting personalities of such an esteemed stature, who have made vast contributions to our nation’s legal fraternity is of vital importance for us as a university” said PU’s president Dr Devanshu Patel.

192,['10/02/2020'],Delhi: Nod to expand waste plant at Okhla draws ire of locals,"This story is from February 10, 2020

The ministry has allowed the plant to increase its generation by 7 MW

NEW DELHI: Going back on its previous directions, the Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) has now allowed the Okhla waste-to-energy plant to increase its power generation from 16 MW to 23 MW by amending the environmental clearance the plant had received in 2007.

The latest documents, which have been accessed by TOI, show the environment ministry has allowed the plant to increase its generation by 7 MW “without increasing the municipal solid waste (MSW) intake and without installing any additional equipment.” “..The ministry hereby amends the environmental clearance dated 21.3.2007 and 9.5.2007 for increase in power generation from 16 MW to 23 MW without increasing MSW intake and without installing any additional equipment..” the order states.

Additional conditions have also been imposed on the plant. No further expansion will be permitted beyond the 23 MW power generations capacity at the site, considering its proximity to the Sukhdev Vihar residential colony, which is less than 100 metres away.

Other conditions include online emissions monitoring for all parameters and that the plant should be run in automatic mode to achieve stable operating conditions. “Online emission monitoring equipment for all parameters provided in the guidelines for continuous emission monitoring systems shall be installed and connected to CPCB and DPCC servers,” the order stated.

However, locals say that meeting the increased power demand without increasing the waste intake is not possible, stating the ministry has completely disregarded the report by the expert appraisal committee (EAC). “EAC had stated that the calorific value of the waste is below 1,000 kcal per kg, which is far below requirement. How can the plant now produce more electricity with less waste?” said Vinayak Malik, general secretary, RWA, Sukhdev Vihar. “In its report, EAC also called for expansion only at the operator’s second site at Tehkhand and not at present site because of its close proximity to residential areas. This direction has also been violated.”

In September 2019, the ministry had observed a number of violations at the plant, stating it was not only handling more unsegregated waste per day than approved, but it is also managing the entire process at one location instead of the two allotted to it. The order, dated September 4, had also stated that the plant had increased its capacity to 20 MW against the 16 MW approved, meaning more refuse derived fuel is being processed and at higher emission levels. The order had directed the CPCB to carry out an ecological damage assessment study and to monitor dioxins and furans from the fuel gas once a month.

The environment ministry had also stated that CPCB would decide a compensation amount to be deposited by the project proponent for “restoration of natural resources and pollution control measures”.

194,['10/02/2020'],Wadettiwar again pushes for lifting of Chanda liquor ban,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Yavatmal: Liquor mafia has thrived in Chandrapur district ever since prohibition was imposed there and even police have failed to curb illicit liquor smuggling as a formidable lobby is at work, said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Saturday.

The minister was addressing a press conference after visiting two hamlets in Yavatmal district — Bhandari (Nath) dominated by Nathjogi community and Bhamb (Raja) where majority of Wadar community members reside.

“The ban has actually proved counterproductive in Chandrapur as it has led to mafia activities leading to unhealthy competition causing threat to life and property of the people,” said Wadettiwar, hinting at pushing for lifting of the liquor ban from the district.

Commenting on NCP minister Jayant Patil backing the demand for declaring Yavatmal as a dry district, Wadettiwar said if prohibition is imposed, the flow of illicit liquor will increase followed by its sale at exorbitant prices.

Earlier, addressing the residents of the hamlets, Wadettiwar said a new policy for improving the living standard of vimukta bhatkya jamati (nomadic tribes) in the state will be formulated soon. The minister also assured the gathering that the state would solve the housing problem faced by villagers.

“I am aware that the roaming Nathjogi community members are deprived of domicile certificate and hence they are denied benefits of several welfare schemes including Gharkul under which the state has promised to build houses for the marginalized sections,” he said and assured the community of removing this lacuna soon.

Expressing concern over the conditions in which the nomadic tribes are living, Wadettiwar urged them to send their children to school as without education there can never be any progress for the community. He also promised to reserve seats for children from the community in English medium schools.

“Providing roof over heads alone will not improve the living standard,” he said. Youth from both Nathjogi and Wadar communities should be encouraged to go for self employment using new technology, he added.

The minister was accompanied by principal secretary JP Gupta, assistant secretary Gavit, deputy commissioner Vijay Salve, Devanand Pawar, Narayanan Shinde, Jitendra Moghe, Rahul Thakre, Anil Ade, tehsildar Dheeraj Sthul, sarpanch Chandrakala Shinde and others.

Madurai: At least 50 houses in Sastha Street in Pandian Nagar in ward 29 of Madurai corporation have been affected by overflowing sewage water caused by encroachment in the adjacent canal and lack of maintenance. This is not the first time sewage water has entered homes in this area. People say that they have brought the issue to the knowledge of corporation officials but has not been set right.

Syed Ahamed Basha from Yagappa Nagar said although there is underground drainage system in Tahsildar Nagar and Yagappa Nagar, the sewage generated from these areas are not pumped to Sakkimangalam sewage water treatment plant. “Instead, sewage collected from UGD is let into an outlet channel from Vandiyur tank, which joins the Vaigai River. With the channel blocked due to encroachment and lack of maintenance, sewage flowing in it enters into the residential area,” he said.

G Selvam, a resident from Pandian Nagar said that sewage flows over a mud road, hindering vehicular movement in the area.

“Officials should remove encroachments alongside the canal, which chokes movement of water and construct retaining wall so that sewage does not flow into residential area. We have taken the issue to the officials umpteen number times, but it has only fallen into deaf ear. When we approached the assistant engineer last year, he assured of taking up the work after the completion of general election. But, the AE got transferred and our struggle continues,” he said.

With the children and elderly falling sick often, residents strongly believe that health issues are caused by the stagnating sewage water around their houses. Another resident said that they are often mobilizing money themselves to clear the stagnating water using septic tank cleaner vehicles, but it is only a temporary solution, they said. Madurai corporation commissioner S Visakan said he has asked officials to check the issue take appropriate measures.

196,['10/02/2020'],Leopard numbers down 90% in 120-200 years: Study,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Bengaluru: A recent study revealed the leopard population in India has declined 75% to 90% over the past 120-200 years and blamed human intervention for it.

The findings come at a time when big cats are facing various threats, including road kills, poaching and habitat loss in several parts of the country.

For the study conducted by Bengaluru-based Centre for Wildlife Studies and Dehradun’s Wildlife Institute of India, researchers used genetic data from leopards sampled from across the Indian subcontinent to investigate population structure and patterns of demographic decline. They also checked the demographic history of each identified subpopulation and compared genetic decline analyses with countrywide local extinction probabilities.

Researchers collected faecal samples and identified 56 unique leopards using a panel of 13 microsatellite markers, and merged this data with already available statistics on 143 leopards.

“Coalescent simulations with microsatellite loci revealed a possibly human-induced 75-90% population decline 120-200 years ago across India,” the study concluded.

It revealed four distinct leopard subpopulations corresponding to the Western Ghats, Deccan Plateau (semi-arid), Shivalik and Terai region of the north Indian landscape, with high genetic variation. Scientists deduce these genetic clusters were formed due to restricted gene flow along major habitat-type differences between these biogeographic zones.

The research was conducted by authors Supriya Bhatt, Suvankar Biswas and Bivash Pandav of Wildlife Institute of India, Krithi K Karanth (CWS) and Samrat Mondol (WII) and has been published in the journal Life and Environment.

Krithi Karanth, chief conservation scientist, said the study results are both interesting and alarming. “Using two different methodological approaches, we have established that even one of the most adaptable big cats in India has experienced decline in population structure and distribution,” she noted.

This study team suggested leopards be given similar attention like tigers in India. It also emphasised the importance of similar work on wide-ranging and commonly perceived as locally abundant species as it’s possible that they may show population decline, especially in the context of the anthropocene (current geological age).

Madurai: Food safety officials are planning to streamline milk vendors in the district, who sell in loose, by bringing them under Verified Milk Vendor scheme, an initiative of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). The scheme, which has already been rolled out in Gujarat, is aimed at addressing issues of quality and safety of raw milk supplied directly to customers by unorganised milk vendors.

FSSAI chief executive officer Pawan Kumar Agarwal briefed food safety officials from Tamil Nadu who took part in a meeting in New Delhi recently in this regard and instructed them to start the spade work for implementing it.

The officials said while large milk suppliers have been brought under their fold, the new initiative will help streamline raw milk vendors who have been outside their ambit. Although the number of raw milk vendors has come down ever since packet milk supply began, they are still operating in good numbers. In a city like Madurai, the raw milk suppliers are present in considerable number in the city itself. Many residents rely on such vendors due to the doubts about the quality of packet milk.

Designated officer for food safety in the district, Dr M Somasundaram, told TOI that they will roll out the scheme soon. To start with, they are planning to cover 100 vendors from the city and outskirts. The vendors will be registered with them and given identification cards of the food safety department. They will be constantly monitored, the quality and safety of milk checked periodically using lactometer and samples sent to designated labs.

People can rest assured on the quality of milk purchased from such verified vendors, he said. Reports had emerged recently showing that milk samples tested by the food safety department contained cancer-causing Aflatoxin M1. It is suspected that the carcinogen could have entered the cattle’s body through fodder. Somasundaram said they will check for the quality of fodder provided to cattle using equipment available for the purpose.

According to sources, Husban Khan, 23, a resident of Ayyappa Nagar, had registered himself on Naukri.com and uploaded his resume on the website.

After a few days, Khan received a call from a person who offered him a job at Sun Pharmaceutical. The caller told Khan that his resume is good for the job, but he will have to go through online interviews and other procedures.

The caller initially asked Khan to send Rs 2,000 to his account as registration charges. After Khan had sent the money, the caller arranged an online interview following which he was informed being selected for the job.

The accused later asked Khan to send Rs 7,000 for completing other formalities, which the job seeker complied with. As Khan suspected something fishy, he called the accused and demanded the money back. Khan told the accused that he doesn’t want the job now. The accused convinced Khan to send Rs 5,000 more saying after that the entire amount deposited by him will be refunded.

In the hope of getting the money back, Khan deposited Rs5,000 in the bank account provided by the accused. After the money was deposited, the accused switched off his mobile. On realizing he has been duped, Khan approached cyber complaint cell (C3) of city police and filed a complaint.

After primary probe, C3 transferred the complaint to Mankapur police station where a case of fraud has been registered. Police are now trying to track down the owner of the bank account in which the money was deposited.

Kozhikode: The Centre for Water Resource Development and Management (CWRDM) will conduct beach auditing at Kappad as part of improving cleanliness on the beach.

The beach auditing will focus identifying the key source of waste and the major waste particles found on the beach.

The beach auditing project is part of the educational and awareness programme planned as part of the Blue Flag Certification Programme. The ministry of environment and forest has entrusted CWRDM to carry out awareness and educational programme among students, tourists and residents on the importance of proper waste management on the beach.

“We will collect details about what are the types of waste found on the beach and who are the sources of waste,” said Dr P S Harikumar, senior principal scientist at CWRDM who is coordinating the beach auditing and other activities at Kappad Beach. The types of waste generated and how to reduce waste generation will all be studied, he added.

The plan is to collect data for the audit through questionnaire. The tourists, residents and others will be made part of the audit.

The audit will also collect details to gauge how aware the residents and tourists are about the importance of cleanliness and waste management. Shop keepers will also be made a part of the audit.

“We are planning a number of awareness and educational programmes for the residents of Kappad and nearby areas,” said Dr Harikumar. Awareness for school students, youths and others is also part of the programme, he said.

To mark the beginning of the awareness programme for Blue Flag Certification process, Kerala State Council for Science and Technology and CWRDM on Sunday carried out beach cleaning activity at Kappad. Over 100 students from various schools took part in the drive.

They also organized painting competition and quiz programme for school students from the area.

In order to qualify for the Blue Flag Certification, a series of stringent environmental, educational, and safety and accessibility criteria must be met and maintained. The programme is also part of the national campaign aiming to keep trash out of beaches and oceans to raise awareness on cleanliness of environment.

The national and international teams are expected to visit Kappad soon to review the cleanliness condition. Cleaning and other activities are already ongoing at Kappad and we are now focusing on the educational side, said Dr Harikumar.

Bengaluru: An open theatre, a scary house, a reflexology pathway and much more. All these aren’t features of a new mall in the city, but a public park coming up in Domlur, east Bengaluru .

Kanakadasa Park, spread over two acres, also has unique seating arrangements themed after fruits like apples, bananas and watermelons. To keep the kids engaged there are installations of frogs, deer, peacocks, etc.

“There are public parks in the city themed around one or two special features. But I wanted to bring many features in one space,” said Lakshminarayan CR, corporator of Domlur ward. “We have spent Rs 2 crore to renovate the park, including pooling in some CSR funds,” he added.

The corporator said the reflexology pathway is specially designed to stimulate acupressure points in the feet. “The walkway is about 10 feet wide and can easily accommodate more than 300 walkers,” he explained.

Ravi Prasad, a local, said residents are excited about the inauguration of new features at the park. “A bench in the shape of a huge apple scaling to a height of 4 feet is interesting,” he added.

The park will also have installations of Disney characters, which will also serve as selfie points. Kalyani L, another Domlur resident, said they are happy to see the park get a revamp. “Though some renovation work had started in 2015, it didn’t take off. Later it became a hub of anti-social elements. It’s good that the public space is being reclaimed now,” she added.

A senior official said the park also has a sustainability factor. “There is a biogas plant and the electricity generated from it will be used to illuminated the walkways. A few final touches remain, after which the park will be thrown open to the public,” he added. The facility also has a parking lot, which can accommodate about 50 cars and over 100 two-wheelers.

Hyderabad: Months after encroachments on the Annarayuni cheruvu , on the outskirts of the city, were demolished, fresh encroachments are being planned, say residents. They say that unless lakes are fenced and watchmen appointed, the water bodies have will always remain vulnerable. On Saturday, residents confronted a man on a tractor who was trying to ‘clean up’ the lake in Keesara so that construction work could be carried out. The lake currently does not have any water.

“We have been working on the lake (protection) for four years and have begged officials to rejuvenate it. Every time officials say they don’t have funds,” said Prashanth Mamidala, an activist, adding: “Forget rejuvenation, mere protection of the lakes boundaries is becoming a challenge.”

Highlighting that despite municipal minister KT Rama Rao giving a positive response on the issue of rejuvenating the lake, nothing had progressed on ground. “Encroachments keep on happening. Why is it that we should beg so much to get things done?” Prashanth said.

In July 2019, a structure on the full-tank-level (FTL) of the lake was demolished after multiple complaints. However, it was back up again by December and still stands. “We have to keep tweeting the MRO Keesara who responds very rarely,” said Srinivas Podduri, a local.

Speaking about the promises made by political representatives, another resident, Vijay Shekar said: “Before the municipal elections, MLA and MPs promise that they will ensure the lake is cleaned up but once the polls are done we are back to square one.”

Irrigation officials, meanwhile, stated that work on ‘priority lakes’ is still pending and there were not enough funds to complete the rejuvenation process for all lakes in one go.

BENGALURU: Make sure you have your Aadhaar card nearby before you breathe your last. For, staff at some BBMP crematoria and graveyards are insisting that Aadhaar of the dead be produced, if you have to be laid to rest.

However, the Supreme Court has made it clear that Aadhaar is mandatory only where citizens are availing benefits of government welfare schemes.

Last week, Rajesh K (name changed), a resident of Vijayanagar, lost his 75-year-old aunt. When the grieving family took the body to Sumanahalli crematorium, Outer Ring Road, for the last rites, they were in for a rude shock. “The staff there said the slot had to be booked online and insisted that we produce my aunt’s Aadhaar card and that too the original,” he told TOI.

“Amid all the grief, their demand stumped us. My aunt’s Aadhaar card was missing and we didn’t have its photocopy either. We went to a nearby cyber café to generate the e-aadhaar, but it didn’t work as the SIM of the registered mobile number had been blocked due to some reason. We somehow managed to activate the mobile number and get the e-aadhaar as proof. It was a traumatic experience,” said Rajesh.

The civic body maintains as many as 12 electric crematoria and 46 burial grounds across the city.

Ä staffer at Sumanahalli crematorium said they ask for Aadhaar as everyone has it now and they think it’s the most reliable identity proof.

When TOI randomly dialled several crematoria and burial grounds, many staffers said they are OK with Aadhaar (original or photocopy). “We ask people who come to book slot for cremation to ensure they mention the Aadhaar number during online booking and show us the original or photocopy of the Aadhaar letter or card,” said a staffer at the crematorium in west zone.

However, a staffer of Hebbal crematorium said they ask for Aadhaar, but if it’s not available, they accept any ID proof.

Prakash KV, a resident of Mallathahalli, said staffers at crematoria insist that relatives mention the Aadhaar number of the dead as identity proof.

Madurai: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami should initiate the process for enrolment of students in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences which is expected to be established by 2023, Madurai MP Su Venkatesan has said. Many other states which are also getting AIIMS have already started the process and a delay would result in Tamil Nadu students being deprived of an opportunity to study there, he told reporters here.

Planning for the AIIMS in Madurai was being done in coordination with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). If the institute is to be started in 2023 the process of student enrolments should have started by now. For establishing a medical college with hospital, a temporary building and link with a 300-bedded hospital were necessary. Madurai had scope for this and it should be started without further delay. Admission notices had been issued for the new AIIMS in Mangalagiri in 2018, Bibi Nagar in Telangana in 2019 and for Jammu AIIMS the notice was to be issued this August. The Jammu and Madurai AIIMS are expected to start functioning in 2023, but TN has not taken any step towards the admission process, he said.

The chief minister and health minister should appoint a special officer for the AIIMS establishment process as AIIMS and National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education Research were necessary for spearheading Madurai’s development, he said.

Asked about Union government’s announcement that a site museum would be established in Adhichanallur, he said it looked like a definite move to divert attention from Keeladi which had revealed the ancientness of the Tamil civilization that had thrived on the banks of Vaigai. “What will they showcase in the Adhichanallur site museum when the detailed excavation was conducted 70 years ago and the report on the latest 15-year-old excavation is yet to be released,’’ he said.

Trichy: The Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association (TNGCTA) has demanded appointment of a full-time research director at the Bharathidasan University as it is hampering research activities..

The university had taken multiple steps to speed up evaluation of PhD thesis and award of degrees without delay by creating a separate research wing in March 2018. “But many such measures on part of the university did not yield much results as it has not appointed a full-time research director,” said P David Livingstone, secretary, TNGCTA Trichy zone.

“Research director (in-charge) S Muthusamy is also heading the chemistry department of the university and only comes to the research section in the evening which is resulting in delay. Despite automation of the research sections, many of the PhD scholars and guides are asked to come in person to clarify many trivial issues,” he said.

A government college faculty member had allegedly applied for research guideship in 2018. While she was qualified for guideship at that point, the university delayed the award of guideship for two years. Now the university is deny guideship to the faculty citing new UGC norms.

“It is unfair on part of the university to delay the award of guideship in 2018 and ask the faculty member to fulfil the requirement based on the recent orders of the UGC,” said Livingstone

Speaking to TOI S Muthusamy, said there may be exceptions, but all measures are being taken to fast track the research section. I am working in the section till late evening to clear files.

On the appointment of a full-time research director, Muthusamy said that university has taken steps and appointment will be made soon. “We have taken up the matter with vice-chancellor P Manisankar on many occasion but nothing has been done so far. Therefore, we have decided to carry out protest if the VC continues to remain a mute spectator,” said Livingstone.

VADODARA: In a cruel twist of fate, a woman undertrial in Vadodara Central Jail was denied a last glimpse of her dead husband before his last rites on Saturday. The couple’s only son too is serving a sentence in the same jail. The casual labourer from Wadhwana village in Dabhoi taluka died alone at his home on Saturday afternoon, as his wife and son are in jail on rape charges.

While the relatives of the deceased tried their best to help Rauji Rathodiya ’s wife Leela and son Sukhdev see his mortal remains, and brought the body to the gate of Vadodara Central Jail, officials did not let them enter owing to lack of knowledge of legal procedures.

The villagers arrived at the jail with just an application seeking permission for the duo see the body. But the jail sentry turned down their request and asked them to leave immediately.

“We had a letter drafted by a lawyer requesting my aunt and cousin to see my uncle’s body. But the jail officials did not even accept the letter and asked us to leave,” said Rathodiya’s nephew Arjun.

He added that they waited at the jail gates from morning till evening and when nothing moved the jail officials, they took the body back to Wadhwana and performed the final rites.

A jail inmate can seek interim bail from a court to attend the funeral of his or her family member.

“The villagers had come with a rough application letter and so we had to turn them away. They did not follow any legal process,” explained jail superintendent V R Patel.

Pisudde had been set afire by Vikesh Nagrale near her college, after she refused to speak to him and also reported his advances to her father. Nagrale, now in Wardha jail, is learnt to have told police that he did not like Pisudde complaining to her father about his attempts to speak to her. The accused, who was nabbed by Nagpur rural police, is married and has a child.

217,['10/02/2020'],Mid-day meal mess due to SHGs chosen by edu dept: Headmasters Association,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: After almost two days of guarded approach over the Hudkeshwar school food poisoning case, the Nagpur chapter of Headmasters Association (HA) has accused the education department and civic authorities of messing up the midday meal (MDM) scheme. Madhusudhan Mude , president of HA (Nagpur district), said some officials are probably sabotaging the MDM scheme for kickbacks.

Mude said that the MDM scheme must be run only by big centralized kitchen set ups that have a proven track record of supplying thousands upon thousands of meals each day. “Only under such a set up can we have constant monitoring of how the food is cooked, packed and delivered,” he said.

He alleged that in many schools MDM contracts given to big national-level not-for-profit organization had been cancelled. “My school is one of them. Akshay Patra was serving midday meals here but the contract was cancelled and given to a local self-help group. The economics of it means that these ultra small units won’t be able to provide high quality food and still churn out a profit. And cutting corner means compromising on quality,” said Mude.

He confirmed to TOI that the education department had been informed about the poor quality of MDM being served by self-help groups. “We have complained more than once but nobody in the department is ready to listen. It means that someone in the department is getting commission to ensure status quo,” said Mude.

HA office bearers are planning to now present a memorandum to the department for completely doing away with contracts to local self-help groups and to bring in the bigger players. Mude said, “The big organizations like Akshay Patra and Annamrita have a huge set-up in various cities and are like a well-oiled machine when it comes to MDM. Their kitchens are state-of-the art, cooking preparations standardized and packing materials are also of high quality. If the department is serious about safety of children then they will revert the contracts to the bigger units.”

Education activist Shahid Sharif said there have been complaints about quality of food served by self-help groups earlier too but no action was taken. “The Food and Drug Administration will be releasing its report on Monday about the food sample taken from the Hudkeshwar school. But we have come to know that there is definitely some problem with the sample that was tested,” said Sharif.

218,['10/02/2020'],"Protect windowpane oysters at Cortalim, NGT tells govt","This story is from February 10, 2020

Panaji: The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) has directed the expert committee of the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority ( GCZMA ) to look into the error in its report, which denies the presence of windowpane oysters on the Cortalim coast, and take adequate mitigation measures for the protection and conservation of the protected species.

Counsel Rahul Choudhary representing the NGO, Federation of Rainbow Warriors, told the tribunal that there was a factual error in the report of the committee pertaining to windowpane oysters, where the conclusion and recommendations of its report state that there are no window pane oysters around Cortalim, when they actually do exist.

The GCZMA, at its meeting on February 5, decided that the expert members would conduct a fresh physical inspection along the construction of the Zuari bridge, where the federation has stated PWD work is ongoing in violation of CRZ clearance.

The authority found that the construction work on the Agasaim and Cortalim side of the bridge is fraught with irregularities. It observed that construction debris and earth dumped on the western and eastern sides of the old Zuari bridge fell partly within the CRZ-1 area of the river and lying within the no-development zone (NDZ) of the Zuari.

“As per the CRZ regulation, no dumping of earth or land-filling is permissible within the NDZ area. It is understood that the NH 17 work is not yet complete and is still ongoing, so the material will be lying within the area for some time, but will be removed as told by PWD — which is permissible as per a circular dated February 25, 2015 from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change,” the GCZMA stated in its meeting.

It recommended that the PWD be instructed to manage waste dumped along the northern bank of Zuari river on the Agasaim side, which is also not permissible. “The respondent should be told to manage the waste properly by installing a waste disposal mechanism at site or by engaging a contractor for its management,” the authority recommended.

The GCZMA further said that the open sewerage system at site is a serious concern. So, the PWD should be strictly directed to close the stinking sewer immediately, which is not permissible within the NDZ area. “Instead, they should provide mobile toilets for the labourers and PWD should be directed to initiate action for replanting of mangroves, which have been cut during the course of road / bridge construction,” the GCZMA said.

219,['10/02/2020'],10th century Chola sculptures found near Trichy,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Trichy: Three sculptures, allegedly from the Chola era, were identified by epigraphists during an explorative study near Chemmedu of Kolli hills in Namakkal district. One among them is the sculpture of Jeyshta deity, supposedly dated back to 10 century CE.

They stumbled upon the sculptures on the outskirts of Karayankattuppatti village where they had been carrying out a study on tribal life and culture. The chola sculptures of deity Mahishasuramardini, which were also found, are estimated to be of 12th century CE.

“Jeyshta is the elder sister of goddess Lakshmi. Also known as Muuttadevi, this deity is mentioned in the ancient Tamil literature Thirukkural where she is called as Thavvai and Mamugadi,” said R Kalaikkovan, director of Dr M Rajamanikkanar Centre for Historical Research.

Seated on a bench with both her legs down with a flower medallion fixed to her head gear, she is adorned with Karanda makuta, palm leaf kundalas, charappali, bangles, rings and swarna vaikaksha.

Her right hand is in abhaya and the left hand is kept on the thigh. Her son Nandhikesvaran also known as Manthan and her daughter Agnimatha are seated in suhasana in two raised pedestals seen one on each side of her. Her son with the face of a bull has a staff in his right hand and his left hand is kept on his thigh. One of the Mahishasuramardini sculpture is in a standing posture with her feet resting on the head of the defeated and killed buffalo demon Mahishan. Holding bow and arrow in the front hands and sword and shield in the back hands, a beautiful deer is standing behind her with its face to her right. “Absence of the usual objects - the chakra and the conch - in the back hands of this image is significant and differentiates it from the urban counterparts,” said R Akila, who was part of explorative study.

In the other sculpture, the hands of the deity are in abhaya (bestowing protection) and dola (simply hanging on the side). The back hands of this icon as in the normal Durga images with conch and chakra. “Commonly the right hand of the deity is used to show the abhaya mudra whereas here it is with the left hand,” said Kalaikkovan.

Illegal parking has made driving through the roads impossible

JAIPUR: Parking woes in Walled City has become a never-ending problem. While authorities blame congested lanes for the mess, residents say lack of proper administration was the reason.

There are many lanes in Walled City but illegal parking has made driving through the roads impossible. Haldiyon ka Rasta, Gopalji Ka Rasta, Nahargarh Road, Baba Harish Chand Marg and Khajane Walon ka Rasta are a few such examples.

Vikas Kohtari, former councillor from Walled city, said roads get congested from early morning. “There is a severe parking crisis in Walled City areas. Though it has been a heritage city by UNESCO, parking has forced people to move out of here. Residents are slowly opting to leave their ancestral havelis and live in Jaipur Greater where they can move freely,” said Vikas.

According to rules, none of the businessmen in the city is allowed to park vehicles in the market. But people hardly follow the norms and cars can be seen parked in the market right from the morning.

Kailash Mittal, vice-president of Johri Bazaar Market Association, said it is easier to park illegally by monthly paying contractors. “These contractors will charge a monthly amount from the businessmen and any one can park their vehicles for more than two hours. Traffic police don’t even tow their vehicles,” said Kailash.

Panaji: The economic development corporation (EDC) has in principle decided to hand over the logistics of its Patto Plaza to the corporation of the city of Panaji(CCP).

When this is done, CCP will be responsible for the maintenance of roads, footpaths, streetlights and pay parking in the complex. The existing pay parking contract for Patto Plaza will end on March 31.“We will have to retender the pay parking contract,” Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar said.

The move, he said, came after the North Goa Collector notified all roads as public roads. Currently, CCP only collects garbage from Patto Plaza, while EDC manages the complex. The EDC reclaimed and developed the 1.8 lakh sqm in 1985 to make it a model commercial hub and also implemented a pay parking scheme in the commercial area.

Nagapattinam: A 45-year-old man was found hanging in Nagapattinam district on Sunday a day after his friend’s daughter died in a road accident while he was taking her to school on a two-wheeler. The deceased man, a flower vendor, has been identified as Veeramani of Pookara Street in Velankanni.

On Saturday, Veeramani’s friend Mathiazhagan requested him to drop his daughter, M Mahara Jothi, 16, at her school as she had missed her regular bus. Jothi was a Class XI student at a private school in Nagore.

While Veeramani was on way to drop her at school, an SETC bus hit his two-wheeler at Paravai on the East Coast Road. The accident happened when Veeramani tried to cross the ECR without noticing the bus, onlookers said. The bus driver's rash driving was also a reason for the accident, according to the Velankanni police.

Jothi and Veeramani sustained injuries and were rushed to Nagapattinam Government Hospital. However, Jothi died on the way to hospital while Veeramani sustained minor injuries in the incident.

Though he returned home after being treated as an outpatient in the hospital, he appeared depressed apparently bogged down by guilt as he felt that he was the reason for Jothi’s death. On Sunday morning, he went missing from his house.

When his family members searched for him at various spots, they were shocked to find his body hanging from a tree in nearby North Pogainallur village. Veeramani is survived by his wife and two sons. Velankanni police arrested bus driver Madhankumar and further inquiries are on.

Madurai: A female daily wage worker employed at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) was sacked after complaints arose that the woman has been employed despite being released from the prison only around four months ago.

The woman, Gowri, was employed as a daily wage worker at the Department of Surgery at GRH, shortly after being released from prison. Though initially there were rumours that she had previously been sent to jail regarding her involvement in a case related to child kidnapping at GRH, the hospital dean Dr Sangumani J denied the rumours.

“After we received complaints from daily wage workers, we came to know that the woman had only shortly been released from jail in a case related to her private affair. We later held an inquiry as well regarding her appointment and removed her from service,” he said.

The dean also said that an inquiry was held in the presence of a professor from the Department of Surgery and that Gowri herself admitted that she was indeed released from jail four months ago.

“The appointment of daily wage workers happens at the levels of Resident Medical Officer (RMO) and Sergeant on a daily basis. There has also been no evidence of any wrongdoing by senior officials. As soon as we found the complaint valid, we removed her. The matter has been put to rest,” added Dr Sangumani.

NEW DELHI: A crisis stares in the face of consumers as traders have put on hold import of Chinese products, including electronics, automobile parts, toys, mobile phone parts, fabrics and other materials, for the next two months.The traders said that due to the outbreak of coronavirus , manufacturing units in China have suspended production. It has become difficult for businessmen to visit the country for checking the quality of consignments due to travel restrictions.Manish Khandelwal, a furniture trader at CR Park, claimed that till December he visited China every month. “Even my clients came here till last month, but news of coronavirus caused panic among them. I need to visit the country regularly to check for new varieties, quality of products, negotiate prices and finalise the consignment. But I don’t think it is going to be possible to visit China soon,” he added.Umesh Seth, an automobile parts dealer at Kashmere Gate, said many businessmen suffered losses during the ongoing Auto Expo as Chinese manufacturers didn’t turn up. “Traders from far flung areas come to place bulk orders at the expo. Even I had to cancel my tickets,” he added.Low price, availability in bulk and variety are some of the favourable features of Chinese goods in India. The price of the same products manufactured in India are much higher, so people prefer to buy them even when there is no warranty, said traders.Vinay Khandelwal, a trader of mobile accessories at Gaffar Market, said, “I have been in contact with my supplier. He told me that labourers are not turning up for work because of the sudden rise in coronavirus cases and deaths. These units were expected to open from February 8 with the completion of the extended Lunar New Year holidays. However, looking at the situation, I don’t think they will start operations soon.”Confederation of All India Traders secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said traders importing Chinese products mostly keep stocks for at least two months. “The impact of short or no supply will be seen in April. In Chandni Chowk alone, around Rs 1,000 crore of materials are imported from China every month. Traders in other markets, like Lajpat Nagar, Rajouri and Gaffar Market, also regularly import Chinese products.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74056219,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-235586,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/coronavirus-spells-trouble-for-electronics-toy-sellers/articleshow/74051597.cms

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Admitting that novel coronavirus (nCoV) has dealt a severe blow to the state’s tourism sector, tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran said on Sunday that a meeting of the state tourism advisory council will be convened soon to chalk out a new marketing strategy to overcome the crisis.“The scare following the positive confirmation of nCoV cases in the state has of course affected the inflow of tourists, which calls for chalking out of a new marketing strategy. We took similar initiatives after the two consecutive monsoon floods, which ravaged the state, and post-Nipah virus outbreak to revive the sector,” the minister told reporters.Though the industry heaved a sigh of relief after the state government withdrew the declaration of nCoV infection as a state-specific disaster a couple of days ago, mass cancellations of hotel bookings and tour packages have already done the damage, stakeholders had pointed out.Meanwhile, responding to widespread criticism on the 20% cut in the 2020-21 budget outlay for tourism sector, especially on the allocation for marketing (which he was giving more thrust now), the minister said this happened due to the ‘specific nature’ of this year’s budget. “But, there’s no need for any concerns as there will be timely support through additional allocations as per requirements,” he said.The allocation for tourism marketing is Rs 63.4 crore in 2020-21 budget against Rs 82 crore earmarked in 2019-20. This was despite Kerala State Planning Board’s (KSPB) recommendation to focus more on marketing destinations and varied tourism products of the state, instead of infrastructure development.Held as a pioneer in marketing tourism among Indian states, Kerala, over the years, has been exploiting the potential of information communication technology for luring tourists from both international and domestic markets. But, the state has not yet come up successfully with a USP (unique selling proposition) for its authentic products like folk artforms, which, according to officials, require regular promotion on global platforms.As per the 2020-21 allocations, the activities under marketing scheme include international and national promotional campaigns, branding and partnerships. An amount of Rs 9.75 crore has been earmarked for international and national marketing events, including participation in trade fairs and organizing B2B meets, while Rs 8.25 crore is allotted for international and national campaigns, including print, TV, cinema halls and OOH (out of home advertising).Other activities under marketing include website development and web-based marketing activities (Rs 7.5 crore), social media and digital campaigns including national and international ‘Blog Express’ (Rs 6.8 crore), conducting FAM trips for tour operators, potential travel writers and journalists (Rs 6.75 crore), production and revamping of publicity materials (Rs 6.5 crore), sponsorships, financial assistance to various fairs with tourism potential and awareness advertisements (Rs 6.25 crore), focused public relations activities in international and domestic markets (Rs 6.1 crore), promoting MICE, monsoon tourism, adventure tourism and branding of tourism information centres (Rs 5.5 crore).",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74062428,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58464,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ncov-has-severely-affected-tourism-sector-surendran/articleshow/74050548.cms

Berhampur: At least 10 people died of electrocution and 20 sustained injuries when a bus came in contact with a low-hanging high-tension wire and caught fire near Mandrajpur village, under Ganjam district’s Golanthara police station limits, on Sunday.

The private bus was carrying around 40 passengers, most of whom were from Dankalpadu village. They were on their way to Chikarada village to attend an engagement ceremony when the bus came in contact with the 11-kv line.

Transport minister Padmanabh Behera blamed local electricity officials for the tragedy and has asked the Ganjam district administration to launch a probe into the incident. Southco is the power distribution firm that operates in the area.

“The deceased sustained 80%-90% burns,” Radhamadhab Tripathy, principal of MKCG Medical College and Hospital, where the passengers were initially taken, said. “Eight of the injured were referred to the SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack, after their condition worsened,” Ganjam district collector Vijay Amruta Kulange said.

Tripathy said the injured sustained 30%-40% burns. “We have constituted a team of doctors to treat the injured,” Tripathy said.

The bodies have been handed over to their relatives after conducting postmortem at MKCG. The deceased have been identified as U Debraj Reddy (11), Santoshini Sahu (12), B Taraneya (57), B Rameya (55), Ch.Tulasiamma (37), B Kanamma (40), B Achulu (35), K Kamaraju (50), B Mohini (30) and K Sanju (20). Debraj died on way to SCB Hospital.

“Among the other victims admitted at SCB hospital are five women and two men. Their condition is critical,” said Bhubananda Maharana, emergency officer at the Cuttack-based hospital

Chief minister Naveen Patnaik expressed grief and sorrow at the loss of lives and announced an ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the next of the kin of the deceased. He also said the injured would receive free treatment.

This is the second time in a fortnight that passengers were killed in a bus-related accident in Ganjam district. Earlier on January 29, nine passengers were killed when a bus fell off a bridge near Taptapani Ghati.

Sources said the bus left Dankalpadu village at about 12.30pm and the incident happened around half-an-hour later. The bus driver, while trying to give way to a two-wheeler, came in contact with the wire. “Some of the passengers got down from the bus and tried to rescue others. We immediately cut the power supply and tried to help those trapped inside the bus,” Damburu Reddy, a villager from Mandrajpur, said.

Firefighters and local police also helped rescue the injured. At least five ambulances were pressed into service to shift the injured to the hospitals. “The driver of the bus is yet to be identified. He may be among those injured,” a local policeman said. Police said they would register a criminal case against those responsible for the incident.

Local people claimed they had asked officials of Southco, the power distribution firm in the area, to raise the height of the low-hanging wire. “Despite repeated requests, Southco officials did not take us seriously,” Ch Sudhkar Reddy, sarapanch of Ekasingh panchayat, under which the incident happened, said.

227,['10/02/2020'],Shacks resort to club vibe to draw crowds,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Panaji: As evening sets in, the relaxed vibe at shacks along the Calangute and Baga stretch morphs into high-octane music energy with DJ’s blaring speakers and groups burning the dance floor with their moves.

In a case of necessity being the mother of innovation, shack operators, who are battling reduced footfalls and increased competition, have resorted to using music and dance to lure single Indian men to their establishments.

If shacks are unable to make business on food or deck beds when the crowd is thin, they are at least able to sell alcohol to the men, who come in to dance, and cover some cost, a shack operator at Baga said.

The tables and chairs are moved to the beach to make space for dancing. “Some shacks even plant two to three young women on the dance floor to draw in groups of single men loitering on the beach,” a shack operator said.

This ploy can attract a crowd of 50 or more men, most of whom enjoy dancing to Indi-pop music. “If I play English music they will ask to turn it off,” a shack operator from Baga said.

“If the shack has a good music system and DJ in a tow, dishing out songs as per audience demand, it can make good business for the night. One particular operator at Baga has a music system costing above Rs 10 lakh,” another operator said.

Agreeing, the shack operator from Baga said that the crowd will not step in if there is no music.

In the last few years, most shacks in this belt have invested in music systems worth anything between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh. Hiring a DJ is a matter of affordability as they charge Rs 1,000-plus per night.

“They (DJs) come at a higher price during the Christmas week and New Year. I don’t have a DJ,” an operator at Baga beach said. The stretch has over 100 shacks where the trend of shack-by-day-club-by-night has caught on with the same enthusiasm as it has at Calangute.

“Foreign tourists avoid these beach stretches due to noise,” one operator said. No action is taken against loud music, he said.

Another factor that works in the favour of shacks at Baga is the presence of popular clubs like Tito’s and Mambo nearby.

“Male tourists who do not want to pay the stag entry fee, but want to enjoy themselves dancing, land up at the beach,” the shack operator said.

Shacks erected close to the entrance of the beach are likely to draw more people. However, location is no guarantee for good business and many shack operators have men working on commission to bring in clients.

“There will be one or two such boys attached to each shack, who will wander around the beach to get customers. They work on commission basis,” a shack operator at Calangute beach said.

A four to five per cent commission is paid on the bill raised for guests brought in by the person.

Arun R, who works at a beach shack in Calangute on commission basis, is feeling the pinch of a not so good tourism season this year. Arun, who is from Karnataka, said he normally earns more than Rs 30,000 a month by way of commissions, but that this year his earnings have dropped.

Some shacks along the beach stretches of Calangute, Candolim and Baga also have additional attractions like large screens where they show cricket and footfall matches.

“Everything is being tried to keep guests hooked and loosen their purse strings on food and beverages. So, if a neighbouring shack has anything new, I can’t be sitting tight. This is competition,” the shack operator said.

Jaipur: After the Rajasthan Housing Board ( RHB ) sold its residential properties on discounted rates, a proposal has been floated to dispose of shops and commercial properties along the same lines.

For this, RHB has identified more than 300 properties in 10 cities including Jaipur, which will be sold at a discount rate between 25 % to 50 %.

Majority of the properties are in the slab of 25 per cent exemption, however, there are four shops in Bharatpur, which have been kept up to 50 per cent exemption. An official said, Jaipur has the highest number of shops. The board will dispose of these shops and commercial plots that are located in different sectors of Pratap Nagar and Indira Gandhi Nagar at a discount of up to 25 per cent.

There are a total of 223 shops in both these areas, of which 61 shops are in Pratap Nagar area, while the remaining 162 in Indira Gandhi Nagar. Other than this, the board will sell shops available in residential colonies in Tonk, Dausa, Sawai Madhopur, Bharatpur, Alwar, Bikaner, Nagaur, Bundi and Jodhpur cities. This decision to dispose of shops in exemptions was taken in the board meeting held in Januaray.

Like previous auction, the board will this time too adopted reverse bidding method for auctioning. An official explained, “Reverse bidding method means a person who has put up a bid to buy house on minimum discount rate will win the auction. Supposedly, one person plans to buy a house at 40% discount and another at 30% discount. The board will sell the flat to a person who is asking for less discount. Residents will be given a month’s time to submit their bid.”

During the real estate slump , the RHB had earned Rs 166 crore by selling 1,011 flats and houses across the state. Buoyed by the success, the RHB plans to continue with the auctions.

229,['10/02/2020'],Clear dues or no RTE admission: Pvt schools to state,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Jaipur: The consortium of private schools in Rajasthan has warned the state government that they will not admit any student under Right to Education (RTE) Act this year until their dues are cleared.

At present, around four lakh students from economically weaker section are studying under RTE in various private schools in the state. As per the Swayamsevi Shikshan Sanstha Sangh Raj, an organisation for private schools in the state, they have not received the payment since 2018 for the RTE students.

Kishan Mittal, president of the organisation, said, “The year is about to end, but the payment for the students for 2018-19 and 2019-20 sessions hasn’t been received. Whenever we question the state government, they give us an excuse of lack of funds. The state government receives funds from the Central government, then where have they spent all the money.”

In 2017, the Rajasthan government was paying every private school around Rs 17,000 for each student, which was later changed to Rs 13,700 in 2018 and then in 2019 it was further cut to Rs 10,500. And for the last two years the government hasn’t paid that money either, he added.

Kishan said that a student who was studying for a fee of Rs 17,000 is now studying for Rs 10,500, which, too, is not paid by the state government on time.

“We have to face losses due to the late payments. When we are following the government guidelines, then why can’t the government pay us on time. There are more than 32,000 schools in our organisation and the decision was taken unanimously at a meeting organised on Sunday. This is a serious issue which should be taken up by the government on priority or we will not admit any RTE student this year,” Kishan said.

Trichy: Farmers of delta districts welcomed chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami’s promise that the Cauvery delta region would be converted into a ‘protected agricultural zone’, celebrating the announcement by bursting crackers and distributing sweets.

The celebrations came after the chief minister’s promised the delta region would be converted into a protected agricultural zone’ at function in Salem on Sunday. Farmer leaders hailed the announcement saying the government must take immediate steps to enable its implementation. The government must pass an ordinance and urge the union government to publish in its gazette.

Farmers of Neduvasal, the village that was the centre of hydrocarbon protest, urged the state to pass a resolution in the ensuing budget session. KK R Lenin, founder and president of the movement against destruction, said the initiative might restrict the union government from exploring oil wells on agriculture land not in the sea.

“As per the contract awarded to Vedanta groups, they may execute explorations on the sea by using horizontal pipes towards seashore. The government should ensure that it should not happen,” he said. Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, secretary of Thanjavur district Cauvery farmers protection association, said that it was former chief minister J Jayalalithaa who proposed the scheme and the present chief minister has endorsed it. “The government should withdraw entire cases registered against those who protested hydrocarbon exploration,” he said.

Farmers’ wing of Tamil Manila Congress headed by its state organizer, Puliyur A Nagarajan, said that delta farmer’s 25-year due demand has been fulfilled. When the union environment ministry exempted hydrocarbon exploration activities from the rigour of environmental impact assessment (EIA) and public consultation through public hearings, how chief minister’s announcement would become a reality? asked N Veerasekaran, state spokesperson for Bharatiya Kisan Sangam. “However, if the chief minister would make it a reality, that would be a benefit to the entire farming community,” he said.

TRICHY: A four-year-old male sambar deer that fell into a 16 foot-deep well near Manikandam of Pudukottai district was rescued on Saturday.

The rescue operation, which lasted for over a couple of hours, left a couple of forest department personnel injured. However, the animal was captured and safely released into Pachamalai reserve forest.

The incident happened on Saturday morning. The locals alerted forest department about a sambar deer falling into an open well in an agriculture farm behind the office of block development officer in Manikandam.

The forest department team along with volunteers reached the spot and pulled the deer out of the well using ropes. After the deer was rescued from the well, it ran into a nearby canal and was taken out of the canal after a brief rescue effort.

Trichy forest range officer, R Gunasekaran , who was leading the rescue team, said that it was a tedious task as the deer was weighed over 200 kg. “We decided to release the deer in Pachamalai forest,” said Gunasekaran. “Usually success rate of rescue mission is very low in case of spotted deer as these are very timid and often die out of shock during rescue. However, sambar deer are ferocious like bulls. Once we covered its eyes, it was quiet and we could translocate it to Pachamalai hill,” said honorary district animal welfare officer, G Ramakrishnan from animal welfare board of India (AWBI), who was part of the rescue.

There were not many sambar deer recorded in the recent time in Manikandam area. Besides, Thuvarankurichi reserve forest is the nearest forest to Manikandam at about 40 km.

While the forest officials, too, were puzzled over its appearance in Manikandam, range officer said that it could have travelled from Pudukottai or Sivagangai forest and entered Thuavarankurichi forest.

Malappuram: The social impact study for the land acquisition for the development of parking area of Karippur International airport will begin soon in view of the protest against the land acquisition from the part of land owners.

A Kottayam based private organization is expected to submit the social impact study report within one month.

The authorities are planning to acquire a total of 15.5 acres in the premise of entry gate of the airport to set up ample parking areas. Authorities will acquire land with a width of 100m and length of 700m. The state transport department will hand over the acquired land to Airport Authority of India (AAI) for further development works.

But the local-level protest against the land acquisition process is still continuing. A group of land owners had staged blockade in front of the Kondotty village office in protest against the move to acquire the land. In view of protest, district collector is likely to convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss the issue with local protest.

Earlier the revenue authorities faced a similar protest when they started acquisition procedures of 137 acres in Pallikkal panchayat and the authorities launched a social impact study of the land acquisition in the area, aiming to address the issues of the local people who will be directly affected by the land acquisition.

It was in October 2016, that the government issued an order granting administrative sanction for 485.3 acres for the long-pending works of airport development. As per the order 248.3 acres would be acquired from Pulikkal, Kondotty and Nediyiruppu villages for the development of the runway of airport and 80 acres would be acquired from the same panchayat for rehabilitation of evictees. 137 acres would be acquired from Pallikkal village for the development of airport terminal.

At the Shetkari Mahosav held at Chanda Club ground, Puglia slammed the pathetic attitude of agriculture officers towards issues pertaining to the farm crisis prevailing in the state. “Officials need to visit farms to understand the hardships faced by farmers.

NEW DELHI: For the first time, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has arrested a vendor selling psychotropic drugs on the Darknet to students and businessmen and seized around 22,000 tablets from him. The arrested man, Deepu Singh, is a hotel management graduate from a private university in Noida.The operation is significant because Darknet markets and vendors are extremely difficult to track because the network provides complete anonymity to the buyer and seller. Anonymous connections are achieved by using end-to-end encryption. At times, agencies track down the receiver of consignments using their sources in courier firms, but the seller, almost always, manages to hoodwink them.Rajesh Nandan Srivastava, deputy director general of NCB, said the psychotropic drugs were being sold by the accused in the garb of erectile dysfunctional drugs, fitness supplements and health products. The drugs were not only being shipped across the country, but also to USA, UK, Romania, Spain and other European countries through courier.Singh was allegedly selling drugs on two Darknet markets — Empire market and Majestic Garden — and had over 80% positive reviews, indicating that he was operating for long and had a wide range of customers.“The network was spread across India, Singapore and USA. Global post offices and international courier services were used as logistics for illicit trade. The payments gateways of cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Litecoin) were used by the operators to conceal transactions from law enforcement agencies,” zonal director KPS Malhotra said.After getting a tip-off, Darknet markets were accessed and vendors were profiled by NCB sleuths by analysing suspicious parcels evading KYC norms, Malhotra said. Singh was found to be a major player. His listings were found in one of the biggest and reliable markets. He was using various international couriers and global post office to ship the contraband.A few days ago, NCB officials intercepted a suspicious parcel from Air Cargo Logistic Centre located near New Custom House, Delhi. Singh was tracked using advanced surveillance techniques and nabbed from Lucknow.During investigation, police found past seizures of 33,000 tablets linked to this network. Singh revealed that he came in contact with a person in 2018 who was engaged in internet pharmacy and offered him a part-time job. Soon, Singh made his own network. The vendor accounts on Darknet (Empire Market) were managed by his associate, who is at large. The associate used to take the orders and send the details of the shipping address and quantity. Singh collected the stock of psychotropic drugs from various cities.Explaining Darknet, Malhotra said, “It is a black market operating via The Onion Router or Invisible Internet Project selling drugs, cyber arms, weapons, counterfeit currency, stolen credit card details, forged documents, unlicensed pharmaceuticals, steroids and other illicit goods.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74056856,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-215878,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/in-a-first-drug-dealer-on-darknet-nabbed/articleshow/74051620.cms

Jaipur: Aiming to bring down infant mortality rate (IMR), the health department is formulating a policy ‘Navjaat Suraksha Yojna’ for care of neonates. While attending a conference of kangaroo mother care at JK Lon Hospital in Jaipur on Sunday, health minister Raghu Sharma said that the health department will soon bring a policy for infants, who are born with low birth weight, malnutrition and those who are premature babies.

The new scheme for neonates will help in bringing down the infant mortality rate further. Aiming to improve healthcare facilities for neonates, the health department has decided to include kangaroo mother care in ‘Nirogi Rajasthan’ initiative of the state government.

“Aiming to prevent deaths of neonates, we will organise training programmes for kangaroo mother care in the state. We have 77 master trainers in kangaroo mother care and they will go to district and block level to train the healthcare staff,” said Sharma.

The health department is promoting the technique claiming that it provides continuous skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby and exclusive breastmilk feeding to keep the baby healthy.

In the state, the infant mortality rate is 35 deaths per 1,000 live births. According to the National Family Health Survey 2015-16, the IMR in the state was 41 deaths per 1,000 live births. The health department is aiming to bring down IMR further by formulating a ‘ Navjaat Suraksha Yojna’, Nirohi Rajasthan and initiatives like kangaroo mother care.

SMS Medical College principal and controller Dr Sudhir Bhandari said that kangaroo mother care is a natural incubator.

The health department is promoting it as it does not require separate funds. “It is a low-cost technique which is highly practical and has potential to save millions of new-borns without any burden on healthcare cost. This technique is still underutilised and if utilised properly, can save many lives. We have been using the technique for the past few years at JK Lon Hospital and now we have trained doctors and nurses in the past three days here at the hospital came to take part in the conference,” said Dr Ramesh Choudhary, associate professor (paediatrics), JK Lon hospital.

“It is just like putting a child in warmer, which is a mechanical care, but it is a humanised care with better results,” said Dr Choudhary, who was part of organising team of the conference on kangaroo mother care (KMCCON 2020).

Jaipur: Jaipur Rural police arrested three persons and seized a stolen tanker carrying 24,000 litres of milk in Phagi police station area.

Police also recovered the instrument used for breaking the seal of the tanker apart from two drums of milk which had been taken out of the tanker.

“For the last six months, we have been conducting an operation to catch those who are involved in selling adulterated goods, including milk and fuel. The Amul dairy tanker seized on Sunday was supposed to go Manesar. We caught the accused when they were in the process of taking out the milk after breaking the seal of the tanker,” said Shankar Dutt Sharma, SP, Jaipur Rural.

The three accused were identified as Raj Jat, 25, Maan Singh, 41, and Dharam Raj, 19.

According to officials, the modus operandi followed by these accused was that first they would break the seal and take out the milk. Following this they would add water in the tankers to maintain its quantity. They would add three times water in milk which they have already taken out of the tanker and then sell it in the market.

“The drivers of the milk tankers are hand in glove with dhaba owners and others in selling the adulterated product in the markets. The onus is on the milk companies and suppliers to test the milk when it reaches the processing units, but that is not being done. Also, the tankers are fitted with GPS and the companies must track the movement of the vehicles and check if there are any unwarranted stops. It is not the job of police to check such activities, the companies must take initiatives on their own to prevent adulterated goods being sold in the markets as they are posing a risk to the consumer’s health,” the official added.

Jaipur: The proposal to develop a sports complex in Pratap Nagar on Rajasthan Housing Board (RHB) land has been shelved.

Urban Development Housing (UDH) minister Shanti Dhariwal has directed to hold the project after the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) proposed to develop the stadium in Chop village on Delhi road.

The RHB had earlier proposed to develop a sports complex on a 133-bigha land in Indra Gandhi Nagar extension. In the complex, the board had proposed to include a cricket stadium, basketball, volleyball and badminton courts, a swimming pool, archery and shooting ranges of international standard.

A senior official source said, “Priority is to develop a stadium at Chop on the directions of the UDH minister.”

As the land on which sports complex was proposed fall under the ecological zone , the RHB has planned to prepare the detailed project report (DPR) of the complex. Work, however, will be initiated after receiving direction from the state government.

Sources said the JDA had earmarked around 35 hectares in Chop village on Jaipur-Delhi national highway for developing a new stadium.

The land was identified after receiving a letter from the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA).

According to a senior JDA official, during the previous Congress tenure, the civic body had allotted nearly 18.16 hectares to RCA in Chop village in 2012. However, the then BJP government cancelled the allotment in 2017 claiming that the academy did not adhere to the terms and conditions.

An official source said, “The state government has directed to revoke the cancellation. It has also identified adjoining 17 hectares to develop a stadium.”

Sources said according to the previous agreement, the land to RCA was allotted with a condition that the academy will hand over the club house (situated in SMS stadium) to JDA. However, the RCA refused to honour the agreement.

The RCA proposed to develop a capacity to seat 30,000 people for an approximate budget of Rs 500 crore in the first phase. The stadium was to also have a multi-cuisine food court and a sports medical university.

Thiruvananthapuram: Former chief minister Oommen Chandy has alleged hidden agenda in increasing the prices of state lotteries from Rs 30 to Rs 40.

“The agenda is to invite other state lotteries and thereby increase the revenue of the state through this. Already there is a favourable verdict from the high court for other state lotteries to do business in the state. Hence by increasing the prices of state lotteries, the other state lotteries will thrive in Kerala ,” said Chandy.

Already the state lottery business is facing severe crisis. Now with the increase in prices, the other state lotteries will be sold much cheaper than our lotteries. This will also affect lakhs of people who are totally dependent on the lottery business. When the prices are increased, the business will be affected and sales will come down. Mizoram lotteries are priced much lower than our lottery. They are waiting for a chance to come back to the state to do thriving business.

The LDF government has always taken a soft stand towards other state lotteries and hence the state will soon witness this once again. It was the UDF government which banned other state lotteries, said Chandy. TNN

Panaji: Corporation of the City of Panaji ( CCP ) will hold a special meeting this month to decide on many contentious issues, including the long-pending signing of a 30-year lease with tenants at the municipal market and the relocation of confiscated food carts.

The meeting to finalise the signing of agreements with tenants was scheduled for February 5, but was postponed after CCP’s legal team wasn’t ready with the new draft lease agreement. “The final agreement, valid for 30 years, is now ready. We will approve it at a special meeting this month,” mayor Uday Madkaikar said.

With no agreements signed, the cash-strapped corporation hasn’t been receiving any rent money from shop owners in the market since the first phase was constructed in 2003, and the second phase in 2007. Ironically, sopo fees (a charge for space occupied by vendors) are collected regularly from fruit, vegetable and flower vendors in the market.

Last month, CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues blamed the corporation for entertaining objections from the market association, and for the association wavering between signing a lease or a leave-and-license agreement with CCP.

Madaikar said permission for the confiscated food carts to continue operating, their relocation will also be decided at the special CCP meet. Seventeen food carts at Don Bosco and 23 carts from Miramar continue to be confiscated for not maintaining hygiene.

Nagpur: Sixteen people were killed and 64 injured in 66 road accidents that occurred during rains in 2019 in the jurisdiction of the city police commissionerate.

Around 89.57% of the 1,007 road accidents happened when the weather was clear. These facts came to the fore after a study carried out by Nagpur city traffic police to gauge the impact of the weather on road accidents.

In 2019, traffic police started investigating road accidents comprehensively. Details of the weather conditions were also taken into account.

Until 2018, while registering cases of road accidents, the police mentioned only few details like the name of the victim, time and the spot. But 2019 onwards, every police station in the city has started filling reports in an 18-point format.

The study included time, day and place of the incident, details of the vehicle or vehicles involved, traffic rule violation (s), vehicle make, type of accident (fatal, grievous or minor), type of road (national or state highway or service road), nature of road (narrow, turning, slope, speed breaker at intersection, pothole ridden, puncture or none) and other factors like the state of the vehicle and environmental conditions like smog, rain, darkness or sunlight.

The traffic police recently completed its analysis on the weather’s impact on road accidents from January 1 to December 31 in 2019. The accident analysis of clear skies as well as the monsoon indicates that motorists are more careful on roads during rainy days.

Instances of rash and negligent driving increase during clear weather. As many 902 road accidents, including 207 fatal, took place when the weather was clear. These accidents claimed 224 lives and injured 941. Nearly 66 accidents occurred due to rains and claimed 16 lives. According to the study, four accidents happened due to the foggy weather that killed one person and injured three.

The GHMC has also approached the court against the advertisers

HYDERABAD: The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has failed to collect Rs 92 crore in taxes from advertising agencies across the city. As per the norms, the GHMC is mandated to collect Rs 6,000 per annum as tax for the advertisements displayed on RTC buses. However, records reveal that four years of the contract, which is for five years, have already been completed.

Activists allege that the GHMC has been ignoring its statutory obligation of taxing ad agencies. “I have complained to the authorities regarding the posters but in vain. GHMC should answer why they are not collecting the pending advertisement tax,” said Shyamsunder Goud, president, Telangana Vanarula Parirakshana Committee.

Besides ads on buses, lollipop hoardings on central medians have also been put up illegally. Agencies that used to secretly operate at night are now erecting them in broad daylight, said sources.

According to sources, after the contract of an ad agency expired in 2011, the agency approached the court and got a stay order and put up additional lollipop hoardings in violation of norms. As per GHMC records, since 2011, ad agencies have not been paying taxes.

The GHMC has also approached the court against the advertisers. A source in GHMC said that the advertisement agencies are backed by politicians.

250,['10/02/2020'],Artificial grounds at Delhi's Siri Fort Sports complex will ruin green areas: Plea,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Delhi high court

NEW DELHI: Delhi high court has put on hold Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) bid to build synthetic football and hockey grounds in Siri Fort Sports complex , after a member of the facility challenged the move.

In his plea, the member — who also lives nearby — argued that the construction of artificial grounds for the sports will entail destruction of green areas of the complex and cutting down of grown trees.

When the court sought to know DDA’s stand, the authority, which runs the sports facility, gave an undertaking that it won’t cut any trees till the next date of hearing.

The petition by Sudhir Gupta complained that without consulting the members, users and players of the complex, DDA had suddenly begun construction for the artificial grounds.

The plea says that such a move will destroy and damage the greenest part of the entire complex, “which will involve uprooting or cutting innumerable trees all around the natural mud jogging track.”

Urging the court to stay the revamp plan, the petition informs the court that DDA’s bid will also involve conversion of lush green grass football and hockey grounds into artificial synthetic grounds by cutting the trees, bushes and shrubs “and in the process damaging and destroying the huge green patch, also known as the lungs of South Delhi.”

Gupta’s plea points out that the existing set-up of the sports facility is unlike other football grounds, which are professionally used and don’t usually have any trees or bushes of any kind.

“In the Siri Fort Sports Complex, the grounds are surrounded by beautiful mud track with hundreds of trees. The jogging track is used by large number of its members. In fact, after Lodi Gardens, it is the most popular green jogging track,” the petition underlines, saying it needs to be protected and maintained as a legacy.

Alleging that DDA’s decision has been taken in a “totally arbitrary and unfair” manner, the petition says the authority neither shared the kind of process and raw material that they intend to use for the two fields nor consulted the members of the complex who are stakeholders and directly concerned with the conversion of the turf.

If allowed to go unchallenged, such a move violates not just the petitioner’s fundamental rights but also violates other constitutional and statutory right to enjoy pollution free environment, Gupta’s plea says.

251,['10/02/2020'],CCI launches probe into cotton sales in Andhra Pradesh,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Picture used for representational purpose

GUNTUR: The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has launched an investigation into allegations about irregularities in purchase of cotton from farmers.

A team of vigilance officials from Cotton Corporation of India’s New Delhi office are visiting cotton purchase centres in the district and inspecting the records. Sources said the vigilance team has unearthed irregularities by field staff and is looking at the possible role of senior officials. The CBI had booked criminal cases against a few senior officers two years ago.

Sources said the CCI and marketing department officials had connived with ginning millers to procure stocks from unauthorized purchase centres by rejecting farmers’ stocks. With the CCI officials refusing to procure the stocks citing technical reasons and procurement norms, farmers were selling their stock to middlemen at throwaway prices. The middlemen sell the same stock to the ginning mills who in turn offer it to the CCI. The CCI officials, however, have completed purchase in the name of farmers to pay higher sums.

While middlemen and ginning mills buy cotton from farmers between Rs 3,500-Rs 4,000 per quintal, the Cotton Corporation of India is purchasing it between Rs 5000-Rs 5550 per quintal, the minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Centre.

Sources allege that middlemen and officials are pocketing nearly Rs 1,500-Rs 1,600 per quintal. Curiously traders bought stocks at Rs 6,000 per quintal, above the MSP, as fresh crop arrived in the market in December. The prices then dipped below MSP resulting in distress sale by farmers.

The fall in prices in the open market is believed to be the result of a conspiracy by middlemen, ginning millers and officials. Traders stopped buying from farmers by the time the peak procurement season commenced in the first week of January.

Although the farmers rushed to the CCI purchase centres, they could not sell the stocks due to several hurdles including failure to get e-crop booking certificate, high moisture level and length of the lintel.

Taking this distress among the farmers to their advantage, middlemen bought stocks below Rs 4000 per quintal and sold the same to the Cotton Corporation of India at MSP with nearly Rs 1,500 profit. “Our officials will ensure quality of the stock. It is the responsibility of the marketing department to give us the list of genuine farmers. We are here to support the farmers,” said Cotton Corporation of India general manager K Maheswara Reddy.

252,['10/02/2020'],Government plans rice cards for BPL families to end PDS misuse,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Picture used for representational purpose

AMARAVATI: In a bid to end diversion and recycling of rice distributed through Public Distribution System (PDS), the government will issue rice cards for BPL families . About 19 lakh ration cards are expected to be weeded out from the existing list. The district administrations are gearing up for the distribution of new rice cards to the eligible families.

Interestingly, rice cards were delinked from Arogyasri and other government welfare schemes.

After studying the ration scheme in the last six months, the government found that about 10 lakh cardholders were not drawing ration regularly. Besides, many ration dealers were found resorting to malpractices by purchase of rice from the cardholders and selling the same stock to the millers.

The government also noticed that huge quantities of PDS rice was sold in the black market and recycled to public at higher prices. While the government is giving rice to the BPL families at Rs.1 per kg, the millers are selling the rice at Rs.15-20 per kg in open market. Hoteliers and street vendors are buying the low quality PDS rice from the millers as the fine variety rice is available only between Rs.45-Rs55 per kg.

“We carried out a survey to identify the eligible families for disbursement of rice cards. The old concept of ration card is over now,” said civil supplies minister Kodali Srivenkateswara Rao (Nani). He said that lists have been published in village and ward secretariats and the government has taken feedback from people. He said they have received objections from two lakh people and is conducting verification. The minister said that no eligible family would be denied ration.

The government had relaxed norms to get rice cards even after delinking it from Arogyasri and fee reimbursement cards. The government is issuing separate cards for Arogyasri and fee reimbursement schemes.

Since the ration card was the only criterion for all BPL schemes in the past, several people had secured ration cards although many of them were not drawing the ration. The government is expecting that the new concept of rice cards would bring the irregularities to an end.

“We will issue new ration cards within five days of filing an application in the village and ward secretariat,” said civil supplies commissioner Kona Sasidhar .

He said that the administration will launch the household distribution of rice in one assembly segment in each district from April and cover all the 175 constituencies by August. Sasidhar said that the government will supply quality rice through rice cards to all BPL families.

“When we examined the patient, we found three blockages in his coronary arteries after angiography but there were multiple limitations that made it difficult to administer either angioplasty or bypass surgery as all blockages were calcified,” said Sanghvi.

Without breaking the calcium deposit, even the stents would not have entered the blocked arteries and even if they entered, they would not have dilated properly, rendering the procedure worthless.

Sanghvi said that usually elderly patients have more calcium deposit and intervention at higher age is always a risk. “So we decided to use the all-new technology , the Intravascular Shock Wave Lithotripsy, to de-calcify the arteries before proceeding with stent installation. We successfully conducted the entire procedure in 45 minutes,” said Sanghvi, adding that three stents have been installed in the patient in the blockages and the patient is recovering fast.

Associate professor (Cardiology) Pawan Sarda said that the balloon in this technique carried an ultra-sonic transmitter, which emitted Sonic Pressure Waves, which broke the calcium deposit in the arteries.

“This technique breaks calcium, making stent implantation easier and stents are properly expanded,” he said adding that the team of doctors conducted the procedure without any external assistance.

He said that this technique was first introduced in the US in June 2017 and had come to India on January 11 this year.

MUMBAI: Coaching campuses , like many other businesses, are passing through testing times. With their backs to the walls, they have come up with a new model for tuition classes.A dozen tutorials have joined hands in a mega Mumbai experiment to share faculty , experience and expertise, thus birthing ‘Edumentors’ out of the crisis. The core mission of these 12, who serve different parts of the city, is to share the big bill of faculty pay so that they do not have to cut corners. “We share our faculty and notes, our stationery supplier is the same and so is the man who furnishes our classes with tables and benches. The interior designer is the same. Coming together and sharing has been a celebration,” said Govindraj Chettiar , one of the directors of Raju Sir’s Academy .The experiment is spreading. In Thane, Logical Academy, Excel Classes and Karnavat Coaching , which were all running three commerce self-financing courses with small batch sizes, joined hands to offer one course each. “Instead of cutting costs and running courses for 10 or 15 students, we decided to divide the market. Now each of us only takes one course. Students wanting to study BMS come to Karnavat, Logical Academy only teaches BAF and Excel picked the BBI programme,” said Sachin Karnavat.With a tagline, “Let’s merge to emerge”, the Maharashtra Coaching Classes Owners’ Association (MCCOA) seems to have found a way out of the crisis. “Of the 98,000 coaching classes in Maharashtra, 40% are operating at a loss or are just managing to break even,” said president Sachin Karnavat.Now, consolidation is paying off. Four classes in Dombivli have broken down the walls of rivalry and prudently realigned. Amol Damle of Samarth Classes, Anand Subramanium of A’s Academy, Virchand Maisheri and Vijay Gawas came together to jointly offer tuitions for class XI, XII and CA and CS courses.It’s not a rosy picture yet. With student enrolment plummeting, discounts are the order of the day. “Almost 90% of the classes are not getting the sticker price of their courses though most have not upped fees from last year,” said Narendra Bambwani, former MCCOA secretary. Fees at his Reliable Classes are down 25%. The reasons are many. Some students don’t join a class for the first term and sign up only for the final term, others turn to app tutorials. “Also, it is now easier to pass because of internal tests and the emphasis on objective questions. The choice in question exams has increased. Students in many subjects are asked to answer three questions of six,” added Bambwani.The hyper competition in the market, with the introduction of digital platforms, has disrupted the tutorials business. “When parents come for admission, they demand discounts and if we don’t budge, we lose the student to a cheaper competitor or a home-maker who is running private tuitions out of home,” said Prajesh Trotsky, consultant to several coaching classes.Unemployment has proved a double-edge sword for the business. “The ones without jobs are starting tuitions to teach and earn. And those with children are not sending kids to classes because of unemployment or poor pay cheques. Then, some students are moving to tech and online tutorials. Schemes like ‘pay-for-XII-get-XI-free’ abound in the market,” he added. Every student enrolled is a battle won and some are willing to go to any extent to get them.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74054977,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37943,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/in-testing-times-coaching-centres-join-hands-to-share-faculty-and-expertise/articleshow/74052022.cms

Kerala DGP Loknath Behera

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a welcome move, the police department will soon introduce a system through which people can give their feedback to senior police officers on the action taken by police based on their complaints.

State police chief Loknath Behera has directed all district police chiefs to randomly chose 10 people everyday from among those who file complaints before local police stations under their jurisdiction and speak to them directly over the phone. This move is expected to increase efficiency of the local police when dealing with case. It is also expected to improve the behaviour of policemen towards complainants as it would allow the latter a chance to share any bitter experience they had while visiting police stations.

In a statement issued on Sunday, Behera said that all district police chiefs must randomly choose 10 complainants from their limits and speak to them. Similarly, the deputy inspectors general in charge of ranges and inspectors generals in charge of zones must also call 10 complainants every day. Behera and the additional director general of police (Law and Order) will also be doing the same. Henceforth, people are requested to provide their phone number too along with the complainant in order to effectively implement this system. The new system will come into effect as the state government will declare police stations as service delivery centres.

The DGP said that thousands of complaints of various nature are received at police stations across the state every day. Efforts are on to digitize details of these complaints following the lines of Crime and Criminal Tracking Network in which digital records of active cases are made available to all police stations. Once the system of real-time digitization of complaints is realized, it will be easy for senior officers to accesss these datas on their fingertips and contact the complainants. Collecting feedbacks from the complainants on a daily basis will help the department assess the quality of services provided through police stations and also introduce necessary changes in their functions if needed, Behera said.

BS Yediyurappa

SHIVAMOGGA/HUBBALLi: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday reiterated portfolios for all new ministers will be distributed on Monday and the exercise was not completed sooner only because of weekend holidays.

“I had completed all the formalities on the portfolio allocation,” Yediyurappa said, appearing to rubbish rumours that the delay was caused due to a tussle over portfolios. “However, considering it was a weekend, I decided to postpone handing them out. On Monday all portfolios will be announced.”

The CM also promised to induct loyalists into his council of ministers, admitting Umesh Katti, Hukkeri legislator, should not have been left out. Speaking in Shivamogga earlier in the day, Yediyurappa said Katti was scheduled to take oath last week along with the 10 defectors, but the decision was scrapped at the last minute due to “unavoidable reasons”. “But I have discussed the issue with Katti. Considering he is from North Karnataka and that we have worked together for many years, he will be included in the cabinet soon,” Yediyurappa said.

When questioned on more prominent legislators from his home district missing out — especially Thirthalli Arag Jnanendra — he said a “different responsibility” has been given to him and has already explained why he could not be inducted.

Yediyurappa refused to react to comments by former chief ministers Siddaramaiah and HD Kumaraswamy on government’s survival, saying he would rather concentrate on the state’s development. “It is common for the opposition to criticize the government, but I’m busy preparing for the budget, which will be presented on March 5. I am concentrating on my work,” he said.

In Davangere, Yediyurappa said he is committed to increasing internal reservation for the Valmiki community under the ST quota from 3% to 7.5%, apart from considering a separate department for the community to address their issues. Speaking at a Valimik community event, Yediyurappa said Justice Nagamohan Das has been asked to submit his report at the earliest to bring in reservation.

In Mysuru, chief minister Yediyurappa’s son and BJP Yuva Morcha general secretary BY Vijayendra on Sunday said the district will get representation in his father’s cabinet soon, pointing to the six existing vacancies. He said former minister AH Vishwanath will be made a minister as Yediyurappa is known for delivering on his promises. Speaking to reporters, he said his father has expanded his council of ministers, ensuring there were no complaints and he will include more legislators given that there are six more vacancies.

NEW DELHI: More than 50 years after its establishment, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) is all set to undergo the biggest infrastructural overhaul. The Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur OPD block on the main campus will be relocated to the new building at Masjid Moth , located about half a kilometre away from the main campus.TOI recently visited the upcoming eight-storey facility where workers could be seen giving final touches and fixing the fitments.“The old OPD block had outlived its utility. It wasn’t able to cope with the patient load. Therefore, the institute decided to build a new one. It is a truly modern building with disabled-friendly services, such as separate counters for the specially abled and a ramp for wheelchairs and trolleys, among others,” said Dr Arti Vij, chairman, media protocol division, AIIMS.Vij added that the new block would be made operational in two phases. The first phase, starting February 10, will involve shifting of OPDs for general medicine , endocrinology and orthopaedics, among others. In the second phase, a fully-automated core lab with capacity to handle over two lakh tests daily will be made operational.“There are nine lifts for patients in the new block, three for staff and one for equipment. Also, there is a queue management system, which will be enrolled in the second phase,” said another official.Over 8,000 patients from across the country visit the AIIMS OPD daily. Currently, the OPD services are run from Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur OPD Block, which came up in 1950s. It is overcrowded and patients are often found squatting on the floor. The new block is designed to serve better, an official said.“The new building will have a dedicated lab for OPD patients to increase the number of tests and decrease waiting time. It will also have a waiting area, minor operation theatres and resuscitation facilities on each floor,” said the official.The doctors at the hospital said that shifting outpatient department services would help decongest the main hospital and allow for better management of inpatient facilities. “The existing OPD may be utilised to expand emergency medicine and other inpatient departments, depending on the need assessments,” said a senior doctor.In addition to the OPD block, the Masjid Moth campus in south Delhi will also house the upcoming mother-and-child and surgical blocks. The authorities said both the buildings were ready and furnishing and equipment installation under way. All these projects, he added, were conceptualised long ago and the construction work started between 2014 and 2015.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74055833,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-205331,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/more-facilities-less-wait-at-new-aiims-opd-block/articleshow/74051648.cms

JAIPUR: Taking cognizance of the rising unrest among university students over different issues, the Maharaja Ganga Singh University (MGSU), Bikaner, has established a constitution park.

While work on Gandhi Park and Bharat Nirman Park is under progress, aiming to educate students on the Constitution and to re-introduce national ethos and values to them.

The university has claimed to have taken first-of-its-kind initiative in the country for having three unique parks.

The MGSU is one of the country’s biggest (in terms of land) university spread in 1,183 acres. The Constitution park welcomes you with a signage taking you through circular walkways with important articles of the Constitution carved on black plaques. The plaques have the preamble, fundamental duties, directive principles, roles of important people in drafting of the Constitution along with important portions. The park came up on a sandy land. It concludes with an Ashok Stambh right behind the 100-feet tall national flag. The park is almost ready with work in its final stages.

“The way university students are engaged in heated debates over CAA, NRC and other issues. It becomes important for us as an institute to tell them what is right and wrong in the light of the Constitution. This exercise will keep students informed, which will eventually help in taking right decisions,” said Bitthal Bissa, deputy registrar of MGSU.

The Bharat Nirman Park will have statues of national heroes like Swami Vivekananda, Chandrashekar Azad, Bhagat Singh and Subhash Chandra Bose. The park is 100 metres in length and 50 metres wide with all the information on these heroes. Every statue will be erected on a five-metre platform. The most ambitious project is to create Gandhi Park. “The aim is to take Gandhiji beyond his statue. This park will have Gandhiji’s important visits like round table conferences in London, important movements—Satyagraha, Civil Disobedience and his role in the freedom movement. It will be in pictorial and illustration formats,” Bissa said.

269,['10/02/2020'],AP sets big incentives for industry in draft policy,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Vijayawada: The draft Industrial Promotion and Export Promotion policy 2020-25 of the AP government has forecast a substantial increase in incentives to Rs 4,638 crore from the Rs 2,431 crore of incentives offered during the 2015-2020 period.

The draft says that the total interest subsidy during its lifetime is expected to be Rs 595 crore compared to the 314 crore in 2015-2020.

Similarly, the investment subsidy is expected to be Rs 2,315 crore in 2020-25 compared to the Rs 1,026 crore in the earlier policy.

Power cost reimbursement is expected to increase to Rs 520 crore from Rs 356 crore, while sales tax reimbursement is expected to touch Rs 1,059 crore from Rs 642 crore. Incentive under the “Others” head is set to increase to Rs 149 crore from Rs 94 crore.

As per the breakup cited in the draft, the “overall incentive outflow from the state” is estimated at Rs 674 crore in 2020-21, Rs 779 crore in 2021-22, Rs 904 crore in 2022-23, Rs 1052 crore in 2023-24 and Rs 1,230 crore in 2024-25, taking the total to Rs 4,638 crore in the five-year period of the policy’s run. The state expects the incentives given to industry would result in direct employment to 2,48,482 people, while the total investment is estimated at Rs 38,119 crore in the 2020-25 period. According to the draft, each Rs 1 crore of investment is expected to create seven new jobs.

The draft says that the inflow to the state during the 2020-25 period is expected to be Rs 3,896 crore, including Rs 858 crore through State GST due to tax on capital expenditure and Rs 3,039 crore through State GST due to sales accrued to Andhra Pradesh.

Most of the investment subsidy is expected to be offered to the MSME sector. The policy aims to increase the growth of manufacturing from 13.5% to 20% of the Gross Value Added.

Referring to AP’s policy of reserving 75% of jobs in the private sector to “locals”, it says that units that employ more than the mandated 75% “locals” would be given a one-time cash incentive of Rs 3,000 per employee for the initial two years.

The policy says that the focus for investment would be the Agritech, agro-based and food processing, aerospace and defence, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, textiles and apparel, electronics and auto and auto components.

Hyderabad: Accessing old records of repeat offenders was easier said than done in the past. This wouldn’t be the case anymore as the state police will now be able to refer to the criminal antecedents of the accused at the time of filing the First Information Report (FIR).

Police have linked the crime database of the state with the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) FIR registration page, which will enable the investigation officers to prepare a stronger case against repeat offenders.

Earlier, police could get certain details of the accused’s criminal history only at the time of arrest and after the accused’s fingerprints were recorded in the database. “Mostly, antecedents of property offenders are checked,” said an IT cell official. Due to this lacuna, offenders who had a history of offences against women and children, causing bodily harm and road accidents, used to secure bail easily as the investigation officers were usually unaware of the accused’s criminal history.

In cases where the details of the accused are known at the time of filing the FIR, the new feature that runs in the background will alert the police officer entering the details of the FIR about the criminal history of the accused. “We have been building a database of repeat offenders in the state. If the accused in a road accident case has a history of similar cases, the system will show a pop-up and the investigation officer can mention the details in the remand report. This way, the accused will not be able to secure bail easily. Also, investigation can be carried out in a better way and a strong case can be made against the accused,” said DGP M Mahendar Reddy.

The feature is being tested on a pilot basis in Telangana and the background search starts as soon as the police officer filing the FIR clicks on the ‘known offender’ option. Particulars such as the name of the accused, his/her father’s name and address can be searched in the police database. “Investigation officers have been instructed to mention the criminal history of the accused while sending remand reports to courts,” the DGP said.

NEW DELHI: The 15th Finance Commission is likely to recommend setting up of a Rs 10,000-15,000 crore fund for welfare of jawans killed or injured in combat. The move is part of the panel's discussions on a separate allocation for defence, a task that was given to it later.

""We were the first (Finance) Commission to visit Ladakh, we saw some very moving presentations on the Kargil war and we recognise that sacrifices by young men for India's protection must be recognised and we need to have some institutional arrangement, like a large corpus for Jawan Welfare Fund . If the corpus is reasonable, then the proceeds from that can go towards welfare of families and jawans. We need to make sure that there is no duplication because almost every state government and the Centre have funds. We need to pool these resources,"" 15th Finance Commission chairman NK Singh told TOI.

The panel has set up a task force under Singh to look at various aspects of providing resources for defence and the proposed Jawan Welfare Fund will be part of that. Apart from the finance commission chief, secretaries for defence, home and expenditure will be members.

""We're getting different assessments for defence forces and paramilitary. We need to try and make sure that we don't excessively centralise it and create a robust one for defence and internal security because they are being governed by two large ministries,"" he said.

MUMBAI: A man who arrived on a flight from Dubai on Sunday morning was arrested for carrying fake Rs 2 ,000 notes with a face value of almost Rs 24 lakh. The notes were of high quality, incorporating seven of nine security features .The accused told police they were printed in Pakistan and sent to Dubai, with India intended as the final destination. The denomination, when issued in 2016, was touted as highly secure, but RBI said in October that no Rs 2,000 note was printed in 2019 as NIA had found high-quality fakes .The passenger, Javed Shaikh (36), a Kalwa resident, had been to Dubai and Bangkok in the past and may have brought in many such consignments. Police are questioning him about who the present consignment was meant for. “An average person will not be able to identify the fake notes. They look genuine. Shaikh walked away at the airport’s security check. He was caught at the bus stop outside the international terminal,” said joint commissioner of police (crime) Santosh Rastogi, who did not rule out a terror link.He said Shaikh could be caught because of a CIA tip-off . “The counterfeit currency was stuffed in one of his bags. It took us over an hour to locate it,” Rastogi said.“We identified him because of his white jeans. It was around 9.30am. He was waiting for a BEST bus... The notes were scattered inside a cushion, which was stuffed into a gap between the bag’s wall and a cloth liner,” he said.The format of the notes’ arrangement was the reason why they couldn’t be detected by baggage scanners. “A scanner identifies notes if they are kept in bundles. It’s the edges of the bundles that get detected. As opposed to this, Shaikh was carrying the notes in a scattered format, making machine detection difficult,” Rastogi said.On the quality of the notes, a crime branch officer said that the two security features that weren’t copied properly were ‘optically variable ink’ (ink that changes colour with changing angles) and ‘see-through register’ (hidden features that are seen only if a note is held against light).The team that busted Shaikh was the crime branch’s unit 8. Led by DCP Akbar Pathan, it included ACP Sangeeta Patil, and senior inspector Ajay Joshi.Shaikh has been booked under IPC sections for common intention, criminal conspiracy, and counterfeiting. During interrogation, he said he went to Dubai just five days ago, and for the first time. “But we don’t believe this,” said Rastogi.In Video: Mumbai: ‘Pak-made’ fake notes with face value of Rs 24 lakh seized",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053309,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-536249,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/pak-made-rs-2k-fakes-with-rs-24l-face-value-seized-from-city-flyer/articleshow/74052028.cms

Tribal groups in Agency areas of Visakhapatnam district have raised an alarm over cases of land belonging to tribals being taken over by people from the plains.

Ramarao Dora, convener of the Adivasi Reservation Parirakshana Porata Samithi, alleged that people from the plains are taking over land owned by tribal people in Anantagiri, Araku and Lambasingi to build infrastructure for tourism. “Several tent projects have been set up in the three places, which are used for prostitution,” Dora said on Sunday, adding that apart from affecting the local ecology, tourism projects and illegal mining are leading to an exodus of tribal people to the plains.

“We have been pleading with the government to take action against commandeering of tribal land in reserved areas because it has affected the livelihood of tribal people. We have also written to the President, the Prime Minister and other senior officials in New Delhi to take action against encroachment of tribal land, but nothing has been done so far,” Dora said.

An Adivasi Aatmagaurava Sabha will be held by tribals in Paderu in the district on February 12. Over one lakh people are expected to attend the event, Dora said.

On the reservation of seats for tribals, Dora said, “Of the 12 ZPTCs in the Agency, the government has reserved four for Backward Classes and the rest for the open category. There is no seat for Scheduled Tribes.”

Jaipur: State varsities are set to change their curriculum making it more employable from the upcoming session, incorporating new developments in science, economics and history.

The state-funded universities are forming a committee to execute these changes with the industry experts in real time. So far, the change in the curriculum took place every three years and in phases. The move came after the governor house directed all the state-funded universities to change their curriculum in a meeting with the vice-chancellors on Friday.

Rashmi Jain, vice principal of Maharani’s College, said she has received a letter from the Rajasthan University VC’s office to take steps towards changing the curriculum. “It is a welcome step taken by the governor. The change in curriculum is a mammoth task which is done by the board of studies. We have leass than three months remaining to change the curriculum, which makes the task very daunting. But if everyone resolves, it will be done,” Rashmi said. The changes must be made keeping in mind the employability.

Experts said degree courses cannot become employable until research modules, skill-based learning and practical studies or training is added. “Adding all these elements in one phase is not possible. It has to be done repeatedly for some years with consistent revision,” said Puneet Sharma, an educationist.

The governor house also directed the universities to introduce semester system in BA Honours degree. “No doubt, semester system is far better than the usual system, but the former requires more resources like teachers, labs and classrooms. The semester system has bi-assessment system in an academic cycle while the usual system has only one,” Rashmi said.

Thiruvananthapuram: In a bid to attract more people, especially the youth to police force, the state police authorities have decided to conduct parades, and display performances of police brass band and dog squads in public places regularly. The decision is inspired from the massive public attention the police could garner when they conducted the Republic Day Parade at Beach Road in Kozhikode on January 26.

In a statement issued here on Saturday, state police chief Loknath Behera said that henceforth the weekly parades of police personnel attached to local police stations and battalions must be conducted in public places so that general public can view it. Similarly, the police brass band troupes are also directed to conduct at least one public performance per week. The district police chiefs are also directed to conduct a show of performances of the dog squads for the public at least once in a month.

Behera said that such public parades and display of performances would help reduce the gap between the police and youths. This would also encourage the youth to work hand-in-hand with the police on schemes such as Janamaithri Community Policing in which the participation of the public is very essential.

There are also discussions to conduct Independence Day and Republic Day parades of local police in places that are more accessible to the general public.

The session would commence with the governor’s speech and would be followed by the tabling of state budget in the assembly.

Later each department would table its budget individually. Notably, the BJP government had not held a single assembly session at Gairsain last year.

Opposition Congress had strongly raised the issue in the state assembly in the last session in Dehradun.

Even outside the state assembly, senior Congress leaders, including Harish Rawat, had slammed the government on the issue saying that “2019 was the first year since 2014 that a session was not held at Gairsain. This is against the spirit of Gairsain and the people of Uttarakhand.”

CM Trivendra Singh Rawat had earlier announced that the next session would be held in Gairsain.

The state government is expected to make the official announcement on the budget session after the cabinet meeting on February 12.

“Since the state government is paying salary to the teachers of aided schools, the government can also give rent for the school buildings, if the managements wish to rent out the schools to the government. If situation demands, the government is also willing to take over aided schools,” said the chief minister. He was speaking at the valedictory function of Kerala School Teachers’ Association state meet.

“The state budget proposed to plug loopholes in Kerala Education Rules (KER), so that the practice of aided school mangers making unjustifiable appointment of teachers is curbed.

He added that some people are seeing the education sector with a business mind. “They are trying to exaggerate the number of students. It will not be permited,” he said.

Pinarayi Vijayan

ALAPPUZHA: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that aided school managers should not try to threaten the state government.

“Since the state government is paying salary to the teachers of aided schools, the government can also give rent for the school buildings, if the managements wish to rent out the schools to the government. If situation demands, the government is also willing to take over aided schools,” said the chief minister. He was speaking at the valedictory function of Kerala School Teachers’ Association state meet.

“The state budget proposed to plug loopholes in Kerala Education Rules (KER), so that the practice of aided school mangers making unjustifiable appointment of teachers is curbed. Some aided school managers have come out against it. As per the budget, new posts can be created in aided schools only with the concurrence of the state government. It has put a stop to the practice of managements creating a new post when the number of students increases in a division in aided schools. Managers had demanded that the government should take over school buildings and said that they only needed rent. If the state government can pay the salary of aided school teachers, it is capable of meeting the rental charges of the buildings too. They should not try to threaten the government by saying this,” the Vijayan said.

He added that some people are seeing the education sector with a business mind. “They are trying to exaggerate the number of students. It will not be permited,” he said.

In another function, Vijayan said that his government would construct at least one housing complex in each district for the landless and homeless under the next segment of LIFE Mission.

He was speaking after handing over the keys of 121 houses sponsored by Ramoji Film City and constructed by Kudumbashree members for the flood victims at a function held at here on Sunday.

285,['10/02/2020'],Anomalies in Aerostat system &amp; UAV purchase order led to cancellation,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Hyderabad: The Andhra Pradesh police’s attempt to purchase Aerostat, an aerial surveillance equipment and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) from Israel has landed the then top cops in N Chandrababu Naidu ’s regime in trouble.

The aerial surveillance equipment, used by agencies like the US Customs and Border Protection, was meant to keep an eye on Maoists and red sanders smugglers. An enquiry by the current Jaganmohan Reddy government found procedural irregularities and involvement of the company owned by the son of the then additional DGP (intelligence), AB Venkateswara Rao .

In April 2017, the AP government issued GO No. 741 allowing DGP N Sambasiva Rao, additional DGP (intelligence), AB Venkateswara Rao, deputy conservator of forests special task force for red sanders protection BNN Murthy to visit Yavne in Israel in April 2017 for a practical demonstration of Skystart 180 Aerostat System. An Israeli company, RT LTA Systems, a subsidiary of Aeronautics, is the manufacturer of both Aerostat and the UAV worth around Rs 45 crore.

Despite objections raised by senior IPS official, Nimmagadda Surendra Babu, a member of the purchase committee, the police department went ahead with the procurement process. In November 2017, Venkateswara Rao visited Israel for an International Cyber Security Seminar.

On December 7, 2017, the AP home department issued a GO granting permission to procure Skystar 180 Aerostat and Orbiter 3 through State Trading Corporation of India. During this period, two police chiefs have changed, but Venkateswara Rao kept pushing for the purchase of the equipment.

Another senior IPS official, Nalini Prabhat had raised concerns regarding the procurement as to why there is no live demonstration of the equipment in India and raised objections on its efficacy. Meanwhile, the then DGP RP Thakur received an anonymous complaint that the Akasam Advanced Systems, that is dealing on behalf of the Israeli company is owned by the son of Venkateswara Rao.

Following this, RP Thakur cancelled the purchased order. The equipment was never bought, and there was no monetary loss to the government in the whole process. However, the Jagan government that took up the issue, found severe procedural irregularities and have suspended the officer as there was an intention and attempt to buy the equipment. The government is also contemplating proceeding against the incident under the Prevention of Corruption Act by roping in the Anti-Corruption Bureau.

According to Ministry of Corporate Affairs records,Venkateswara Rao’s son Aluru Chetan Sai Krishna had incorporated a company named Akasam Advanced Systems in Vijayawada on July 11, 2017, three months after Rao’s visit to Israel. The key allegation is that Akasam was involved as an Indian dealer of Israel-based company called RT Inflatables. A search on the web shows a company by the name of RT LTA Systems, but there is no trace of a company called RT Inflatables.

AB Venkateswara Rao has denied any involvement of his son or himself in the process. Sources close to him said that Global Tender was called in to find out the exact price of the equipment and State Trading Corporation was roped in to deal with the purchase.

Sources close to Venkateswara Rao said all correspondence was conducted from DGP office and Intelligence department was only the user agency. Tenders were cancelled thrice as they received only one bid. During this time, an Araku MLA was murdered by Maoists in the agency area. Sources said that then DGP had issued orders after the MLA’s murder. “DGP RP Thakur cancelled the order after senior officials raised objections. AB V Rao's family is not involved,” a source said.

Villagers also demanded to know the status of the expansion plan of the garbage treatment plant, which they had earlier opposed. Sarpanch Shraddha Borkar said they are still waiting for data collected by experts. Assuring villagers that the panchayat “is with the people”, Borkar said the panchayat would write to the chief minister again, opposing the plant’s expansion.

The budgetary provisions for several developmental works were also announced. The secretary said the panchayat has been allocated nearly Rs 14 lakh under the 14th finance commission for many of these works.

Former sarpanch Eknath Oraskar pointed out that no allocation had been made for sports infrastructure and a village library and suggested that the budget be revised to include the same.

A villager, Mario Cordeiro, highlighted the badly-maintained light poles near the Saligao junction. The sarpanch said they would write to the electricity department asking that these be repaired urgently. The sarpanch was also requested to act against heavy trucks passing through the no-entry zones in the village during peak hours.

Another villager, Bola Ghadi, suggested that signboards be erected in the vicinity of the Lourdes Convent school cautioning motorists to drive safely.

KOCHI: Taking their investigation to the social media, the city police are closing in on two thieves, apparently foreign nationals, who steal high end mobile phones from shops in the district.Since the only clue about the accused were the visuals from a CCTV camera, police sought the help of their 1.3 million followers on Facebook and posted a video of the crime, seeking tips about the accused. It was on Friday night, the police posted the video of two seemingly white men nicking a mobile phone from a shop at Chembumukku in Thrikkakara. One among the duo was seen talking to the salesman, distracting him, even as the other leans over the counter and nicks a mobile phone. He can be seen keeping it in his bag before leaving the shop. Two days on, police have been getting calls from across the district and nearby towns.Police, however, are yet to get to the accused. In some cases, the callers either misidentified the accused while in other cases the accused managed to give police the slip.In one tip received by the police, a theft attempt was reported at a mobile phone shop at North Paravur. Police got information that the accused had asked the way for Vypeen from the area.Based on this input, police have strengthened surveillance in Vypeen area where tourists frequent. “There is a temple festival going on at Cherai and the police have been asked to stay vigilant. Checking for the accused duo is being held in this area as well,” said an officer. Another tip call, according to sources, came from Koothattukulam where the caller identified two persons similar to those in the video, however, these persons were later identified to be two Rajasthan natives.Police said the accused are repeat offenders who roam the state posing as tourists. “We have identified two-three cases from across the district and it seems like the same duo have committed the crime. Their modus operandi is also the same. One among them distracts the person manning the shop while the other makes the loot. Their target mostly are mobile phone shops,” said a police officer.Police also sought the help of WhatsApp groups of mobile phone shop owners to spread the video of the crime and seek tips about the accused. “When we shared the video on WhatsApp, we got CCTV visuals of a theft from Chavakkad in Thrissur. The men in the video looks similar and their modus is also the same. It is hard to track them as we don’t know their whereabouts,” said a police officer.Police said they have approached the Foreigner Regional Registration Office (FRRO) as well. “We have sought the help of FRRO and are trying to get the passport details of the accused.

PANAJI: Around 230 cases of crimes against women , including cases of rape, molestation and outraging of modesty —have remained undetected in the state, over the past five years.

Goa police said they were trying to solve the undetected cases. “From time to time, directions are given to all the investigation officers to conduct thorough and speedy investigations and to make sincere efforts to detect the cases,” chief minister Pramod Sawant in a written reply tabled in the state legislative assembly.

There are two police stations for women in the state— one at Panaji (North Goa) and the other, a women and child protection unit, at Margao (South Goa), Sawant said.

Goa police have registered cases of rape, kidnapping, molestation, eve-teasing, marital abuse, dowry deaths and immoral trafficking of women, among others. While chargesheets have been filed in many cases, based on evidence, most of the cases are pending trial. Some cases have been closed by the police , due to lack of evidence.

Goa police have made arrests in several cases of crime against women in the past couple of years. Police had arrested three Indore-based men for gangraping a 20-year-old woman at Betalbatim beach. The three raped the woman, filmed the act, and demanded money in exchange for not making the video public.

A 22-year-old chef from Kuwait and native of Kolhapur, Joseph Das, was arrested for molesting a 17-yearold German girl at Ourem beach in Canacona.

The police had arrested nine tourists from Pune for allegedly attempting to outrage the modesty of a minor girl at Calangue beach. The nine men also assaulted the girl’s minor brother and created a ruckus before they were arrested.

KOCHI: The police team investigating the case of the abandoned body of a preterm baby which was found in a bucket in Perandoor Canal at Elamakkara on February 2 has found that it was a case of abortion and that the body was “unscientifically dumped” in the canal by someone who was supposed to dispose of the medical waste.

According to top police sources, the investigation found that the baby was legally aborted in a city hospital and the police have taken the statements of the parents. The police said that they are probing to find the person who dumped the body in the canal after the hospital handed over the body as medical waste post abortion. Meanwhile, the police refused to divulge the identity of neither the parents nor the hospital.

“We confirmed that the baby was aborted at the advice of the doctor after they found out about its abnormal growth. As the baby’s age was less than 25 weeks, which is the permissible limit for abortion, no action will be taken against the parents. We are yet to confirm how the hospital has managed the disposal of the body, which is medical waste. The probe is currently on to find the person who did that,” said a police officer.

The bucket with the body was spotted by children who were playing near the canal on Makkaparambu Theeradesha Road. The water current brought it to the edge of the canal and when they saw it, they mistook the body for a doll and picked up the bucket. But when they realized it was a body, they called elders in the area and they alerted the police.

296,['10/02/2020'],Calicut University researchers invent slow-release fertilizers,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Calicut University (File Photo)

KOZHIKODE: Researchers at Calicut University have come up with an eco-friendly solution to a long standing problem faced by farmers of having 70% of nitrogen fertilizers, mainly urea, getting wasted before plants can absorb them.

Urea which makes up for around 50% of total nitrogen fertilizer consumption worldwide, is susceptible to nitrogen loss to the environment due to its fast and premature decomposition nature. It has also been causing environmental damage due to agricultural runoff of massive levels of fertilizers to water bodies often resulting in harmful algal blooms in waterways.

CU researchers have now developed a slow-release fertilizer composite by giving a glassy/crystalline coating to urea using sugar acetates (sucrose octaacetate (SOA)) by processing it in a CO2 solvent medium.

P Raveendran, professor of Chemistry and Dean (Faculty of Sciences) at CU, along with researcher Anu Antony of the varsity Chemistry department have jointly made the invention. Raveendran said that while urea takes around 15 minutes for total decomposition, the slow-release composite of urea and sugar acetates takes upto 90 hours for decomposition.

The SOA-urea composite prepared in CO2 medium forms an amorphous glassy solid which results in immobilization of urea, leading to slow-release to the soil.

The new fertilizer composite has a simple, green and non-hazardous preparation process as all materials used in the process, including the SOA coating material and CO2 solvent, are inexpensive and environmentally benign. “The slow-releasing fertilizer composites ensure efficient nutrient uptake by reducing loss of nutrients via leaching, runoff, volatilization etc., and thereby improving crop yield and reducing the amount of fertilizer needed,” said Raveendran.

He said that apart from urea, the technique can be applied to other fertilizers including ammonium nitrate , potassium nitrate , calcium nitrate etc.

According to researchers, a major drawback associated with the application of urea as a fertilizer is its fast and premature decomposition causing inefficient absorption of nitrogen by the plant.

In the initial stages, plants require only a very small amount of the nutrient. However, the demand for nutrients increases during the upcoming stages of growth. Leaching, surface runoff and vaporization of urea further lower the amount of urea present in the soil for uptake by the plants in their growing stages and about 40 to 70% of nitrogen escapes to the environment and only the remaining small amount of nitrogen is left for the uptake by the plants.

Also, the new invention will prevent fertilizer burning plants due to fast release of urea that can adversely affect the growth of the plant. Researchers have filed patent application for the new invention.

Vijayawada: Krishna district administration says it has focused on completing the Kanaka Durga flyover works and inaugurate it in a huge way, at the earliest. District collector A Mohammed Imtiaz, who is monitoring the works of the flyover, said that they want to inaugurate it by March 31. Officials said they have already completed the works of the Benz circle flyover and have started trial runs.

The Kanaka Durga flyover project is a dream project for the residents of Bhavanipuram, Gollapudi, Vidhyadharapuram and One Town areas who are frequently faced with severe traffic jams. The Telugu Desam party-led government had begun the works of 2.3-km, six-lane flyover and 2.9-km-long road widening from VMC office junction to Bhavanipuram.

Though work on the flyover began in November 2015, the project got delayed due to poor funds and the project’s complicated design. The project missed the deadline five times when the TDP government was in power.

Following special interest in the project from chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy the deadline of December 31, 2019 was fixed.

But once again, project works missed the deadline and the state government took the issue seriously. Collector Imtiaz, who is inspecting the project every week, said the project works were about 90% complete.

“We are keeping efforts to complete the project works soon and permit traffic from March. A minor portion of works is pending and the agency has already started landing works. We are confident we won’t miss the deadline this time,” Imtiaz said.

Meanwhile, citizens are happy with the pace of project works and requested the district administration to focus on developing connecting roads. “We have waited for almost five years for the Kanaka Durga flyover to be complered. We are happy that the project works have gained pace at least now. Officials should also develop connecting roads before permitting heavy vehicles through the flyover,” said Kaja Nageswara Rao, a cloth merchant from One Town.

Visakhapatnam: Medical authorities in Vizianagaram will take up a mass vaccination drive against filariasis in association with the malaria control department from February 10 to 12.

The drive will provide tablets to more than 2.4 million people in the district and is geared toward making Vizianagaram filariasis-free. East Godavari and Vizianagaram districts are among the two most affected by the disease in Andhra Pradesh.

There are at least 4,000 confirmed cases of filariasis in the district. Dr S Ramani Kumari, district medical and health officer (DMHO) told TOI, “We are not sure of the actual spread. Symptomatic cases show that there are 4,000. But the actual number of people affected or those carrying the disease are unknown.”

The DMHO as well as the district malaria control department agree that Vizianagaram town, Parvathipuram and Salur are the most affected. A Sambamurthy, district malaria control officer said, “Vizianagaram has a number of water tanks that are very old. The conditions are similar in Parvathipuram and Salur where water bodies are dirty. These are breeding grounds of the culex mosquito which is a vector for passing on filiriasis.”

302,['10/02/2020'],Govt assures job for victim’s brother,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: Leaders cutting across the political spectrum expressed grief over the demise of Ankita Pisudde, who succumbed to burn injuries here on Monday. Right from governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and deputy CM Ajit Pawar, many condolences to the family.

While the governor called for introspection by citizens over the “unfortunate incident”, the CM assured that the case against her assailant Vikesh Nagrale would be tried in the fast track court. Thackeray also informed that the government had already appointed noted lawyer Ujjwal Nikam to fight her case.

“The entire society is agitated today. Women are progressing in all walks of life. They are assuming newer responsibilities and tackling challenges efficiently. In order to further hasten their progress, society must bear a positive attitude towards them,” Koshiyari said.

Home minister Anil Deshmukh assured a job to a member from her family, probably her brother. He held discussions with Nikam and the Wardha SP in the morning and asked them to prepare a strong case. He also assured full help to the family after the news of her death emerged in the morning.

While terming the 25-years-old teacher’s death as a blot on the entire state, Pawar called for stringent punishment to the accused, which would act as a deterrent in society.

Demanding stringent punishment for her stalker Nagrale, who threw petrol and set her afire, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said he would pray that the deceased’s family members get strength to come out of the shock. He requested the government to ensure justice for her.

Pressing for capital punishment for Pisudde’s assailant, PWD minister Ashok Chavan said the entire state was in a state of shock and there was resentment against the accused. “In such cases, the trials should be run on fast track basis and accused should be sentenced to gallows as early as possible.”

Revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat assured the government was standing with the victim’s family and would make every effort to ensure justice. “The Hinganghat incident is a shame for the entire state and the government will take responsibility to prevent such incidents. We’re also considering bringing in stringent laws to ensure that such incidents shouldn’t be repeated. Attempts were made to save the young victim by giving her the best medical treatment, but unfortunately we couldn’t save her. The government and the Congress party are with the family in their difficult time,” he said.

Expressing disappointment over the young victim’s death, human rights activist and lawyer Smita Singalkar said the incident displayed an urgent need to change the society’s mindset towards women. “It’s high time to work on men’s mentality, who usually don’t like to hear ‘no’ from women and they construe it as a setback to their superiority. The attitude to seek revenge develops after this. Parents, society and the government machinery should come together to make schoolchildren aware of this aspect right from the beginning. Every woman has a right to accept or reject a proposal,” she said.

303,['10/02/2020'],Conversion to Christianity by inducement should be punishable offence: RSS general secretary,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Suresh Joshi

PANAJI: National general secretary of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) Suresh ‘Bhaiyaji’ Joshi, on Sunday said while RSS does not oppose conversion to Christianity, it is opposed to conversions by way of exploitation and inducement of the poor, illiterate and the backward. This practice should be made punishable by law, Joshi said at a public interaction in Goa.

He also said that political opposition of BJP by any Hindus should not be seen as opposition of Hindus.

The top RSS functionary said that not just mass conversion, but even individual conversion was wrong. “Forceful conversion or by inducement, we say, should be made a punishable offence. There is no restriction on those who are going to Christianity on their own,” Joshi said, even as opposed the dishonesty of conversion by inducement.

“There are many cases across the country of those operating under the guise of NGOs. If you want to work in the area of water conservation, then why are you building a church in the village,” Joshi said while replying to a question from the audience.

In response to another audience question, he said that any opposition of Hindus by Hindus is only limited to the political stage. “You have written in your question that Hindu has become enemy of the Hindu community, meaning BJP. Hindu community does not mean BJP. Opposition to BJP should not be seen as opposing Hindus. All these political fights will continue. It should not be linked as opposition of Hindus...Opposing Hindutva is political. Supporting Hindutva is also, at times, political. I feel that Hindutva and Hindus should rise above this,” Joshi said.

He also said that without the concept and sentiment of a ‘rashtra’, the country will remain nothing but a piece of land, and that is how it is being wrongly viewed by some, as a mere geographical entity.

“Why are those born who are willing to give up everything and sacrifice for this motherland, if this is a lifeless land? Those who think Bharat is just the Himalayas, its mountains and its rivers, have not understood Bharat. Then they think that if there is a piece of land where not even grass grows and we have lost it, let it go. But it is not a lifeless piece of land. That is why I say that only praying to Bharatmata will give this country the strength and energy,” Joshi said, adding that just as a human being has atma (soul), the country too has a soul and that has been named as ‘rashtra’.

Joshi also said that a Hindu can never be communal because Hindus are not a community. “Those who worship one god, have one manner of worship, and believe in one book are considered a community. Since Hinduism doesn’t fit into this description, Hindus are not a community. Hindus, therefore, cannot be communal,” Joshi said.

The RSS has never stopped any non-Hindu from joining the organisation. But they will have to believe in Bharatmata. “We will not change our ideology or have a separate programme tailored from them,” Joshi said.

File photo of devotees at the Kanaka Durga temple

Vijayawada: Jana Sena on Sunday raised corruption charges against Sri Durga Malleswara Swamy Varla Devastanams management and said executive officer MV Suresh Babu was holding on to the post despite the high court orders.

Jana Sena spokesperson Pothina Venkata Mahesh made allegations of corruption against endowments minister Vellampalli Srinivas for allowing Suresh Babu to continue as an executive officer.

“Kanaka Durga temple is the second largest temple in the state after Tirumala Tirupati Devastanams but the apathy of the state government is hurting sentiments. The state government transferred IRS officer Koteswaramma as executive officer of the temple and in her place posted Suresh Babu, who is not eligible for the position. I have challenged this appointment in the high court. Despite a row of government orders issued to regularise his service, the high court said that Suresh Babu is ineligible for the post,” Mahesh said.

“Suresh Babu was given two promotions in three months, which is against the guidelines of the endowments department,” Mahesh alleged.

“The temple income has come down to Rs 2 crore per month in recent times ever since Suresh Babu took charge as executive officer. The temple’s expenses have also increased. Temple authorities cancelled the milk tender for Rs 42 per litre and allocated a new tender to the same vendor for Rs 44 per litre. Temple authorities are at liberty to waste the money donated by the devotees and minister Vellampalli Srinivas is indirectly supporting these acts,” Mahesh alleged.

“The chief minister should immediately post an IAS cadre official as EO and order a probe into the illegal contracts and tenders called for by Suresh Babu,” Mahesh demanded.

305,['10/02/2020'],"For a patriarchy fix, many young Tamil Nadu women opt for hymen reconstruction surgeries","Representative image

CHENNAI: A couple of months ago an uproar over reports of fake virginity products sold on Amazon India led to the e-tail giant taking down the merchandise. While not surprisingly, newer varieties of these synthetic blood-containing, self-dissolving cellulose capsules continue to be sold on websites of Indian pharmaceutical companies, there seems to be an equal, parallel demand for another virginity ‘restoring’ service — hymen reconstruction surgery or hymenoplasty — in Tamil Nadu.The surgical procedure with the aim to cause bleeding in women during post-nuptial intercourse (a common myth associated with the bride’s virginity), hymenoplasty surgeries in Chennai have in fact existed for as long as cosmetic surgeries, as a part and parcel of that specialisation. As a Chennai-based plastic surgeon says, ""Although it may stem from cultural reasons, for us, it is the same as repairing any ruptured tissue — like a torn earlobe or a cleft lip.""But for many young women living under the fear of social stigma and shaming, hymen reconstruction is a prerequisite for a good married life. Among the recent patients that Dr Karthik Ram, chief cosmetic surgeon at Chennai Plastic Surgery, had was a 26-year-old woman from Trichy, who wrote to them enquiring about the procedure ahead of her wedding. ""She had been looking for a safe place to get it done, and realised that travelling to Chennai would keep it confidential and simple,"" he says. ""We don’t usually probe our patients for reasons, but try to talk them out of it first. And this woman told us that her previous relationship ended, and her new family was conservative, so she couldn’t take a chance,"" he says.While cosmetic surgeons say they make it a point to reiterate to their clients what has for years been underlined by gynaecologists — that an intact hymen is not an indicator of virginity — their clinic’s websites are quite straightforward about the purpose of the service. Some call it ‘the restoration of virginity’ while others attribute it to ""cultural factors"" and protection from the ""shame and humiliation the woman may face if she’s discovered not to be a ‘virgin’ after marriage"".The conservative patriarchal mindset, which puts women on a pedestal by pandering to an ideal of purity and innocence, essentially encourages their objectification. ""We must understand that for young women signing up for the procedure, its gravity goes beyond medical reasoning. They’re scared and insecure, because they can’t at that point, be tutoring their fiancés about the myth behind the hymen. They just want to be safe,"" says another surgeon offering the service.In Coimbatore and Srirangam, hymenoplasty has been finding takers in young middle-class women hailing from conservative families and facing risk of humiliation. ""Most are women aged between 20 to 25 years. We recommend they come to us about two weeks before their wedding. Some are those getting married for the second time,"" says Dr Ram.The surgery is typically a minor one lasting less than an hour and healing too is fast, taking no more than two weeks at most, say surgeons. ""Initially, hymenoplasty fell under the range of surgeries intended at reversing the process of aging — repairing a tear following a difficult pregnancy, or restoring of the fat tissues in the vaginal region. But over the years, with its medical or aesthetic reasons becoming unfounded, it has been put under the umbrella of ‘cosmetic gynaecology’,"" says the Chennai-based surgeon.While in Chennai, takers are still few, a doctor says a good number of her hymenoplasty clients have also been women from the Middle East, where stigma is severe. ""I’ve also had older teens who have survived sexual abuse coming to us with their parents who fear their children will face trouble after marriage if their hymens are not restored,"" she says.Pointing out that this trend perpetuates a narrow-minded attitude and puts unrealistic pressure on young women, senior gynaecologist/obstetrician Dr Priya Selvaraj says young men and families needed to be educated most. ""Medically, the hymen by itself is a membranal structure that can partially, completely or very thinly cover the vaginal outlet. It can tear while doing heavy sports activity or tampon use. Also, due to its variable structure — appearance, elasticity and the extent to which it covers the vaginal opening — it cannot be used to ascertain whether a woman has had sexual intercourse or not,"" she says. ""Therefore, an intact hymen or even bleeding for the first time during intercourse, are not signs of virginity at all.""",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74055320,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-538027,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/going-under-the-knife-for-a-patriarchy-fix/articleshow/74051692.cms
306,['10/02/2020'],‘No head of religion can get in way of governance’,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Panaji: It is wrong for any religious body to issue a statement that will bring about a communal divide, transport minister Mauvin Godinho said on Sunday, reacting to the statement issued a day earlier by the archbishop of Goa and Daman, Filipe Neri Ferrao, against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Ferrao had appealed to the Centre to “immediately and unconditionally” revoke the CAA.

“No head of a religious body has the right to interfere in the governance of any state or country and especially make a comment that will bring about an opposition on communal basis. They should not be seen even indirectly as inciting some sort of communal tension,” Godinho said, adding, “The intention behind it may be very good. But one should be very careful.”

Commissioner for NRI affairs Narendra Sawaikar, in a series of tweets on Sunday, said the opposition to CAA was unfounded. “Why should Archbishop oppose #CAA? when SC is hearing & will decide a challenge to the law. 14 year Catholic girl is fighting for justice in Pakistan. Crores of people are supporting CAA. Unfounded opposition,” he tweeted.

In another tweet, he said, “Archbishop says that #CAA shld be withdrawn as it is being opposed. My question is why? When crores of people are supporting #CAA, including Goans. #StopSpreadingFalsehood.”

Meanwhile, ports minister Michael Lobo on Sunday said the archbishop, in his capacity as a religious head, has been issuing statements to guide his faithful and that no politician should comment on it. He also said that the Pope gives messages about his views on many issues to the world and similarly, Hindu religious heads, too, give clear messages to their community.

Guntur: Gurazala legislator Kasu Mahesh Reddy has prepared a plan to develop 20 villages in his constituency as model villages.

After studying the conditions and taking feedback from mandal-level officials, Mahesh Reddy has selected 20 villages to give a complete makeover in the next few months. He has held discussions with engineers from panchayat raj, rural development, rural water supply and other allied departments to ready an estimate to take up various development works in the villages.

“We are planning to make model villages with roads, drains and drinking water, including RO facility. We will ensure that no civic grievance is left unaddressed in these villages,” Mahesh Reddy said.

The MLA said they would expand the programme to other villages in a phased manner after completing the work in the first phase. He said that there was no dearth of funds for taking up the works. He said that they would also distribute house sites to all the eligible poor in the model villages.

Recalling the success of his experiment in making Narasaraopet town with 100 percent cement concrete roads when his father Krishna Reddy was legislator of the constituency in the past, Mahesh said that he was planning to upgrade civic facilities in Gurazala constituency.

He said that development works in phases would help them complete the projects. He said that they were planning to develop all the 100 villages in the constituency as model villages by 2024.

He said that chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy had announced a government medical college to his constituency and cleared comprehensive water grid project for Palnadu. “We have achieved two big projects—medical college and water grid—within six months of coming to power. We have also kept our promise of upgrading Dachepalle and Gurazala as municipal towns,” said Mahesh Reddy. He said that he would resume Jagananna Palle Baata, a walkathon, in the villages after local body elections.

309,['10/02/2020'],Kerala govt prepares Brahmapuram plant for fresh ‘lease’ of life,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Trouble mounting: The waste dumping yard at Brahmapuram

KOCHI: Even as work on the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram has started, the state government has kicked up a new controversy by deciding to replace the concession agreement with a lease agreement and revoke the Kochi corporation council’s decision in this regard.

The local self-government department issued an order in this regard on January 16.

A concession agreement is entered into by a government body and an agency allowing the latter to operate a business subject to certain terms. A lease agreement between lessor and lessee allows for use of an asset or land. This enables the lessee to raise funds by mortgaging the properties with banks.

Kochi corporation and GJ Eco Power Pvt Ltd had signed a concession agreement to set up the plant in February 2016. Later, the agency approached the local body to convert it into a lease agreement, which the corporation rejected outright. This forced the agency to approach the government and the state-level advisory committee (SLAC), which met in December 2018, asked the civic body to accede to the agency’s demand. But the health standing committee decided not to consider the proposal of the agency and the corporation council, convened in April 2019, ratified it.

The corporation secretary relayed the decision of the council to the government. But the department revoked the decision and asked the corporation to implement the direction of the SLAC under section 58 of the Kerala Municipality Act 1994.

The corporation reached an agreement with the agency in February 2016.

“The contract says nothing about a lease agreement and that’s why the corporation rejected the agency’s proposal. If the current concession agreement is converted into lease agreement the agency can raise funds for setting up the plant. The government has asked us to take a decision in this regard at the council meeting. The mayor is on an official trip to Dubai and is expected to return by February 15. The council will discuss the matter after that,” said deputy mayor K R Premkumar.

With the local body reaching lease agreement with GJ Eco Power Pvt Ltd, the 20-acre property in Brahmapuram will have to be leased out for 20 years.

“The ownership right on the land will remain vested with the lessor. The concession agreement signed in 2016 is a licence to use land. It has no mention of leasing out land. Only a portion of the agreement regarding land use needs to be changed. When the concession agreement was signed officials were ignorant about the lease. Now the government is coming up with six more similar plants. Under the lease agreement, only the equipment set up on the land can be mortgaged. Since we received all the required permits, the agency had started groundwork at the site. The lease agreement is only for raising funds for setting up the plant. Pilling work will start after February 18 soon after KSEB removes a tower in the area,” said a GJ official.

The government had conducted a couple of meetings to discuss the same but no decision has been taken.“We have recommended a 10% to 20% increase in fines (compared to existing fines as per old MV Act,1989) for many offences, including speeding, driving without helmets and driving uninsured vehicles,” said a transport department official.The new Act proposed a fine of Rs 5,000 to Rs25,000, or three years imprisonment for some of the offences.Some of the very few changes introduced by TN include removing minimum age required for commercial driving licences, mandatory driving tests while renewing expired driving licences and few online vehicle registration procedures.Transportation activist K Kathirmathiyon said the government delayed implementation of fines keeping local body polls in mind. “But what is stopping them now? Further delay will defeat the entire purpose of the Act. Hefty fines alone will deter motorists from violating traffic laws,” he said.Other experts said the state was gearing up for elections in about a year’s time and this could be one of the reasons why the government has put the new rules in the cold storage.Road safety researcher M Radhakrishnan said before introducing any new law, the state has the responsibility of holding public hearings and spreading awareness among people. The failure to do so was the main reason to hold back the new Act. “The police came out with announcements on new fine structure even before ensuring that they have necessary equipment to collect penalty from violators,” he said.As per the new Act, driving licence and vehicle details of repeat offenders, booked for major offences identified by the Supreme Court committee on road safety, would be uploaded on Centre’s VAHAN portal. This requires handheld devices but all enforcement authorities are not equipped with them.“Forget about educating people on hiked penalty, even the basic requirements for imparting driving lessons to people are not fulfilled by driving schools. The Motor Vehicle Rules in the Act says a 5,000sqft area is needed for conducting driving classes for people. None of the driving schools has this,” said V S Suresh, a Madras high court advocate.The public has other reasons to worry about besides hefty fines. S Dinesh, a resident of Taramani, said, “Even when the fine amount is Rs 100 to Rs 500, traffic police demand bribes. Can’t imagine how they will start chasing down us when penalties become Rs 10,000 or more.”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74060133,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31900,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/highest-number-of-road-accident-deaths-but-tn-reluctant-to-slap-high-fines/articleshow/74051693.cms
311,['10/02/2020'],Chennai Metro News: Chennai Metro rail has no rule to penalise men boarding ladies coach,"This story is from February 10, 2020

CHENNAI: It has been nearly five years since the first metro line opened in the city but Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) is yet to have a penalty policy in place to curb men travelling in a ladies coach. While a metros in Delhi and Bengaluru have implemented strict rules and slapped fines on violators, male commuters travelling in ladies coaches in the city’s metro trains continue to go unchecked.

Frequent announcements are made at all stations warning men not to occupy the ladies coach but there are no squads or police personnel to check these compartments periodically. “We do not have rules to make men travelling in ladies coach an offence. So we cannot penalise them,” an official said. “In other metros like Delhi, it is based on instructions given by the metro rail organisation,” the official added.

One of the reasons for not penalising commuters, according to sources, is poor patronage. Metro trains here have an average daily patronage of 1.16 lakh while the estimated patronage is nearly 7.76 lakh.

CMRL operates a four-car train and has one coach with a capacity of nearly 312, exclusively for women. The four cars are linked without any partition unlike suburban trains which have either separate compartment or are partitioned with an iron sheet.

Male commuters would restrict themselves to the two common coaches earlier when the patronage was low, as they had ample space to sit even during rush hour.

But now, after the patronage has reached a daily average of 1.16lakh, women commuters have started complaining that male commuters walk into their coach both during rush hour as well as in non-peak hours when other coaches are not crowded. “Women in Delhi are aggressive. They chase away men walking into the ladies coach. Here women barely show the courage to talk because others won’t back them up when they ask men to leave the coach. At times, elderly men occupy our coach and that makes it even more difficult for us to ask them to leave,” said Uma Chandran, a regular commuter from Shenoy Nagar to Ekkattuthangal.

In suburban trains, operated by Southern Railways, special squads conduct surprise checks and slap a fine of Rs 500 on those violating the rules.

CMRL officials said all metro follow Metro Railways Operations and Maintenance Act that details offence and punishment, which does not specifically mention about men travelling in ladies coach. “But that will change soon. Amendments are being made to the Act and all metros were asked for suggestions. One of the suggestions made was to make men travelling in ladies coach as a punishable offence. The amended Act is yet to be tabled in the Parliament,” a CMRL official said.

Jaisalmer: BJP state president Satish Poonia on Saturday said that there are many issues that need discussion in the assembly. He was speaking here to the media during his one-day trip. He also alleged that chief minister Ashok Gehlot goes back on his promises.

Poonia added that in the Congress manifesto it was stated that power tariff will not be increased for five years, but it was not to be so. “The chief minister had promised to give unemployment allowance but only 1.5 lakh people got it while 27 lakh are still waiting,” he added.

The BJP leader also alleged that the law and order situation is deteriorating. “Rajasthan did not have a full-time home minister and the CM who has this portfolio did not have time to take care of the situation,” he added.

Regarding the Congress’s decision to not implement CAA, he said that this is a law and it cannot be stopped from being implemented.

He said that assembly speaker CP Joshi has also said that Rajasthan will have to implement this law.

Representative image

PANAJI: A 29-year-old Nigerian national caught with narcotics on October 26, 2019, has been released on conditional bail after the additional sessions court found that the police did not file a chargesheet within the time limit of 60 days.

Kingsley Echezone Igweze staying in Siolim filed an application for default bail stating that no chargesheet was filed by Goa police’s anti-narcotics cell within 60 days and that the quantity of narcotics recovered from him was a variable one.

The court of additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi found that the chargesheet was filed on January 24, the day after Igweze filed his application for default bail.

The court order came two days after chief minister Pramod Sawant said that he had instructed the police department to take strict action against the drug peddlers operating in the state.

T George, counsel representing Igweze, relied on the recent order of the high court of Bombay at Goa passed on January 23 where the high court found that another Nigerian national Felix Odede was “entitled to bail by default” as the chargesheet in his case was filed beyond the 60-day period.

In its decision the high court held that the chargesheet has to be filed within a period of 60 days where the offence is punishable with up to ten years of imprisonment.

“In the present case, the applicant is alleged to have committed offence punishable under Section 21 (b) of NDPS Act wherein the punishment is with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and with fine which may extend to Rs. 1 lakh,” the court stated.

In Odede’s case too the chargesheet was filed on January 22, only after he moved the high court. The quantity of narcotics in his case was also of a variable quantity (6.635 grams of cocaine and 8.542 grams of MDMA) which entails punishment only up to ten years.

As per the decision cited the time limit for filing the chargesheet is 60 days and therefore, the applicant is entitled to be released on default bail on stringent conditions as laid down in the decision as the applicant is a foreigner.

In both cases the Nigerians were granted conditional bail on furnishing bail bonds of Rs 1 lakh and directed to deposit their original passport and visa with the investigating officer and not leave the state without prior written permission of the court.

Chintadripet fish market

CHENNAI: Chennai’s iconic 203-year-old Chintadripet fish market is functioning from an unauthorised complex and has no trade licence, Greater Chennai Corporation told the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Southern Zone.

“If it is not legally permissible then what is the action taken to remove such illegal activity,” NGT questioned the corporation and Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) while giving them a month to submit a report on possible pollution at the site.

The petitioner S Ranjith Fernando said the fish market, run by a political leader, with 19 shops and spread over 9,600sqft was not maintained properly with no mechanism to dispose and treat water and fish waste. Odour from the market affected the surrounding air quality, he said.

The petitioner said vendors use nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that will have an adverse impact on the quality of water and soil if discharged untreated.

Last December, TNPCB inspections revealed that waste generated while cleaning fish and prawn were manually collected and stored in plastic bins which were later collected by the corporation.

Water was let into sewer lines and bleaching powder was used to disinfect the area, TNPCB said.

The corporation said the market building had no approved plan and owners/occupants did not submit copy of the plan as directed by courts in the past.

“So it is to be treated as unauthorized construction. It is revealed that shop owners do not have licences... There was no maintenance of the building and it is not in good shape and condition despite warnings from sanitary inspectors to maintain hygiene,” the corporation added.

The fish market association represented by its head D Y Mohammed Saliha requested an alternate place to run the market.

The case will again be heard by NGT on March 18.

Vasco: Members of the Chicalim gram sabha , at Sunday’s extra-ordinary meeting, unanimously resolved to oppose the urbanisation of Chicalim village .

Claiming an ‘ulterior motive’, the villagers alleged that the local government has joined hands with the real estate lobby for their own gains, causing them to go against public interest.

They also demanded that local MLA and panchayats minister Mauvin Godhino addresses them and clears his stand on the notification of the government.

“Undeterred urbanisation with increased real estate development, will greatly harm Chicalim’s sensitive ecology, biodiversity and heritage,” activist and villagers Cyril Fernandes said.

In Sao Jose de Areal, too, the gram sabha rejected the state’s notification of the village as an urban area and unanimously resolved to remain a ‘rural area’.

The members further resolved that the village panchayat shall forward the resolution to the government, asking it to immediately drop the subject notification and retain all villages in the list as ‘rural areas’.

317,['10/02/2020'],Biometric-based boarding within 2 years at Cochin airport,"This story is from February 10, 2020

A view of Cochin International Airport

KOCHI: In line with the Union government’s Digi Yatra progamme that envisages the digital processing of passengers at airports, the Cochin International Airport Ltd ( Cial ) plans to implement biometric-based e-boarding system within two years to offer its passengers a seamless, paperless and hassle-free transit through all major check points — terminal entry, security check, boarding gate, and aircraft boarding.

Cial authorities said that the system is aimed at improving passenger experience by reducing waiting time in queues as they can walk through e-gates swiftly. Also, it will augment access control of airport authorities as ticket counterfeiting could be checked completely through e-tickets with unique barcodes thereby preventing illegal entry into the terminal. Cial has invited tenders from qualified companies in this regard.

Under the system, the passengers will have to go through a one-time registration at the airport where they will be giving out their personal details, any one of the government IDs (Aadhaar, voter’s ID card, driving licence, passport etc.) along with their facial biometrics to the airport operators. The passenger will thus get a unique Digi Yatra ID which will be used at the time of booking. The data will be stored in the airport’s database under each Digi Yatra ID and will be processed to identify the passenger later whenever he uses the airport to fly to other places. This will make the passengers’ entry at all the checkpoints seamless and fast.

“E-boarding intends to strengthen access control, paperless boarding and reducing human intervention in identity check, is expected to be completed in one and half years. Physical examination of boarding pass and identity cards at multiple checkpoints is the most time consuming process at airports. As Cial’s passenger traffic is increasing, the rush at counters will be high and the system will be a solution to make the process fast,” said a Cial official.

All the e-tickets provided by airlines or ticket facilitator applications have a 2D/QR Barcode following the concept ‘One person, One Ticket & One Code’. So that each passenger, even in a group booking, will be issued with individual ticket having unique code, which is linked to the servers of airlines, security agencies, customs and airport authorities. Within seconds, the system can compare the details in ticket and ID and give clearance.

“The passenger only has to scan his boarding pass in mobile phone at a scanner placed at the security area for frisking. Once the machine approves the ticket and his identity through facial scan, CISF personnel will let him pass through a terminal placed at his end before frisking the passenger. In this method, those using fake tickets could be caught easily. At present, anybody can create a paper ticket and use an ID to enter the terminal. Once e-boarding is implemented only bonafide passengers will be allowed entry,” an official said.

Gajendra Singh Shekhawat

JAISALMER: Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said Saraswati river is flowing under this part of the land and its existence has been proven.

“Scientifically it has been confirmed that Saraswati river is flowing beneath the ground. In addition, there are many streams that flow under the ground which directly connect the Himalaya glacier to the sea,” Shekhawat said.

Speaking about PM Narendra Modi’s dream project Namami Gange, he said work was going on mission mode. He said people during the last Kumbh Mela had felt it that Gangotri water in Haridwar could be used for consumption.

Discussing about stopping water to Pakistan, he said India and Pakistan had signed the Indus water treaty. PM had already announced that now it was not possible that terrorism and water could flow together. “All preparations have been done to stop the flow of water to Pakistan,” he said.

The Union minister said many technical studies were done in which the existence of Saraswati river flowing underground had been proved.

The minister said the Congress government in Rajasthan had cheated the farmers and did not waive off their loans.

“The youth are also feeling cheated as the promise of unemployment allowance has not been fulfilled. The state has also hiked power tariff. People have lost faith in this government,” he added.

He said the Congress had become irrelevant in the country.

319,['10/02/2020'],"Goa: Abandoned, cured patients find unwilling home at asylum","This story is from February 10, 2020

Officials say it’s almost impossible to trace residences of some patients

PANAJI: A peculiar problem at the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour (IPHB), Bambolim, has left the authorities scratching their heads — many patients do not go home even after they’re cured, and stay at IPHB till their death.

Many of them either have no family, or are abandoned by their kith and kin.

Information obtained under the Right to Information (RTI) Act reveals that as of December 2019, 76 patients have been residing in IPHB for over five years, and since 2013, 29 patients have died while at the institute. It is, however, unclear if they had been declared mentally fit, as the IPHB didn’t have the relevant records.

“It is not possible to trace patients as some of them are from outside the state and are unable to recall their home address after recovery,” an IPHB official said. The problem is more acute in the case of women patients, authorities say, as it’s practically impossible to trace their residences. Some of them — either abandoned or lost — don’t even remember their home state.

“Many of these patients had never before moved out of their house, let alone travelled,” said an IPHB official.

“Male patients fare better, and are at least able to recall some details like the name of their village or directions to their residence.”

The institute, which admits on average three patients a day, has 190 beds. In 2019 alone, it saw 1,104 admissions. Many of the institute’s patients with behavioural problems are picked up by police personnel and taken to IPHB for treatment. Some of these are brought in straight from Goa’s railway stations. “In these cases, the person is made to board a train and naturally, they disembark at the last station (Margao).”

In recent years, the internet has come to the aid of the authorities, who often use the resource to track the families of patients on the basis of sketchy details they provide. “However, our efforts don’t always bear fruit,” an official said. And when there’s no immediate family, “they continue to remain at the hospital”.

Meanwhile, the Goa government has proposed a “half-way home” to accommodate IPHB patients who have recuperated, or require more time to recover but are unable to go home for lack of family support or absence of family.

GMC dean S M Bandekar said that he is aware of the problem. “The chief secretary has approved the proposal for the half-way home,” he said. “Patients with no families, after their initial treatment, will be placed in the half-way home and looked after.”

In the past, 38 IPHB long-stay patients were discharged and housed at Provedoria, the government’s institute of public assistance.

Vijayawada: The minister for panchayat raj and rural development (PR&RD) Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy directed officials of the department to establish a Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) in coordination with the energy department and Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) to ensure all the LED street lights in the state are at 100% capacity all the time.

At a review meeting with the officials and all stake-holding departments on Sunday, Reddy said that the state government had transformed the governance in rural areas with the establishment of village secretariats. As all the services and grievances are being addressed in 72 hours through village secretariats, issues with LED light illumination should also be addressed within 72 hours.

To achieve this, Reddy suggested the EESL, a public sector undertaking of the union ministry of power to strengthen field level network for quick response to the complaints. “Even as EESL is making some fruitful efforts, it has to be improved further to reduce delays for which coordination with stake holding departments is required,” he said.

The officials of the energy department told the minister that measures have been taken to put in place a web portal to redress the complaints of street lights not working. Village volunteers will identify the issues at field level and report to village secretariat, where a ticket will be raised for deployment of quick response teams.

EESL officials told the minister that the LED street lighting programme taken up in Andhra Pradesh is presently the world’s largest programme. The EESL has made an upfront investment of Rs 800 crore to install 23.54 lakh LED lights across the state. The officials further said that they are planning to install another three to five lakh LED lights in the uncovered areas and extended colonies.

Installation of LED street lights is estimated to have saved 260 million units of energy per year that would translate into Rs 156 crore in monetary terms, according to the officials.

Ten Innova Crysta cars are parked at Kumarakrupa guest house for the newly-inducted ministers

BENGALURU: Officials of the department of personnel and administrative services (DPAR) were surprised when a huge majority of the ministers inducted into chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s council of ministers last week demanded official vehicles bearing registration numbers either ending in nine or adding to nine.

""We’ve had ministers either asking for a specific number or not caring about it at all, but this is the first time a majority of new ministers were after one number - nine,"" a senior DPAR official said.

The ministers, however, said it had nothing to do with numerology or astrology. KR Pete MLA KC Narayanagowda’s vehicle bears registration number 2727. Sources say Narayanagowda had written to the department demanding a vehicle whose registration number adds to nine.

Hirekerur MLA BC Patil, who took oath along with Narayanagowda, has got a car with the registration number 0009. Patil insisted it wasn’t a collective decision by the defectors-turned-ministers nor was it designed.

""I chose the number thinking it is a lucky number. I did not contact any astrologer,"" he said, adding: ""When I won the 2018 assembly polls with 555 votes, I bought a vehicle with the same number assuming it to be lucky. Now, I chose number nine, but it is not that I planned always to have it.""

ST Somashekar’s Innova Crysta bears the registration 0045. ""I never believed in numerology,"" the Yeshwantpur MLA and minister said. ""How can nine be a lucky number for me? I have already suffered for six months. I certainly did not ask for any specific number.""

But sources say the new ministers chose the number as they think their decision to shift parties in 2019 gave their political careers a major boost. Also, they were influenced by the fact that Yediyurappa proved his majority in the assembly on July 29, 2019.

Vijayanagar MLA Anand Singh has also got an Innova Crysta bearing the number 4999. ""I feel 9 is now my lucky number. I have not contacted any numerolgist,"" Singh said.

Shivaram Hebbar of Yellapur constituency bucked the trend. He opted for 6000. Hebbar said he chose the vehicle because it was in good condition and not for the number.

Astrologer S Krishna Kumar, who is also director of the astrology course at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, said vehicle owners prefer registration numbers ending or adding up to 9 or 5. “In numerology, these two numbers are auspicious. Vehicles with these registration numbers are expected to bring good things to owners and also ward off bad things,” he said.

But sources say the new ministers chose the number as they think their decision to shift parties in 2019 gave their political careers a major boost. Also, they were influenced by the fact that Yediyurappa proved his majority in the assembly on July 29, 2019.

Vijayanagar MLA Anand Singh has also got an Innova Crysta bearing the number 4999. ""I feel 9 is now my lucky number. I have not contacted any numerolgist,"" Singh said.

Shivaram Hebbar of Yellapur constituency bucked the trend. He opted for 6000. Hebbar said he chose the vehicle because it was in good condition and not for the number.

Astrologer S Krishna Kumar, who is also director of the astrology course at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, said vehicle owners prefer registration numbers ending or adding up to 9 or 5. “In numerology, these two numbers are auspicious. Vehicles with these registration numbers are expected to bring good things to owners and also ward off bad things,” he said.

BENGALURU: Officials of the department of personnel and administrative services (DPAR) were surprised when a huge majority of the ministers inducted into chief minister BS Yediyurappa’s council of ministers last week demanded official vehicles bearing registration numbers either ending in nine or adding to nine.

""We’ve had ministers either asking for a specific number or not caring about it at all, but this is the first time a majority of new ministers were after one number - nine,"" a senior DPAR official said.

328,['10/02/2020'],Mind over matter: Soaring through skies to keep India safe,"This story is from February 10, 2020

HYDERABAD: The Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was deployed in Sri Lanka and a transport aircraft was on a mission to take supplies from India to the country that was going through an internal strike. The aircraft was to return to India but it was noticed that a propeller had caught fire. Ravirala Jayasimha of the Indian Air Force (IAF) who was part of the crew reacted instantaneously. He jumped out of the cockpit and put out the fire. The propeller had suffered damage but the challenge was to fly it back to India.

“I made all mandatory checks and told pilots that we should be able to fly out. The plane could fly but there probably would be an issue if we faced turbulence. Since we could also depend on the second engine, I suggested that we fly and the pilot trusted me enough,” Jayasimha recalled.

But in the process of putting out the fire, Jayasimha suffered burn injuries on his hand. The scars have remained but he prefers to view them as proof of the courage he displayed.

Even as a child, Jayasimha was not used to giving up. Hailing from Nalgonda in Telangana , he joined school at the age of 12 in class 7 and soon topped his class. It was his headmaster who changed the way Jayasimha thought about life. The teacher gave him Rs 40 as a gift. “Does one get rewarded like this?” he asked the teacher innocently. “Achieve greater things and the rewards will come by themselves,” the teacher answered. In class 10, he topped the school. In Intermediate, he stood third in Andhra Pradesh .

Jayasimha’s journey with the Indian Air Force began as an Airman. But the journey wasn’t without challenges. They initially did not select him because of medical reasons. The malnutrition was evident. When he went for recruitment into the IAF, they told him that he would die on the running track itself as he was too weak to even run.“If I have to die, I might as well die doing that,” he told them. “You should have eggs and milk and come back for the test after three months,” they told him.

Jayasimha’s family was not economically sound and he could not afford that diet. He came back only to fail the test again. A conditional offer was made as he was sent for training to Chennai. Three months later, he passed the medical test. He excelled in the course and was assigned to the post of lead aircraft maintenance technician.

When Jayasimha was posted in Amritsar, a Cheetah Chetak helicopter developed problems. Just when the others had given up, Jayasimha took charge and carried out repairs to make it fit to fly. He went on to take the SSB exam that would put him in the officer rank. He not only made it to the Air Force Academy in Dundigal but also passed out as ground duty officer. Jayasimha rose in ranks to become a squadron leader in the IAF.

He went on to join the Defence Services Staff College at Wellington and acquired more degrees, including two MSC degrees and an MBA. He also has 14 Guinness world records to his credit in memory and mind education.

After quitting the IAF, Jayasimha started giving inspirational lectures and teaching mind management techniques to improve memory for students.

“An eagle can soar in the sky but it is not enough if it knows that it has wings. It has to take off,” he tells students as he talks to them about tapping into their true potential.

Kerala is conducting bird-based surveys to document the scientific distribution of birds in the state. Following the same technique adopted by Kerala, bird enthusiasts have decided to prepare the atlas for the district.

“The enthusiasts had already divided the district into cells and sub cells. Every 3.3 square kilometer is considered as a cell and each cell has nine sub cells. The district has as many as 37 cells and 111 sub cells,” said a bird enthusiast who is involved in the study.

Explaining that they have been planning to carry out the survey on random basis, he said they have been planning to record the activities of bird at a cell for once in 15 minutes for four times from 6am to 11am on daily basis. tnn

Workers collect palm leaf waste from Ernakulathappan Ground

Kochi: Every year during the annual temple festival, the Ernakulam Siva Temple, like all places of worship, generates several tonnes of waste. Disposing them of is a problem for which they have to take the help of Kochi corporation.

But, this year, the problem transformed into solution as Pelican Biotech, which is in need of biodegradable waste for creation of soilless planting medium used to convert medians under the Kochi Metro rail into gardens, were in need of organic material to be used in four medians near Jos Junction. “On Wednesday, we collected around three tonnes of waste from the temple which would be used at medians near Jos Junction. Work on the decorative garden is being carried out with CSR funding from Cochin Shipyard,” said Pelican Biotech CEO C N Manoj. The waste comprised of elephant dung and remains of palm leaf fed to elephants brought to the festival.

Pelican Biotech is using biodegradable waste collected from various sources to transform 16 medians of Kochi Metro into decorative gardens. “The total length of medians would come to 160m and we would need 160 tonnes of waste,” said Manoj. Fifty percentage of the waste, which gets transformed into soil transplanting medium, has to be replaced every six months.

Ernakulathappan Kshetra Kshema Samiti president R Rajendraprasad said while waste generation on ordinary days mostly consists of garlands used on deities and tender coconut shells after abhishekam, more amount of waste is generated during festival. “Normally, we depend on the Kochi corporation but this year we decided to provide the waste to Pelican Biotech after they approached us,” he said.

According to Rajendraprasad, the temple administration has successfully introduced a ban on plastic inside the temple premises. “We can say that it is now 99% plastic free. We also had done a campaign to make Sabarimala pilgrimage green,” he said.

331,['10/02/2020'],CMC Colony housing unit residents’ woes worsen,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Coimbatore: Residents of CMC Colony housing unit are in a spot.

On one side, the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) is planning to demolish the dilapidated housing unit and start reconstruction work by March. On the other side, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) has disconnected the power connection, which the residents had drawn illegally for the construction of temporary shelters that are being set up adjacent to the housing unit.

The move has hit the work of makeshift shelters, on which they have already invested Rs 50,000 each, and they won’t be able to vacate the housing unit without an alternate accommodation facility.

Ramesh, a 51-year-old sanitary worker, said, “The power connection was disconnected a week ago. But we can’t afford to delay the construction of temporary shelters. First of all, the housing unit could collapse anytime. Secondly, I have already borrowed Rs 50,000 by pledging bank passbooks and am not in a position to spend more.” His monthly salary is just Rs 9,500.

Now that the power supply is disconnected, the residents are forced to carry water in drums from public toilets for the construction work. The welding work has also been hit and they are now forced to use nuts and bolts to connect the pole joints. “We don’t know how strong the shelter would be. But we don’t have any other option,” Ramesh said. He, along with his family members, has been constructing the shelter on their own.

A total of 200 families are affected by the TNEB’s move. While a majority of them have stopped the construction of makeshift shelters mid-way, others are in a hurry to complete them.

Another resident, Ganeshan, said they were forced to stop the construction work as they could not drill poles and metal sheets to make holes in the absence of power supply. “There is also pressure on us to vacate the housing unit at the earliest. We don’t know what to do.”

The housing unit is almost 30 years old. TNSCB had intimated the residents its decision to reconstruct the housing unit a few months ago and asked them to vacate the place at the earliest. Subsequently, some of them had either moved to their relatives’ places or rented out a house. More than 200 families were, however, left with no other option but to construct temporary shelters nearby.

A resident, who has completed the work on the shelter, said that was not livable. “The heat is unbearable inside the shelter. The situation is difficult for everyone, especially children, who are not used to sleep without fans. We don’t know how long we have to bear this.”

When contacted, a TNSCB official said the TNEB had disconnected the power supply as that was drawn illegally. “The city corporation has now submitted an application seeking power supply for the residents and it is likely to be provided to them in a week. If the occupants vacate the housing unit this month, the reconstruction work would commence soon,” the official said.

Pimpri Chinchwad: The race has heated up in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) for the president’s post of Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority (PCNTDA). The MVA government replaced the BJP-appointed Sadashiv Khade with the Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar.

The PCNTDA was set up in 1972 with a vision.

It is an autonomous institution meant to look into building of housing colonies for people and infrastructural projects that would be needed in the limits of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporations areas. Nigdi Pradhikaran, Wakad, Thergaon, Bijlinagar, Moshi and Kalewadi were some areas of its jurisdiction.

The Fadnavis-led BJP government too did not appoint any politician to this post for over three years.

Later it nominated Khade on September 6, 2017 who continued in office even after the Maha Vikas Aghadi government came to power. The state government issued a government resolution on February 3 replacing him with Mhaisekar.

Now, there are strong aspirants for the post among all the three parties.

Not a single Congress candidate won the 2017 municipal elections so there is no Congress corporator among the 128 elected members of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). If the Congress gets allotted the post of PCNTDA president, it will help the party get at least one big government post in the city.

Former MLA Vilas Lande, former mayors Yogesh Behl and Mangala Kadam, former opposition leaders Bhausaheb Bhoir and Datta Sane are among the main contenders from NCP for this post.

In the Congress some top contenders are Pimpri Chinchwad city unit president Sachin Sathe, former mayor Kavichand Bhat and Shyamala Sonavane.

District unit president Gajanan Chinchwade, city unit president Yogesh Babar, former group leader of corporators Sulabha Ubale are the main contenders for this post in Shiv Sena.

Sathe and Sanjog Waghire, president of Pimpri Chinchwad unit of NCP said, “The allotment of the state-run corporations and authorities(pradhikaran) among the alliance partners is yet to be decided. We would like it if the state unit of our party tries to get this post allotted to us.”

333,['10/02/2020'],Online database helps identify 1.31L fake ration cards,"This story is from February 10, 2020

caption

Bhopal: Almost a month after the launch on ‘One nation, one ration card’ scheme, which includes MP, around 1.31 lakh people have been found to be registered at more than one location. As many as 50,000 people under below poverty line (BPL) have been deleted from the list and more are likely to follow, according to officials.

The new scheme is aimed at providing portability of Public Distribution System (PDS) entitlements. The mechanism aims to ensure that no person under BPL or person entitled to PDS is deprived when he or she moves from one place to another. Currently, the scheme is being implemented in 11states, including Madhya Pradesh.

The PDS software system was integrated between the 11 states. Data sharing revealed fake ration card holders to the tune of 1.31 lakh, according to district food controller Jyoti Shah Narvariya.

The Union government has given a one-year deadline till June 30, 2020, to states and Union Territories for rolling out the ‘One nation, one ration card’ system, under which beneficiaries can buy subsidised foodgrains from ration shops in any part of the country.

Currently, the 11 states under the scheme are expected to easily implement the PDS portability within their state as Point of Sale (PoS) machines have been installed in all ration shops. There are about 439 PDS ration shops in Bhopal. An estimated one lakh people in the division are labourers from nearby states or districts.

This facility will be of great help to a family or a person shifting from one state to another. The idea behind this initiative is that no poor person or family should be deprived of ration, for want of a ration card of that particular state. Apart from this, the new initiative will also help in weeding out fake BPL card holders. The new initiative is being implemented through IMPDS (Integrated Management of Public Distribution System), an online database.

Nashik: Over 1000 participants took part in the second edition of this year’s ‘ Happy Streets ’ organised by the Times group at Dindori Road on Sunday.

Deputy commissioner of police, Amol Tambe, was encouraged by the participation of people and called the event as a ‘ piece of Pune ’. “In the past 20 years, the city has advanced multifaced, which was to be seen at the streets today. There are many ideological exchanges taking place. The hope for innovative ventures for artists is also growing through such platforms,” said Tambe.

The half-a-kilometer stretch between RTO Corner and Kishor Suryavanshi Road at the Dindori area on the outskirts of the city was thriving with life and energy with people from all quarters.

The two-hours event which kick-started at 7 am saw equal participation from the female counterparts. Deputy Municipal Commissioner Archana Tambe appreciated the women for coming out in numbers.

“The women are always busy with family responsibilities. The opportunity to relish music and art is less for them. The initiative of ‘Happy Streets’ gave them an opportunity to take time out for themselves and get stress free,” said Tambe.

Many new activities like a magic show, quilling, charcoal painting, live music, cycling, etc were seen on the streets. Many new stalls were also seen at the Sunday event.

The most popular item was Zumba that kept the crowd swirling over Bollywood songs for two hours continuously. The dance-lovers had filled half of the area to dance on the roads.

People brought their bicycles, yoga mats, calligraphy stationery, rangoli colours, etc to embrace the congestion of free roads.

A 73-year-old Subhash Bhavsar showed stunts while riding his bicycle without holding hands. All the onlookers could not stop themselves from appreciating his balance. “There are two more Sundays left for this year’s Happy Streets. We will make sure that the citizens enjoy the most and begin the year with a lot of vigour and delight,” the organizers said.

The event will take place at Govind Nagar on February 16 and at Nashik Road on February 23.

Stress is common these days for the students as well as for the parents. “Not only students but parents also place a call to guide their children. Since there is less time left for the papers to begin, I advise them to revise only what they have studied to date so that they do not forget their answers,” said the counsellor.

Jaipur: A jawan from Rajasthan was killed in cross-border firing in J&K’s Poonch district on Saturday.

Naik Rajeev Singh Shekhawat from Luhakana village in Virat Nagar tehsil of Jaipur district was killed during shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) in Degwar sector. He was posted with Rashtriya Rifles.

His mortal remains are expected to reach his village on Sunday night. He will be cremated with full military honours on Monday.

Shekhawat, 36, is survived by wife, son and parents.

Luhakana former sarpanch Bhawani Singh said, “Shekhawat was my junior in school and always wanted to join the army. His father is also an ex-serviceman. The family has lost their only son and the sole bread winner. He had come to the village last month. The family is inconsolable and it is an extremely difficult time for them. His son does not even understand what has happened.”

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot condoled the death of Shekhawat.

“I salute braveheart Naik Rajeev Singh Shekhawat of Luhakana Khurd, Rajasthan, who made the supreme sacrifice on the Line of Control in Poonch. My deepest condolences to the bereaved family,” Gehlot said on his Twitter handle.

337,['10/02/2020'],On launch mode: Technopark firm develops blockchain sat,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Though blockchain technology , with its decentralized approach, offers a solution to security issues , a lot of firms have concerns in using the technology due to restrictions in storing information in systems that are connected to the internet. To bring a solution to such users, a Technopark firm is set to enter a new territory — the space.

Technopark firm Accubits Technologies is gearing up to launch ‘ChainSat’, the world’s first enterprise blockchain satellite. ChainSat is a low earth-orbit satellite, weighing 12kg, and it can establish an enterprise blockchain ledger that can enable a secure transactional network for financial and government firms, which have privacy as a key concern.

Four-year-old Accubits Technologies has planned the ChainSat as a network of eight satellites. In the first phase, the team is planning to launch its first satellite by January 2021. “During the first phase, we expect a communication delay of 16-19 minutes. With the commissioning of the second phase consisting of the remaining satellites, we will get real-time data. The second phase is expected to be ready by the end of 2022,” said Jithin V G, co-founder and CEO of Accubits. With the support of Space Park, a state government initiative, the firm is in touch with various space agencies such as SpaceX, Antrix and French space agency CNES for the launch.

Explaining on the need for a satellite, Jithin said that the existing communication channel —the internet— could not assure the security demands of various firms.

“After that initial blockchain boom from 2015-18, we saw that the wave was receding. Most of the financial institutions and government firms have certain compliance policies which restrict them from storing information on public-facing servers or systems that are connected to the internet. ChainSat aims to fix this problem by facilitating an off-grid network for blockchain transactions. With this, users in the enterprise blockchain network can access the decentralized ledger through direct satellite communication,” he said.

Accubits’s client list includes JPMorgan Chase, Vista Bank NASA, United States Geological Survey, United States Postal Services, among others. It has provided land registry on blockchain for Dubai land department.

Belagavi: In comments that raised eyebrows, Ramesh Jarkiholi, who quit the Congress and joined the BJP and who took oath as minister last week, said his brother Satish has a bright future. The two siblings have rarely seen eye-to-eye — at least in public — in recent times.

He also trained his gun on Congress leader DK Shivakumar, sarcastically thanking the Congress MLA for his meteoric rise. “Had Shivakumar not stood against me, I would not have emerged as a tall leader in the state. I must thank him,” Ramesh said.

The Gokak MLA said Satish of the Congress, the most politically-savvy of the five Jarkiholi siblings, would reach “the top” in his political career. However, he advised him “to inculcate patience and adopt strategies”. “He should make his moves at the right time as timing is very important in politics,” Ramesh said.

He also urged Satish to keep his supporters happy. “Many of his followers are disappointed with his leadership because he does not extend a helping hand to his own people. In the present political climate, people do not endorse a leader who only talks about Buddha and Basava,” Ramesh said.

Ramesh took a dig at Lakan, the youngest sibling, saying, “Lakan speaks ill about me most of the time. He does not understand much. But we brothers are one when it comes to family. We are united when it comes to family matters, but when it comes to politics, we are at loggerheads.”

339,['10/02/2020'],Matchmaking seminar for HIV+,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nashik: Nearly 250 HIV-positive people took part in a matchmaking seminar organised by city-based non-profits and the District AIDS Prevention and Control Unit (DAPCU) on Sunday.

NGO Yash, which was one of the lead organisers, has been conducting the event for the past 12 years. So far, it has been able to match 57 couples.

Sunday’s event saw participation from across the state and beyond. “I run my own matchmaking centre in Malegaon. I am looking for a bride who understands my condition. That is why I came here. I hope to find someone interesting today,” said Ramesh*.

Relatives too turned up to look for matches for their loved ones. “I am looking for a suitable bride for my younger brother,” said one participant’s sister. “He lives in Nagpur and he found out he had HIV last year. He is very young and handsome. We hope to find a girl who will understand my brother’s condition,” she said.

Registration started at 8am and the main programme began with a round of formal introductions. Then the participants sat in a circle to introduce themselves to each other. This round ended with a lunch, but personal meetings went on until 5 pm.

“It doesn’t end here,” said Ravindra Patil, secretary of the Yash Foundation. “The prospects will meet each other a couple of times. Once satisfied, they will inform us and we will arrange a medical counselling before their wedding. It is not easy to have such a condition and still hope to have a happily married life. The NGO's objective is to give them a platform,” he said.

The event also featured success stories by two couples who had met each other through Yash. Both couples today have children who have tested negative for HIV/AIDS.

“Our parents did not want us to get married as they were worried our children will have the same health issues. But we took that brave step and today, we have a beautiful daughter who has tested negative. Medical science has progressed,” said Rachna*, one of the participants who shared her success story with others at the event.

Pune: Buying puppies online from two unknown persons cost a 25-year-old man from Kivale Rs48,000 last month.

When Vishal Sambhaji Shinde did not get the puppies on the promised day, he started pursuing the fraudsters for his money. The suspects threatened him that one of their relatives was an officer with the state police and refused to return the amount. Shinde on Saturday lodged an FIR with the Dehu Road police against the duo. “I am a member of a WhatsApp group for dog breeders in the state. On January 18, I had posted about a requirement for a beagle puppy. A day later, a person called me and said he was willing to sell a pair of beagle puppies for Rs20,000. He even sent me the photographs of the puppies,” Shinde told TOI.

Shinde said the person told him to transfer the money online, following which he would deliver the puppies from a private bus in the evening. “Believing him, I transferred the money and told him that I would be waiting at the Pune end of the Pune-Mumbai expressway to collect the delivery,” he said.

Shinde said the suspect also gave him the contact details of his ‘relative’ who wanted to sell a puppy of Siberian Husky breed. “After talking to the ‘relative’, I transferred Rs28,000 more. He told me he would bring the Siberian Husky along with the beagles,” Shinde said.

When Shinde did not get the puppies by the evening, he contacted the person. “He said there was some problem with the bus and would be delayed. However, despite waiting for a long time, I did not get delivery and realised that I had been duped,” he said.

Shinde said that when he posted the incident on the Whatsapp group, six people, including a woman, got in touch. “They told me that the same person had duped them as well,” he added.

Coimbatore: The city corporation has replaced close to 45,000 sodium vapour street lamps with LED lamps in the last seven months and is expected to change the remaining lights within a month.

The corporation had decided to replace 58,878 sodium vapour lamps with LED lamps at the cost of Rs 81 crore. The replacement work commenced in July after checking the quality of the procured lights twice through third party, a corporation source said.

“We have almost completed the replacement work and it is only a few thousand is pending. It is expected to be completed within February. About 10,000 to 12,000 lamps would be kept in stock as buffer and would be used in case of emergency,” the source added.

Explaining that the installation of controllers is expected to be completed in another couple of months, the source said that once the installation work is completed, the issues like faulty bulb could be identified even before public raises a complaint about it.

The decision to change the bulbs in older corporation areas was taken after witnessing the positive result of installing LED lamps in 40 added areas of the corporation limit. The LED bulbs had helped the corporation to conserve power by 42%. At present, the corporation is paying more than Rs 20 crore per annum as electricity bill and over Rs 9 crore to maintain street lamps.

Pune: The wreath-laying ceremony and light and sound show at the Southern Command’s National War Memorial have created a buzz among the Puneites.

Over one lakh people from all walks of life, including school students, have visited the memorial in the last one year.

Army officials said the response to the wreath-laying ceremony and light and sound show is steadily increasing in the city. As per the army records, on average, 8,000 people visit the venue every month. The command had been organising the ceremony for the public for the last three years.

“Interaction between school students and soldiers is one of the crucial aspects of the event,” a senior army officer said.

Aakash Pandey, a software professional who had visited the memorial with his family recently, told TOI, “I had never attended a wreath-laying ceremony before. It is important that everyone visits the memorial to understand the finer nuances and the importance of this military function.”

Besides the ceremony, the memorial houses ammunition gallery, brief write-ups about the history of the Southern Command and its contributions in several wars and operations over the years. The Dakshin Maharashtra and Goa Sub Area (DMGSA), which is the local military authority, started conducting special light and sound show for the public a few months back.

“The light and sound show concept is new for people and, therefore, the event sees a large participation. On January 26, the crowd was such that several people had no place to even sit,” said another army officer, who is involved in the planning of the ceremony.

COIMBATORE: A 35-year-old daily wage labourer was arrested on Sunday for impregnating a 16-year-old higher secondary school girl in the city. The girl is a Class XI student of a government school.

According to a police officer, the issue came to light during a medical camp that was conducted at the girl’s school recently. “During the camp, she inquired about the menstrual cycle and told doctors that she was having menstrual problem. The minor girl was sent to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital , where doctors found that she was six months pregnant,” the officer said.

The girl’s parents lodged a complaint with the Perur all-woman police on Sunday.

346,['10/02/2020'],Pakistan presents 60 from India as kabaddi world cup team,"This story is from February 10, 2020

AMRITSAR: A group of about 60 circle kabaddi players, said to be mostly from Punjab, has created a controversy by participating in Pakistan’s first 'kabaddi world cup 2020', which is being played in circle format, without any official permission or clearance by the Union sports ministry.

India has denied sending any team to Pakistan and the Amateur Kabaddi Federation of India (AKFI), the apex body for the sport in the country, too washed its hands off the row by saying that it had not authorized any player to go to Pakistan.

This is the first time Pakistan is hosting the event. The poster of the tournament shows participation by 10 countries, including India, Australia , UK, Canada , Germany, Iran , Kenya, Sierra Leone and Azerbaijan. The eight-day tournament was inaugurated at Punjab Stadium, Lahore, on Sunday and matches will be played in Faisalabad on February 12 and 13 and in Gujrat, which is in the country’s Punjab province, on February 14. The final will be held on February 16 in Lahore and the prize money for the victorious team is 1 crore Pakistani rupees.

The circle format is popular mostly in Punjab. The national-style kabaddi is recognized by Indian Olympic Association and also by the Olympic Council of Asia and is used in the Asian Games . Tournaments like the Pro-Kabaddi League and 'Kabaddi World Cup' are played in the same format.

A circle kabaddi team has 10 players and four rolling substitutes are allowed during a match, so ideally a team would not comprise more than 14 players. The invitation to 60 Indian players has created a controversy in Pakistan too. Pakistan Amateur Circle Kabaddi Federation (PACKF) blamed the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) for ""importing 60 Indian players to adjust them in teams of other countries, who have not sent official teams.'

Sources told TOI on Sunday that as many as 58 Indian kabaddi players had crossed over to Pakistan from Attari international border in two batches on February 6 and 7 and were received by Pakistan Punjab’s minister of sports, Rai Taimoor Khan Bhatti.

All the Indian players purportedly had gone to Pakistan on their own but Pakistan, according to these sources, was projecting them as the ‘Indian team players.’ There are no details available about how these kabaddi players financed their trip when they did not get any permission from AKFI.

Punjab Kabaddi Association president Sikander Singh Maluka admitted he knew that some kabaddi players had gone to Pakistan to play in a tournament but denied they were part of any official team. He said Pakistan had invited many kabaddi players in Punjab and even asked him to attend the tournament ""being organised in the name of Guru Nanak Dev.""

However, There is no information available in Pakistan about the event being organized as part of celebration for Guru Nanak Dev’s 550th birth anniversary.

Reiterating his allegations about a ‘scam’ linked to the invitation to such a large group of kabaddi players from India, Muhammad Sarwar Bhatt, the PACKF secretary general, told TOI that he had filed a writ petition against PSB in the Lahore high court a few days ago.

“This is a big fraud being committed in the name of kabaddi,” claimed Bhat.

The Lahore high court had summoned the PSB director to furnish records and began an inquiry into the reason for inviting 60 Indian players for the tournament, Bhatt said, adding that “the PSB president has been directed to furnish records on March 12.”

AKFI administrator, retired Justice SP Garg told TOI that the body didn’t support the unauthorized Pakistan visit by the kabaddi players and said that “legal action may be taken against these players.”

In the beginning, the park used to witness good footfall, but people have turned their back to the site for the many years due to municipal corporation’s negligence.

Last week, Bhujbal had visited pending tourism projects like Boat Club, adventure sports complex near Gangapur dam. And on Sunday, he paid a sudden his visit to NMC’s Dadasaheb Phalke Memorial that was constructed in 2001.

Confirming the news, a senior NMC official said the civic administration has already extended the contract of the present contractor for maintaining cleanliness at the memorial park.

“We are also in the process to develop Phalke memorial on our own and necessary financial provision will be made in the civic budget for the financial year 2020-21,” he said.

The memorial park, situated around 13-km and spread over 29 acre, displays an eloquent version of Phalke’s works along with a beautiful garden in its courtyard.

The NMC intends to develop the entire complex in order to converting it into a tourism hub. The civic body wants to develop parks with recreational, leisure, entertainment, green zone, garden facilities and bird park for tourists at the site through a private agency on public-private-partnership (PPP) basis.

348,['10/02/2020'],IFS officer suspended on charges of ‘financial irregularity’,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Haridwar: The forest department has suspended Indian Forest Service ( IFS ) officer AK Gupta for his alleged involvement in illicit felling of pine and sal trees and illegal extraction of resin worth Rs 5.63 crore in Champawat during his stint as district’s divisional forest officer (DFO) between 2010 and 2016.

The suspension order, signed by principal secretary of Uttrakhand forest department Anand Bardhan, came out on Friday. The officer, the order said, has been attached to the headquarters of forest department under the head of forest force now, and would be given 50% of his salary as per the IFS service rules for next 90 days. The order, a copy of which is with TOI, reads, “Charges of financial and administrative irregularity against AK Gupta as DFO of Champawat has turned to becorrect as found out in the investigation conducted by Sanjiv Chaturvedi.”

Earlier in September 2017, an audio clip of Gupta had gone viral suggesting his involvement in the case. Thereafter, an investigation was launched and within two months, whistle-blower IFS officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi submitted his probe report which found Gupta guilty. Subsequently, a three-member committee was set up by the then head of forest force to ascertain charges against Gupta.

The committee also concluded that Gupta had allegedly sold trees worth lakhs in connivance with smugglers and villagers in his six-year tenure.

It was noted that a well-networked gang used to operate on the behest of a legitimate license provided by Gupta during his years of service in Champawat.

Notably, the Forest Management Plan of the state does not allow any permit for pine felling for market sale. However, Gupta allegedly issued ‘rampant permits’ in violation of the rules, the report says.

Incidentally, AK Gupta had even approached the high court and had requested the HC to stay on in Champawat. Interestingly, he had won the case.

When asked about the delay in ascertaining charges against Gupta, principal secretary of forest department Anand Bardhan told TOI, “Departmental processes take time. The suspension order comes after several clearances.”

TOI tried to contact AK Gupta but he was unavailable for comment.

Bhopal: By showing living people as dead on documents, a sarpanch and his accomplices of Kadhaiya Chhawar village embezzled Rs 49.85 lakh of funds under a government scheme.

On Saturday, Berasia police registered a case of forgery against eight people, including the village sarpanch, panchayat secretary, panchayat coordinating officer, nodal officer and four office-bearers of the panchayat.

The accused made fake documents for death, disability and of mass marriage ceremonies. The officials, who were part of the nexus, made the fake documents, verified them and then embezzled the government funds under the Karmkar scheme. When the accused realized that their fraud has come to light and they would be booked, they fled before the police could reach them. After the death of a labourer registered under the Karmkar scheme, the state government provides compensation of Rs 1 lakh to his family, said Berasia SHO Ajay Mishra. The scheme also offers Rs 1 lakh for disability while it provides Rs 50,000 for marriage in the family, the SHO added.

The village sarpanch and his secretary made fake death documents of 21 labourers, marriage documents of 10 labourers and fake document of one person under the differently abled in the scheme.

During investigation, all the labourers were found to be alive and no marriage ceremony had place taken at their home in the scheme, said the SHO. He added that the role of 32 others labourers is also under scanner in the fraud.

SHO Mishra said the fraud was started in 2018. Later, a verification officer was also included in the crime. The accused attached their different bank accounts to get compensation and transferred money after carrying out the formalities.

For the past few months, the authorities were getting information about labour fraud and a case was registered after corroborating the charges.

The accused were identified as sarpanch Balram Gurjar, panchayat secretary Om Prakash Sharma, panchayat verification and nodal officer Hukum Chand, panchayat coordinator of Berasia Uma Shankar and panchayat office-bearers Deep Singh, Bhagwan Singh, Mahesh Kumar and Pramod Vishwakarma.

SHO Mishra said cops have raided their homes, but the accused locked their houses and are on the run. They will be nabbed soon, Mishra added.

351,['10/02/2020'],IPS officer pitches himself for DGP post,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Bhopal: In an unprecedented act, Madhya Pradesh IPS officer Maithili Sharan Gupta on Saturday pitched himself publicly for the post of director general of police (DGP) amid speculation that incumbent DGP V K Singh may be shifted. Gupta is on the UPSC list for DGP that the state has rejected.

An officer of the 1984 batch, Gupta put up social media messages, declaring himself as an officer who has the capacity to ‘turn around policing in the state’. He also sought support from public and media.

“I feel others (esteemed journalists and good public personalities) should come forward to convey my point of view and potential to make a difference in delivery to public and transforming police as real saviour and helper. I would not like to project myself as victim or aggrieved. The state government should realise that I have the capacity to turn around policing in entire MP,” said his social media post. It went viral.

Special DG-police reforms, Gupta is one of the three IPS officers empaneled by Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) for the post of DGP, but the state government has rejected the list, saying one of the officers has not expressed his ‘willingness’ for the post.

The other two are incumbent DGP V K Singh and Vivek Kumar Johri, who is DG of Border Security Force. Johri, also of the 1984 batch, was special secretary in Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) before the appointments committee of cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and with home minister Amit Shah among its members, appointed him as head of BSF.

Controversy over DGP’s post erupted on February 8 after the Madhya Pradesh government rejected the UPSC panel.

MP home secretary Rajesh Kumar Jain wrote to the UPSC secretary that Johri has not given his ‘willingness’ for the post of DGP in writing, so naming him in the panel is against the mandate of UPSC guidelines for selection. He also wrote that state government would send a new proposal to the commission.

The next day, DGP V K Singh had a lengthy closed-door meeting with chief minister Kamal Nath. Singh passed it off as a routine meet, but the one-on-one with the CM took place after nearly a month, say sources.

Nashik: After birth certificates, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has now started providing online death certificates to citizens.

The facility has been running as a pilot project in the Panchavati division for the past fortnight. Officials said the service will soon start in other five divisions of the NMC — Nashik East, Nashik West, Nashik Road, Cidco and Satpur.

Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has directed the medical department of the municipal corporation to start providing death certificates online in five other divisions from the next week.

“We are making efforts to start the online distribution of death certificates to residents. The municipal commissioner has already directed us to start the online facility for six divisions of the NMC,” a civic body official said.

“The certificates are provided through WhatsApp and email. We have linked hospitals and crematoriums, which immediately inform the medical department of the NMC in case of a death. Once we receive this information, a death certificate is sent to citizens within 10 days,” the official added.

The NMC has also started the process of providing marriage certificates online. Currently, citizens have to visit divisional offices of NMC for physical submission of forms. They are also called for verification along with witnesses and relatives.

“But they will not need to come to the divisional offices to submit the form. They can do everything online and can also upload documents on the web. Citizens will have the option to select a time slot online, similar to the passport office,” said an official.

The NMC has been submitting online birth certificates since September 15. So far, over 11,000 birth certificates have been sent to parents via the web. The civic body has also connected with 400 hospitals in the city to secure details of newborns.

353,['10/02/2020'],Railways told to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to woman,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Ahmedabad: A consumer court has directed the Western Railway to pay Rs 1.5 lakh to a senior citizen who fell down and injured herself in 2011 while getting down from a coach on Surat platform, which was then under renovation.

According to case details, a resident of Gurukul, Ushaben Shukla, 79, had travelled from Ahmedabd to Surat in Shatabdi Express on April 4, 2011. The Surat railway station was under renovation and the height of the platform had been reduced. The elderly woman fell on the platform and suffered injuries while getting down from the coach.

Shukla was hospitalized and underwent a surgery before she was discharged a week later. She had to spend Rs 1.87 lakh for treatment and medicine. She approached the Surat district consumer dispute redressal forum seeking compensation from the railways authorities for the negligence by not keeping a standard distance between the steps of the coach and the platform so that the passengers do not face any difficulty. She also claimed that there were many instances of passengers falling on Surat platform due to the reduced height of the platform creating more space between the coach’s steps and the platform.

The consumer forum entertained Shukla’s petition. This brought the Western Railway to the Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission with an argument that the consumer forum does not have jurisdiction to entertain such a complaint. There is a specific provision of the Railway Claims Tribunal to redress such grievances.

The railway authorities also argued that the Surat railway station master office had not received a single complaint about passengers falling down while getting down from trains due to the faulty design of the station.

The consumer commission said that more care has to be taken at the time of getting down from railway coach at station. In this case, the complainant is a senior citizen and therefore more care was required to be taken by her. However, it would meet the ends of justice, if the railways paid Rs 1.5 lakh on lumpsum basis to the complainant.

Dehradun: After two employees of Military Engineering Services (MES) were caught accepting bribe in Dehradun , the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is now probing other MES officials on suspicion that they deliberately red-flagged the progress report of contractors to receive bribes for different construction works in the hill state.

“The investigation has revealed that certain officials used to red-flag the progress report of contractors. Later, they would file a favourable report in return for financial gratification,” said a CBI official handling the case.

Last month, a CBI team had arrested an Assistant Garrison Engineer and a Junior Engineer from Dehradun Garrison Engineer office for accepting Rs 40,000 bribe from a Delhi-based contractor for clearing his payment of over Rs 20 lakh.

However, since the coronavirus outbreak, exports from India have been temporarily stopped.“Last year, India had exported 15 lakh cotton bales (1.78 quintal in each bale) to China. So far this year, it could export only 4 lakh bales,” said Pradeep Jain, the president of the Khandesh Ginning and Pressing Factory Owners’ Association.This year, China was expected to import large volumes of cotton as its internal cotton reserves had reduced. It was to import more than 20 lakh bales of cotton from various countries — a bulk of which would have been from India,” said Jain. Such expectations had created a positive mood in the market and the prices of raw cotton had increased by Rs 200 per quintal to settle at Rs 5,300 per quintal in the first week of January.“But the outbreak of coronavirus has badly hit cotton exports from India. The export has stopped temporarily,” said Jain.The prices of cotton have now stabilised at around Rs 5,000 per quintal. The government is procuring cotton at the price of Rs 5,500 per quintal, but it is also expected to stop procurement of cotton from farmers soon.The market is so slow.

It warned the actor to stop insulting the protestors. More than 2000 people participated in the rally. It has decided to conduct a state-wide protest and burn manu dharma books on May 21.

The federation also held a public meeting on abolition of caste. Addressing the gathering, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol Thirumavalavan said the people who were speaking about Tamil Desiyam were not ready to accept intercaste marriage. “Those involve in honour killing would have a Hindutva or Sangh Parivar background. So, we have to be careful of them. Ambedkarists, Periyarists and leftists should not allow Hindutva forces to set their foot in Tamil Nadu.”

Dravidar Kazhagam leader K Veeramani, meanwhile, presided over two intercaste marriages on the stage. He said it was the government’s duty to treat everyone equally and abolish the caste system. “The caste system should be eradicated from the country and the government should take initiative in this regard.

The country is ruled by the people who believe in Manusmṛiti and they are trying to divide the people. So, we are ready to sacrifice our lives to protest this,” he said.

The Advanced Institute for Integrated Research on Livestock and Animal Sciences to come up at Thalaivasal in Salem at a cost of Rs 1,024 crore is touted to be biggest in south Asia.

To be set up on 1,100 acres land, the institute will be of international standards and will have a veterinary college within, said chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami after laying the foundation stone for the project on Sunday.

Flanked by a battery of senior ministers from the state cabinet including his deputy O Panneerselvam, EPS said that the institute would revolutionize livestock and animal research in the country.

“The livestock park will have three components. The first will have a modern dairy farm and a state of the art veterinary hospital. In addition, there will be a facility for breeding of native cattle breeds like Umbalacheri, Alambadi and Bargur as well as one for native dogs like chippiparai and Kombai,’’ he said. Similar facility for protecting native goat breeds and pig rearing would also be a part.

The second component will be dedicated to production of value added products from fish, meat, egg and dairy. A 2000-sq. m. pisciculture farm would be set up to produce 20 lakh fishes every year which will be distributed to farmers for rearing.

The third component will be of academic nature where a complex for higher education, research centre for veterinary sciences and a training centre for farmers would be established. “A veterinary college at a cost of Rs 82.17 crore would be set up with a capacity of 80 seats,’’ EPS said.

In addition to the students of the proposed colleges, students from other veterinary institutes from across the globe, researchers and entreprenuers could visit and benefit from the facilities at the livestock park, EPS said.

Pointing out that research will be pursued to develop high yielding, disease resistant native as well as high bred cattle varieties, EPS said that the proposed modern dairy farm of international standards with a capacity of 500 heads of cattle will also feature a state of the art industrial unit which can make 12 types of value added dairy products. “An advanced fodder manufacturing unit of 50 tonne capacity will also be set up,’’ he said.

EPS said the ideas for the institute were picked up by him during his visit to livestock units in the US last year.

Moreover, lack of infrastructure facilities results into landing of fish catch in unhygienic conditions. This leads to deterioration of overall quality of fish products and increase of waste, affecting the price realisation and export, which ultimately leads to monetary loss to the fishermen.’’The state government has proposed to construct five new fishing harbours at Navabandar, Madhwad, Veraval, Porbandar and Sutrapada.The proposal states that the Gujarat fisheries department has established five fishing harbours and 18 fish landing centres (FLCs) for fisheries activities. There are about 24,720 mechanised fishing boats which operate in Gujarat. Present fishing harbours and fish landing centres are sufficient only to accommodate about 12% of these fishing boats.Sources in the government said, “Fishermen suffer monetary losses due to non-availability of berthing space in fishing harbours.

It was also learnt that TNCA will build temporary stands as it plans to host a few Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) games in the forthcoming season. “If we build stands, the ground can seat around 15,000 spectators which is not bad for an IPL game. So, the TNPL matches will prove as a test event,” a TNCA source told TOI.

Palaniswami also assured that the state government would provide the required support to host the IPL matches. “As far as I know, IPL matches have not been conducted in any place other than Chennai in Tamil Nadu. So, Salem would turn out to be the first city to host the matches outside Chennai. The state government would extend all support for it,’’ he said.

The chief minister said the stadium would benefit the youth in the region and provide a fillip to the game of cricket.

Srinivasan said the stadium would initially host the Tamil Nadu Premier League T20 matches. With CSK set to start their IPL preparatory camp from the first week of March, the former BCCI chief said captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni might visit and inspect the ground along with coach Stephen Fleming. “Eventually, Dhoni would be playing matches in the stadium. So, he needs to take the call. I would like to request the chief minister to watch the match when Dhoni plays,’’ he said.

Lauding the state government and TNCA for developing the ground, Rahul Dravid, who is currently serving as the National Cricket Academy director, said the youth from smaller towns and cities would be playing a crucial role in the future of national cricket. “The next generation of heroes and talents in the country will come from smaller towns and cities and facilities like this would help them achieve their goal.”

The event was marked by a lighter moment when Dravid bowled a few balls to chief minister Edappadi K Palansiwami.

GORAKHPUR: In a key decision to tackle unemployment by equipping youths with skills and work experience, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday announced an internship programme under which students from Class 10 to graduation will get to work with technical institutes and industries for six months to one year and will be paid a stipend of Rs 2,500 per month during the period.

The Centre will contribute Rs 1,500 of the honorarium while the state will provide Rs 1,000, Yogi said after inaugurating the Rozgar Mela (employment fair) at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University.

“The internship scheme will be launched this year. Under this scheme, students from Class 10 to graduation will be linked to various technical institutes and industries. On completion of their internship, the government will assist them in placement through an HR cell, which will be set up soon,” he said.

The scheme is in sharp contrast to the unemployment allowance of the previous Samajwadi Party government, wherein jobless youths, aged between 25 and 40 years, having annual family income less than Rs 36,000, were given a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000.

Yogi said the government has also decided to ensure compulsory recruitment of at least 20% girls in state police. The CM claimed UP was the first state in the country which was successful in giving government jobs to more than 2.5 lakh youths within three years. The investment of more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore through Investors’ Summit also created employment opportunities for 35 lakh youths, he said.

“Through the department of labour and employment exchange, we have done three times more work in just three years than previous governments in five years,” he added.

The state government will be opening an ITI and a skill development centre in each tehsil to equip youths with skills to increase employability, the CM said.

“Our government has ended interviews for non-gazetted posts of class IV, III and II in the state to curb corruption and ensure transparency in recruitment,” Yogi added.

The CM said Defence Expo 2020 in Lucknow was a huge success and it will open the doors for creation of jobs in the state. “Defence chiefs and ambassadors of 70 countries attended the Expo. Many national and international companies signed MoUs for putting in money in the defence corridor, which will bring an investment of Rs 50,000 crore and employment for 5 lakh youths,” he said.

363,['10/02/2020'],Workhorse &amp; guard dog: Ramnad Mandai a hit among city residents,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Madurai: Ever since the 2017 jallikattu movement, the push for promoting native breeds of animals has been significant and dog breeders see more people opting for native breeds such as the extremely rare ‘Mandai’ breed from rural Ramanathapuram.

""Mandai dogs are hound dogs that have been used mainly for hunting and herding sheep and goats in Ramanathapuram for generations. Local people are also possessive of them and do not even give away pups to others who are from a different place. Hardly around 10 people in a village here have these dogs,"" said P Venkatachalam, kennel owner from Ramanathapuram.

Venkatachalam, who is a breeder for almost 10 years now, recalled that Mandai dogs have a rich history in Ramanathapuram. ""They are hard-working dogs mainly used to herd goats and sheep, particularly those species that are ferocious and fight. My father’s Mandai dog was almost the same height of a full-grown ram and it could herd cattle with ease,"" he said.

Now, Mandai dogs are being preferred as guard dogs in urban areas. ""Their maintenance cost is low. We usually give kanji as food. They can guard really well and listen to only their owners with proper training. We got a good response for the breed from urban dog owners,"" said Venkatachalam. His kennel has sold many of their Mandai dog litter to owners from Bangalore, Chennai and Coimbatore for prices ranging between Rs 4,000 and Rs 6,000.

Madurai Canine Club president S Vinayaga Moorthy said that the club was trying its best to promote native breeds of dogs from villages. ""Mandai dogs, which have a rich history of being used in temples, are only around 500 in population now. There are many breeds from villages that usually go unnoticed. Owners need to get certification and prove the purity of breed. This breed from Ramanathapuram has been certified only this year and we wanted to highlight it at our dog show to create awareness,"" he said.

Similarly, dog breeders and kennel owners said that the demand for native breeds, just like for Mandai dogs, has gradually been rising over the past few years. ""The native breeds easily adapt and their maintenance cost is also low. They are also ferocious and are not intimidated by local stray dogs unlike some foreign breeds. Since most of them are hunting dogs, they are great guardians when trained,"" said Saran, owner of a two-month old Chippiparai pup. Kanni, Kombai, Chippiparai and Rajapalayam are some of the most sought-after native breeds of dogs from Tamil Nadu.

364,['10/02/2020'],89 properties to go under the hammer in NMC auction,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nashik: After receiving a poor response to the amnesty scheme, the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has decided to auction properties of 89 taxpayers for defaulting tax payment amounting to Rs 23 lakhs.

This is for the second time that NMC is auctioning such defaulters properties. Last time such action was taken last month. The auction of the properties is set to be held on February 26 at Dadasaheb Gaikwad auditorium in the city.

Out of the 89 properties going under the hammer, 67 are from the Nashik Road division which has total dues of Rs 13.5 lakhs. Ten properties are from the Cidco division, which has pending dues amounting to Rs 6.5 lakhs while the remaining seven properties are from Satpur division with total dues of around Rs 3 lakhs.

“If we do not get a response from the bidders during the auction of the properties, we will take a call on changing the ownership of the properties in the name of NMC,” said an NMC official.

Last month, the NMC had put on an auction of 44 properties, which had defaulted property tax dues amounting to Rs 50 lakhs. Eight defaulters paid their dues totally worth Rs 3.68 lakh. Hence, an auction for only 36 properties was held in the first week of January with not a single bidder turning up for the bidding process.

In July last year, the NMC had put on an auction of 172 properties with total defaulting taxes amounting to Rs 2.84 crores but even at that time, it received a cold response from the bidders.

“It is difficult to inform about the reasons why people do not participate in auctioning of properties. But sometimes, the titles of the properties are not clear or there have been some loan burdens on the properties,” said an NMC official.

To counter this issue, the NMC will now convert the properties to their names. “If we do not receive a response to the auction of properties for the second time, NMC may take over these properties following approval of the standing committee,” said an official.

NMC has set a property tax collection target of Rs 218 crores for the current financial year 2019-20. So far, they have collected taxes amounting to Rs 118 crores, which is still short by Rs 100 crores.

365,['10/02/2020'],Illegal phone exchange: More likely to be arrested,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Malappuram: More arrests are likely in connection with the illegal telephone exchanges busted in Noida and Malappuram , in which a man from Palakkad was arrested , defence sources said.

The exchanges were busted in a joint operation by the CID wing of the Mumbai police and military intelligence officers. Thacharayil Hillar, 34, of Chalissery in Palakkad, was arrested on Thursday from Malappuram.

Inspector Basheer Chirakkal of Changaramkulam police said the case was registered by Mumbai police, and Hillar was taken into custody from a rented room at Changaramkulam town.

Several electronic devices were also seized from his room, the inspector said. The Mumbai police team had approached Malappuram district police chief U Abdul Kareem, seeking support for the raid. Changaramkulam police was ordered to assist the Mumbai police personnel.

“We have learnt that the person was a part of an international criminal gang, which operated the parallel telephone exchanges with the support of Chinese technology. The gang managed to divert internet calls from Gulf countries through a parallel channel for monetary benefits,” inspector Chirakkal said.

“We have no further details,” he added.

Quoting defence sources, news agencies reported that the illegal voice over internet protocol (VoIP) exchanges were used by callers suspected to be linked to Pakistani spy agency ISI to gather information about important defence installations.

Two Sim boxes with 100 slots each, nearly 200 Sim cards, routers, modems and other communication devices procured from China were seized in the raids in Noida, Uttar Pradesh and Changaramkulam.

It has been suspected that the entire operation could be an attempt to compromise internal security, defence sources said.

A probe was launched after defence personnel in September 2019 received calls from suspicious numbers, seeking information on important defence installations. The callers had fictitious identities and the involvement of ISI was suspected, defence sources said, adding investigations revealed illegal VoIP exchanges in Noida and in Kerala which routed incoming calls from Pakistan to local numbers.

Hillar had gone to the UAE after completing his graduation eight years ago. In Dubai, he met the members of a similar racket. On returning to India, he replicated the illegal exchange.

Inspector Chirakkal said the cyber wing of Kerala police was checking the possible existence of similar exchanges in the state.

Ahmedabad on Sunday recorded 26.8°C as maximum and 12.4°C as minimum temperature

AHMEDABAD: With change in wind direction, the minimum temperature in Ahmedabad and major cities of Gujarat have recorded a rise. India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted 3-4C rise in minimum temperature in next three days with easterly to southeasterly winds over the region.

Ahmedabad on Sunday recorded 26.8C as maximum and 12.4C as minimum temperature, 3.1 degrees and 0.8 degrees lower than the average. Several areas of the city recorded windy weather in morning hours.

Naliya was the coldest in the state with 6.2 degrees of minimum temperature, followed by Keshod (10.6 degrees), Kandla (10.9 degrees), Deesa (11.8 degrees) and Gandhinagar (12 degrees).

Met department officials said that it’s unlikely that the minimum temperature would go much lower than the current conditions in next few days. “This winter, the change in wind directions have resulted in see-saw behaviour of the minimum temperature,” said an official.

368,['10/02/2020'],NMC paid 366 surplus teachers Rs22 crore per year for last 6 years,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: Despite facing a cash crunch and high administrative expenses, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has been employing 366 surplus teachers in its schools for last over six years. When this came to the notice of municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe, he directed NMC education department to send a proposal to the state education department to transfer the surplus teachers.

In the wake of chief secretary Ajoy Mehta’s review meeting on NMC’s working on Monday, Mundhe held review meetings with head of all departments on Thursday. Mundhe learnt about the 366 surplus teachers with NMC-run schools and directed education officer Priti Mishrikotkar to submit a proposal to the state education department to absorb them as soon as possible.

As per NMC data, there are 3,000 sanctioned posts of teachers in NMC. The civic body has 1,121 teachers currently. However, the state government rules require NMC to employ two teachers for the first 60 students, and one more teacher for every 30 extra students for primary schools. The students-teacher ratio for higher primary and secondary schools is different.

NMC is operating 131 primary and higher primary schools, and 29 secondary schools. The student strength in NMC schools is around 18,000. As per the government student-teacher ratio, NMC requires 755 teachers, but is maintaining 1,121 teachers, making for a surplus of 366.

The government norms also make mandatory for NMC to transfer surplus teachers to the state’s education department for employment at zilla parishad or government-aided schools of any district in the state. Accordingly, NMC sent a proposal to the state’s education department in 2014-15, but did not pursue it. No reminder letter too has been sent by NMC to the department in last six years.

Each teacher gets over Rs50,000 per month salary. Calculated at an average Rs50,000 per month, salaries of 366 surplus teachers come to over Rs22 crore per annum. For primary and higher primary teachers, NMC bears 50% salary while remaining is given by the government. For secondary teachers, government pays the entire salary. Most of the 366 surplus teachers are from primary and higher primary schools.

Thus, NMC and government have been facing a loss for over six years.

A NMC official told TOI teachers were not sent to state education department as the general body had in 2009 passed a resolution not to send teachers of NMC schools to state. “Now, NMC education department has submitted a proposal to the civic chief and appropriate decision will be taken in next couple of days,” the official said.

It is likely to become a hot topic in NMC as teachers unions are said to be very strong. Consequently, teachers have protection of NMC office bearers and corporators.

Nashik: With the state government drawing a deadline of April 15 for implementing the loan waiver scheme, the banks have now been asked to clear the process of merging the Aadhaar-linked accounts of the farmers to get the exact number and amount owed by the beneficiaries in the district.

The accounts of more than 92% of farmers — beneficiary of Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farmers loan waiver scheme — have been uploaded on the portal and the remaining would be completed in the span of eight days and the scrutiny will also be carried out alongside.

Suraj Mandhare, collector of Nashik , said, “Around 92% of the accounts have been uploaded on the portal for crop loan waiver scheme announced by the state government. We have asked the banks to conduct the scrutiny of the Aadhaar-linked accounts to figure out if the particular beneficiary has more than Rs 2 lakh loan — the limit set by the state government.”

The collector pointed out that 99% of all the accounts were already Adhaar-linked after which the process of uploading the data was being carried out.

After having run through various checks, by the district administration, the numbers of farmers that fall in the category of outstanding loan below Rs 2 lakh is 1.46 lakh of which 1.08 lakh are with the Nashik District Central Cooperative (NDCC) Bank.

According to the collector, the data of 1.07 lakh farmers having accounts with the NDCC has been uploaded on the portal. The process of uploading the remaining data will be completed in couple of days.

Similarly, in case of the private and nationalised banks, the number of beneficiaries is 37,674 and data of 26,313 farmers is yet to be uploaded.

372,['10/02/2020'],New colour code to be in force from March 1,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The new colour code scheme for contract carriages will be in force from March 1 . The colour code was approved in a state transport authority (STA) meeting.

The contract carriage vehicles shall be painted in white with a violet ribbon of 10cm width with a metallic gold ribbon of 3cm width above the violet ribbon at the centre of the exterior of the side body.

The directive of the transport authority mentions about the specific size and colour to display the name of vehicle, if any. The name of the vehicle can be painted in white at the top of the front side of the vehicle in a normal font with a size not more than 12inch. Name of the operator or any other details can be painted in a column not more than 40cm height at rear portion of the vehicle and at full width of the vehicle.

The STA directive follows the high court order which declared that exhibition of gigantic figures of film stars or writings on the bus body and safety glass shall not be allowed. Also, the recent incidents of rash driving by tourist buses brought for tour programmes for school students led the authority to expedite the measures for road safety.

“Now, there is no uniform colour for the contract carriages plying in the state. It can be seen that most of the contract carriages are painted with figures of film stars, international players, pictures of wild animals, birds and with peculiar type of colour combinations... These paintings often attract the attention of other road users causing accidents. Therefore uniform colour code is to be enforced taking into consideration of all these factors and road safety concerns,” states the directive of STA.

While the new vehicles will have to follow the colour code for vehicle registration from March 1, the existing contract carriages will have to change the colour before they are brought for next fitness test.

“Only the new vehicles brought for registration from March will have to comply with the order. As only basic colours are fixed for the vehicle, the expenditure related to painting the vehicle will be 60% less. The similar colour code introduced for private bus operators was not a financial burden,” said transport minister A K Saseendran.

Nagpur: A godman in his late 30s left a scandalous trail at a village in Bhandara district when he eloped with a married woman after a weeklong ‘Bhagwat katha satsang’. Now on way to Uttar Pradesh, the godman also told the woman’s husband that he was heading to Vrindavan with his ‘Radha’.

On Saturday, Bhandara police managed to zero down upon the godman and the woman, mother of a five-year-old daughter, in Vrindavan and were bringing both of them back to Nagpur.

It’s learnt the godman, known to have had several such flings with women in the past, had conducted a ‘satsang’ at the village between January 27 and February 3. He had also been invited for ‘satsang’ in the same village last year. Sources said the godman, who is a native of Nagpur district, also frequented the village on various pretexts over the last one year.

During his latest ‘satsang’, sources in the village said the godman stayed at the residence of the married woman. During his stay the family of the married woman had noticed some unusual closeness between the two, and their frequent talks too had been noticed.

The woman and the godman were also active on social media. The family of the woman told the police that the illicit relationship may have grown deeper due to their frequent communication on social media.

Suspicious of her behaviour, the woman’s family had started keeping a watch on her after the satsang. On February 4, the woman was slapped by her husband after he caught her speaking to the godman on phone. Later the same evening, the woman is learnt to have jumped from the first floor of her residence to flee the place. The family tried to trace her but she could not be found.

On February 5, the family landed up at Bhandara police station to lodge a missing complaint. The police had called up the godman on phone. He confessed having eloped with the woman, and also revealed their plan to visit Vrindavan, when her husband spoke on the phone.

Senior PI Sudhakar Chavan of Bhandara police station said the phone location showed the godman was at the same village when the woman fled her home.

SP Arvind Salve of Bhandara said the woman would be handed over to the family, but it would be up to her if she wanted stay at her in-laws place or go somewhere else. “Police will not force the woman to go anywhere against her wish. She is an adult and is free to do what she wants,” he said.

PATNA: A tanker (container) meant for supply of drinking water is being used for transporting smuggled liquor in ‘dry’ Bihar .Interestingly, the tanker having slogans of the government’s populist schemes such as ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ and ‘Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao’ written on it, was seized from Chakia village under Majhi police station limit in Saran district on Saturday. Altogether 330 cartons of India made foreign liquor (IMFL) manufactured in Haryana besides 400 pouches of country liquor were seized from the tanker.Majhi police station SHO Neeraj Kumar Mishra said on Sunday that a specially designed crater was made inside the tanker to store the liquor bottles. To make the transportation of alcohol foolproof, a car was moving ahead of the tanker to escort it. The car was also seized. Kunal Kumar Singh (liner) and tanker driver Sonu Kumar were arrested. During interrogation, the driver revealed that the consignment was to be delivered to bootleggers operating in Saran and Siwan districts.SHO Mishra said, “Initially driver Sonu, a resident of Indra Colony in Aligarh, tried to mislead the police by disclosing that he was carrying drinking water in the container. But, water didn’t flow from the tap even after being pressed repeatedly by the cops. The search of the tanker led to recovery of liquor.”Saran SP Har Kishore Rai said the seized consignment was to be supplied during Holi when the demand of liquor will be high. “All the police stations across the district, especially those located along the Bihar-UP border, have been put on alert and the SHOs concerned have been asked to check all the vehicles entering the district,” he said.The SP said the water tanker bearing the registration number of UP was seized following a tip-off. To a question, the SP said it was being ascertained whether the tanker was earlier used for the purpose.Senior police officers are baffled over the novel modus operandi adopted by the liquor smugglers in Bihar where use of alcohol is prohibited. Bootleggers have also used coffin boxes, cycle tubes and vegetables to hide liquor bottles and bring them in from Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. “There have been instances when liquor bottles were smuggled inside fruits like watermelon,” a senior police officer said.The officer further said, “The smugglers keep on changing their modus operandi to avoid detection. Sometimes they move in afternoon as most checks happen at night.”Manufacture, sale and consumption of liquor is banned in the state under Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act 2016.In Video: Watch: Water tanker stuffed with smuggled liquor seized in ‘dry’ Bihar",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74055372,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193239,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/liquor-flows-from-water-tanker-in-saran/articleshow/74050462.cms
375,['10/02/2020'],Authorities want Airport Road users to obey wardens,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Pune: The airport authorities have requested flyers to follow the traffic wardens’ instructions to ease the traffic jams along the new airport road.

“We have taken up several infrastructural projects. There are traffic congestions during rush hours. We request passengers to cooperate with the traffic wardens,” the authorities said.

Early on Sunday, a flyer posted a photograph of the new airport road that was jammed with traffic. It is the same situation in the late evening, sources said.

An airport official tweeted, “This pertains to the alighting point at the departure entry gates, exit at the arrival area and the public roads in front of the terminal building.”

In a conversation last week with TOI, Pune airport director Kuldeep Singh had said the airport will have better access once the major projects are completed. The airport authorities are looking at the handing over of around 34 acres of land.

The new airport road is also used by people going towards Symbiosis College via the VIP Road. Right from 509 Chowk, the road is crammed and the traffic leaving the airport worsens it. Passengers alight from the autorickshaws or cabs at this chowk and walk towards the airport so as to not miss flights, a frequent flyer added.

Wadgaon Sheri MLA Sunil Tingre, who is also vice president of the Pune Airport Advisory Committee, told TOI that there were plans for more alternative roads to the airport.

“However, some land belongs to the IAF which is needed for the airport as are plots owned by private landowners. In the last advisory committee meeting, we had talked at length about them. Once these issues are cleared, things will be in order,” he said.

376,['10/02/2020'],Consumer forum pulls up insurance company for failing to reviving cover,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik district consumer forum has pulled up an insurance firm for its failure to extend the promised cover despite fulfillment of all formalities and ordered it to compensate the consumers Rs 15,000 for harassment, both physical and mental.

“The failure of the insurance company in extending the insurance cover despite completing the formalities by the consumers amounts to deficiency in service. Though there was no claim filed by the consumers and they were hale and hearty, the company has to compensate for the mental harassment faced by the consumers when they were abroad,” read a February 2 judgment delivered by a three-member forum.

Pious David (72) and Thalema Pious (68) residents of Nashik Road had been to Australia from November 3, 2017 on a tourist visa. Both had paid premiums of Rs 5,169 and Rs 5,789 to ICICI Lombard insurance company for a health cover of USD 50,000 during their stay till December 15, 2017.

According to the consumers, they had chosen to take the insurance cover from the company on condition if they were able to extend the same after completing the formalities.

“The clients paid the required premiums and went to Australia on tourist visa. For some reasons their stay abroad got extended and hence got in touch with the insurer requesting to extend the cover as well. They even completed all the formalities but the company simply refused extension for no valid reason,” MK Vaishnav, counsel for the applicants, said in the case registered with the forum on March 31, 2018.

“The complainants witnessed an accident in Australia where there was a huge casualty and was disturbed with the thought how could they deal with such medical injury if they were part of the mishap,” Vaishnav added.

In its reply the company through its counsel PP Pawar claimed that there was no medical claim filed by the consumers with it. Besides it was not biding upon the company to extend the cover. “Whatever has been said in the complaint is fictitious and hence the case may be dismissed,” Pawar had said.

“It is observed that the company has in its terms and condition stipulated the process for extension of cover which was followed by the complainant from abroad. The company by turning down the request without any valid reason has caused mental harassment to the consumers,” the forum said asking the company to pay Rs 10,000 as compensation for mental harassment and Rs 5,000 for physical harassment.

377,['10/02/2020'],"Jaywalking no crime, 3 pedestrians die every day in Gujarat","This story is from February 10, 2020

AHMEDABAD: Jaywalking , or crossing the road without regard for approaching traffic , has become so commonplace in the city that it is no longer perceived to be a crime. Throwing caution to the wind, and putting their own lives and the safety of others at risk, Amdavadis walk across streets with impunity while vehicles are on the move. On the flip side, most zebra crossings meant for people to walk across the roads, are taken over by vehicles that stationed at red signal.

Road safety consultant Amit Khatri says, Nearly 65 to 70% of the pedestrian accidents are caused because of jaywalking. He says that till this date pedestrians are not being fined for being careless on the road, and not respecting street signs. “It’s a behavioural issue. Ear pods are plugged in, often people are seen talking on mobile phone while crossing the road,” says Khatri adding that Artificial Intelligence powered CCTV cameras can now recognize jaywalking. “The traffic police should be asked to locate such individual on the spot and fine them,”

According to the report, “Road Accidents in India – 2018” of the Union government, on an average, three pedestrians are killed in Gujarat every day in road accidents. As many as 1,170 pedestrians were killed in road accidents during the year 2018 in the state. The report found footpath encroachments played a major role in such incidents by forcing people to walk on the road space meant for vehicles.

378,['10/02/2020'],Delhi assembly elections: How eroding share of Congress may further boost AAP,"File photo

NEW DELHI: A further decline in the prospects of Congress in Delhi, though not unexpected, seems to be powering AAP ’s success, as has been predicted by various exit polls. Most polls forecast zero seats for Congress though one has given it four, with a vote share of 8.8%.In 2015, Congress had a vote share of 9.8%. Psephologists don’t seem to believe that the party can match even that figure this time round. Unlike BJP, which mounted an aggressive campaign, the grand old party was largely missing in action. AAP claimed that a major chunk of late voting had gone in its favour even though BJP maintained that the reality was quite the opposite.Congress’ loss is being seen as AAP’s gain, as any vote-split would have helped BJP make deeper inroads.Sources said among a few constituencies where Congress ran a strong campaign were Kasturba Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Seelampur, Mustafabad, Badli, Sultanpur Majra, Chandni Chowk, Hari Nagar, Dwarka, Kalkaji, Sangam Vihar and Kondli. However, with party bigwigs conspicuous by their absence for most of the campaigning, it was left for the candidates to fend for themselves. To their credit, many of them conducted door-to-door meetings and made extensive use of social media, besides holding small public meetings on their own, the sources added.But for most parts, the campaign failed to generate a lot of excitement. While BJP and AAP ran high-octane campaigns, Congress adopted a laid-back approach, with not many senior party functionaries hitting the ground in support of its candidates. In the last week of electioneering, several star campaigners, including Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and ex-PM Manomohan Singh and chief ministers of Chhattisgarh and Punjab CM, did address public meetings, but it all appeared to be too little too late.“Congress doesn’t appear to be very strong this time. When it was in office in Delhi, the party carried out a lot of development work,” said Hiten Sharma, a voter at Chanakyapuri. The party, too, chose to harp back on its past record, often invoking the tenure of three-time CM, the late Sheila Dikshit.While some candidates blamed the delay in distribution of tickets for the lackadaisical approach, others claimed that there was a lack of coordination from the central office. A candidate, requesting anonymity, said that the party had failed to back the contestants on the ground. While the more resourceful candidates could still power their campaigns, the newcomers fought lone battles.In contrast, sources in AAP said, the party had managed to project itself as an alternative to people who previously voted for Congress. “A large chunk of Congress voters shifted to AAP across various assembly segments. It will significantly increase our vote share and lead to the party breaking its own record of 2015,” claimed an AAP functionary. In 2015, AAP had won 67 of the 70 assembly seats.Even though Congress failed to match the electioneering blitzkrieg of AAP and BJP, the chief of the party’s Delhi unit, Subhash Chopra, claimed they would surprise everyone with their performance when the results finally came out.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74052343,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-151667,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi/how-eroding-share-of-cong-may-further-boost-aap/articleshow/74051765.cms
379,['10/02/2020'],Cold is back and so are diseases,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Bhubaneswar: The return of cold wave after a spell of rain and the prevailing inclement weather have led to outbreak of diseases. Cough, cold, respiratory diseases and bronchitis are affecting a large number people.

Many are also suffering from ailments like asthma, body ache, joint and muscle pain and skin diseases. Doctors said precautions like avoiding exposure to cold, maintaining personal hygiene and keeping distance from affected persons can keep people away from diseases.

“Influenza is a winter disease and people generally suffer from common cold, running nose, sore throat and cough in this season. With the drop in temperature, viruses get active in the atmosphere as a result more people, especially children, elders and those with history of asthma and chronic diseases, fall sick,” said Dr C B K Mohanty, director of medical education and training (DMET).

Several parts of the state experienced rain and thundershowers for the last few days with bone-chilling wind making a comeback. Both day and night temperature has dropped significantly. The Met office forecast cold wave conditions will prevail in coastal and interior districts for some more days.

On Sunday, Koraput and Sundargarh recorded 10 degree Celsius, the lowest minimum temperature in the state, while the minimum temperature in Bhubaneswar was 15 degree Celsius, an IMD source said. The state witnessed a sudden fall of temperature. “Due to this, cold and cough affected my child. Children are going to school, getting exposed to cold wind and are falling sick. It has become a big problem as final exams are starting from tomorrow (Monday),” said Shrabani Mishra, mother of a 10-year-old son. Doctors also advised eating of healthy food.

Children with low immunity generally fall ill during winter. “Apart from common cold, fever and cough, many kids also complain of tonsil infection due to exposure to cold wind and by taking cold drinks and ice cream in this season. Kids also get stomach flu in winter and complain about abdominal pain, diarrhoea, excessive flatulence, vomiting and fever,” said senior paediatrician Dr S S Mohapatra. Hospitals across the city said the number of patients complaining flu-like symptoms has increased in the last one week.

“Winter is the season of flu and bad weather aggravates it to serious conditions. Besides, this is the season when cases of swine flu and pneumonia are reported,” said Dr Dhananjay Das, deputy superintendent of Capital Hospital here.

The weather condition is hazardous for people with history of asthma and respiratory diseases. Doctors advised patients not to take them lightly and avoid self-medication.

“Many people take common cold very lightly and take medicine of their own. Parents must ensure their children cover ear, nose and neck when they are going out,” said Dr Swarupananda Mishra, ENT specialist.

380,['10/02/2020'],"Pune: Three steal domestic LPG and sell it for commercial use, booked","This story is from February 10, 2020

PUNE: The Bibvewadi police on Saturday booked three men, including the brother of a sitting corporator, for mishandling LPG cylinders, which resulted in an explosion that left one person injured.

The incident occurred on Friday night in Indiranagar in Bibvewadi. Police found about seven cylinders stored illegally in the house that was damaged in the explosion.

The injured person, Rajaram Bhawarlal Bishnoi, alias Raju, is a 29-year-old resident of Upper Indiranagar . He sustained 30% burns and is getting treated at Sassoon General Hospital, said sub-inspector P M Waghmare of the Bibvewadi police station.

Fire brigade officials said the explosion occurred around 11.30pm on Friday in a small house located in a slum pocket. The entire house, in which the cylinders were stored, caught fire as a result. Two fire tenders rushed to the spot. The firefighters safely removed the cylinders from the house, and rescued Bishnoi and took him to the hospital. The house was damaged in the incident.

Sub-inspector Waghmare said the seven cylinders had no supporting documents. “The cylinders should be in the custody of the LPG agency or with the authorized personnel,” he said.

Waghmare said their investigation has revealed that the three suspects were involved in illegal trade of the LPG cylinders for the past few months.

“One of the three suspects owned the house and rented it to the other two. One suspect is employed by a LPG agency as a delivery boy for the Bibvewadi area,” Waghmare explained.

The delivery agent would steal cylinders meant for the domestic use from the agency and take them to the house. “Bishnoi and another man were employed in the house. The delivery boy also used to bring empty cylinders meant for commercial purposes,” Waghmare said.

“The two workers used to take remove gas from the domestic cylinders with the help of a machine and transfer it to the commercial cylinders, which they sold to different eateries and other establishment,” Waghmare said.

Cylinders for domestic use are subsidized by the government, while commercial cylinders are more expensive, police said.

“They had to break the seals to steal gas from the domestic cylinders. The delivery boy would reinforce the seals and deliver them to households. This way, they also cheated many families,” Waghmare said.

In his statement, Bishnoi told police that on Friday night, there was a brief power outage in the area, when they were transferred the gas. “When the power supply resumed, there were a few sparks, which caused a cylinder to explode,” Waghmare said.

The three suspects have been booked under the sections 188, 285, 287, 338, 436 and 420 of the Indian Penal Code. Police have also invoked provisions of Essential Commodities Act and The Explosives Rules, 2008.

382,['10/02/2020'],‘We are targeting over Rs 5L-cr in investments in third edition of Make in Odisha conclave’,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Though the third edition of Make in Odisha conclave is months away, preparations have started in right earnest. State industries and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) minister Dibya Shankar Mishra provides a glimpse of the government’s plan during an interaction with Sujit Bisoyi

Odisha is gearing up for the third Make in Odisha conclave this year… What are the plans?

The state government has successfully hosted two editions of Make in Odisha conclaves. Many of the proposals received during the two conclaves are under various stages of implementation. Countdown has already begun for the third edition, which will be even bigger. We hope to get positive response from the investors this time as well. Our target is to attract investments worth more than Rs 5 lakh crore in the third edition of the conclave.

The government had held national and international roadshows ahead of the 2nd edition of Make in Odisha. Any such plans this time?

The exercise has already began with two roadshows in Bengaluru and New Delhi to showcase the state’s business ecosystem in different sectors. More events, including international roadshows, are on the anvil. We are planning a mega show in Delhi (date yet be finalised) which will be attended by the chief minister ahead of the conclave’s third edition. The aim is to reach out to maximum investors to showcase our business ecosystem and growth potential.

What do you think are Odisha’s biggest advantages?

Over the past two decades, our government has been committed towards developing infrastructure like road, railways and port. The state now has three deep sea ports while some more are under construction. The state has rich mineral resources, skilled manpower and land bank. Above all, we have a stable government that takes firm decisions. All these factors make Odisha the most favoured investment destination in the country.

The state and Centre are working together on most issues now. Do you think it will have a positive impact on the state’s industrial growth?

Our CM has always stressed that interests of the state are paramount. We believe in constructive cooperation with the Union government. Whatever cooperation we need from the Centre to further develop the investment climate in the state, we will ask for it. I am hopeful that the Centre will also extend full cooperation on all fronts. What is the government’s vision to boost MSME sector?

If you have seen our six priority areas or focus sectors, we have mostly focused on downstream and ancillary industries. This will hugely boost the MSME sector in Odisha, which has the potential to create enormous employment opportunities. Growth of MSME sector will largely help in growth of state’s economy. To facilitate the small and medium industries, the state government has created sector-specific industrial clusters in different parts of the state. Besides, we have formulated policies with attractive incentives.

Odisha had roped in Japan as country partner for second edition of the conclave…

We sincerely feel that any international partnership is always welcome. Japan will always be there as one of our potential partners. As far as country partner for the third edition of Make in Odisha conclave, the discussion is on at different levels. We will get a clear picture after a few months.

Odisha is yet to get any significant response as far as foreign direct investment is concerned…

A long-term exercise is needed to get international investment. We are on the right track. Going by the response received during the recent roadshows in Guangzhou, China, and Singapore, I can say that Odisha is being considered as a potential investment destination. We are optimistic that the state will get more foreign investments in the years to come.

Where does the state stand in respect to investment intents received during the previous two conclaves?

Many of the intents have been converted into actual investments after dedicated teams were formed to follow up with the investors, who had evinced interest. We had received 84 and 202 proposals in the first and second editions, worth Rs 6.26 lakh crore. Of these, we have so far approved 120 proposals worth more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore. Many of these projects are under various stages of implementation.

There have been frequent agitations related to land acquisition…

There is hardly any agitation now against land acquisition for industrial projects. In fact, the state government has expedited the land acquisition process for some big-ticket projects.

Nashik: An online fraudster, pretending to be based in London, duped a city-based woman to the tune of Rs 51 lakh over a period of one-and-a-half year. A complaint in this regard was registered with the cybercrime police station.

Police said that the fraudster first won the victim’s trust and asked her to transfer money in his bank account from time to time. However, after she realised that she was being cheated, she approached the cybercrime police with a complaint.

Police said the 43-year-old complainant, a school teacher by profession, got acquainted with a person on a social media website in November 2018. The suspect told her that he was based in London. Later, the teacher and the concerned person often contacted each other on social media website, phones calls, etc.

As days passed, the conman won the trust of the woman after which she started sending him money.

Devraj Borase, senior PI of the cybercrime police station said that the conman who used to speak and chat with the victim only in English used to assure the latter that he would come and meet her in India.

A few months back, the conman told the victim that he had sent a gift to her address. A couple of days later, he told her that the gift was stuck with the customs department and that he would need some money to clear the article from the aforesaid department.

The woman paid a huge sum of money to the conman. Borase said that the woman sold her jewellery and also used her savings to give money to the conman with the hope that he would come to India and meet her.

However, after the woman had spent Rs 51 lakh on the conman, she realised that she was being cheated. Upon realising her mistake, she discussed the matter with a friend.

BENGALURU: RMC Yard police arrested two Iranians who allegedly stole money from car showrooms by diverting cashiers’ attention in Bengaluru, Udupi and Mangaluru .

The accused would approach the cashiers, asking for change for Rs 2000 notes to divert their attention and flee with cash from the showroom. Saeed Rostami, 26 and his friend Saber Hossein Eghbalzadeh, 35, are both residents of Tehran and in India on tourist visa.

The duo landed in New Delhi on January 16. Later, they arrived in coastal Karnataka before reaching Bengaluru on February 1. The same day around 4pm, the two visited Trident Automobile Pvt Ltd’s service centre in RMC Yard. They went to cashier Kiran and sought change for Rs 2000. One of them dropped the note and Kiran picked it up for him. Meanwhile, Kiran also noticed there was no change in his cash box and informed the duo accordingly. “Kiran later realised Rs 44,000 was missing from the cash box. He verified CCTV footage and found the two visitors stole the money when he bent down to pick up the Rs 2000 note,” a police officer said.

Kiran filed a theft and cheating case against the men. RMC Yard police suggested Kiran circulate the footage at other car showrooms and service centres as they had heard about similar incidents being reported from Udupi, Mangaluru and other places in Bengaluru. “Sharing of CCTV footage helped us nab the suspects. They visited a showroom near Cauvery junction on Ballari Road on February 6. The staff noticed the duo and realised they were the same guys, who had stolen the money at RMC Yard and informed us,” said police.

387,['10/02/2020'],Non-NCERT books in CBSE schools ruffle feathers,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Parents’ Association has expressed displeasure over the Directorate of Public Instructions order to CBSE schools to send them a list of non-NCERT textbooks prescribed by them.

The members of the MPPA said, the DPI is giving the private schools liberty to prescribe books by private publishers — which are unnecessarily more expensive than the NCERT.

“The Madhya Pradesh education department had passed an order in 2018 stating that all private CBSE schools should use NCERT books ... and in turn not force parents to buy expensive books by private publishers. The orders clearly state that the schools found guilty of prescribing books by private publishers in place of NCERT books can lose their NOC and recognition. But even two years later, this order has not been implemented,” said Prabodh Pandya, secretary of MPPA.

Citing examples of several noted private schools affiliated to the CBSE board in Bhopal, Pandya said, “I have the lists of all the books prescribed by the private schools. They are only using NCERT books for Hindi and Social Studies and have prescribed books by private publishers for all other subjects. Why?”

“The orders by DPI further give the schools the liberty to prescribe books by private publishers. The education department is not asking them clearly to follow the orders issued by it in 2018 and still beating around the bush by quoting the CBSE by-laws that state schools 'may' prescribe books by private publishers, but should give preference to NCERT books? The Delhi high court has also given a decision on this matter and the state's orders are also available”, Pandya said.

The members sent a letter to the Madhya Pradesh education minister Prabhuram Choudhary regarding the matter on Sunday.

Commenting on the issue, education minister Prabhuram Choudhary said, “We have asked all the schools to provide us the information of the books they are prescribing in the school curriculum. Schools cannot pressure parents to purchase extra books and will have to follow the rules laid down by the education department of MP. If we get a complaint regarding the same, we will take strict action against the school.”

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Hours before Delhi started voting on Saturday, Special Cell tracked down a huge cache of weapons and ammunitions brought to the city to disrupt law and order. The consignment, containing 21 pistols and 50 live cartridges, was brought to Delhi by two smugglers from Madhya Pradesh, who have been arrested.

The carriers were identified by the police as Pritam Singh (20) and Santoshi (50) from Morena in MP. Police are looking for the receivers and suspect that gangs of northeast Delhi and UP had ordered the weapons. The carriers claimed they had no details about the identity of the receivers and the kingpin of the racket had told them that they would be contacted by them once they reached the location of delivery.

The operation was conducted by a team led by ACP Lalit Mohan Negi and Hriday Bhushan, who have been tracking three arms supply modules from MP for the last one year. “Gangs are indulging in supply of illegal weapons to the criminals of NCR. Keeping in mind the upcoming Delhi assembly elections and in order to cut this supply of illegal fire arms and ammunitions to the criminals, intensive efforts were being made to track and arrest the illegal arms traffickers,” said Pramod Kushwaha, DCP (Special Cell).

The team received information that two carriers involved in interstate illegal firearms trafficking would be coming to northeast Delhi’s Dilshad Garden to supply these weapons.

A trap was laid and the accused were arrested with 21 pistols, including 11 semi-automatic pistols of .32 bore and 10 single shot pistols of .315 bore. They were also carrying 20 cartridges of .32 bore and 30 cartridges of .315 bore. A case was registered against them.

During interrogation, Santoshi revealed that he had been arrested and sent to jail in a case of brawl and met arms traffickers inside the prison.

391,['10/02/2020'],‘Budget will help in development of the 3rd and 4th line to decongest the Bhusawal section’,"This story is from February 10, 2020

One of the busiest and important railway stations in the Bhusawal division , the Nashik Road railway station has decided to uplift the passenger amenities and help in the overall development of the station. In a freewheeling interview with TOI’s Abhilash Botekar, the divisional railway manager, Vivek Kumar Gupta shares his thoughts on the future plans.

What are the immediate development plans for the Nashik Road station?

The Nashik Road station is one of the most important stations for the division – considering the footfall and the revenue earnings from it. Hence, we at Bhusawal division have decided to extend the foot-over bridge (FOB) to platform number 4 at Bhusawal-end and provide two more elevators at the station. One elevator will be attached to the new extension of FOB on PF 4 and another elevator has been sanctioned at the current booking office. This has been sanctioned to help the passengers access the FOB on PF 1, who otherwise have to go round about the booking office to get to the escalator.

How has the Union Budget helped Nashik and Bhusawal division on an overall basis?

The budget sanctioned 400 crores for the construction of road over bridges and 500 crores for improvement of signals in the division. Not only that, the budget has sanctioned good funds for the development of the 3rd and 4th line which is required to decongest the Manmad, Jalgaon, Bhusawal sections. They often witness huge train traffic coming from Northern, Western, Eastern, South Central, and Mumbai (Central) sides.

Will train connectivity to South India and Konkan improve?

As mentioned Bhusawal – Jalgaon – Manmad is the busiest sections on the Central Railway route. Upgradation of the system is being undertaken on war-footing in the region and the budget has made several provisions towards the same. This will take at least a couple of years to realise that the infrastructure is ready and hence starting a new train before that looks to be a difficult task. The private train operators running high-speed trains may have some other ideas and could introduce few on the routes.

How many high-speed trains will originate from the Bhusawal division?

At this point in time there are no private trains being planned from the Bhusawal division. But the division will have six high-speed trains passing through – as they will originate from Mumbai, Pune and Surat. Two trains from Mumbai will benefit Nashik, three from Pune will pass through Manmad and Bhusawal, while one train is expected from Surat passing through Bhusawal.

What are railways’ plans for harvesting solar energy?

The railways have decided to build roof-top solar power facilities at all the new railway station buildings. So the three stations of Dhule, Jamda and Shirud being constructed on Chalisgaon – Dhule link will have solar roof-top fittings as standard equipment. On the old buildings, we are taking it on case to case basis. Meanwhile, we have also decided to construct a solar power farm at the Traction Sub-Stations of Chalisgaon, Akola and Murtizapur as we have ample space along the tracks.

392,['10/02/2020'],19 Gadchiroli teachers booked for missing electoral duties,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: The Gadchiroli district administration has initiated action against 19 teachers of zilla parishad (ZP) schools and anganwadis in Aheri taluka under Representation of Peoples Act, 1950. Similar action for dereliction of electoral duties has also been initiated against some teachers of Buldhana district.

The offence, though a non-cognizable one, can lead to imprisonment of the teachers for not less than three months but which can extend to two years and also a fine. Aheri police, who registered the offence on February 6, would now seek permission of the court to investigate the case. The complaint was lodged by the naib tehsildar.

It’s learnt the teachers were part of 93 government employees assigned duties as Booth Level Officers (BLO). After a notification by the Election Commissioner of India, the work of Electoral Verification Programme (EVP) was initiated around a month-and-a-half ago. There was a meeting of the 93 BLOs at the office of the Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO). An ‘absolute list’ is prepared after the EVP is completed, with deletion of names, like those who died or left the place, or inclusion of new voters.

Sources said the teachers of Aheri taluka had together decided to protest the election duty, following which three meetings were held with them. A show cause notice was also served to the teachers for not joining the programme.

A source said the teachers tried to plead that ZP authorities were pressuring them to raise the level of education, with added workload. During the meetings, probationary IAS officer Rahul Gupta, Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) and tehsildar Omkar Otari tried to explain to the teachers that the duties under Election Commission of India cannot be ignored.

Collector Deepak Singla said the BLOs were still reluctant, and did not turn up for the assigned electoral duties.

Otari said no exemption was possible for these 19, and they are also given special annual remuneration for the work. “Apart from education department, other government employees are also involved, and compelled to work with additional responsibilities. Most of our work of electoral verification is over except that assigned to the teachers,” he said. “The teachers from other adjoining talukas too have attended duties,” he said.

Gadchiroli ZP CEO Vijay Rathod also said that departmental action may be initiated against the teachers after receiving a report from the SDM and tehsildar.

SDM (in-charge) Gupta said there is a Supreme Court guideline making electoral duties mandatory for government employees. “We had taken a liberal stand, and then also warned them, but finally had to take punitive action,” he said.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said, “We will seek guidance from the court to go ahead with the probe.”

PUNE: The Pune city police has dismissed as many as seven police constables in the first week of February for various reasons ranging from absenteeism, disrespect towards seniors and towards duty, among others.Additional commissioner of police (administration) Sanjay Shinde told TOI, “We have taken stern action against the policemen for violating several service codes and they have been dismissed from their services.”“We will not tolerate any indiscipline by the policemen. They will have to follow the rule books properly,” Shinde added.The senior officer said that one of the dismissed constables last reported to work three years ago. “We requested him to resume his job and sent a policeman to his house to inquire about his health. However, he did not report to work. We gave him sufficient time to resume duties but he failed to do so and then we decided to dismiss him from the service,” Shinde said.Similarly, a woman constable was in charge of the work of passport verification at a police station. While executing her duties, she demanded Rs 1,000 from an applicant to clear the passport verification process. “The passport applicant contacted senior police officers and it was decided to dismiss her,” Shinde said. According to the police, the woman constable had joined the city unit only about two years ago.A police naik has been dismissed from service for remaining absent for over two years. “When we called him to inquire about his absenteeism, he started abusing senior police officers. When police officers decided to call an inquiry against him, he issued threats to them. This behavior is not at all accepted,” Shinde said.A senior police officer said that police officer may remain absent, in some cases even for a long time, but they must provide a valid reason for their absenteeism. “If the reason is justifiable, he or she can resume their duties. The valid reasons include serious health issues, serious family issues, and others. However, the constable or police officers must follow some rules while on proceeding on leave. For instance, they are required to submit their health certificates duly signed by the appropriate medical officers,” the officer explained.Shinde said, “In many cases, it has been found that the police constables and officers do not follow proper ethics and decorum. They are also disrespectful towards their seniors by passing comments and abusing them.”The dismissed police constables can approach the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal against the orders issued by the city police seeking remedy against their dismissal.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053953,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-216803,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/seven-police-constables-dismissed-from-service/articleshow/74050923.cms

396,['10/02/2020'],Cong: Shivraj shielding lynching mastermind,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Bhopal: State Congress media coordinator, Narendra Saluja, on Sunday accused former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan of defending the alleged mastermind of Manawar lynching incident, Ramesh Junapani and said that a former chief minister defending a person, who led the lynching mob which killed a farmer and seriously injured five more, just because he happens to be his supporter is below his dignity.

He further said that Chauhan had tried to “shield” BJP leader, Devendra Tamrakar, also after he was accused of rape by a woman. Chouhan had gone to the extent of holding a public meeting at Ashok Nagar in his favour.

The two incidents in question clearly show that the BJP in MP stands with the criminals and not with the common people, which is “shameful”, he added.

Saluja further said Chauhan’s statement that Congress government in the state was “implicating” BJP leaders in all the major incidents of crimes to escape responsibility for deteriorating law & order situation was “childish and ridiculous” and the truth was quite the contrary.

He said whether it be incident of municipal council chairman Prahlad Badhwar’s murder or killing of VHP leader Yuvraj Singh in Mandsaur, local BJP leader Manish Bairagi and Bajrang Dal district convener Vikky Kausar were found involved in the two incidents respectively.

Similarly, Tarachand Rathore, who has links with the BJP, was found involved in the murder of BJP leader Manoj Thakre in Badwani.

Chauhan was very articulate in criticizing law & order situation in the state when BJP leader Himmat Patidar was apparently killed but it later turned out that Patidar had himself killed his servant to get the amount of insurance by fraud. BJP leaders were also found involved in the abduction ad killing of two siblings from Chitrakot town, he said.

He exhorted Chauhan to ascertain the facts about cases of major crimes before hurling charges on the Congress government in MP.

Former minister and BJP leader Vishwas Sarang while defending Chauhan said that video of the incident clearly shows that Junapani was trying to save the farmers after mob attacked them, he was not inciting them and he has only been implicated in the case because he is a BJP worker. What Chauhan has said is not wrong at all. The Congress government in the state has not been able to handle law & order situation in the state ad for “face saving”, it is framing BJP leaders in one case after another, which is highly objectionable and will be resisted not only by Chauhan but the BJP party as a whole.

Shivraj Singh Chauhan could not be contacted for comments.

397,['10/02/2020'],RTO registers a slump in orders for fancy numbers,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Pune: The special or choice registration numbers issued by the Pune regional transport office (RTO) has registered a drop between April and November 2019-20 as compared to the same period in the last two financial years.

Altogether 15,855 special choice numbers were issued between April and November in the current financial year, while 19,540 were issued in 2018-19, and 21,307 in 2017-18.

“It is difficult to pinpoint the reason for the drop in special/choice registration numbers issued between April and November. One reason could be that lesser number of vehicles was registered in the current fiscal. There is still two more months to go before the financial year ends and we are hopeful that the figures will rise,” deputy regional transport officer (RTO) Vinod Sagare told TOI.

The officials said that the vehicle registration figures from April to December were currently being compiled.

If one compares the month-to-month revenue earned by the RTO, the figures earned from the sale of special registration numbers in 2019-20 (barring May and November) have been less when compared to the last two fiscals. For example, the RTO earned a revenue of around Rs2 crore from the sale of these special registration numbers in May 2019-20.

During the same month in 2018-19 and 2017-18, the RTO earned Rs1.7 crore and Rs1.3 crore respectively. However, it garnered a revenue of Rs1.3 crore in June 2019-20. The RTO earned around Rs1.9 crore in 2018-19 and Rs1.9 crore in 2017-18.

“I wanted to get a number which reflected my date of birth. The RTO comes out with a series of special numbers almost every fortnight which are auctioned. However, the number which I wanted was not in the series. So, I approached the RTO to consider my case. I was told that there were four more people who wanted the same number and realised that the cost will be huge. So, I dropped the idea,” Ganesh Tambe, a resident of Kothrud told TOI.

Another buyer, who got a two-digit special registration number for his newly-bought SUV, said, “The number was in the series but there were many takers. I paid a big amount but made sure I got the number.”

An RTO official said people opt for special numbers due to various reasons. “For some, it is their guru, who has advised them to go for a certain number. Then, there are some who ha0ve dreamt about a number and hence they want it. There are those who choose numbers according to the birthdates of their children or wives,” he said.

399,['10/02/2020'],Congress targets govt over SC ruling on reservation in jobs,"This story is from February 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: Protesting against the Supreme Court order that reservation in jobs and promotions for SCs/STs were not a fundamental right, Congress accused the Modi government of inflicting a ""big damage"" to the key empowerment tool available to Dalits and asked BJP to clarify its stand on the verdict. BJP ally Lok Janshakti Party too said it did not agree with the Supreme Court ruling.

The opposition plans to take up the issue in Parliament on Monday, in what could turn proceedings stormy in the two Houses.

Disagreeing with the verdict, Congress member Mukul Wasnik said the Uttarakhand government told the court during the hearing that quotas were not a fundamental right and their implementation rested on the discretion of the state government. He added that counsels representing the state had occupied senior positions (in the Centre) while Uttarakhand was also ruled by BJP.

""Modi government should clarify if it believes that reservation for SCs/STs is a fundamental right or not, whether or not it is the constitutional duty of the government to provide quotas,"" he said at a press conference with Dalit functionary and former MP Udit Raj. ""What has happened is contradictory to the position BJP has been articulating in public,"" they said. ""Congress believes that reservations are the fundamental right of SC/ST. They can't be left to the government's discretion,"" they said.

Lok Janshakti Party demanded that the central government restore reservation as provided under the Constitution.

400,['10/02/2020'],NMC suspends women SHG’s contract in food poisoning case,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has suspended mid-day meal (MDM) contract given to women self-help group (SHG) Shagun Mahila Bachat Gat, Ramdaspeth, for 43 schools under it after 32 students of Marotrao Mude High School, Hudkeshwar, fell ill with food poisoning symptoms.

The NMC had given the contract of MDM for the government-aided private school. The civic body is likely to take further action against the SHG after receiving report from Foods and Drug Administration (FDA).

NMC education officer Priti Mishrikotkar issued a letter to the women SHG suspending its contract on Saturday. The same day she also issued a letter to The Akshaya Patra Foundation for suppling mid-day meal to all schools served by the SHG.

“The women SHG supplied MDM — 40kg rice and 20kg barbati curry — to Marotrao Mude High School at 12.30 noon on Friday. Students were served MDM at 2.30pm. Twenty-eight students between 3pm and 3.30pm, and four between 6pm and 7pm complained about loose motion, headache, stomach ache etc. Thirty-two students including 21 boys and 11 girls were immediately examined at a private clinic and then admitted at Government Medical College and Hospital. They are undergoing treatment. All students are stable and likely to be discharged on Monday morning,” Mishrikotkar said in a press release.

Mishrikotkar added FDA took samples of food and water at around 5pm on Friday and yet to submit report.

NMC official told TOI that out of 233 students, only 32 faced problems. “There were no complaints from other schools from where the SHG had supplied the same meal. We have not taken any permanent action against the SHG now and will wait for FDA’s report,” the official said.

Despite directives of home minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday and complaint lodged by RTE activist Shahid Sharif on Saturday, Hudkeshwar police has neither sent the food samples for testing nor took any action.

Senior PI RN Waghmare said, “We have preserved the food samples and will send it for chemical analysis on Monday as the FDA office was closed for weekend. Further decision will be taken after receiving reports from FDA,” he said.

Sharif said, “According to Juvenile Justice Act, it is mandatory on the authorities concerned to take action in such cases within 24 hours. It is a serious lapse on the part of authorities.”

401,['10/02/2020'],"96,000 white ration cards weeded out, final list today","This story is from February 10, 2020

Visakhapatnam: In a bid to end diversion and recycling of rice distributed through Public Distribution System ( PDS ), the government has decided to issue rice cards to BPL families.

About 19 lakh ration cards are expected to be weeded out from the existing list. The district administrations are gearing up for the distribution of new rice cards to eligible families.

In Visakhapatnam district, the Andhra Pradesh civil supplies department has eliminated 96,035 white ration cardholders. Nearly 60 per cent of the cards come under Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) limits, according to the officials. A re-survey will be conducted to cross-check the details soon before a final list is announced possibly on Monday.

According to the government, upon a study of the ration scheme in the last six months, it found that nearly 10 lakh cardholders were not drawing ration regularly. Moreover, many ration dealers were found resorting to malpractices by purchasing rice from cardholders and selling the same stock to millers.

“We carried out a survey to identify eligible families for disbursement of rice cards. The old concept of ration card is over now,” said civil supplies minister Kodali Srivenkateswara Rao (Nani).

These cards were eliminated by the government under YSR Navasakam— a scheme to identify beneficiaries of various welfare schemes.

As per the rules, the process is supposed to be completed by Sunday and fresh welfare cards like rice cards and Arogyasri cards will be issued by February 15 so as to make the cards effective from March.

Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam joint collector, who is also collector of civil supplies, L Shiva Shankar said, “We have eliminated the white ration cards as part of the government’s steps to issue rice cards under YSR Navasakam scheme. There will be no white ration or pink cards in future. Those who are below poverty line will be given the rice cards.

As part of the Navasakam scheme, surveyors went door-to-door to check the financial status of families and take their consent before eliminating their names from the list of white ration cardholders.

“A total of 96,035 white ration cards have been eliminated so far. We are now carrying out a resurvey. We will announce a final list possibly by Monday,” Shiva Shankar added.

Representative image

VISAKHAPATNAM: The district school education department has launched a 100-day action plan to boost the performance of students taking the Class 10 examinations this year. A lot is riding on the exams this year as these are the first class 10 exams after the introduction of several reform measures introduced this year.

Speaking to TOI, Prem Kumar, the deputy district education officer said that the department is organising mock tests at regular intervals to help students identify their weaknesses. “The action plan has been prepared on the basis of instructions from state government officials. Schools are being provided with model papers,” Kumar added.

Several changes were made to the examination pattern in course of the last year. The 20% internal marking system was scrapped and the state government also did away with objective-type questions. The internal marks system was removed after there were allegations of malpractice by some private institutions.

Additionally, the duration of the exam has been increased to 2 hours 45 minutes from the earlier 2 hours 30 minutes. The duration has been increased so that students use the first 10 minutes to develop a comprehensive understanding of the question paper and use the last five minutes to revise their answer script.

Elaborating on the action plan, deputy DEO Kumar said that students have been divided into several categories. “The action plan primarily focuses on slow learners. Tailor-made study material and reference books are being prepared and supplied to schools,” added Kumar.

M Venkata Rao, the Visakhapatnam district president and state treasurer of AP private un-aided school management said that students should note all changes introduced in the exams. “In the absence of objective-type questions, students should focus on concept-oriented learning instead of depending on question banks,” he said.

Nearly 2,100 students are going to take the class 10 examinations within GVMC limits. Officials of the civic body informed that students are being called in for additional study hours in the mornings and evenings.

403,['10/02/2020'],Haven’t paid fines on e-challans? Traffic cops may seize your bike,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Visakhapatnam: In case you have received more than six e-challans for violating traffic rules and have not bothered to pay the fine , then beware. The next time the city traffic police spot your vehicle on the road , it will be seized.

In a bid to ensure compliance, the traffic cops of the city have formed special teams who have been deputed across the city’s streets to check vehicles and verify if there are any pending e-challans against them. The cops are armed with apps on their smartphones and will seize the vehicle in case there are more than six pending challans issued against it.

Speaking to TOI, M Ramesh Kumar (ADCP traffic) said that fines have been collected for only 30 per cent of the total number of e-challans issued. “Since many traffic violators are delaying payment of fines, we have formed special teams to collect the dues. The city police are yet to receive fines against more than six lakh challans.”

Over 3 lakh e-challans have been issued over the last year. These challans have been issued by identifying rule violators by taking their pictures on phones and using closed-circuit cameras. Once someone is caught violating a traffic rule, the owner of the vehicle receives an e-challan on their phone through an app linked to the road transport authority (RTA) server.

According to ACP (traffic) MRK Raju, many motorists have not provided their phone numbers to the RTA, or have not updated them. Consequently, they do not receive alerts for the e-challans issued against them.

“We appeal to motorists to know about the e-challans pending against them by looking up their vehicle numbers in the e-challan mobile apps and other websites and clear their dues,” added Raju.

City police commissioner RK Meena said that despite the presence of traffic police at junctions, motorists— especially youngsters are violating traffic rules by jumping signals, riding without helmets or riding without documents.

“Our teams are going to nab all those violators who have failed to pay the dues by intercepting vehicles and entering their vehicle numbers in the app,” Meena added.

Police sources said that special teams set up for the job has managed to collect pending fines from over 2,000 motorists per day since the drive began around a week ago.

Visakhapatnam: The Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) has urged the state government to not allow private buses to ply in the city. RKVS Kumar, CITU president said that zonal officials of APSRTC and the corporation’s regional manager recently met owners of private buses to operate buses in the city. He said that CITU objects to the move in the interest of poorer sections of society.

Kumar further said that some buses in route number 20A that runs between HB Colony and Old Post Office has been withdrawn. “This is forcing the people to use private transport. The government must run public transport keeping in mind the lessons learnt in New Delhi,” he added.

He added that private services are not only a financial burden on people but are also harmful from the perspective of road safety.

MUMBAI: After dismantling the girders for British-era Frere Road overbridge , the Western Railway announced on Sunday that it had decided to expedite rebuilding of this ROB and inaugurate it a month before the stipulated deadline of July 16. The primary reason is that the closure of this ROB, situated between Grant Road and Charni Road , has led to numerous traffic snarls in the area.

A senior WR official said, ""We got all the paperwork done and the sanctions were in place for all stages of the project before the dismantling work had commenced in January. We have also approved the design for the new girders which are being fabricated at our workshop. Work is on in full swing and we expect the new girders to arrive in a month.""

The official admitted the closure of the old ROB had inconvenienced scores of motorists. The WR has informed the BMC to speed up its work on the approach roads to the ROB so that this gets completed simulataneously to avoid delays.

The final bridge will have four lanes with a divider (which was not present in the old structure) to regulate the flow of traffic in both directions. When contacted, WR chief spokesperson Ravinder Bhakar said the dismantling work was a tedious and lengthy process. ""Around 220 metric tonnes of steel and a 350sq m slab was removed within just 24 days.""

Visakhapatnam: British couple Pat and Alan Braithwaite were in the city recently as part of a 5,600-km-long Trans-India Challenge. Travelling in their yellow-and-black Morgan three-wheeler Queen Bee, the 34 day journey by the couple from Suffolk will raise funds for the NGO Goonj’s initiative to empower rural communities and contribute to a ‘circular economy’.

The couple departed from Mumbai on February 1, and has since visited Pune, Solapur, Hyderabad, Khammam and Rajamundry and will next head north towards Kolkata.

Queen Bee arrived in the city with around 1,200 km of the road trip complete. The journey, however, was not smooth throughout. The specially-designed suspension on the vehicle was put to test after leaving Khammam and crossing over into Andhra Pradesh, but after running checks on arrival in Rajahmundry, Queen Bee was declared in perfect health to continue to Vizag . Along the way, the car and husband and wife Alan and Pat have been greeted with smiles, waves and requests for selfies. Traffic has often come to a standstill as motorists and pedestrians stopped to photograph Queen Bee.

Alan (73), an entrepreneur, said, “The roads have generally been good and India’s drivers have been very supportive towards us. However, day six threw up some surprises and the road quality, combined with the heat, made it an unexpectedly difficult day. But no one expected this to be easy.”

Adding that cars such as Queen Bee are a rare sight on India’s roads, he said, “I have a deep connection with India. My grandmother is from Mysore and my grandparents were married in Mumbai. My mother is from Belgaum and my parents got married in Shimla. India is very close to my heart and I adore it. This is my third visit to India but this adventurous ride which is the first one makes it more special and meaningful.”

Pat (73) said, “Our drive on the 30-km-long coastal stretch of Visakhapatnam was amazing and we loved the journey. We also had a great experience while interacting with the students of Gitam University.” The couple added that they are partnering with Goonj to raise awareness about the organisation in and outside India and to help fund its projects on the circular economy.

Speaking about the Trans-India Challenge, British deputy high commissioner Andrew Fleming said on a visit to the Port City, “We are glad to welcome Alan Braithwaite to the region. Undertaking this ambitious initiative so soon after a major heart operation is an example to many. There is huge potential to leverage the circular economy to new levels for the benefit of India’s rural communities.”

MUMBAI: A magistrate court recently directed the police to conduct an inquiry and submit a report after a 21-year-old acid attack survivor accused a plastic surgeon from a reputed South Mumbai hospital of cheating her.

The woman alleged that the doctor had taken Rs 2 lakh that she had managed to get through a crowdfunding initiative and refused to return it even when the surgery had not been performed.

The woman said she had refused to undergo the scheduled surgery as the doctor had allowed a film crew to cover it as part of its documentary without obtaining her consent. She also said despite repeated requests, the doctor had refused to return the money.

Advocate Swapana Kode , who submitted the complaint, said, “Since the police was not taking action, we approached the court. The court has now directed officials of the Azad Maidan police station to submit a report. The money was raised through a campaign by an NGO and siphoning it amounts to breach of trust.”

The survivor’s estranged brother-in-law is accused of orchestrating the acid attack on her in 2014.

The survivor told the court when she had visited the doctor with her brother the doctor allegedly threatened them with dire consequences if they visited again. The survivor added it was also brought to her notice that without taking her consent, the doctor had posted her pictures on various social media sites. The survivor’s plea says she continues to remain untreated.

Visakhapatnam: Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has identified 1,713 polling stations for the upcoming elections to civic bodies.

While Zone-IV and Zone-V will have the most number of polling stations--376 each while Bheemili zone will have the least number of stations-- 54.

GVMC has identified 17.51 lakh voters in the city--8.79 lakh male and 8.71 lakh female voters--based on the voter lists provided by the State Election Commission. Voters belonging to backward communities form a lion’s share of the electorate--9.3 lakh voters.

GVMC is expected to finalise ward-wise reservations based on the number of voters belonging SC/ST/BC and women’s categories in the next few days. GVMC is currently waiting for guidelines from the government to finalise the reservations.

After the government fixed reservations for various categories in local body elections at 59%, a writ petition was filed against the government that the reservations should be capped at 50%.

If the government continues with the 50% reservations, 27% seats in GVMC will be reserved for the Backward Classes, 15% for the Scheduled Castes and 7.5% for the Scheduled Tribes.

Earlier in January, the government had fixed the number of wards in GVMC at 98. Later, it was also published in the extra-ordinary issue of the Andhra Pradesh Gazette.

Bracing for the elections, GVMC has been repurposing a portion on the third floor near the engineering block of the GVMC office into a new council hall to facilitate council meetings. The civic body is spending Rs 2.5 crore on the new council hall. The new council hall will house 120 members, including 98 corporators, city MLAs, MPs, co-option members, etc. The benches are spread into two rows in the council hall with each bench having a seating capacity of three members.

Tirupati: Even as opposition parties have come out against the state government’s proposal to shift the capital from Amaravati, YSR Congress (YSRC) Hindupur MP Gorantla Madhav has appealed to the chief minister to consider establishing the capital in the Rayalaseema region.

The MP said decentralised development was necessary to build Andhra Pradesh into a formidable state and appealed to YS Jaganmohan Reddy to consider Rayalaseema as the effects of under-development have impoverished people in the region.

Addressing a press conference in Anantapur district on Sunday, the former-cop-turned politician said Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N Chandrababu Naidu was trying to mislead people as well as industry on KIA motors relocating its Anantapur plant.

Madhav alleged that the TDP president was behind the fake report that KIA motors was engaging in talks with the Tamil Nadu government in order to move out its manufacturing unit from Anantapur. TDP MPs had also attempted to mislead Parliament on the issue, Madhav said, and added that he had tried to stall the spread of misinformation.

“Despite the Andhra Pradesh government and KIA Motors categorically denying any such development, the former chief minister held a press conference and continued to spread lies that KIA Motors plans to move its plant to Tamil Nadu. Chandrababu Naidu is attempting to defame the government,” the Hindupur MP said.

Stating that the YSRC-led government was working for the welfare and industrial progress of the state, Madhav demanded the TDP chief apologise for claiming KIA Motors would be shifting its plant.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Police sub-inspector Deepanshu Rathi, who killed his colleague and former girlfriend Preeti Ahlawat before shooting himself on Friday night, had begun obsessively stalking her, suspecting that she was in a relationship with another colleague, police probe reveals.Rathi, 27, and Ahlawat, 26, were batchmates during police training and were set to get married. But Ahlawat called off the wedding in December when Rathi’s possessive attitude and his constant messages took a toll on her, police said. Rathi later accused her of having an affair with a batchmate and began tracking her.Probe revealed that for the last few weeks, Rathi was planning to take revenge.Investigations revealed that Rathi’s name was saved as ‘Wikipedia’ on the woman’s phone. Rathi had recently got to know about Ahlawat’s friendship with another SI of their batch, identified as Rohit Tomar, which was disturbing him. “Tomar and Ahlawat were just friends but this did not go down well with Rathi. He started trailing her and saw the two interacting. So, he started following her even more. Tomar’s name on Ahlawat’s phone was saved as ‘Rays’,” said an officer privy to the investigation said.On Sunday afternoon, Ahlawat’s body was handed over to the family after a post-mortem examination. The preliminary report revealed that she sustained a single gunshot wound and the bullet was stuck in her head. Police had recovered three empty cartridges from the location where she was murdered.Ahlawat’s elder brother reached Delhi from New Zealand on Sunday morning and could not hold back his tears.The WhatsApp group of the 2018 batch where Rathi used to forwarded pictures of Ahlawat walking out of metro stations and moving around, had only male members.Police officers said Rathi and Ahlawat had started dating in June 2019 and the last communication between the two was on January 3 this year. “We have sent her mobile phone for forensic examination to check if any messages or chats have been deleted. She had also blocked him so we need to check if he was trying to contact her through another number. His last messages to her said he wanted to meet her. In other messages, he asked her to leave her job and wanted to know where she was. Ahlawat’s response to his request to meet was a ‘no’,” an officer privy to the investigation said.Ahlawat’s elder sister told police that she decided to call off the wedding as she was sick of his possessive behaviour. Rathi’s family had also tried to counsel him so that he moved on in his life. Both the families had even started looking for other prospects for their children.In Video: Delhi: Woman cop shot dead by her batchmate",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053261,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-189639,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-stalker-cop-case-sub-inspector-suspected-victim-was-having-affair/articleshow/74053165.cms

NOIDA: Two years after six unauthorised internet service providers were busted in Uttar Pradesh as part of a SIM box fraud across NCR, the crime branch of Mumbai police raided a telecom exchange in Noida.

The search was conducted last Thursday after links were found between the Noida telecom exchange and the one in Kerala , from where international calls were being made using VoIP (voice over internet protocol) technology. The VoIP exchanges were being used by callers suspected to be linked to Pakistani spy agency ISI to gather information about important defence installations, PTI reports.

While one person was arrested from Kerala’s Changaramkulam, equipment such as SIM boxes with multiple SIM cards, hard disc, VoIP adapter and some documents were seized from the office in Noida Sector 3.

SIM boxes are used to route VoIP calls made from a foreign location but the number that flashes on the receiver’s phone is Indian. According to officials, the alleged fraud came to light in January, when they received information that a landline number based in Mumbai had received an internet call from Saudi Arabia . However, this call had evaded the local telecom operator and was passed off as an Indian number.

According to defence sources, defence personnel in September last year had received calls seeking information related to important defence installations, PTI reports. The involvement of ISI was suspected, sources said, adding that investigation revealed illegal VoIP exchanges in Noida and Kerala which routed incoming calls from Pakistan to local numbers.

The Mumbai crime branch found as many as 20 IMEI numbers of various service providers were being used from a single device.

Visakhapatnam: The Chhattisgarh government is likely to adopt AP’s schemes for kidney patients in its Supebeda region.

A team from Chhattisgarh recently visited Uddanam in Srikakulam district where nearly 13,000 patients from 177 villages are benefitting from the state government’s support system.

Local area hospital superintendent Dr E Lakshminarayana said the Chhattisgarh government had written to the Centre, requesting remedial actions for kidney patients in their state. The Centre then suggested to approach AP.

Massive inventory makes luxe rentals go for discount

MUMBAI: Investors who bought luxury apartments, hoping property prices would appreciate and they would earn fabulous rents, now face a harsh reality. Not only have prices stagnated or dropped, but rental incomes from such flats are low.A glut of high-end apartments, mainly in central Mumbai, has left tenants with a wide choice of properties to choose from. As a result, rents for large apartments have crashed by 20%, and in some cases up to 30% and more.In new buildings, high outgoings and maintenance charges, added with tax on rental income, have left owners with little in hand. A developer cited the example of a Rs 5-crore apartment, which currently fetches a rent of Rs 1 lakh a month. “But after deducting the outgoings and 22% tax on rental income, the owner gets a measly Rs 56,000 in hand. The yield is barely over 1% annually on such an expensive property,” he said.“It’s true. Home owners who have leased big apartments are left with little in hand,” said Pranay Vakil, chairman of Praron Consultancy.To create demand for rental housing, leading developers have set up separate cells within their organisations to cater to leave-and-licence demand for flats bought by their investors. They have even drawn up standard agreements that can be quickly signed by someone who wants to move in quickly, saving on expenses on lawyers.A property broker from central Mumbai said a lot of supply has come into the market in this area, which has also affected the older gated communities. According to him, property prices in the area have come down by 20%.Owners, discouraged from selling, prefer to give a flat on rent. “For a Rs 4-crore apartment in central Mumbai, that earlier would fetch Rs 1.5 lakh a month, today commands a little over a lakh a month—a 33% drop,” he said.The rate of rental return doesn’t change much with area or property type. The broker said a 5BHK flat worth Rs 20 crore in a new project in Worli fetches the owner a monthly rental of Rs 4.5 lakh. “But, after deducting taxes and outgoings, he gets barely Rs 2 lakh in hand a month,” he said.A property consultant operating in the western suburbs said deluxe 4 and 5BHK apartments in Bandra-Khar once commanded rentals of Rs 5-7 lakh a month. These are now down in the region of Rs 3.3 lakh a month. “However, 1-2BHK flats are in demand and their owners are earning good rentals (as a proportion of costs) in Bandra-Khar,” he said.The rental market has been under pressure for the past two or three years, said Pankaj Kapoor of Liases Foras, a real estate data and analytics firm. “Rental supply has increased and a huge inventory is available, but bigger flats are going at a discounted rate,” he said. From Lower Parel to Bandra, large flats are lying empty and owners are compelled to rent them out at cheaper rates, said Kapoor.Ritesh Mehta, senior director and head of residential services (development initiatives) at JLL India, said the residential leasing market in Mumbai has predominantly remained stagnant for two years at most locations.“A few exceptions have been locations closer to work and commercial hubs: BKC, Goregaon, Lower Parel and Airoli have seen escalation of rentals by 3-5% year on year. Average rentals in Mumbai have been 1.7-2% of the capital value of a property.”While owners rue investing in what has turned out to be a bad rental market for them, the situation couldn’t possibly be better for tenants. In this zero-sum game, the rentier’s loss is the renter’s gain.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053290,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-447254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-depressed-rentals-high-civic-taxes-hit-luxe-flat-investors/articleshow/74053217.cms

THANE: A project of the metro rail network meant internally for Thane city has possibly been scrapped, said a senior official of the Thane civic body. The metro project is likely to be replaced by a high-speed tram, also known as light urban rail transit system.

The high-speed tram runs at a speed of 60 km per hour as against the old trams which trundle along at 15 km an hour.

“The reason that this decision has been taken is that the high-speed tram entails less capital expenditure as compared to the metro rail, said the official.

KOLKATA: The office of enemy properties in Bengal — the custodian of 2,764 properties in the state — has started making a list of properties free of legal encumbrances, so that the first lot could be put up for sale.

“Enemy properties” are defined as those left behind by people who migrated to Pakistan (after the 1965 and 1971 wars) and China (following the Sino-Indian war of 1962), to take citizenship of those countries.

In 2017, the Centre amended the Enemy Property Act, 1968, and Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971. It was decided that heirs of those who left India after 1962, 1965, and 1971 cannot claim ownership of these (enemy) properties.

Late last month, Union home minister Amit Shah set up a panel to auction more than 9,400 enemy properties across India, which is likely to fetch around Rs 1 lakh crore to the exchequer.

Following this, the Custodian of Enemy Property for India started working on a pilot auction in Bengal to assess the nature of the properties to be auctioned and prepare a legal report before the first lot is put up for sale.

Last year, the Centre allowed state governments to use some enemy properties for public utilities.

“The first step in the pilot project is to free up a property and to divest it under Section 18 of the Enemy Property Act,” an official with the Custodian of Enemy Property for India said.

“One wing of the department is busy making the properties free of encumbrances,” he said.

As of now, most enemy properties in Bengal are rented out to corporates or individuals, with the custodian office collecting rent. Maintenance of the properties is sometimes challenging, as the tenant cannot change the nature of the property.

“A large chunk of these properties is in districts like Malda and Murshidabad. There are certain iconic buildings in Kolkata, too, that are used for commercial purposes,” the official said.

Kolkata: The West Bengal governor on Sunday once again expressed his anguish over the law and order situation in the state. How can there be free and non-violent polls when explosives are being traded freely in the state, Jagdeep Dhankhar told reporters in the city.

Bengal is well-known for its culture, music and scholars and has the highest number of Nobel laureates in the country, but how can it also be a “hub of violence”, he said.

“Blasts can be anywhere in Bengal. My heart aches as it causes loss to people. We have to focus on it,” Dhankhar said.

Rebutting the charge, Trinamool Congress secretary general Partha Chatterjee said Dhankhar should have continued as a politician for a longer period instead of becoming Bengal governor. “Now, we do not have to give rejoinders to political leaders such as Dilip Ghosh; instead, we have to reply to Raj Bhavan,” Chatterjee said.

Chatterjee, the state parliamentary affairs minister, also criticised BJP Bengal president Ghosh for saying on social media that on Sunday he visited the Tirupati Balaji temple and prayed for the state’s prosperity, peace and ‘parivartan’.

Ghosh should first visit temples of Bengal, Chatterjee said and added that “people of Bengal have faith in Mamata Banerjee”.

430,['10/02/2020'],Chennai Airport: Consultant to maintain Chennai airport facade soon,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Chennai airport

CHENNAI: With summer approaching, Airports Authority of India (AAI) is drawing up plans to ensure that there are fewer incidents of the glass panel breaking at the Chennai airport .

The authority is looking at a consultant to do an audit and maintain the facade of the steel and glass terminals of the airport. The agency will check if the fixtures are good and whether they can withstand strong winds and squalls or thunderstorms, and to ensure that the air conditioning maintains the correct temperature so that the difference between temperatures — inside and outside the airport — do not break the glass. The terminals were opened in 2013.

A senior official said contracts would be awarded soon. Two agencies will look at the audit and the air conditioning. The work is part of the maintenance being planned for the building.

An AAI official said the steel and glass terminals withstood Cyclone Vardah in 2016 but the consultancy is required to ensure that the glass and the roofing will be strong enough to handle the changes in temperature.

“The glass facade was new to the city’s airport. Initially there were too many incidents of panels breaking because of impurities in the glass and also because the air conditioning was not consistent to balance the temperature within the terminal,” he added.

AAI has reduced the damage to glass panels after a thorough audit which found out the weak points. The air conditioning system was also improved to ensure temperature in the interior of the terminals synced with the exterior weather.

Learning from the experience, AAI has decided to go with a less glass intense design for the new integrated terminal that is being constructed in the space between the international and domestic terminal.

431,['10/02/2020'],"Gurugram: Kids in other room, BJP neta shot by husband with his service revolver","This story is from February 10, 2020

The couple (inset) lived in a rented accommodation in Sector 93

GURUGRAM: A former Armyman, working as a security officer with a private firm, allegedly shot dead his wife — the state secretary of BJP Kisan Morcha in Haryana — on Saturday over suspicion of infidelity. He, along with two other people, has been booked and is on the run.

The couple, Munesh and Sunil Godara, lived with their two children — a son studying in Class 10 and a daughter studying in Class 7 — and Sunil’s father Dalip Singh in an eighth-floor rented house at The Spaze Privy in Sector 93. Police said around 9.30pm on Saturday, Munesh was working in the kitchen and speaking to her sister on the phone when Sunil told her he wanted a word with her.

“They would often fight because Sunil suspected she had an affair with another man, Bunty Gujjar,” said Dalip Singh.

On Saturday again, as the argument escalated, Sunil whipped out his service revolver and shot Munesh, according to Dalip’s police complaint. Both the children and Dalip were home at the time. Revolver in hand, Sunil fled and threatened the guards on his way out, it added. The security guards, who later told police that he was inebriated, called cops and a team of Sector 10 police reached the spot. Sunil had driven off by then.

Explaining how Sunil possessed the weapon, police said he had been engaged as a private security officer after being forced to take voluntary retirement from the Army because of his conduct.

Based on Dalip’s complaint accusing Sunil, Bunty Gujjar and his wife Anu, an FIR was registered for murder, acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention and sections of the Arms Act. “We have formed two teams for the investigation,” said Sanjay, station house officer of the Sector 10 police station.

Sunil and his family hailed from Charkhi Dadri. He got married to Munesh in 2001 but those close to the family said their relationship had always been strained. Fights over Bunty Gujjar, especially, had taken a toll, they said.

Munesh’s family, however, dismissed the speculation. “My sister had never been happy in the marriage. Claims about her affairs are just rumours,” Munesh’s brother Sunil Jhakkar said, adding — as what he thought was the marker of a good wife — that she never stepped out of the house without her brother or husband.

LUCKNOW: The Lucknow police on Sunday arrested Sheikh Tahir Siddiqui of Bahujan Muslim Mahasabha, a local outfit, on charges of inciting mobs ahead of a mass mobilization programme against the amended citizenship law at Lucknow’s own Shaheen Bagh , the Husainabad Clock Tower.

Thakurganj police said Siddiqui was instrumental in mobilizing people for the “Ghantaghar Chalo” campaign during his visit to the protest site on Saturday. Siddiqui was also booked for vandalizing property and hurling bombs at Satkhanda police outpost during the December 19 protests in the city.

Ten others were also detained on charges of fomenting trouble. At least 50 people have been arrested so far for holding protests at the Clock Tower since January 17.

The Lucknow police on Sunday also slapped notices on 10 people, including prominent social activists Sandeep Pandey, Mohammed Shoaib, retired IPS officer SR Darapuri, Shia clerics Kalbe Sibten Noori and Saif Abbas, and former Lucknow University vice-chancellor Roop Rehka Verma to stop them from participating in the campaign.

The notices were served under Section 144 of CrPC, which prohibits assembly of five people without the permission of the police commissioner.

Durga Prasad Tiwari, assistant commissioner of police, Chowk, said a team was keeping an eye on Siddiqui’s movements. “We have footage of Siddiqui inciting mobs to participate in anti-CAA protest at the Ghantaghar while raising anti-India slogans,” Tiwari said.

According to the Met department, the air quality saw a dip after the minimum temperature declined to 7 degrees Celsius. The air quality also deteriorated to ‘poor’ level in other cities of Delhi-NCR. On Sunday, Delhi recorded the AQI at 285 (poor), Ghaziabad 295 (poor), Greater Noida 276 (very poor), Faridabad 266 (poor) and Noida 290 (poor).

According to the Met department, the maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to remain the same on Monday. “There is a forecast of fog or mist in the morning and later mainly clear sky on Monday. While the maximum temperature is expected to be at 21 degrees Celsius, the minimum temperature will be 7 degrees Celsius,” said a Met official.

The maximum temperature, which was recorded at 21 degrees Celsius on Saturday, remained the same on Sunday as well. The minimum temperature, on the other hand, was recorded at 7 degrees Celsius on Sunday, one notch below what it was on Saturday. As per SAFAR’s forecast, the AQI is likely to see slight improvement but will be in the ‘poor’ level, between 225 (poor) and 256 (poor), in the next 48 hours.

Meanwhile, Delhi’s maximum and minimum temperature is set to rise by 3-4 degrees over the next 72 hours owing to an approaching western disturbance.

The Met department said it will lead to a rise in mercury across the plains.

AGRA: Aligarh district administration has decided to seize surety bonds of Rs 1 lakh each of four Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students, which they had signed prior to December 15 violence on the campus.

Confirming this, additional city magistrate Ranjit Singh said on Sunday that the surety bonds, under Section 107 of CrPC were signed by the four students, including two former students, assuring the administration that they would maintain peace in the city. However, they were allegedly found to be involved in the December 15 violence on the campus that left several persons, including students, injured.

Singh said while two of the ex-students are former secretary of the students’ union Huzaifa Amir and former vice-president of students’ union Hamza Sufiyan, research scholar Salman Imtiaz, who is also the former president of students’ union, and, Moinuddin, a postgraduate student, are still pursuing their studies.

Salman Imtiaz confirmed that the bond was signed by him along with other students on August 1 after a ruckus at VC’s office over the administration’s decision to take disciplinary action against three students in two separate incidents.

Besides, 44 other persons, linked to the AMU, have also been identified by the administration for serving notices for disrupting peace in the city, said Singh. He told TOI that the university administration has been asked to provide their addresses but no response has been received despite sending a reminder to them.

When contacted, AMU proctor Wasim Ali said that there is no evidence to show that they are AMU students . “On the basis of names, how can we confirm that these are the same persons identified by the administration,” he said.

436,['10/02/2020'],ED challenges Ratul Puri’s bail in Delhi HC,"This story is from February 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: The enforcement directorate (ED) has challenged in the Delhi high court the bail granted to businessman Ratul Puri , nephew of Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath , in a money laundering case related to a bank loan fraud. The plea is listed for hearing before Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar on Monday.

ED challenged a trial court’s December 13, 2019, order by which Puri was given bail on a personal bond of Rs 5 lakh with two sureties of the like amount. He was earlier granted bail in the AgustaWestland chopper deal case.

Giving Puri relief, the trial court had directed him to not leave the country without its prior permission and to join the probe as and when called for. He was also asked by the court to not influence the prosecution witnesses or tamper with the evidence in any manner.

“Multiple raids have been conducted by different investigating agencies at the residential as well as official premises of Puri. In fact, the entire record of the accused company (Moser Baer) is in the custody of the official liquidator. Thus, the apprehension of the probe agency that the applicant would tamper with the evidence appears to be far-fetched,” the court had observed while granting the relief.

Opposing this line, ED has contended the trial court erred in holding that the agency's apprehension about Puri tampering with evidence was far-fetched.

“The relevant records/documents are not available with the official liquidator and are, in fact, now accessible to the respondent (Puri) and vulnerable to tampering,” it said and sought setting aside of the trial court's bail order.

ED had in November last year filed a chargesheet against Puri and his company Moser Baer.

It had arrested Puri on August 20 last year in the loan fraud case, which emerged from a CBI FIR. Puri was also arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the bank fraud case after he appeared before the central probe agency in the VVIP chopper scam.

The court had on December 2 last year granted bail to Puri in the AgustaWestland money laundering case while directing him to not “tamper with evidence” or “try to contact or influence the witnesses”.

437,['10/02/2020'],Coronavirus in Chennai: Promises of coronavirus cure give Tamil Nadu headache,"Passenger arriving at Chennai airport wearing mask

CHENNAI: Thousands of people are screened every day at airports for symptoms of novel coronavirus -- fever, cold and breathing difficulty — and hundreds are put on mandatory 28-day domiciliary quarantine to prevent its spread. But a bigger threat are posters promising cure for nCoV with traditional medicines put up by clinics across the state.Homeopaths claim that Arsenicum album 30C — a solution prepared by diluting aqueous arsenic trioxide generally until there is little or no arsenic remaining in the solution — can prevent nCoV, and in combination with other drugs can treat symptoms in infected people. Unani and ayurveda experts also claim that a cocktail of oils and herbs can offer preventive therapy and treatment.“The Union ministry has put out a press release stating how AYUSH can prevent and cure the viral disease,” said a Chennai-based homeopath. His clinic has posters promising prevention and cure.Last week, another Chennai-based Siddha practitioner said that he has found a herbal cure to the virus. Some others in districts have even volunteered to help patients in China and other affected countries with traditional siddha and ayurveda medicines.State health minister C Vijaya Baskar says none of these claims are scientifically proven. “As of now there is no known cure for the novel strain of coronavirus,” he said. It has hit more than 25,000 people and killed a little more than 2% of the affected patients.Doctors who have been treating patients infected with the novel strain say they are using a combination of antiviral drugs used to treat HIV. “If AYUSH practitioners have curative drugs, they must approach the government. It has to be tested before it is given as treatment,” he said.Although the state did not criticise or protest the centre’s press release, it asked the Commissionerate of Indian Medicine and Homeopathy to book cases against doctors making false promises and seal clinics. “We have raided at least three clinics in the last one week. We have asked AYUSH doctors’ bodies also to ensure there is no promise of cure,” said Indian medicine commissioner K Ganesan.Meanwhile, day after issuing two press releases claiming treatment and cure, AYUSH ministry said these streams had preventive medications that boost body’s immune systems and the release was an advisory to insist on hand hygiene. However, AYUSH practitioners say the regimen could help ease symptoms such as swelling in the lungs, with fewer side effects. “As of now, there is no clinical proof that the roots of various plants or herbs can help combat the deadly disease.“We don’t want practitioners to offer such therapy. Anyone withs travel history and symptoms should approach government hospitals,” said health secretary Beela Rajesh.“We have also recommended that people should avoid travelling to affected countries on business or leisure,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74053441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-505622,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/promises-of-coronavirus-cure-give-tamil-nadu-headache/articleshow/74053430.cms

Yogi Adityanath

GORAKHPUR: In a key decision to tackle unemployment by equipping youths with skills and work experience, chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced an internship programme in which students from Class 10 to graduation will get to work with technical institutes and industries for six months to a year and will be paid a stipend of Rs 2,500 per month.

The Centre will contribute Rs 1,500 of the honorarium while the state will provide Rs 1,000, Yogi said after inaugurating the Rozgar Mela (employment fair) at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University.

""The internship scheme will be launched this year. Under this scheme, youths studying in 10th, 12th or graduation will be linked to various technical institutes and industries. Government will also assist in placement of youths on completion of internship through an HR cell, which would be set up soon,"" he added.

The scheme is in sharp contrast to the unemployment allowance of previous Samajwadi Party government wherein jobless youth, aged between 25 to 40 years, having family annual income less than Rs 36,000 were given a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000.

Yogi said the government has also decided to ensure compulsory recruitment of at least 20% girls in state police. The CM claimed UP was the first state in country which was successful in giving government jobs to more than 2.5 lakh youth within three years. The investment of more than Rs 2.5 lakh crore through Investors Summit also created employment opportunities for 35 lakh youth, he said.“Through department of labour and employment exchange, we have done three times more work in just three years than previous governments in five years,” he added.The state government will opening ITI and skill development centre in each tehsil to equip youth with skills to increase employability, the CM said.Our government ended interviews for non-gazetted posts of IV, III and II class in state to curb corruption and ensure transparency in recruitment, Yogi added.

The CM said Defence Expo 2020 in Lucknow was a huge success and will open the doors for creation of jobs in the state.

Ireland’s election is hanging in the balance after a surge in the left-wing Sinn Fein party’s support upended the nation’s traditional twoparty power structure. Irish politicians are now facing messy talks over the creation of a new government.

Counting began on Sunday, after an exit poll showed a virtual dead heat between Irish PM Leo Varadkar ’s centrist Fine Gael party, its centrist rival Fianna Fail, and Sinn Fein in Saturday’s election. On Sunday, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail ruled out governing with Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the IRA, which presented itself as a left-wing alternative to the centrist consensus.

The election represents a “seismic” shift in Irish politics, Sinn Fein’s housing spokesman Eoin O’Broin tweeted, with Fine Gael and Fianna Fail facing an unprecedented threat to their stranglehold on power. An exit poll indicated Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein all got about 22% of first preference votes. The survey was conducted by pollster Ipsos MRBI for public broadcaster RTE, and Irish Times newspaper. In the 2016 election,Sinn Fein won 14% of the vote.

A Simorgh, or “Phoenix”, rocket couldn’t put the Zafar 1 communications satellite into orbit due to a low speed. “Stage-1 and stage-2 motors of the carrier functioned properly but it didn’t reach the required speed,” a defence ministry space programme spokesman said.

Sunday’s failure came after two failed launches of the Payam and Doosti satellites last year, as well as a launchpad rocket explosion in August.

(Representative image)

BENGALURU: With the proposed taxation on dividends, real estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) fear this would put the potential pipeline to raise Rs 1.14 lakh crore through these platforms at risk as investors and promoters consider overseas jurisdictions.

REITs and InvITs — which have attracted top global investors like Blackstone, KKR, Singapore’s GIC, CPPIB, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Brookfield — are mandated by Sebi to distribute 90% of their cash flows as dividends which significantly increases the tax burden of investors.

This week, investors and developers told TOI they met officials in the financial ministry to remove this double taxation, which will increase the total tax outgo by over 60-65% for both domestic and foreign investors, making India less competitive as compared to markets like Singapore.

“The government is taxing the annuity income of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) created. Now on that taxed income, the SPVs distribute returns to unit holders and investors and if that is taxed as well, it’s creating a double layer of taxation. Investors would then prefer putting their money in other instruments offering higher returns,” said Bobby Parikh of tax advisory firm Bobby Parikh Associates.

Since introduction, this asset class has already raised Rs 26,600 crore and several in the pipeline include government-sponsored InvITs for National Highway Authority (NHAI), Gas Authority of India (GAIL) and Power Grid Corp . Embassy Office Parks was the first REIT listed last year after which several others, including one from K Raheja is in the works to raise about Rs 3,750 crore.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman (File photo: ANI)

KOLKATA: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday put the onus of bringing petroleum products under the ambit of GST on states.

While addressing the media after a post-Budget meeting with industry representatives, the finance minister said states and the GST Council have to decide when they will bring this under GST. “No amendment (to the law) will be required. Whenever the states decide to bring this under the new regime, it can be done.”

Sitharaman also indicated that the government has “literally” proposed to the GST Council to consider a situation, where tax rates rationalisation can take place once a year.

Her comments come in the backdrop of frequent changes in rates ever since the new regime kicked in over two years ago and indicated that the Centre was keen on bringing about stability at a time when collections have remained lower than the target.

Sitharaman also said the finance ministry was “closely monitoring” credit growth, particularly for the retail sector, to boost consumption.

“Lending, particularly for retail by banks, both public and private sector, are issues that we are closely monitoring. The finance secretary has been continuously engaging with banks.”

The government’s continuous engagement with banks and NBFCs and encouraging them to boost credit growth has helped disburse close to Rs 4 lakh crore worth retail advances across 400 districts during the festive season starting Dussehra, she said. “After that, we have been following it up. NBFCs are being given quite a few facilities so that they can have greater liquidity. So, all steps are being taken to ensure that liquidity is not an issue.”

Sitharaman hinted that there could be some “grandfathering” option available to the investors, who have already made long-term investments, keeping in mind the previous tax regime.

“You will have a situation where people who have made these commitments towards long-term investments or savings for their houses, their insurances. A part of the governance is also to administer, keeping all those things in mind. It is not that somebody is to deny the commitment they have made.”

471,['10/02/2020'],Government open to more bank mergers if needed: Anurag Thakur,"This story is from February 10, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government is open to further consolidation of banks depending on needs, minister of state for finance Anurag Singh Thakur has said.

Last year, the government announced mega amalgamation of 10 public sector banks into four to cater to the needs of the aspirational and New India.

This exercise will create six global sized banks, effective April, and will bring down the number of public sector banks to 12 from 27 in 2017.

""We have successfully done the mergers and recapitalisation of the banks. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has been successful which has brought back more than Rs 4 lakh crore to the banks. Further consolidation or merger will depend on the need,"" Thakur told PTI in an interview.

Creation of global sized banks through consolidation will facilitate Modi government's resolve to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25, he said.

Bigger banks would have wider reach, stronger lending capacity and better products and technology to serve customers of New India.

Last year in August, the government announced merger of United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) with Punjab National Bank (PNB), making the proposed entity the second largest public sector bank (PSB).

It was decided to merge Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank , while Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank. Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be consolidated with Union Bank of India .

In April 2019, Bank of Baroda in a first three-way merger exercise amalgamated Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with itself.

SBI had merged five of its associate banks - State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Hyderabad and also Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself effective April 2017.

Asked about listing of LIC as announced in the Budget, Thakur said it will help bring in greater transparency, public participation and also deepen the equity market.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Budget 2020-21 on February 1 proposed to sell a part of government stake in LIC through an initial public offer next fiscal.

The government aims to garner Rs 90,000 crore from the listing of LIC and stake dilution in IDBI Bank in the next fiscal out of total disinvestment target of Rs 2.10 lakh crore.

The government owns 100 per cent stake in LIC, and around 46.5 per cent stake in IDBI Bank.

Terming this year's Budget 'Jan Jan Ka Budget', Thakur said every strata of the society has been taken well into consideration and major reforms have been undertaken benefiting youth, women, farmers, investors and the middle class.

The government has provided Rs 2.83 lakh crore for agriculture, farmer welfare and rural development.

""Doubling farmers' income is an agenda for the next two years. We have already fulfilled the commitment of one and a half times of cost of production of farmers which the government had promised,"" he said.

With the announcement of 'Kisan Rail' and 'Krishi Udaan' to be launched by Indian railways and ministry of civil aviation, respectively, for a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, this too will serve beneficial as it will aid farmers in facilitating smooth and fast transport of perishable goods, he said.

In addition, the government has increased agriculture credit target to Rs 15 lakh crore for the next fiscal.

Thakur said, ""from startups to education, internship to apprenticeship, many announcements have been done...So, I think more young entrepreneurs, more startups we are going to see...We see India moving to top three startup countries in the world in the next couple of years.""

With regard to helping the MSME sector, he said, the government has asked the RBI to consider extending debt restructuring window by another year till March 31, 2021.

More than five lakh MSMEs have benefitted from restructuring of debt permitted by the Reserve Bank of India last year, he said.

472,['10/02/2020'],PSU banks may see higher profits: Krishnamurthy Subramanian,"This story is from February 10, 2020

Chief economic advisor Krishnaswamy Subramanian (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The PSU Banks may see enhanced profits with writeback of some of the loans provisions in their balancesheets on account of the IBC resolutions and they must now tap the market themselves instead of looking for recapitalisation, chief economic advisor (CEA) Krishnaswamy Subramanian has said.

""The Budget's decision not to recapitalise the PSU banks is a good move and signals that all the banks are adequately capitalised at this point. The Judgement on Essar Steel provides greater clarity on the IBC. State Bank of India profits were boosted by Essar Steel IBC resolution. Some of those accounts which have been fully written down by banks, when they get resolved, there will be a writeback on account of the resolutions. And this will enhance their profitability and also have an impact on their growth capital. That's one aspect the government clearly believes that these banks are adequately capitalised.

""So having all the while supported the banks when they needed support, now government wants them to stand on their own, enhance the governance and tap into the market,"" Subramanian told IANS.

State Bank of India (SBI) reported a 41 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) rise in its net profit during the December quarter to Rs 5,583 crore, which was driven by healthy income from retail loans and an Rs 11,000 crore recovery from Essar Steel, following its sale to ArcelorMittal.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in the Budget that government so far has infused Rs 3.5 crore capital into public sector banks (PSBs) to help them maintain regulatory capital requirements and finance growth plans. In the last Budget, the government had infused Rs 70,000 crore.

""We have infused Rs 3.5 crore capital into PSU banks. A few among them will be encouraged to move capital market for fundraising purposes"", she said in her Budget Speech.

Finance secretary Rajeev Kumar had earlier said banks have to tap the market and government would start gradually lowering its stake from the state lenders. In some of the state run banks, government stake nearly touches 100 per cent.

Recently Punjab National Bank got board approval to raise Rs 1,000 crore from market through bonds. The IDBI Bank also proposes to raise Rs 1,500 crore from bonds to fund growth.

Among all four anchor banks, the Punjab National Bank was given Rs 16,091 crore, Union Bank of India Rs 11,768 crore, Canara Bank Rs 6,571 crore and Indian Bank Rs 2,534 crore. Merging entities, like the Allahabad Bank, was provided Rs 2,153 crore, while the United Bank of India got 1,666 crore and Andhra Bank Rs 200 crore.

Besides, the Bank of Baroda got a capital infusion of Rs 7,000 crore, Indian Overseas Bank Rs 4,360 crore, UCO Bank Rs 2142 crore, Punjab & Sind Bank 787 crore and Central Bank of India Rs 3,353 crore.

State Bank of India has already initiated the process of diluting stake in its subsidiary SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, and UTI Asset Management Co Ltd via planned initial public offerings. It is looking to sell 50 lakh shares representing 1.01 per cent stake in the National Stock Exchange. Life Insurance Corporation of India-controlled IDBI Bank too received additional capital of Rs 4,557 crore through the first supplementary demand for grants approved by the Parliament last month.

473,['10/02/2020'],Premium AC brands flow into mass market,"(Representative image)

CHENNAI: Air conditioner (AC) makers are partly shedding their green quotient to become pocket-friendly, as more manufacturers line up lesser energy-efficient 3-star category models from their 5-star (or most energy-efficient) stable. In the process, they have knocked off nearly Rs 9,000 — or 25% — from the AC’s price and entered a fiercely competitive segment, which accounts for nearly 70% of the entire market.The 3-star AC category is now the target for brands like Samsung and General, whose reach was restricted to 5-star inverter ACs and other super premium models. Samsung is introducing 3-star models priced from Rs 35,990 for 1-tonne. So far, the company was operating in the price range of Rs 45,000 or higher.“We figured that we had only 40% addressability and, by entering the mass and mass premium segment, we will make it 100%,” said Samsung India deputy general manager (consumer electronics business) Ankur Kapoor . This year, the company is introducing a 3-star on-off AC and increasing its models in the 3-star inverter space.Japanese brand General is also getting pocket-friendly. The company’s owner, Fujitsu , which recently started direct selling in India, has launched 3-star inverter models in the market with a starting price of Rs 24,000 (for 1-tonne), made especially for the subcontinent. Until last year, the ACs in the brand had been confined to 5-star inverter models and had their products in the Rs 50,000 and above category.“This is a good opportunity for us to scale up and improve our market share. Currently, our products command a 50% premium. The new models will find takers among the majority of buyers,” said Fujitsu General head (sales & marketing) KC Poovaiah.Indian brands, too, are targeting the growing room AC market. Godrej, for instance, has re-introduced window ACs and has launched a 3-star inverter version in this segment at Rs 32,000 to increase its share in the mass market. “We have also introduced a 1.25-tonne AC in the 3-star inverter space. With houses becoming smaller, there is a need for this configuration in the country where bulk of the purchases happen in the 1.5-tonne space,” said Godrej Appliances group head (ACs) Santosh Salian .",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74060326,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-77004,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/premium-ac-brands-flow-into-mass-market/articleshow/74053659.cms
