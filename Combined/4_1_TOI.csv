Looks like Hansika thought so, too, and she has now got her own set of GIFs. The actress is said to be the first south actress to have her own set of exclusive GIFs on social platform.“I like interacting through expressions and I love using GIFs. So, my team said I should think of having my own GIFs,” says Hansika, “We’ve been working on it for four months now. Until yesterday, about 270 of the GIFs have been uploaded and we’ve got over 53.5mn views.”So, what was the process of getting her own GIFs like? “My team worked together with an online GIF database on this. It might look easy, but the minute you are in front of the camera, you don’t know where to start and what to do,” she says, “I was shooting for two films in Hyderabad at that time and allocated half a day to shoot these GIFs. There are certain regulations, like you have to wear a particular dress because not all colours are allowed. You have to follow the mood board. They had come with certain suggestions and I had my own ideas, too. For example, I wanted to have GIFs for Happy Birthday, New Year, Ganesh Chaturthi, Good Morning, Wake Up and even Darling from the song Darling Dambakku (Maan Karate) because that step is so famous.”A baby crying, asking to be let outMost of them were tough, but #pokerfaceon was the most difficult because I’m not like that.

1,['1/04/2020'],"save water: Increased water use during lockdown, so reduce, reuse and recycle","Reduce

water usage

Re-use and recycle

Avoid chemical cleansers, go natural

Use reject from water purifiers

Wastage is 100 times your drinking needs

SMALL STEPS TO REDUCE WATER USE

Redirect washing machine drain to clean toilet bowl

Use RO reject to mop, water plants

Fit aerators to taps

In many parts of the country, the lockdown owing to the corona crisis is going to spiral into another big issue — water scarcity. With a lion’s share of people still reliant on fresh water and no concept of recycle and reuse in practice, staying put at home has increased everyone’s consumption patterns multi-fold.AR Shivakumar, former scientist, Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Science and water management advisor says, “There has been a surge in the domestic requirement, and with the depletion of groundwater, it becomes every citizen’s responsibility to save water .”“The mantra is to use less and reuse more. So, collect the water that would be poured down the drain and use it for another purpose. When washing vegetables and fruits don’t do it under running water, soak them for a while in a dish and then wash. This water can be used later, to soak dirty vessels, or even for the first wash of utensils. Also, do not scrub dishes under running water,” advises Odette Katrak, co-founder Beautiful Bengaluru.“Every day, we flush down 30-50 litres of freshwater, per person, down our toilets. Substitute this with the water drained out during washing cycles of the washing machine. A washing machine uses 20%-22% of your daily water requirement, while toilet and washing combined uses 40-50%. You can save 20% by diverting the machine’s water outlet into your toilet bowl,” says Shivakumar. You can also reduce the amount of water in the flush tank by putting a one litre pet bottle filled with sand in it, says Lalithamba BV. Odette adds, “Water from washing pulses can be used to rinse dishes or water plants, but not to mop floors. Based on this, I evolved a water needs hierarchy framework depicting what secondary sources can be matched to certain needs, depending on whether clear, cloudy, soapy or muddy water would suffice.”“Use natural cleansers to wash clothes, mop, and clean utensils. Unlike chemical detergents, these do not lather much and the water left thereafter, can be repurposed. We use the washing machine drain to water plants. Since the cleansers are natural and safe, there’s no harm done to the plants,” says Lalithamba.“For every 10%-15% of drinking water consumed by using a reverse osmosis (RO) purifier, 80% gets flushed out as reject. On average, a family uses 20-30 litres of water for drinking and cooking, which means for every 100 litres of water, you only get 20 that you can consume,” says Shivakumar. Odette adds, “Collect RO reject and use for mopping, watering plants, and cleaning the kitchen and basin, among others.”On average, a home of four people uses 30,000 litres per month, meaning 250 litres per person per day. Of this, hardly 3-4 litres is consumed, and almost 100 times of the water consumed is being flushed down.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/increased-water-use-during-lockdown-so-reduce-reuse-and-recycle/articleshow/74919094.cms

MUMBAI: As the fears about the impact of the spread of Coronavirus weighed on investor sentiment globally, Dalal Street ended its worst quarter ever on a brighter note. On Tuesday, a strong rally in sensex heavyweight Reliance Industries, along with across the board short covering and index management by large funds on the last day of the financial year, helped the index close at 29,648, up 1,028 points on the day. Of the sensex’s 30 constituents, 26 ended higher while IndusInd Bank, of late being hammered due to asset quality concerns, led the slide with a 14.7% crash.The January-March quarter, that saw the sensex give up almost 12,700 points, or 31%—that too after reaching an all-time high at 42,274 on January 20—has been the worst in terms of points loss as well as percentage loss. Also investors wealth erosion of Rs 42.6 lakh crore with BSE ’s market capitalisation now at Rs 112.6 lakh crore, was the sharpest, official data showed. Foreign investors too took out over Rs 48,000 crore during the quarter, again making the three-month period the worst ever. Mutual funds, however, have acted as the cushion in the face of strong FPI selling and have recorded a net buying figure of about Rs 37,500 crore.According to a note by Shrikant Chouhan, EVP — Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities, the day’s gains could be called the yearly and quarterly NAV management day for the market with several of the large-cap stocks closing at the day’s high. Technically, if the nifty falls below 8,350 level, it would retreat further to 8,250 or even up to 8,000 level, Chouhan said. “Global markets are doing better than expected but our markets are trading cautiously due to consistent selling from foreign institutions.”In Tuesday’s session, it was RIL that rallied over 8% and contributed about a fifth of the sensex gains which came after the company late on Monday said that its board on April 2 would consider fund raising. The decision by the company comes in the backdrop of an expected delay in stake buy by global oil major Saudi Aramco in RIL’s refinery business, a deal to offload a stake in Jio, its telecom arm to social media giant Facebook also being pushed back due to the Covid-related uncertainties, which also had shaved off over 40% of its value in less than three months and oil prices crashing by about 60% in less than two months.The other top sensex gainers in Tuesday’s session were ITC, ONGC and Tech Mahindra. Other than IndusInd Bank, the other index laggards were Maruti Bajaj Finance and Titan, BSE data showed.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74921579,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-69941,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/down-12700-pts-31-sensex-has-worst-quarter/articleshow/74921572.cms

The song, a parody of Baar Baar Haan, from the Ashutosh Gowariker’s directorial, has also earned appreciation from the director on Twitter.Here’s what Ashutosh Gowariker shared:With help from his musician friends Omkar Kelkar and Nachiket Jog, Kalamkar retained the tune but changed the lyrics. The new lyrics- ‘Ek desh ha, ek bhavana- todu sakhali, rokhu corona (One country, one sentiment- let’s break the chain and stop corona) spell out the spirit of unity and support in times of the COVID-19 outbreak.After Gheware got a green signal for their idea from the city police commissioner, the team put their heads together to finalise a song. “We brainstormed on a couple of patriotic songs and finalised this one from Lagaan because it’s catchy,” shares Gheware, adding, “We keep telling people to stay home during our rounds, but I am sure it becomes monotonous for them and after a while, they stop bothering. With this creative way, we are getting a wider reach.”Kalamkar adds, “The reason we choose this song is because it indicates unity and if we unite to fight against the virus, we shall definitely win the battle. We set the lyrics according to the tune of the song and were good to go the very next day. ”With a portable sound system on their police vehicle and a mic, Kalamkar sings the song while his team claps and joins in chorus. The team is covering areas like Dattawadi, Janta Vasahat, Laxmi Nagar and others that fall under the police station’s jurisdiction. Kalamkar says they restrict the performance to just two minutes. “Our motive is to only create awareness among people in a unique manner. Just as our communications generally last 2-3 mins, we have tried to keep the song short so that the purpose of the message isn’t lost and at the same time it reaches people,” says Kalamkar.Ask the team if they are aware of the song going viral and Gheware quips, “Yes! In fact, a police friend of mine from Gadchiroli even asked for the video as they are planning to do something similar there. They also plan to come up with a Hindi song for wider reach.”",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74921523,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1247304/74921523.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/pune-cops-stayhome-anthem-goes-viral-amidst-lockdown/articleshow/74921523.cms

But the family reunion and celebrations will have to wait for a while since her kin, including her husband, continue to remain in quarantine. The father hasn’t been able to see the baby till now.Zahra Banoo gave birth to a boy on March 28, in what is possibly the first known case of “quarantine birth” in India. Zohra Banoo , the gynaecologist who attended to the mother, said the newborn weighs a healthy 3.5 kg and has been vaccinated.Two days before her due date, Zahra was shifted to the hospital from a quarantine facility in Kurbathang in an ambulance. “We shifted the mother to the out-patient department and utmost care was taken to ensure she didn’t come in contact with other patients,” said Dr Kachoo Sikandar Ali Khan, medical superintendent at the district hospital in Kargil. There are 353 people in quarantine in the district, Kargil DC Baseer Khan said.Zahra has tested negative for the coronavirus twice but those attending to the woman wore protective gear as an added precaution. By Tuesday, she had served 14 days of her quarantine and doctors said she would be released soon.Khan added that the delivery had brought much cheer among the hospital staff. “In these times of crisis, our staff volunteered to provide emotional support to the pregnant woman as she was alone,” said a doctor, citing the example of one Fatima, employed as sanitation staff at the hospital, who stayed with the mother during labour.At the quarantine facility, the father said he was happy and anxious at the same time. “This is my third child and I wish I could have been there with them,” said Vilayat Ali. “I’m grateful that the doctors supported us. We were shifted from Sankoo (a town 45km from Kargil) to the quarantine facility after my brother who had no travel history tested positive.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of ashtami, when a lot of devotees perform “kanya” (or “kanjak”) puja by calling nine young girls home, major devi temples of the capital have urged people not to celebrate the occasion by inviting anyone and to stay at home, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak.Kanya puja is performed on the eighth and ninth day of Navaratri. It involves the worship of nine girls, representing the nine forms of Goddess Durga Ashtami and Ram Navami also usually witness a large number of bhandaras (community kitchens), but temples heads and managements of temples such as the Kalkaji Shaktipeeth and Jhandewalan Devi have appealed to people to divert resources to help the needy during in these testing times.Rajeev Nanda, who manages the sanctum sanctorum at Katyayani Shaktipeeth at Chhatarpur said under the prevailing circumstances no one should call children at home as they may be exposed to infection. “The chief priests of Chhatarpur peeth have recommended that people keep nine representative kanjak portions in a big thaali and donate a portion to hungry cows, birds or stray dogs. Once the current crisis is over, devotees can worship the kanjaks,” Nanda said.Dedicated to the goddess Aadi Shakti, the Jhandewalan temple near Karol Bagh is among the oldest temples in Delhi and attracts lakhs of devotees during the auspicious period. Temple spokesperson Ramesh Chandra Joshi said that even the idea of “celebration” should not cross people’s minds when nation is fighting the virus outbreak and no one should call nine kanjaks home.“Devotees can carry out puja in their homes without the kanjaks. They take a vow to help the needy based on their capacities. Keep the donation aside that you want give to your temple, and dedicate it after the crisis is overcome,” Joshi said. “Nine kanjak can be replaced by a vow to help the poor and needy. We at the temple are also feeding 20,000-30,000 people who totally depend on us.”Senior public health officials have warned against any festive gatherings during Ram Navami to prevent any further spread of the coronavirus infection. “We should all stay at home and do our bit to contain the spread. That will be the best form of worship,” an official from SDMC remarked.At south Delhi’s Kalkaji shrine, head priest Surendranath Avdhoot also appealed to devotees not to do anything that violates social distancing norms. “Kanya puja has its own importance but the situation this time is such that even we will not be able to call anyone to the temple. There is no alternative. People can feed even one girl if someone is inside their home, otherwise send the food to their homes,” he added.North DMC chairperson Jai Prakash has appealed people to donate soaps, masks and hand-santisers to poor as charity.

15,['1/04/2020'],"Stocks fall, capping Wall Street's worst quarter since 2008","NEW YORK: Stocks fell Tuesday to close out Wall Street's worst quarter since the most harrowing days of the 2008 financial crisis.The S&P 500 dropped a final 1.6%, bringing its loss for the first three months of the year to 20% as predictions for the looming recession caused by the coronavirus outbreak got even more dire. Stocks haven't had this bad a quarter since the last time economists were talking about the worst downturn since the Great Depression, when the S&P 500 lost 22.6% at the end of 2008.The surge of coronavirus cases around the world has sent markets to breathtaking drops since mid-February, undercutting what had been a good start to the year. Markets rose early in the quarter, and the S&P 500 set a record with expectations that the economy was accelerating due to calming trade wars and low interest rates around the world.But benchmark U.S. crude oil dropped by roughly two thirds this quarter on expectations that a weakened economy will need less fuel. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped below 1% for the first time as investors scrambled for safety, and it ended the quarter at roughly 0.67%. Germany's DAX lost a quarter of its value, and South Korean stocks fell just over 20%.The big question is if markets will get worse. At this point, no one knows.""People are trying to digest the length and magnitude of what the coronavirus impact is going to be,"" said George Rusnak, managing director of investment strategy at Wells Fargo Private Bank.The steep drops from Tokyo to Toronto in recent weeks reflect investors' understanding that the economy and corporate profits are in for a sudden, debilitating drop-off. Economies around the world are grinding to near standstills as businesses close their doors and people hunker down at home in hopes of slowing the spread of the virus.But markets have also cut their losses in recent weeks on hopes that massive aid from governments and central banks around the world can blunt the blow. The S&P 500 was down nearly 31% for the quarter at one point, but it has climbed 15.5% since last Monday.The Fed has promised to buy as many Treasurys as it takes to get lending markets working smoothly after trading got snarled in markets that help companies borrow short-term cash to make payroll, homebuyers get mortgages and local governments to build infrastructure. Congress, meanwhile, approved a $2.2 trillion rescue plan for the economy, and leaders are already discussing the possibility of another round of aid.Whether markets have indeed found a bottom or whether investors have become too optimistic about the economic rebound coming after the viral outbreak peaks is impossible to say without knowing when the number of new infections will hit its peak.""We're kind of on this little milestone journey with markets,"" said Brent Schutte , chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co. ""First, we get the economic plan in place, then we have to start to see some of the containment actions pay off. At some point it's going to be how do we get back to work.""Among the next milestones for investors is Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show a sharp drop in payrolls. Companies will also being reporting their earnings results for the first quarter in upcoming weeks, and analysts are looking for the steepest drop in profits since the start of 2016, according to FactSet.The numbers may get even worse in the following quarter. Goldman Sachs economists said Tuesday they expect the U.S. economy to shrink 34% in the second quarter, but they expect growth to rebound in the third quarter.The S&P 500 fell 42.06 points to 2,584.59. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 410.32, or 1.8%, to 21,917.16, and the Nasdaq was off 74.05, or 1%, to 7,700.10.The relatively modest moves are a big departure from earlier in the month, when huge swings punished investors. The S&P 500 had its worst day since Black Monday 1987 on March 12 with a 9.5% loss, for example, only to outdo itself with a 12% drop two trading days later. Sandwiched in between was a 9.3% surge.The number of known coronavirus cases keeps rising, and the worldwide tally has topped 830,000, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States has the highest number in the world, more than 170,000.Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause pneumonia and require hospitalization. More than 41,000 have died worldwide due to COVID-19, while more than 175,000 have recovered.We're still not even close to peak coronavirus in the U.S. which has already reported more cases than any other country and will sadly likely see a huge spike in the number of deaths, meaning further lockdown measures will likely follow,"" said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe.

16,['1/04/2020'],Govt slashes small savings rates by up to 140 basis pts,"NEW DELHI: The government on Tuesday announced one of the steepest-ever cuts in small savings rates, which will see returns on the popular public provident fund deposits fall by 80 basis points to 7.1%, starting Wednesday, while the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme will see the annual interest rate drop by more than a percentage point.Similarly, rates on post office term deposits have also been slashed by as much as 140 basis points with one- to three-year deposits now fetching 5.5% instead of 6.9% earlier. The rate on five-year term deposits has been pared by a percentage point to 6.7%. These deposits come with quarterly compounding of rates.Even at the revised rates – which will be applicable for the April-June quarter -- the returns will be higher than what you will earn through a fixed deposit in a bank. For instance, for a five-year FD, State Bank of India is currently offering 5.7%.Besides, some of the schemes such as PPF have the added tax benefit which results in higher returns. For instance, someone in the 30% bracket will earn a post-tax return of over 9%, apart from the tax benefit on investment of up to Rs 1.5 lakh.In a post-budget interview, economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty had indicated to TOI last month, that rates will be lowered at the end of March.Although the announcement move is in line with the falling interest rate regime, the government had earlier ignored its own policy and refused to align the returns with market rates. Even this time, it has done so due to repeated prodding by the Reserve Bank of India as the lower policy rates were not translating into a commensurate fall in deposit and lending rates.While RBI has lowered policy rates by over 2 percentage points during the last couple of years, PPF rates have come down by 90 basis points since October 2016.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74921815,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57352,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/govt-slashes-small-savings-rates-by-up-to-140-basis-pts/articleshow/74921809.cms

Coronavirus pandemic: Complete Coverage 21-day lockdown: What will stay open and what won't How to quarantine yourself at home Trust the newspaper for your daily verified news

A bench of CJI S A Bobde and Justice L Nageswar Rao said, ""Upon perusal of the status report filed on behalf of Union of India, we are satisfied with the steps taken by the Union of India for preventing the spread of coronavirus at this stage.""

Noting that the mass migration had stopped with the intervention of the Centre and states and workers were being given food and shelter wherever they have been asked to stay, the bench said, ""Migration of large number of labourers working in cities was triggered by panic created by fake news that the lockdown would continue for more than three months. Such panic driven migration has caused untold suffering to those who believed and acted on such news. In fact, some have lost their lives in the process. It is, therefore, not possible for us to overlook this menace of fake news either by electronic, print or social media.""

The SC's order underlined Section 54 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which provides up to one year imprisonment with fine as punishment to a person who makes or circulates a false alarm or warning concerning a disaster or its severity or magnitude, leading to panic. It also said such panic mongers could be punished under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code .

The court made it mandatory for states to follow the Centre's advisory in tackling Covid-19. ""We trust and expect that all concerned — state governments, public authorities and citizens of this country — will faithfully comply with the directives, advisories and orders issued by the Union of India in letter and spirit in the interest of public safety,"" the court said.

The bench said it was well known that panic could severely affect mental health. ""We are informed that the Union of India is conscious of the importance of mental health and the need to calm down those who are in a state of panic. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta informs that within 24 hours, the central government will ensure that trained counsellors and/or community group leaders belonging to all faiths will visit relief camps/shelter homes and deal with any consternation that the migrants might be going through. This shall be done in all the relief camps/shelter homes wherever they are located in the country,"" the bench said.

""Anxiety and fear of the migrants should be understood by the police and other authorities. As directed by the Union of India, they should deal with the migrants in a humane manner. Considering the situation, we are of the opinion that the state governments/Union Territories should endeavour to engage volunteers along with the police to supervise the welfare activities of the migrants. We expect those concerned to appreciate the trepidation of the poor men, women and children and treat them with kindness,"" the bench said.

The court posted the hearing of PILs filed by Lakh Alok Srivastav and Rashmi Bansal on condition of migrant workers for further hearing on April 7.

21,['1/04/2020'],Government to borrow Rs 4.9 lakh crore in April-September,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Despite fears of a large borrowing programme to meet excess spending because of the coronavirus pandemic, the government on Tuesday said it would borrow Rs 7.8 lakh crore through gilt auctions in fiscal 2021, compared to Rs 7.1 lakh crore in fiscal 2020, of which 62.6% or about Rs 4.9 lakh, is proposed in the first half of the financial year.

This was in line with the borrowing trend in the past few years when the government front-loaded gilt auction in the first six months of the fiscal by mopping up between 60% and 65% of its full-year target.

Through weekly auctions of government bonds, the mop up would be about Rs 19,000 crore to Rs 21,000 crore, compared to about Rs 17,000 crore in FY20. Through treasury bills, the government plans to borrow nearly Rs 1.4 lakh crore.

However, given the Covid-related uncertainties, the bond market expects the total borrowing for FY21 to eventually shoot past the Rs 8 lakh crore mark, thus hardening the yield.

According to Atanu Chakraborty , secretary, department of economic affairs, the government’s borrowing plan factors in any Coronavirus-related economic stimulus that may be required. He also said that the government has sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements.

Bond market players said that the first half borrowing calender was more or less in line with the trend of recent years. According Ram Kamal Samanta, VP – Investment, Star Union Dai-Ichi Life Insurance, in an environment represented by subdued growth, stable inflation, ample liquidity and lower policy rate, fixed income market is likely to remain supported.

“Moreover, use of unconventional monetary policy toll like LTRO and Operation Twist is also likely to contain any near term spike in yields. However going forward, with lower likelihood of any meaningful monetary easing and higher chance of fiscal slippage by the central and state governments, slowly and steadily yield will move up with each successive auction,” he said.

“It amuses me to watch the kids of police personnel who cannot even hug their fathers or mothers in fear of virus but to spread the message to masses on social media to support their parents,” Sawang said.

Sawang said the amount of hard work that the Andhra Pradesh police are putting in to save the lives of people inspired him to go on to the roads to participate in the duties at ground level. He said he will do duty at police pickets along with other personnel in this difficult times. He promised the family members of the police that the welfare of the officers working on the ground level is being taken care of by the government.

27,['1/04/2020'],Bihar: Jail inmates interact with kin via video conferencing,"Representative image

PATNA: The prisons inspectorate, which had prohibited visitors from entering jail premises for meeting inmates as part of social distancing measures to prevent spread of coronavirus, has now come up with virtual interaction system to enable people interact with the prisoners while sitting at home with the help of their smartphones.

IG (prisons and correctional services) Mithilesh Mishra said the ‘e-mulakat’ system of videoconferencing had been started for the prisoners to reduce their mental stress as they might get disturbed if not allowed to interact with their family members. “Telephone booths have also been set up at the jails so that prisoners can talk to their relatives,” Mishra added.

Prisons sources said the proposal to implement virtual interaction system had come earlier as well, but it is now being implemented on a war footing in all jails. “In fact, the prisons department rolled out the system on March 26,” the sources added.

The IG (prisons) had temporarily banned entry of visitors to jails on March 14 as a precautionary measure to combat Covid-19.

“The system will eliminate several security related hazards and ease pressure on jail authorities as large count of visitors throng jails for meeting prisoners regularly,” the sources said, adding configuration for ‘e-mulakat’ had already been completed in at least 20 jails in the state. “At Begusarai, Katihar, Bettiah, Samastipur and Darbhanga district jails, the project has already been implemented. Prisoners have started interacting with their relatives through videoconferencing,” they said.

A senior home department official said the project would be implemented in other prisons, including eight central jails, soon.

“Around 20 such calls were made till Tuesday in jails. One prisoner at a jail can use the facility at a time for five minutes,” the official said, adding those keen to interact with prisoners will have to download a mobile-based application for videoconferencing.

A senior prisons official said one has to first send an e-mail via e-prisons platform to the superintendent of the jail where prisoner is lodged for registration and seeking approval for video conferencing. “Once superintendent is satisfied after verification of documents, he can give approval for videoconferencing and fix date and time for the same,” the official said.

The official added that process is also on to enable prisoners appear for trial before separate courts at one go from inside jails in the future. On March 19, the Patna high court had become the first high court in the country to conduct hearing via videoconferencing.

Top bureaucrats from consumer affairs, civil aviation, railways and India Post were also present, sources added.As passenger trains are not running now, e-commerce firms are looking to use the railways to ship goods faster without traffic on tracks. India Post, which has one of the largest last-mile delivery networks in the country, would come in handy in getting essentials to consumers across top metros and smaller cities as well. India has over 1.5 lakh post offices. A senior government official in the DPIIT confirmed the development. This comes at a time when online platforms continue to battle labour shortage even when offering double incentives for deliveries.“Railways is doing couriers right now. It is prepared to run the extra services for e-commerce companies. Railways board chairman was also present in the meeting (with the online platforms). They can do these short services while running trains at Rajdhani’s pace (one of the fastest trains). India Post is already involved in essential services and they can do both — the first mile and last mile,” this official said.The transportation from railways will help e-commerce companies take goods from manufacturers to warehouses, as overall trucking routes remain choked, while India Post can act as a potential last-mile distributor of goods, another person aware of the goings-on said.“Conversations with India Post are still at a discussion stage. What is being discussed is post offices serving as drop locations where consumers can pick up fixed packages of essentials. Or the postman can also deliver these,” the source mentioned earlier said. Another aspect that is being discussed is pick-up of orders and packages from large offline retailers, including D-Mart, to avoid crowding at stores. “This is something platforms have to decide. If they want to do this at scale and solve the ongoing issue, they can,” the government official added. According to him, the situation still remains dynamic with daily improvements in the supply chain network compared to the previous week.“To achieve the objective of moving essential supplies across the country, from our sellers/vendors to the customers, our teams are exploring all possible collaboration ideas, including the railways among several other innovative ideas,” said Rajneesh Kumar, chief corporate affairs officer at Flipkart.

With this, the online beauty and cosmetics seller has become the latest unicorn (valued at over $1 billion) in the Indian startup industry.The new round of funding comes as online retail business is set to enter a tough quarter, with sales restricted to just essentials and the overall slowdown likely to impact discretionary spending like cosmetics. Nykaa sells beauty products via its online store as well as 50-60 offline stores across the country.The funding includes the sale of shares by some existing investors and employees of Nykaa, which has been done at a discount to the $1.2-billion valuation. The latest round comes about a year after the company raised $15 million from TPG Growth, which had valued it at $724 million.Avendus Capital was the financial advisor to Nykaa on the fundraise.At the same time, Nykaa said that it is taking precautions as it told its vendors in a communication that its cash flows and income will be impacted. “The lockdown has already impacted business across industry, and this will have significant impact on the business cycle, including cash-conversion cycle...In light of this, we find it prudent to update you that there will be a delay in making payments of outstanding invoices to all vendors and partners,” Nykaa communicated on Tuesday.Nykaa confirmed the Steadview investment. “We are very grateful to achieve this significant milestone...In the midst of this unprecedented global crisis, we are working to ensure all our stakeholders are well served and that Nykaa emerges as a leading retail player in the industry,” Nykaa founder & CEO Falguni Nayar said in a statement on Tuesday.Nykaa, which was started by the former investment banker Nayar, is one of the leading players in the online beauty space, competing against e-commerce players like Amazon Fashion , Myntra and other niche players like Purplle, which was recently funded by Goldman Sachs.

31,['1/04/2020'],No entry without medical check-up: Villagers to migrants,"PATNA: It’s a double whammy for hundreds of migrant labourers who came back to their native villages from outside Bihar following the nationwide lockdown .

While they faced untold hardships to reach their destinations from Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala, their entry to their homes have been banned by fellow villagers out of the fear of contracting Covid-19.

Three youths, including two brothers, were denied entry to their homes Dhanauti villagers under Barun block in Aurangabad district on Monday. The villagers asked the youths returning from Ludhiana to first visit the special camp.

Sujeet Sao (24), Anil Singh (30) and Rahul Singh (32) had no option but to get examined by doctors at the local primary health centre (PHC) from where they had to spend a night before being let off as there was no symptoms for coronavirus.

In another incident, three youths were picked up by the police and health department officials from Silwatia Bargo under Ram Nagar police station in West Champaran on Sunday and subsequently admitted to a hospital at Bettiah. While Sanjay Choudhary and Vaikil Patel were let off after medical check-up, Dhananjay Choudhary was sent to the quarantine centre and his blood samples were sent to the RMRI, Patna for examination. The police team reached the village after being tipped off by some local residents that the three youths had returned from Tamil Nadu and had not undergone medical test.

Such reports poured in from over a dozen villages in Vaishali, Kaimur, Banka, Muzaffarpur, Madhubani, Madhepura, Darbhanga, Gopalganj, Katihar, Supaul and Bhagalpur districts.

Narrating his woes, Sajjan Thakur (49) of Rampatti in Madhubani district said, “Pahle to bhukhe pyase kisi tarah ghar pahuche. Ab gaon mein entry ban hai. Jayen to jayen kahan (First we reached home hungry and now we are not allowed to enter the village. Where should I go)?”

What distresses more is that those who have been quarantined at their homes have been socially boycotted. Handwritten pamphlets or notices indicating that they have been quarantined have been pasted on the walls. The neighbours were being told not to visit those under home quarantine.

“These people are being treated as if they have committed a crime,” said social activist Pramod Kumar.

Physician and secretary of Indian Doctors for Peace and Development, Dr Shakeel, has written to the principal secretary (health) and National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to stop ‘stigmatising’ the Covid 19 suspects.

Authoritative sources said around 50,000 migrants have returned home from Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Nepal in the last three days alone. While some were allowed to go home after screening, others were sent to quarantine centres in the border areas.

The state directive to conduct health examination of all those returning from outside the state is also taking its toll on the government officials. In Jehanabad and Nawada, medical teams, which had gone to collect samples from some migrants, were attacked.

Jehanabad BDO Ajay Kumar said, “The team was attacked when it visited Dayali Bigha after getting information from some residents that 22 villagers had come back from Delhi and four from Punjab. The locals became furious when a youth was being taken to the hospital for medical check-up. Two official vehicles were damaged in stone-pelting.”

The SHO of Okri police outpost, Chandra Shekhar Kumar, said two people had been arrested in this connection. Earlier, a similar incident was reported from Nawada district.

ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said those found to be taking law into their hands won’t be spared. In the Jehanabad incident, raids were on to nab the other accused, he added.

The ventilator machines that had been non-functional since their installation more than a year ago could have played a crucial role in saving the life of the high-risk patient.

Senior medical officer Dr Ravi Datta said, “Health authorities have decided to make optimum use of all the four ventilators by shifting them to CMCH. Higher authorities will co-ordinate with CMCH to deal with high-risk Covid-19 patients in future.” There are nine other ventilators in the neonatal care unit of the civil hospital, but that too have been lying non-functional after installation due to non-availability of trained staff to run them.

“We have informed the authorities about the need of well-trained medical staff for smooth functioning of rest of the ventilators, which are for newborns. Authorities have assured help in the next few days,” said Datta. The health authorities have asked the contacts of the coronavirus victim to quarantine themselves.

Pandit, his wife Kalpana and son Shubham were kept in different rooms a SIHFW. “The rooms were spacious with an attached bathroom. We were given with fresh towels, toilet kits and slippers,” he said.

“Diabetics like me were given tea, coffee and milk without sugar. Those who did not eat dinner were given fruits and milk. Those serving us were also polite and never complained,” he said.

“We used to inquire about each other’s health and talk as a family,” he said. Pandit’s daughter Riya is studying MBBS in Spain. She stays with a relative there and is safe.

35,['1/04/2020'],"After Covid, cos will strive for ‘best place to be human’ tag","By Raj Bowen Over the last month, the Covid-19 epidemic has brought humanity to its knees as nothing has ever done before, not even the two World Wars, seen in context. Once this is over (and surely it will be), there will be post-mortems, analyses, hindsight, conjecture and definitely a blockbuster movie or two. And the world will lick its wounds and limp back to normalcy.The human spirit has levels of resilience that stretch in direct proportion to the challenge they are tested with. The key word to note here is ‘human’ and that will need to be brought out of mothballed corporate cupboards.Physics defines the concept of ‘work’ as the measure of energy transfer as an object is moved over a distance by an external force, at least part of which is applied in the direction of the displacement. Embedded here may lie the clues to some of the fundamental shifts we need to make to first understand that organisations are not ruled by physics but by humanities. Here are some guidelines that we will now ignore to our own peril as, potentially, a Covid-20 will not take any prisoners:* Not capital, but energy: Organisations don’t run on capital — their essential lifeblood is the ‘energy’ that the employees bring with them and convert into something of value to the organisation’s clients. Yes, to an extent it mirrors part of the physics definition of energy transfer. The missing part is the understanding around ‘how’ this energy is created. The conventional party-time corporate phrase that ‘command and control of employees is dead’ is as clear a lie as there ever was.Ask any junior level employee what goes on in his head the day he wants to leave a little early because it’s his son’s first birthday. If he wants to make this happen, he needs to know how to work around the command-and-control reality, instead of mistakenly assuming it’s dead.* Not objects: The next reality that must change is about the understanding of employees as objects and the sharpest proof of that is the existence of human resources as a business function itself. Objects do break, get lost, get stolen, get rusted, become obsolete. Similarly, resources get depleted, dissipate, depreciate and, ultimately, are destroyed. Do we now have a case to (if not to formally re-label this part of an organisation) at least start believing that we don’t have thousands of ‘objects’ in the organisation — we have thousands of ‘humans’? Hopefully, the award to be coveted by corporations may well then be ‘A Great Place to Be Human’.* No need to shout: The third hangover of the physics definition that needs to be thrown out of the window is the part about ‘moving the object over a distance by an external force’. Think about it — very simply, the manager (it’s just wrong to use the word leader here) who shouts at and pushes his team hardest is the one who wins the promotions, the bonuses and the awards.This continues even as we get busy with power point slides quoting, ‘People don’t leave companies, they leave managers’. Don’t make any mistake here: Those managers still get promoted. This will now compulsorily call for a total overhaul to help managers transition into leaders by unlearning the physics way of creating energy/results of ‘pushing objects’ and learning the humanities way of creating energy/results by ‘engaging the human’s potential’. So, the ‘external force’ will not work any longer. Managers will have to learn the new skills of engaging humans.* Redefine work: The final part that brings this all together — or apart — is the physics notion, at least part of which is applied in the direction of the displacement. In the humanities context, the question is, ‘How aligned are an organisation’s employees towards pulling (remember, not pushing) in the same direction?’ Even the physics definition provides for ‘at least partial alignment’.Global studies around employee (redefined as human now) engagement point to low double-digits, possibly around 15% at best. There is no way 15 out of every 100 humans in an organisation will be able to pull the firm back from the devastating impact of Covid-19, no matter how loud the managers shout or threaten or push.We tried that for Covid-19, and finally retreated into our own personal spaces and hunkered down to sit quietly and allow it to pass on. The organisations that understand this reality must start setting the scale back to zero now, in multiple ways, and the re-definition of ‘work’ is the beginning.The existing calendar we all grew up following in the corporate world was BC and AD. The new one will now be BC and AC — before and after corona .

36,['1/04/2020'],"We’re ready to serve but need protective gear, staff: Docs","Nagpur: After orders from the collector and warning from municipal commissioner, the city doctors have restarted their clinics but complain of lack of help from the government, particularly failure to provide personal protection equipment (PPE) to prevent coronavirus infection.

Many doctors had shut their clinics after the nationwide lockdown last week, which led to a slew of complaints by patients. The government then came out with orders to reopen them, despite strong opposition from Indian Medical Association (IMA).

“We are also not keen to stop our livelihood, but are forced to do so due to unprecedented circumstances. When the lockdown began, the police beat up nurses and other staff coming to work and they now aren’t ready to resume duties. Most come from far off places, particularly in Mumbai and Pune, and they’d don’t have any means of transport. Some of our doctors are above 60 and also suffering from diabetes and blood pressure. Since morbidity rate of Covid-19 is more in this age group, they should be exempted, but the government is not listening,” IMA state president Dr Avinash Bhondve said.

The doctors said they were not concerned with their own safety but also of nurses and other staff working with them, along with their family members.

“Doctors are supposed to be the saviour of mankind. They are demigods who risk their own life to cure ailments. Covid-19 outbreak in India has posed a different type of challenge to our fraternity. Firstly, we don’t have PPE (includes gown, cap, mask, goggles, boot gloves at least), which is must for treating persons with highly infectious viruses/pathogens,” said consultant ENT surgeon Dr Sanjiv Ukil.

Another doctor having clinic at Manewada Square said even patients weren’t coming unless in emergency due to lockdown. Therefore, there was no point in keeping the clinics open. “We have been putting the lives of staff like nurses and receptionist at risk along with those of patients. Unlike doctors, our staffers aren’t that much health conscious,” he said.

Some doctors feel in such critical situation, operating small clinics was against the very principle of social distancing. “Individual clinics usually function from small premises where waiting area is not that spacious. The patients and relatives sit in cramped spaces and are at higher risk of getting infected. Doctors are always available for emergency cases,” former IMA national president Dr Y S Deshpande said.

Stressing that PPE’s were a must in such situations, another ex-IMA chief Dr Ravi Wankhedkar said many patients coming to their clinics had symptoms of cough and cold and fever which could be Covid-19. “India already has shortage of human resource in healthcare sector. If doctors fall ill, the situation will only worsen. You don’t expect soldiers to fight without protective gear,” he said.

Doctors are also facing problems of their staff’s unwillingness to report to duty due to virus threat. “Family members of our nurses, lab assistants, attendants are not allowing them to come. Many staff members don’t have identity cards. They face harassment by police. How to run clinics without proper help,” asked Dr Manish Jadhav, who runs a small clinic in Narendra Nagar.

After Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) permitted telephonic consultation, many practitioners started to tide over the crisis. “This is completely safe for both doctor and patients and also saved our time and fuel. If doctor is infected, s/he could pass it on to hundreds of others. Hence, a middle way must be found out,” another doctor running a clinic at Laxmi Nagar said.

37,['1/04/2020'],"Sunil, Lakshmi Mittal cos commit Rs 100cr aid each","Mumbai: As India continues to face the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, a fresh set of names from the world of business are stepping in to help those in need.

On Tuesday, Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Enterprises committed Rs 100 crore to relief and recovery initiatives related to Covid-19. Beyond this, Bharti said it will match the amount contributed by its employees towards India’s fight against the coronavirus onslaught.

On similar lines, steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal said his Indian ventures will contribute Rs 100 crore to the ongoing relief efforts countrywide. New Delhi-headquartered Jindal Steel & Power, Piramal Group, IFFCO — a fertiliser company owned by a cooperative society, and component maker Bharat Forge donated Rs 25 crore each to the PM CARES Fund, which was introduced last week by the Centre for Covid-19 relief efforts. While Mumbai-based Indiabulls gave Rs 21 crore.

Companies have been closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities and NGOs to bolster disease prevention and resilience efforts. They have been providing medical kits that include surgeon gowns, hood caps, shoe covers and infrared thermometers to the hospitals. Some consumer durable makers have also been offering air purifiers, refrigerators and water purifiers to medical centres. Oil PSUs — ONGC and IOC — contributed Rs 300 crore and Rs 225 crore, respectively, to the PM Cares Fund. ONGC’s contribution makes it the biggest PSU donor to the PM’s relief fund. Other PSUs — Power Finance Corporation, NTPC and NHPC — have put in a total of Rs 1,125 crore.

SBI employees pledged Rs 100 crore to the PM CARES Fund. The 2.6 lakh employees will contribute two days’ salary. This is perhaps one of the biggest commitments by employees of an organisation. Last week, the PSU bank had announced a commitment of 0.25% of its FY20 profit in support of Covid-19 control.

Tata Group, which announced a commitment of Rs 1,500 crore, tweeted that it will allocate Rs 500 crore to the newly formed relief fund by the Centre.

The government has allowed companies to contribute from their CSR funds to the PM Cares Fund. Rules require companies with a revenue of Rs 1,000 crore or profit of Rs 5 crore to contribute 2% of profit for CSR. A significant chunk of the pledge by companies have gone to the PM Cares Fund.

Xiaomi India pledged Rs 15 crore to various Covid-19 relief initiatives, while digital solutions provider for capital market transactions CDSL, Jyothy Labs and Care Ratings contributed Rs 7 crore, Rs 5 crore and Rs 2.5 crore, respectively.

The premium in respect of the policy is understood to be Rs 128 crore.The government has said that a loss of life due to contracting Covid-19 in the course of work would be treated as an accident. The health and family welfare ministry issued an order on March 29 entrusting New India Assurance with the issue of the policy. New India subsequently issued it on Monday in the form of a tailor-made personal accident cover valid for the next 90 days.This is for the first time that a personal accident policy is being issued to cover an infectious disease. Hitherto non-life companies could provide life insurance only for accidental death. While life companies issue policies covering death due to natural causes, there are no life policies for specific events.Speaking to TOI, New India chairman Atul Sahai said that currently most of the treatment for the coronavirus is being done at government hospitals. The policy therefore provides only death benefit. He said that the company had the capacity to provide this cover without going in for reinsurance support. The 22.12 lakh insured in the policy include healthcare providers and community health workers who may have to be in direct contact with Covid-19 patients, and private healthcare staff and workers as detailed in the health ministry order. Government officials said that the policy was aimed at boosting the morale of healthcare providers.In Italy, in three months, around 90 healthcare providers passed away on account of contracting coronavirus during the course of service.

PATNA: With people seeking medical help via virtual platforms amid lockdown, telemedicine services have finally taken off in the city. Of late, a sudden surge is being witnessed in the number of online and telephonic consultations people are seeking with doctors.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), telemedicine is one of the most essential services in strengthening the health system’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) is also making efforts to deliver free consultancy to people, for which it has issued numbers of health specialists. The state health department is also running a helpline number for all non-emergency complaints.

IMA-Bihar senior vice-president Ajay Kumar said around 300-400 doctors are giving consultation over phone to people across the state. “Keeping in mind the coronavirus spread, IMA has given a green signal to telemedicine facility. In just two-three days, more than 300 doctors from across the state, including Purnia, Muzaffarpur and Patna , have started giving free consultation to people who need medical advice,” he said.

Former IMA-Bihar secretary Dr Brajnandan Kumar said it was decided at a recent meeting with health officials that a website will soon be launched for availing telemedicine services. “The online portal will have different phone numbers on which people can give a missed call to avail free check-up,” he said.

The state health department is also running a helpline number – 104 – for all non-emergency complaints. State surveillance officer Dr Ragini Mishra said altogether 35,000 calls were received from across the state on this number and other district-level helpline numbers till Tuesday. “The queries have comparatively increased in the last few days. People are mostly asking questions about normal flu and viral infections,” she said.

Meanwhile, doctors said they receive more than 20 queries via phone calls per day. Dr Pratyush Kumar of Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) said the number of patients coming to the hospital has dropped significantly.

“I receive around 10-15 queries regarding different health problems every day. Telephonic calls apart, several people have started consulting me through online chatting platforms. People don’t come to the hospital apprehending that they might come in contact with Covid-19 suspects,” Dr Kumar said.

PATNA: The 21-day Covid-19 lockdown has disrupted all the construction works being carried out at different places under the jurisdiction of the East Central Railway ( ECR ) at a cost of Rs 4,614 crore.

ECR’s chief public relations officer (CPRO) Rajesh Kumar claimed that the lockdown had hit the ongoing railway projects in Bihar. “Works like construction of new lines, rail bridges and foot overbridges as well as doubling of tracks and gauge conversion have been affected. Even after the lockdown ends, it will take time for the railways to restart the suspended projects,” the CPRO told this newspaper.

During the current fiscal, a sum of Rs 1,113 crore has been allocated to the ECR for completion of the Koderma-Ranchi, Koderma-Tilaiya, Hajipur-Sugauli, Bihta-Aurangabad and Motihari-Sitamarhi new rail line projects. Another Rs 2,243 crore has been allocated for track doubling work on the Kiul-Gaya, Samastipur-Darbhanga, Hajipur-Bachhwara, Karaila Road-Shaktinagar, Danea-Ranchi Road, Garwa Road-Ramna and Ramna-Singrauli routes.

“The Patliputra-Pahleza Ghat new line work, the yard remodelling work at Kiul and Lakhisarai and the gauge conversion work on the Sakri-Laukaha Bazar and Jayanagar-Bardibas routes are also likely to be delayed, leading to additional expenditure. The lockdown has created labour crisis,” the CPRO said.

He added, “The lockdown has affected production work at the Bela wheel factory in Saran district and the electric locomotive manufacturing unit at Madhepura. Except track maintenance work, nothing else is being done under the ECR’s jurisdiction due to the lockdown.”

MUMBAI: HDFC Bank may have to finalise potential successors for Aditya Puri by June 2020. In revised guidelines, the RBI has said that proposals for the appointment of a new MD & CEO of a bank should contain a panel of at least two names in the order of preference and should be submitted at least four months before the expiry of the term of office of the present incumbent.

Puri, who is 69 years old, will complete his term in October 2020. Also, in the case of reappointments, the RBI has said that it must receive six months in advance an application along with the completion of fit and proper formalities by a board-level committee. The fit and proper guidelines include a declaration and undertaking from the candidate certified by the nomination and remuneration committee of the board.

The revised guidelines were issued by the RBI on Tuesday. The declaration includes details of the investment, proceedings against the candidate and disclosure of any instance where the candidate has been reprimanded, censured, restricted, suspended or barred by any financial sector regulator.

HDFC Bank had earlier this year said that it would tap executive search firm Egon Zehnder to help identify a successor to Puri. It was widely expected that it would take until July 2020 for the board-level committee to finalise a successor.

MUMBAI: The government has extended the term of RBI deputy governor B P Kanungo by a year even as N S Vishwanathan , another deputy governor, stepped down three months ahead of the end of his tenure. The RBI reallocated the portfolio managed by Vishwanathan among the three other deputy governors, Kanungo, M K Jain and M D Patra.

Jain will be in charge of regulation and supervision, which are now consolidated departments unlike in the past when they were split for banking and non-banking entities. He will also be in charge of communications.

In a statement on Tuesday, the RBI said Kanungo’s reappointment was for a period of one year effective April 3, or until further orders.

Kanungo has under Vishwanathan at the RBI the department of currency management, department of external investments & operations, department of government & bank accounts, department of information technology and department of payment & settlement system. Other departments are Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC), foreign exchange department, internal debt management department, legal department and right to information departments.

Vishwanathan was reappointed deputy governor for one year but chose to step down early, according to sources, on grounds of health. Vishwanathan was in charge of the important department of supervision, which had come to the fore in recent years due to the divergence in bad loans detected by the RBI and those published by banks. He served under three governors, Raghuram Rajan , Urjit Patel and Shaktikanta Das .

Also, investors’ wealth erosion of Rs 42.6 lakh crore, with BSE ’s market capitalisation now at Rs 112.6 lakh crore, was the sharpest, official data showed.Foreign investors too took out over Rs 48,000 crore during the quarter, again making the three-month period the worst ever. Mutual funds, however, have acted as the cushion in the face of strong FPI selling and have recorded a net buying figure of about Rs 37,500 crore.On Tuesday, of the sensex’s 30 constituents, 26 ended higher while IndusInd Bank, of late being hammered due to asset quality concerns, led the slide with a 14.7% crash. However, the sensex was helped by a strong rally in index heavyweight Reliance Industries, along with across-the-board short-covering and index management by large funds on the last day of the financial year.According to a note by Kotak Securities EVP (equity technical research) Shrikant Chouhan, the day’s gains could be called the yearly and quarterly NAV management day for the market with several of the large-cap stocks closing at the day’s high. Technically, if the Nifty falls below 8,350 level, it would retreat further to 8,250 or even up to 8,000 level,Chouhan said, “Global markets are doing better than expected, but our markets are trading cautiously due to consistent selling from foreign institutions.”In Tuesday’s session, it was RIL that rallied over 8% and contributed about a fifth of the sensex’s gains, which came after the company said late on Monday that its board on April 2 would consider fund-raising. The decision by the company comes in the backdrop of an expected delay in stake buy by global oil major Saudi Aramco in RIL’s refinery business.

49,['1/04/2020'],HipBar offers digital help to overcome withdrawal symptoms &amp; lockdown blues,"Chennai: Diageo-backed liquor-tech start up HipBar has offered its bouquet of tech-services to the Tamil Nadu and Kerala state governments, which will ensure safe alcohol home delivery to bonafide consumers, satisfying the primal objective of social distancing.

The platform which to deliver with proper checks including age verification, it could well turn out to be the perfect via media. With lockdown shutting down liquor supplies across states, withdrawal related issues are sweeping across the country. States such as Kerala has seen seven suicides as tipplers were denied their quota of booze, cases of spurious liquor and home brewing is surfacing, opening a newer set of problems to an already stretched government machinery.

Kerala Government had announced prescriptions from government doctors for dispensing liquor to the dependents, and this was shot down by the IMA.

HipBar, whose payment solutions are currently used by TASMAC, ran India’s first alcohol home delivery service in Bengaluru from August 2017 to November 2018 before facing legal headwinds. From its on ground experience, it developed an e-governance technology platform to help governments to organise and manage last mile delivery of alcoholic beverages in two working models, the hyperlocal model (Swiggy / Zomato) and the next day delivery model (BigBasket / Grofers). The state excise departments control the supply chain using a number of archaic methods like licenses and passes in movement of alcoholic beverages. HipBar said, when its technology is put to use, it can effectively regulate the last mile deliveries from a single dashboard. HipBar says if the governments want to cater to the alcohol deprived in a state of lockdown, home delivery can be operationalised almost immediately. “We are ready and waiting by the phones. States will realise that technology assisted home delivery of alcoholic beverages is better than the status quo on all fronts. Technology assisted alcohol home delivery is not a poor alternative. It's the best way to regulate consumption at a micro level and implement the moderation agenda at scale,” said Prasanna Natarajan, CEO, HipBar.

50,['1/04/2020'],Loan EMI Moratorium: Banks to roll out EMI waiver options soon,"(1/2) Clarification regarding Covid19 relief measures on Loan Repayment. Three months deferment is automatic & cust… https://t.co/CEUaNqeMdk — Central Bank of India (@centralbank_in) 1585665601000

MUMBAI: Banks will soon come out with the operational procedure for retail borrowers to avail a three-month moratorium on their loans. Most lenders plan to send out text messages and emails allowing borrowers to avail the facility, while some have already done so.State Bank of India said that its technical team was working on the RBI circular and giving an option may take some time as this requires changes in current systems and procedures. The bank told customers that if an EMI was debited and they wish to avail the moratorium, they can contact the branch to initiate the refund process. ICICI Bank sources said that it was working late into the night to create a channel to give an option to customers.On Monday, banks had a video-conference under the Indian Banks Association, where it was decided that the option has to be rolled out to all borrowers. HDFC , the country’s largest housing finance company, said that it would start sending out options to borrowers on whether to avail of the moratorium or not.Lenders across the board stressed the point that the moratorium was not a waiver of interest and that the interest for the three months would be recovered from the borrower. They also stressed that borrowers whose cash flows were unaffected should continue to repay their instalments as always.Meanwhile, to reassure borrowers, a host of public sector banks took to social media to say that a moratorium would be made available. Bank of Baroda said that it was providing the moratorium on all instalments falling due between March 1 to May 31 for all term loans, including corporate, medium and small enterprises.“EMIs of housing loans, vehicle loans, MSME loans and payment of all other term loans falling due after March 1 and up to May 31 have been deferred by 3 months,” Syndicate Bank said. UCO Bank told borrowers that it has granted moratorium of three instalments of term loans up to May 31. “The next instalment is now payable in June 2020. Your repayment schedule will be extended accordingly,” the bank said.Central Bank of India indicated in a tweet that the moratorium will be given to all. “Three months deferment is automatic & customers need not approach bank for the same,” the bank said. “However, customers may approach the bank to change the standing instructions or any other mandate given by them for payment of their loan instalment. Interest will accrue in loan accounts but no penal interest. March 20 instalment already paid will be automatically appropriated towards next EMI due, that is for June 20,” the tweet said.Banking sources said that the RBI circular was not a directive to lenders to grant a moratorium to borrowers but a permission in case they wanted to grant relief. “It is up to each individual bank to take a view according to their credit policy,” he said.Lenders said that it was taking long as some of the matters had to be referred to board-level committees to enforce. Lenders said that they were seeking clarification from the RBI on whether it was necessary to recover interest from business immediately at the end of three months as mentioned in the central bank’s circular. “If we postpone for only three months and seek recovery immediately after that, it would be a burden on the borrower,” said a bank chief.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74922772,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61398,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-to-roll-out-emi-waiver-options-soon/articleshow/74921490.cms
51,['1/04/2020'],No change in power subsidy: Bihar minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav,"Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav

PATNA: Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, there is some good news for power consumers as the new tariff rate for 2020-21 fiscal with 10 paise per unit lower charges for all category of power consumers will come into effect from Wednesday (April 1) without any reduction in subsidy.

Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) had announced the new tariff rates on March 20 on zero subsidy basis. Energy minister Bijendra Prasad Yadav said the subsidy to be given to the power consumers will remain unchanged.

“It has been decided in principle by the government that subsidy given to the power consumers against their electricity bills will remain unchanged. A final announcement regarding the same will be made in a few days,” he said.

The decision to keep the power subsidy unchanged will benefit power consumers in Bihar as the BERC has reduced the power tariff for the first time in 15 years. The tariff rates will further come down after introduction of subsidy.

For instance, after the announcement of subsidy last year, the effective rate for domestic power consumption in urban areas came down to Rs 5.40 per unit and Rs 3.17 per unit in rural areas despite a marginal hike in the tariff order of BERC.

The practice of zero subsidy tariff petition was introduced in 2016-17 fiscal. The subsidy is announced by the state government after finalisation of tariff by the BERC.

“The subsidy against power consumption normally varies in the range of Rs 2,500crore-Rs 4,500 crore. Thus, cabinet’s nod is required as it involves huge funds,” he said.

In 2018, the state cabinet had approved Rs 4,137 crore for giving subsidy to power consumers.

Another reason to rejoice for the power consumer is the decision of discoms to abolish meter rent, which are basically monthly fixed charges for energy meters.

57,['1/04/2020'],Heartrending scenes as two victims cremated,"KABUL GURDWARA ATTACK

Ludhiana: Heart-breaking scenes were witnessed at the homes of two Ludhiana residents who were among those killed in the terror attack on a gurdwara in Kabul. Their families caught their last glimpse before they were cremated at a ground near Daresi.

The bodies reached Ludhiana early Tuesday morning. Shankar Singh of Chawni Mohalla and Jeevan Singh of Nanak Nagar in Ludhiana were among those killed on March 25. The families had insisted that they wanted to see their faces one last time before they were cremated, so the bodies were brought in a special flight from Kabul to Delhi airport.

Sunny Chawla, brother-in-law of Shankar Singh, said his sister-in-law along with the bodies had reached Delhi airport around 5pm on Monday, but they had to complete certain formalities before being allowed to travel to Ludhiana. He added that four relatives accompanied them and they reached Ludhiana around 4am.

“The bodies were taken to the civil hospital for some tests before the cremation. My brother-in-law’s family, including his wife, three daughters and three sons, were at the cremation, besides other relatives. Harpreet Kaur, wife of deceased Jeevan Singh, her 13-year-old son and two daughters were also present at the cremation,” he added.

“After the cremation, my sister-in-law Topi Kaur was tested at the civil hospital. Now she is admitted to the isolation ward of the civil hospital though she has no symptoms of coronavirus.”

He said Topi Kaur was an Afghan passport-holder, but would not return to Kabul, as there was no one from her family there now.

An eyewitness said about 100 persons attended the cremation.

Ludhiana (north) MLA Rakesh Pandey represented the state government and laid a wreath with the message, “From the people of Punjab, India”, on the bodies.

Police had made adequate arrangements for the cremation with ADCP-I Gurpreet Sikand also in attendance.

Their children were inconsolable. Their close relatives said the deceased were lone breadwinners of their families.

Manjeet Singh, brother-in-law of Shankar Singh, said he has left behind wife and six children, and none of them earn. He said his nephew, Akash, had a rehri at Ghanta Ghar Chowk and his two other nephews, Gurri and Babbu, who were between 14 and 16 years old, respectively, did not work. “My brother-in-law would send them money for their basic needs. My nieces, Kiran and Simran, study in classes IX and X, and their sister Roshni left studies after Class VIII. I don’t know how they will manage. We request the government to provide compensation to the family and also give job to a member.”

‘Went to Kabul 9 yrs ago’

A relative of deceased Shankar Singh said he had gone to Kabul about nine years ago and was in cloth business there. He added that the deceased would daily do service in the gurdwara for about one-and-a-half hours.

‘Was to come on Baisakhi’

A relative of Jeevan Singh said the deceased had told them that he would return on Baisakhi and get one of his two daughters married. He said the deceased has left behind a seven-year-old son, two daughters and wife. The relative said both Shankar and Jeevan were Afghanistan citizens and had learned the local language well. Vishal Singh, son of Jeevan Singh, said he studied in Class VI and the government should help them. His mother, Harpreet Kaur, said she has no source of livelihood and they live on rent. Apart from her son, she has two daughters, 19-year-old Simran and 13-year-old Kesar. She said her husband had gone to Kabul to work about eight years ago and he had recently come to India and left on February 4 after fixing marriage of their elder daughter.

The NGO has crowd-sourced the money beside pooling funds from its office-bearers in two days to provide the safety kit to IGGMCH. The NGO has offered an ambulance and masks to them.

Nagpur First is also reaching out to citizens for donation to help doctors in their fight against Covid-19.

Following shortage of safety kits and sanitizers, an emotional post went viral pleading for support to doctors at IGGMCH, also known as Mayo Hospital, where an isolation ward for positive Covid-19 patients has been set up. The other is at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH).

“If you are affected by coronavirus, there is a good chance of recovery, but you need a doctor to treat you,” the post reads. It goes on to seek personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and N95 masks for hospital doctors who are in the frontline in fight against the disease. “As the patients increase, they will need protection. They can’t stay home like other citizens. We need to protect young doctors risking their lives,” it says.

Nagpur First treasurer Sachin Jaghirdar said, “We are getting sanitizers from a village near Narsinghpur in Madhya Pradesh. The supplier is charging us Rs125 per litre. Before pledging the sanitizers, we had collected funds by making a public appeal at our level.”

“Personally, I reached out to my contacts as well. Local individuals connected to Nagpur First contributed money. As of now, in two days of appeal starting from March 29, we have collected Rs1.5 lakh. Some kits form this money will also be distributed through city authorities,” he said.

The NGO’s trustee Tanveer Mirza, who is a TOI Nagpur Hero, is coordinating the distribution of washable masks across the city.

Jaghirdar said the ambulance is ready but Mayo authorities do not need it as of now. “But anybody can reach Nagpur First if they need the ambulance free of cost,” he said.

Nagpur International diaspora is also contributing for the big fight back. “Chairman (international) Dinesh Jain, co-chairman Shashank Rao, chairman (India operations) Hemant Lodha and secretary Faiz Wahid are contributing from the respective countries they are based out of,” he said.

62,['1/04/2020'],Lockdown effect: Air quality improves across Andhra cities,"Vijayawada: It been a week since the nation-wide lockdown was announced and Andhra Pradesh has already witnessed a huge improvement in terms of air pollution.

The difference has been particularly noticeable in urban areas like Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tirupati and Velagapudi areas, where the Air Quality Index (AQI) values have dropped below 50, marking the present status as ‘good’.

In Visakhapatnam, the AQI value stood at around 121 on March 1 deeming it ‘moderately polluted’. A day after Janata Curfew on March 21, it fell to 45 and entered the ‘good’ category.

Speaking to TOI, BV Prasad, junior scientist of Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (APPCB) said the air quality in Vijayawada and elsewhere in Andhra Pradesh earlier was satisfactory (AQI between 51 and 100) before the lockdown.

“During the lockdown in most of the cities it is good. (AQI below 50). However, air quality will return to its original quality of satisfactory AQI, once the lockdown is lifted,” Prasad told TOI.

AQI dropped to its lowest, 31, after the lockdown in Tirumala. The most prominent pollution parameter across the urban areas in the Andhra Pradesh happens to be PM10 and PM2.5 particles. The lockdown has been most effective in improving the air quality in Vijayawada. The capital region of Amaravati, too, saw a massive improvement with the present AQI value falling down to 36. AQI of Rajahmundry is at 50, which is categorised as ‘good’.

However, in terms of water pollution, officials said there will only be a minimal impact even if there is no pilgrimage activity on the river banks.

“Usually there is a minimal impact on water quality of river Krishna by the pilgrim activity and the impact is localised. It is the domestic sewage generated by Vijayawada that is adversely affecting the quality of water. There is no letup in that. Hence, there won’t be any lockdown effect on water quality of river Krishna,” Prasad added.

“We are tracing contact details and local travel history of the deceased from last two days. He had been to Yavatmal district, in Darwha tehsil, some days ago,” said Dr Premchand Pandit, civil surgeon of Buldhana.

“There had been some positive patients in Yavatmal earlier. We have alerted police and health agencies there. They will now see whether the person had any contact history with any of the positive patients in Yavatmal,” he added.

Meanwhile, the health department continued its door-to-door survey and contact tracing drive on Tuesday. Samples of some more contacts of the 60 admitted in isolation facility will be tested on Wednesday.

A complete lockdown is being observed in Buldhana city, with the district borders sealed. Even shops of essential goods are not open in the locality where the positive patients used to reside. Health officials conducted a survey of every house in this locality.

During this survey, some rumour mongers circulated a message on social media that this was a survey for NPR and NRC. So, many residents started opposing the survey. Eventually, higher authorities had to intervene and convince people that the survey was regarding Covid-19 only.

Suspecting local spread of Covid-19, the district administration of Buldhana has taken some very important steps on Tuesday. On April 1, a WHO-sponsored online session about Covid-19 has been organized for all local doctors in Buldhana from 3 to 5pm. Dr Sanjay Suryawanshi and Dr Mujib of WHO will answer questions of local doctors on Zoom platform.

In the first week, Rs 1.5-crore fine was collected and 2.7 lakh cases were disposed after 37,000 vehicle owners responded to the scheme. The response got even better when sergeants started collecting fines on the road. Till March 20, total collection of fines reached over Rs 5.5 crore.Ever since the lockdown was imposed, the collection of fines, however, reduced to a trickle. Total amount collected on March 31 is a little more than Rs 15 lakh, though online collection is still active. Senior traffic department officials said that the deadline for the fine collection is likely to be extended beyond March 31.Police sources said the lockdown affected the popular scheme in two ways: physical absence of vehicles on road, which means police had little option of pursuing anyone, particularly commercial vehicles like buses and taxis. Secondly, cops have been busy with the enforcement of lockdown and other duties associated with keeping the Covid-19 menace at bay.“We expect that the scheme will continue, but we will have to take a decision based on ground realities. We might reintroduce the scheme once things get normal,” said the police officer. The joint CP (Traffic) Santosh Pandey said that the traffic department’s priority goes to Covid-19 and the scheme has not been suspended for a single day as “it can be settled online.” The last round of waivers — one that ran for 75 days — had yielded around Rs 40 crore, compared to the paltry Rs 6 crore in a 30-day period this time.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/traffic-fine-waiver-rs-5-5cr-till-mar-20-rs-15l-during-lockdown/articleshow/74921411.cms

HARIDWAR: After six coronavirus-positive Tablighi Jamaat members died in Telangana , city administration has sounded an alert and is tracing the members of the congregation from Uttarakhand who attended a religious event in Delhi’s Nizamuddin with infected patients. The event was reportedly attended by about 2,000 Tablighi Jamaat members from March 13 to March 15.

According to sources, 34 state residents, who are part of the group, attended the religious event at Nizamuddin.

So far, 26 members from the state have been quarantined in Delhi. We are tracing the rest of them and they will be quarantined as soon as possible.”

Meanwhile, the local intelligence unit is also tracing those members of Tablighi Jamaat who had reached Haridwar from other states before the lockdown. Such members might also be quarantined. According to sources, 14 members of the congregation had come to Haridwar from different states to preach in city mosques.

NEW DELHI: India is likely to start manufacturing new serological diagnostic testing kits within the next two months as many advances have been made after the virus was isolated by research agencies, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said.ICMR’s chief epidemiologist and communicable disease expert Dr R R Gangakhedkar said once the virus has been isolated, it helps in taking research forward for developing diagnostic kits, medicines and vaccines and India is working in that direction.“We are hopeful that at least a serological diagnostic testing will be made in India in next one to two months,” Dr Gangakhedkar said. Serological tests are tests that look for antibodies in blood and help in diagnosing diseases.Meanwhile, to take speedy decisions on R&D for SARS-CoV2 and Covid-19 , the government formed a science and technology committee co-chaired by V K Paul and principal scientific adviser K Vijayraghavan . The committee will work in coordination with Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), department of biotechnology(DBT), department of science and technology (DST) and other science agencies, scientists, industries and regulatory bodies for taking quick decisions on solutions to the disease.The committee has given its consent to institutes under DST, DBT, CSIR, DAE, DRDO and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) to self-assess and prepare their labs for research and testing through standard and rigorous protocol.Besides, ICMR with its strength in clinical trials and operation research is working with the DBT and CSIR on the agenda of developing a vaccine for the Covid-19 disease.Amid concerns of time lag in giving approval to private testing laboratories, Dr Gangakhedkar categorically said “there is no time lag”.“There is no delay, we are allowing those who are fitting into criterion. Now, the kit has to be procured by them. If they face problem in that, then they have to resolve it. We cannot do anything about it,” Dr Gangakhedkar said.He further clarified that the slight delay in reporting of approvals could be because of the load on data entry operators which takes a few hours.So far, the ICMR has approved 49 private labs and 399 patients have been tested in these labs.ICMR maintained there are adequate capacity and stocks of reagents in government labs to meet the current testing requirements.“The kits used in public sector labs are being procured and stored by us and we are not facing any problems in that,” he said.Till Tuesday, a total of around 42,788 tests were conducted by government diagnostic labs. So far, 123 public sector labs are functional under ICMR to test Covid-19. However, given the current testing protocols, India at present is using only 36% of this capacity.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74921924,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-380648,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/new-test-kits-likely-in-2-months-icmr/articleshow/74921888.cms
68,['1/04/2020'],"All Vidarbha patients asymptomatic, will recover","Nagpur: Amid the Covid-19 scare, there is some heartening news. Even though there are a dozen positive patients in Nagpur, none of them is critically ill. Excluding one woman who is 60, all are under 50 years of age and three are under 19. All of them are asymptomatic carriers and don’t have any ailment or complaints related to health. According to doctors, these have all the chances of making full recovery provided they follow medication schedule and isolation rules strictly.

“All nine patients admitted in Mayo isolation ward are doing well. We have patients right from a 12-year-old girl to a 60-year-old woman. All of them are asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus. Doctors are monitoring their crucial health parameters periodically,” said a doctor treating these patients at IGGMCH.

As they are not showing any symptoms or having any complaints, doctors are concentrating on improving their immunity. Fluids, multivitamins are given to them along with nutritious protein-rich food. Those having diabetes and hypertension are continuing their regular medicines while in isolation. Some were so enthusiastic that they recorded motivational video messages and shared it on social media platforms.

In GMCH, all three patients admitted are from the same family. They are husband, wife and their son. As husband is suffering from paralysis, he is given separate medicines while the other two are taking common fluids and multivitamins.

“We have experience of treating asymptomatic patients. Three such patients have already recovered and discharged from GMCH. Our focus is on maintaining their critical health parameters like temperature, blood pressure, and ensure ample rest to all of them,” said a professor from medicine department of GMCH.

In Yavatmal, three patients who recovered were all above 50 years of age. One of them was having fever. Still, all of them recovered and were discharged. In Gondia, a 23-year-old youth is admitted in GMCH and he is also an asymptomatic carrier.

“If we refer available preliminary data, age and co-morbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and obesity play vital roles in Covid-19. All other patients have great chances of recovery,” said a doctor in Gondia GMCH.

While this is good news for Nagpur, people must understand that following social distancing and lockdown is important at least for next two weeks. Social distancing is the only way to avoid spread of infection.

Covid-19 Still Controllable Here

* Nagpur city has had total 16 Covid-19 ccases so far, 4 of them have recovered

* In Vidarbha, total number of cases is 23, and seven have recovered

* No patient admitted in Vidarbha was critical nor anyone needed ventilator support

69,['1/04/2020'],"Admin limits veggie vehicles, brokers at Kalamna mkt yard","Many people thronged Kalamna Market to buy and sell vegetables

Nagpur: In a bid to avoid large gatherings and people throwing caution to the wind at wholesale Kalamna and Cotton Markets, the district administration has decided to allow only 100 vegetable vehicles and 50 brokers to do business per day.

“In view of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, it has been decided to restrict the number of people at the markets. There are around 300 brokers and they will be allowed to work on rotation basis till the lockdown period,” said Rajesh Bhusari, administrator, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Kalamna market yard.

Additional municipal commissioner Ram Joshi said, “The collector has taken the decision to stop crowding. At least 8,000 people throng Kalamna daily. Now, this crowd will be distributed to 24 grounds identified by the NMC in 10 zones from where farmers will sell vegetables directly. All retail vendors and people can buy from these grounds. This will help avoid large assembly of people at one place.”

The decision, however, did not augur well with the farmers and brokers. Vinod Lokhande, one of the leading vegetable brokers at Kalamna, said, “The rush at Kalamna on Tuesday was due to closure of vegetable market for four days from Friday to Monday. So, on Tuesday when the market opened, there was huge rush. The decision by Vegetable Brokers Association to close market for three days was wrong.”

“Secondly, due to closure of Cotton Market, farmers reached Kalamna to sell their produce. On Tuesday, there were 3,000 vehicles, the number of which otherwise remains around 500 daily. For smooth supply of vegetables, the administration should impose time restriction from 5am to 9am instead of market closures,” said Lokhande.

Lokhande said, “Brokers take guarantee to sell farmers’ produce. We also take risk in case it does not sell. On Tuesday, as limited vehicles were allowed, farmers sold their produce at throwaway price standing outside the Kalamna Market. There was a line of vehicles up to 3km.”

Another broker Rahul Rakhe said, “It is the local people who are into panic buying. As weekly markets are closed, wholesalers are not coming and 70% buyers are residents. Kalamna vegetable market on Tuesday was more of a result of mismanagement.”

“Another issue grappling is the foodgrain supplies. As police are not allowing private carriers and labourers inside, wholesale traders are not coming to buy foodgrains. Even though foodgrains come under essential commodities, its supplies are restricted. The business has come down to 25%,” said Gulab Balkote, one of the leading brokers.

In March, there used to be supply of 5,000 sacks each of tur, gram and wheat. Due to lockdown, it has been restricted to 500-1500 sacks.

Balkote said, “There are 500 labourers at the grain yard. Amid exodus of labourers, we managed to stop 100 of them from UP, Bihar and Chhattisgarh by offering them 50kg rice, 50kg wheat flour and 15kg tur dal.”

However, even as the administration is imposing restrictions, no social distancing is followed. Though sanitizers have been placed at the main entrances, Bhusari said, “We are facing shortage of sanitizer stock.”

72,['1/04/2020'],About 400 youths in Pusad for job ‘dumped’ at 2 hostels,"Though food is being served at the hostels, people aren’t following social distancing

Yavatmal: The curfew imposed to contain the coronavirus spread has aggravated woes of 418 youths who have been staying in two hostels and rented rooms at Pusad for the last 10 months. About 400 inmates at the hostels are living in inhumane condition without food, water or medicines. The hostels were locked from outside and the youths were not even allowed to go out to stock up essentials.

On receiving a tip off, TOI contacted the hostel inmates. A few of them, on condition of anonymity, narrated their plight.

It is learnt 1,600 educated youths were allegedly sent to Pusad by a Delhi-based company ‘Glaze Trading India Pvt Ltd,’ with its office at Janakpuri area of the country’s capital, after hiring them from various parts of the country.

The company allegedly lured these youths by offering various incentives through social media. Over 1,000 were provided accommodation in hostels of BP Ed College and BN Engineering College. The remaining stayed in private rented rooms in Shreerampur area where the company has it branch. Now, 418 youths are staying at these three locations while whereabouts of the remaining are not known.

The youths were allegedly also not paid salary. A few of them were given only a few hundreds as incentive. The company’s office in Shreerampur is closed and the manager is untraceable. None of the inmates either knows the names or contact numbers of their bosses.

TOI alerted district collector MD Singh on Monday night who moved his machinery to save the starving youths at the hostels.

On directives of the collector, Pusad tehsildar Vaishak Rahurwagh visited the hostels on Tuesday. According to Vaishak, 134 youths are housed in the BP Ed College hostel, 259 in BN Engineering College hostel and 25 in Shreerampur.

The tehsildar summoned a medical team which examined the youths. The company markets medicines for skin care among other products. Ironically, the youths are suffering from contagious diseases like scabies, chickenpox fever, cough and similar infections, the tehsildar said. The toilets at the hostels are uncleaned for days together and garbage is lying scattered.

It is learnt, the doctor who checked the sick inmates gave them sleeping pills and two other tablets.

Vaishak claimed food grains have been sent to the hostel, but the inmates told TOI that they were not served food till 2pm on Tuesday. In the morning they were given only poha, the inmates said. The canteens at the hostels were closed down on Tuesday.

The tehsildar is likely to file an FIR against the company for deceiving the youths, most of them hailing from south Indian states like Tamil Nandu, Kerala and Karnataka.

Civic officials said all weekly vegetable and roadside markets, which were closed either due to the anti-encroachment drive or the coronavirus scare, will be shifted to playgrounds.

Out of the 10 zones, the NMC is allowing farmers to sell vegetables in open spaces or playgrounds in nine zones, excluding Satranjipura zone. The NMC, with the help of vegetable growers, is also planning to provide fresh vegetables at the doorstep of citizens in each and every locality from April 1, stated a press note released by the NMC.

Despite the lockdown and appeal to ensure social distancing in public places, there was no response from the public, especially at places like Cotton Market, Gokulpeth road market and other market places in the city.

As NMC’s marking to maintain social distancing failed to get the desired results, the city police took control and prevented people from crowding markets.

With Cotton Market shutting down temporarily, farmers from nearby villages and towns will now sell their produce directly to citizens in the open places.

The 24 places for the markets were identified by the assistant commissioners of nine zones. The NMC has also put some guidelines in place for vegetable vendors. Permission to sell vegetables will be given to those who follow the rules, clarified the press note.

The NMC has chalked out terms and conditions for entering the market and they include following social distancing, marking to avoid crowding, keep valid documents of vehicles and driving licence. If the driver has cold, cough or fever then he should get himself examined at a nearby government hospital.

While some outlets have cordoned off their shops dealing with customers standing outside, others have barred entry of more than one person at a time. At least one oil agency has promised to waive off coolie charges if a customer pays through digital wallet and does not come to their place physically.

Posta and Burrabazar are the biggest wholesale hubs in the state where lakhs, including traders, labourers, drivers, helpers and customers congregate every day. The gathering has not been huge since the lockdown as most of the establishments have remained shut but they want to implement a standard operating procedure for the coming weeks.

Several department stores and even retail markets are trying to decrease crowding in the market and also washing or sanitising hands before entering. The objective of the three-week long lockdown is to isolate people and prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading.

“Till now, all our efforts were focussed on getting the market open and making it operational. Now, we were concentrating on getting hold of labourers and delivering goods to the retailers. We have also started receiving good to replenish the stock to some extent. In a wholesale market where thousands of people work together, it is very difficult to practice social distancing, but we are trying to put in place a norm where some sort of isolation can be practiced,” said Biswanath Agarwal, general secretary of the Posta Bazar Merchants’ Association.

The owners of Anshul Trading have cordoned off the entry gate of their shop with a rope. They are dealing with the customers from the other side. After the deal is finalised, only one labourer can enter and lift the goods. “We cannot sit at home because we deal in essential commodities. But the threat of novel coronavirus is equally dangerous for us, which is why we have restricted entry to the shop,” said Sanjay Goel, one of workers in the shop that deals in biscuits, papad, besan and makai.

Navratan, a cooking oil agency, has waived off coolie charges for customers paying through digital wallet. “Nowadays, the means of communication are excellent, and a person need not go to a shop physically to purchase. We will waive off their coolie charges for those who place orders over phone and pay through digital wallet,” said Madhusudan Binani, owner of the agency. Platinum, another oil agency, has curtailed its working hours. The outlet is now open till 1pm only. “We want to do business but, in the meantime, save ourselves and our employees too,” said one of the owners.

The merchants’ association has instructed the labourers to wear masks and wash their hands regularly. Food is being provided by the association.

COIMBATORE: The city police are planning to deploy drones to monitor people’s movement at markets and other places, and depute cops, who are below 50 years of age, for vehicle check as part of the precautionary measures to contain Covid-19.

In the past, the city police had used three drones to monitor the rallies that were taken out both in support of and against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Many anti-CAA public meetings were also monitored with the help of drones.

Now, they are mulling the option of using the drones for “patrolling” during lockdown.

While the public have been advised to come out only to buy essential commodities, police have been seizing vehicles form the people, who have been coming out deliberately in violation of prohibitory orders.

City police commissioner Sumit Sharan said they have been controlling the movement of public in the city. “We plan to use drones to identify people, who are deliberately coming out and gathering at a place in large numbers. We have already deployed more than 1,200 cops, who are working in two shifts in the city, to identify such people.”

In another instance, inspector general of police (west zone) K Periaiah inspected security arrangements in Coimbatore, Tirupur and Nilgiris districts. He visited Thudiyalur , Periyanaickenpalayam , Karamadai and Mettupalayam in Coimbatore, inter-district border on Annur-Avinashi Road, and toll plazas at Kaniyur and Vijayamangalam.

Periaiah urged the motorists to use face mask and hand sanitizers.

HYDERABAD: A 38-year-old man was nabbed by the city police on Tuesday and sent to jail for circulating a fake government order (GO) on social media stating that the excise department will open liquor shops. The fake GO had gone viral on social media.

The accused was identified as K Sanish Kumar alias Sunny, a resident of Uppal. On Saturday, cybercrime police received a complaint from Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), state task force and excise department. The excise department stated that few miscreants created a fake order by forging the signature of the director of prohibition and excise department and were circulating it on social media which stated that liquor shops would be open from 2pm to 5.30pm on March 29.

“This is a fabrication and the state government and the prohibition and excise department have not issued any such orders,” stated the complaint.

According to cybercrime police, notices were served to five other persons for forwarding the order to others.

The accused was booked under relevant sections of the IPC and the IT Act and sent to jail. “This is a warning to those who want to create or circulate fake news,” said an officer from Hyderabad commissionerate.

NEW DELHI: Delhi government will expand its base to feed the poor and start distributing cooked meal for 10-12 lakh people twice a day at about 2,800 locations from Wednesday.

According to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP government is at present providing ‘jan ahaar’ to almost four lakh people at 800-odd locations in the capital.

To ensure that social distancing was maintained at each hunger relief centre, the Delhi government has now decided to add 2,000 more locations from Wednesday.

Officials said the district magistrates of each of the 11 districts along with officials of the directorate of education (DoE) have been asked to identify schools or other prominent government buildings and set up hunger relief centres.

The locations, said officials, will be in close proximity to jhuggi clusters, resettlement colonies and those pockets where the daily wagers and poor reside so that they don’t have to walk long distances for food.

The government had earlier set up two feeding centres in schools in each municipal ward. With enough space for people to stand and maintain social distancing, the schools were the ideal locations for the purpose, said an official.

The decision to add more such locations was taken during a video conference chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to review the measures taken to contain Covid-19. Kejriwal, some of his cabinet colleagues and top officers of Delhi government and police attended the video conference.

According to officials, the LG expressed concern over reports of violation of social distancing norms at some of the food distribution centres. “The LG clearly stated that ensuring social distancing should be the topmost priority at the moment to prevent Covid-19 from spreading in the capital. In view of such reports it was agreed upon that the number of food distribution centres should be increased from present 500 to 2,500 so that social distancing is adhered to effectively,” said an official.

The Delhi government currently runs 568 hunger relief centres, each having the capacity to provide food to 500 people. In addition, about 260-odd night shelters also provide cooked food largely to the homeless apart from any other person willing to eat there.

“Right now, food is available at around 800 locations in Delhi. From Wednesday, 2,500 schools and 250 night shelters will start distributing food for 500 people each, which makes it a total of 2,800 centres. We were feeding 3.5-4 lakh people daily and from tomorrow and we will start feeding 10-12 lakh people from tomorrow,” Kejriwal said in his digital press conference on Tuesday, adding that people were crowding at the food centres leading to the decision to increase their numbers.

WHO has described as myth, the argument that bodies of Covid-19 patients should be cremated. The dignity of the dead, their cultural and religious traditions and their families should be respected and protected throughout. Hasty disposal of a Covid-19 dead person should be avoided.“It is a myth that persons who have died of a communicable disease should be cremated, but this is not true. Cremation is a matter of cultural choice and available resources,” WHO said in its interim guidelines on how to deal with the bodies of Covid-19 victims. The guidelines gain significance in the backdrop of the alleged order of Mumbai municipal commissioner that the bodies of the victims, irrespective of their religion, should be cremated.WHO further elaborated that authorities should manage each situation on a case-by-case basis, balancing the rights of the family, need to investigate the cause of death and the risks of exposure to infection.The interim guidelines warn that children and adults above 60 years and immuno-suppressed persons should not directly interact with the body.“Based on current evidence, the coronavirus is transmitted between people through droplets, fomites and close contact, with possible spread through faeces. It is not airborne. As this is a new virus whose source and disease progression are not yet entirely clear, more precautions may be used until further information becomes available,” WHO said.According to WHO, except in cases of haemorrhagic fevers (such as Ebola, Marburg) and cholera, bodies are generally not infectious. Only the lungs of patients with pandemic influenza, if handled improperly during an autopsy, can be infectious. Otherwise, cadavers do not transmit diseases.“Till date, there is no evidence of persons having become infected from exposure to the bodies of persons, who died of Covid-19,” WHO said, adding that the safety and well-being of everyone who tends to bodies should be the priority.

Police have also warned people not to share any rumours carrying uncertified and unscientific information on Covid-19. Any person who shares such posts will be booked under violation of Section 144 and Disaster Management Act.

During lockdown, messages offering “free Internet data” are being circulated over social media platforms, Bhopal Police told TOI on Tuesday. These messages have a link — clicking on which may give fraudsters an opening to steal private data from your device, including siphoning off money from your digital wallets, said ASP cybercrime branch, Sandesh Jain.

Jain said, another message which is doing the rounds of social media is of “free recharge” offered by the government. It even has names of Prime Minister, CM and other ministers, he said, adding that no such scheme is being run by the government and people are advised to not trust any such message or forward them to others.

While the JU students have formed Commune, a community kitchen to feed hundreds of homeless and daily wagers in and around Jadavpur station, Dhakuria station and Golpark, the PU students have been raising funds to help the vendors around the university with medicines and essentials.

The kitchen at JU has come up on the parking area near Gate No. 4. Research scholar Hindol Mazumdar said, “After getting the JU authorities’ approval, we have set up the kitchen to feed hundreds of pavement dwellers, migrant labourers, daily wagers, including cycle rickshaw pullers. Given the present crisis, it is our social responsibility to ensure that none is starving.”

On Monday, the JU students had cooked khichdi and distributed it to 150 people in and around Jadavpur station, Dhakuria, Gariahat and Golpark. “We are following the health advisories while cooking and distributing the food. Our initiative will continue till the lockdown ends. We are trying to cook more food and cover wider areas between Garia and Golpark daily,” said Debjan Sengupta, an ex-student of JU.

Some teachers and non-teaching staff of JU have also joined the social initiative by helping the students financially.

Among the vendors helped by PU students during the lockdown include Badam Kaka, Dilip Kaka, Sukumar Da, Lal Da, Ananda Da, Chat Kaka. Asif Abdullah, a student of PU, said, “Badam Kaka was out of money for medicines. We have solved the problem for a week or two.”

83,['1/04/2020'],Andhra Pradesh chilli farmers want to shift stock to cold storages,"Representative image

GUNTUR: Chilli farmers are in a fix as they could not sell the produce with the sudden closure of the agriculture market yard due to the lockdown. The agriculture market yard suspended the activities in the yard last week little after the state government declared the lockdown as part of containment measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Contrary to the initial expectations that the yard will resume its operations on Wednesday, the government has extended the lockdown schedule till April 14 following a directive from the Centre.

The long lockdown has put farmers in a tight spot as they are worried that the quality of chilli might be affected if the mercury levels go up in the coming days. In that case, they might have to sell their stocks at lower prices. Demand was soaring for chilli when the situation suddenly changed due to the spread of Covid-19.

The prices were actually steadily rising due to the high demand from exporters giving the growers profitable margins before the closure of the yard. While the top varieties Teja, Guntur Sannalu were quoted anywhere around Rs 14,000-Rs 18,000 per quintal, even average qualities were picked up at not less than Rs 10,000 per quintal.

These prices were highest in the recent history and farmers were virtually dreaming about reaping rich dividend when the Covid-19 shattered their hopes.

Farmers are now demanding that the state government allow them to transport their stocks to keep them in the cold-storages till the yard resumes activity. While one round of yeild had been picked and bagged and kept in their back yards, the farmers are yet to pick the last yield.

Added to this is the shortage of agriculture labourers. “The government should immediately allow us to engage workers to pick the remaining chillies as the crop is drying up fast due to rising temperatures,” said a grower Narasimha Rao of Muppalla village.

A leading exporter Lanka Kranthi Sekhar observed that allowing the farmers to keep their stocks in cold storage is the best solution as the prices would not go down even after the reopening of the yard. He said there was sufficient space in the cold-storage in and around Guntur city to take in entire stock available with the farmers.

Meanwhile, BJP MP GVL Narasimha Rao has said that he had discussed the plights of chilli farmers with senior officials and expecting them to take remedial measures. He hoped that the yard would be reopened shortly to take the stocks in a phased manner.

The move was being considered in view of the Covid-19 outbreak and the need to decongest prisons in the state.

Ramanand told TOI, “Close to 6,000 convicts lodged in state jails are expected to benefit. We have recommended amendment of rule 9 of the Bombay Parole and Furlough Act 1959 for granting emergency parole to the convicts. The amendment will empower the jail superintendents to release them on parole after checking their past conduct. For instance, if a convict was earlier released on parole, whether he had returned to the jail after the parole lapsed etc will be looked into.”

“The notification amending the parole rules will be issued by the disaster management department. The jail superintendents will have the power to release the convicts on parole for 45 days. The parole can be extended for 30 days as per the Epidemic Diseases Act. The parole will stand terminated after the notification is revoked or withdrawn. The convicts will then have to return to jail,” he added.

The state police will monitor the movements of around 1,694 under trial prisoners (UTPs) released on bail so far, including 138 from the Yerawada central prison since March 27. More UTPs are expected to be released in a phased manner.

Pune police’s additional commissioner of police (crime) Ashok Morale told TOI, “All police stations and crime branches will check undertrial prisoners released on bail by visiting their residences on a regular basis for maintaining surveillance and keeping tabs on their current activities.”

“We have complied data of all criminals in the Criminal Intensive Surveillance System. The data will be used for monitoring their movements. The criminals will be summoned to the police stations and crime branches to deter them from committing new crimes,” he said.

Nagpur: Apart from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), public representatives, too, have started distributing and spraying disinfectants in their localities. Some corporators have not engaged workers as they themselves are spraying the disinfectant.

With the rise in Covid-19 patients, the NMC on March 28 started manual spraying in areas where positive patients were found and also engaged 11 fire tenders for spraying on main roads. The NMC is spraying sodium hypochlorite, claiming it will prevent the spread of Covid-19. Some public representatives started spraying much before the NMC’s drive.

West Nagpur MLA Vikas Thakre, who is also Congress city president, said, “I distributed 50 machines which can be mounted on backs. Spraying will be done all over my constituency. I also engaged three four-wheelers in which a big tank has been installed with a pump for spraying. It’s my responsibility to keep citizens safe and sound. There is also panic among people who feel relaxed after spraying is done in their areas. I’m continuously providing sodium hypochlorite and necessary materials for the drive,” he said.

When asked whether it’s permissible, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe said, “They are public servants. So, no problem. But all should follow the guidelines. NMC has launched the drive across the city and is covering all areas,” he said.

BJP corporator Jitendra ‘Bunty’ Kukde engaged 10 machines in his ward from March 23 onwards. “I personally mount the machine on my back and do spraying between 7am and 1pm daily. I have covered all the areas in my ward along with my nine supporters. I’m willing to give the machines to other wards,” he said.

Another BJP corporator, Dayashankar Tiwari, engaged a four-wheeler for spraying. “As the NMC is short of staff, the entire city cannot be covered fast. It is also our responsibility as public representatives to keep our people safe. There is also no violation of the lockdown as it is an essential service. It is also not a violation of section 144 as just two persons — a driver and a sprayer — are engaged,” he said.

BJP city president and corporator Pravin Datke, too, distributed 50 spraying machines.

East Nagpur MLA Krishna Khopde said, “Union minister Nitin Gadkari is likely to engage three private fire tenders for spraying soon. Gadkari also plans to give one bottle of hand sanitizer to every household. Many such initiatives have been planned by Gadkari and the BJP’s city unit. We are public representatives and always in public service in all situations,” he said. Some party leaders were seen spraying sodium hypochlorite with tools used for watering plants.

BHOPAL: Five days after a 32-year-old man allegedly threw boiling oil on his 30-year-old wife, while she was sleeping with her three children at her home in Jehangirabad locality, the woman died while undergoing treatment at a hospital on Monday. The woman had sustained severe burn injuries on face, eyes and upper body. Jehangirabad police added sections of murder to the case and launched a manhunt to nab the accused, who is absconding since the incident.

After committing the horrendous act, the accused allegedly stole Rs 25000 from the woman’s cupboard. He had a major fight with his wife on Wednesday night when he saw that she had got the money which she was saving with a self-help group. He asked his wife to give him the money for liquor, but she refused.So next day, he burnt her with boiling oil and fled the spot with money.

Police said that the victim Geeta Shaqya, 30, hailed from Gwalior . She got married to Bunty Shakya, a resident of Bheem Nagar , in 2008. They have three children. Police said that accused Bunty was addicted to alcohol and often quarrelled with Geeta in inebriated condition.

Three months ago, Geeta had filed a complaint against Bunty at Jehangirabad police station, after which he went absconding and was residing at his native town in Gwalior. Recently, when lockdown restrictions were enforced, Geeta called him and asked him to return home to avoid coronavirus. Police said that Bunty returned home a few days ago and started quarrelling with Geeta in inebriated condition.

The couple had a dispute over money on Wednesday night after Bunty returned home drunk. After arguments, they went to sleep. Bunty got up around 4 am on Thursday and boiled oil in a pan on the pretext of preparing tea. He threw boiling oil on Geeta while she was asleep. Geeta sustained around 30 per cent burn injuries on face, eyes and upper body. She rushed outside in terrible pain and raised alarm. Her sister Rajkumari, who stays in the neighbourhood, called ambulance and dialled 100.

LMH Dean Dr Kajal Mitra said that hospital had reserved 350 beds for isolation of patients, ten Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds with ventilators and 13 High Dependency Units (HDUs).

“Looking at the burden of patients at two government hospitals in city, LMH had offered to give our services in a meeting with divisional commissioner. Earlier, we created a ten-bed isolation ward for Covid-19 suspects. Now, we have extended the capacity to 350,” said Dr Mitra.

LMH will not only admit the coronavirus suspects but also collect their samples for testing. In case found positive, the patient will be shifted to separate rooms where ICU and ventilators will also be available, if needed. LMH has also agreed to shift non-Covid-19 patients from GMCH and IGGMCH to their campus if these government hospitals require vacating some more beds for coronavirus patients.

Campus of LMH hospital is situated at Digdoh hills on Hingna road which is comparatively far from city centre. This could be an advantage as chance of infection will reduce in case community spread of Covid-19 starts in Vidarbha. The hospital has 1,200 plus students of UG, PG and superspecialty courses.

Added strength

* At present, the Covid-19 patients/suspects are treated only at IGGMCH and GMCH

* After 12 new patients found in city from March 26, the burden on these two hospitals increased

* At present, these two hospitals together have 97 beds reserved for Covid-19 cases

* Number of ventilators and ICU beds is very limited in both hospitals

90,['1/04/2020'],IMD finds major changes in rainfall trend in last 30 years,"The rainy days are just the opposite, being highest over west coast and northeast states

PUNE: An IMD analysis on the rainfall trends from 1989 to 2018 has shown significant changes in India’s monsoon and annual showers, which in part could explain the extreme heavy downpour events and the simultaneous dry conditions in parts of the country during the past few years.

Scientists involved in the study have connected these changes to climate change, especially during the past 30 years. The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) study found that frequency of rainy days showed an significant increasing trend over Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, northern parts of Madhya Pradesh and parts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh. On the other hand, significant decreasing trends were seen over Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Punjab and the country’s northeastern parts.

In Maharashtra, the analysis showed that in the months of June to September, there has been a significant increase in rainy days in the stations in Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Raigad, Kolhapur and Bhandara.

“There is a significant decrease in rainy days in stations in Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Hingoli, Nanded, Yavatmal, Wardha districts,” said Pulak Guhathakurta, head, climate application and user interface, climate research and services, IMD, Pune.

In October last year, Guhathakurta said, the Parliament standing committee had told the ministry of earth sciences to gauge the effect of climate change on the rainfall patterns of India during the recent 30 years. “Past analysis reports have estimated the impact of climate change on rainfall from 1901 to 2010. But this is the only study so far in India that gauges the impact of climate change on rainfall patterns during the recent 30-year period,” he said.

“One shocking aspect of the study was the decreasing trend in rainfall and increasing trend in dry days during the last 30 years over the fertile Ganga Brahmaputra basin, a major agricultural zone,” he said.

In Maharashtra, the study also showed that every year, there is a significant increase in rainy days in Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Raigarh, Kolhapur and Bhandara districts. In contrast, there is a significant decrease in rainy days in Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Hingoli, Nanded, Yavatmal, Wardha districts.

“We noticed that during June to September, there is also a significant increase in heavy rainfall days in Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Raigarh, Kolhapur and Bhandara. On the other hand, there is a significant decrease in heavy rainfall days in Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Hingoli, Nanded, Yavatmal, Wardha,” he said.

State-specific analysis showed that only five states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Meghalaya and Nagaland) have shown significant decreasing trends in southwest monsoon rainfall. All these five states, along with Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, have also shown significant decreasing trends in annual rainfall.

91,['1/04/2020'],No bread for breakfast as city bakeries work with skeletal staff,"KOLKATA: Bread , which is a staple in most city homes, was hard to come by at most markets on Tuesday. The trickle of a supply on Sunday virtually dried up on Monday, leaving lakhs discontent about an essential breakfast item disappearing from the menu.

Families were forced to shift to alternative options, including roti-sabzi, poha, corn flakes or oats. If the bakers’ association is to be believed, the shortage is liklely to be on till the end of the lockdown .

According to bakery owners, almost all labourers have left for their villages before the three-week lockdown started, leading to a halt in product of bread and other bakery products. Scarcity of flour and maida in the wholesale market has only compounded the problem. Bread manufactured by some of the popular brands have also disappeared from shops.

“In our household, bread is a must for breakfast. Till Sunday, we received at least some quantity but from Monday, there is absolutely no bread available in the markets. Families with children are bound to face a lot of difficulty. We are forced to explore other options,” said Arpit Ganguly, a resident of Premchand Boral Street in Bowbazar.

Pointing to the reason for the sudden shortage, Ariful Islam, chief executive officer of the West Bengal Bakers’ Association, said, “Only 5% bakeries are open in the city, which is highly inadequate to meet the demand.”

According to Islam, most labourers left the city for their villages on the Saturday before the Janata Curfew. “Saturday is a holiday in bakeries. These labourers, who live in the districts, could not return because the entire country was locked down with no local trains and buses plying. We were operating the bakeries with skeletal staff but now, even their families are scared and calling them back. Many of them have managed to leave already,” said Islam.

Alleged police highhandedness has also been making it difficult to retain the few hands, who have been reporting to work. A baker in Bowbazar alleged his employees had put the dough in the oven and were standing outside the bakery because it was very hot inside, when cops thrashed them. “The cops did not even give any time to explain they were employees of the bakery. One of the boys was badly injured and the rest were so scared that they have refused to work until the lockdown got over,” said the owner of the bakery.

Shortage in supply of flour and maida is causing a huge problem in production of bread. “Almost all flour mills in the state are shut. All the wholesale outlets in Posta are yet to open. The bakeries are not getting enough raw material for production,” said Aslam.

Owners said they were trying to convince some of their workers to return. “Some of them may return in a day or two but the supply of bread will return to normal only after the lockdown is lifted,” said Islam

PUNE: A 55-year-old truck driver was stabbed to death, while the cleaner of another heavy vehicle suffered injuries after a gang of six men assaulted and robbed them of valuables collectively worth Rs7,000 in the early hours of Monday on Pune-Solapur highway near Daund , about 110km from the city.

The Daund police have identified the deceased driver as Kashinath Kadam of Osmanabad district. The injured cleaner of another truck, Mohammed Pathan (49) of Osmanabad, is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Daund. Shakil Shaikh, the cleaner on Kadam’s truck, has lodged an FIR with the police.

Inspector Sunil Mahadik of the Daund police said Kadam and Shaikh were on their way to Pimpri from Osmanabad in the early hours of Monday. They were carrying pulses in the truck.

“Around 2am, Kadam stopped at Malad village along the Pune-Solapur highway for answering nature’s call,” Mahadik said.

While Kadam was returning to the truck, the six men all of a sudden surfaced in front him and started beating him up. “When Kadam resisted them, one of them stabbed him near the chest and robbed his Rs3,000 and cellphone,” Mahadik said.

He said the suspects attacked the driver and the cleaner of one more truck parked near Kadam’s truck.

“They robbed Rs2,000 and cellphone from its driver, Altaf Patel of Osmanabad. The cleaner of the second truck, Pathan, suffered injuries in the assault,” Mahadik said.

Shaikh, the complainant, took Kadam to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the doctors. “We registered the offence under sections of dacoity and murder with dacoity of the Indian Penal Code,” Mahadik said.

He said there was already heavy police deployment along the highway because many people were attempting to migrate to their native places during the lockdown because of the Covid-19 situation.

“We are suspecting involvement of local gang behind the robbery and murder of the truck driver. There are few gangs in the area involved in train robberies,” Mahadik said.

“We are working on some clues and have also intensified patrolling in the area,” he added.

The lockdown across the country because of the Covid-19 situation had left several truck drivers and cleaners stranded on highways with their vehicles. No food joints were open for them and they had a torrid time waiting on roads for the state borders to open.

PANAJI/COLVA: Chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Tuesday that his government, with the aid of the Union ministry of external affairs (MEA), wishes to evacuate around 8,000 Goans working abroad — including seafarers — and quarantine them in Goa. “A decision in this regard will be taken in the next two days,” he said.

Sawant met Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao (NCP), Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco (Congres) and seafarers’ associations on the issue. “The associations’ claim is that there are around 7,000-8,000 seafarers and Goans working in the US, Italy, Spain, etc,” Sawant said.

“I have spoken to Union home minister Amit Shah about it. We are still discussing how to get them back and where to quarantine them. With the help of the MEA, we want to resolve the issue. We want to help them.”

Founder of Seamen’s Association of India (SAI) Dixon Vaz told TOI that the CM was informed about the situation and conditions on cruise liners where seafarers are stranded with food stocks depleting. A call was then made to the director general shipping, he said. Vaz said that Sawant assured the delegation that he is in tough with the PMO, home ministry and MEA to make the necessary arrangements to get those stranded back to Goa following all safety procedures.

Vaz said he also told the CM that crew members are stranded in coronavirus-affected countries, and that arrangements have to be made here in Goa to quarantine them upon their arrival.

94,['1/04/2020'],Nagpur likely to get three more Covid-19 testing labs,"Representative image

NAGPUR: With Mayo Hospital overburdened, the Central and state government are likely to give permission for testing of swab samples for Covid-19 to three more government institutions of the city — AIIMS, Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), and Maharashtra Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (Mafsu).

At present, Mayo Hospital is the only approved lab in entire Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh and some parts of Madhya Pradesh (MP). With rise in number of suspected cases and close contacts of positive persons, Mayo Hospital is reportedly overburdened. As per public representatives and family members of patients, reports are delayed up to 24 hours or more.

Mayo Hospital has only one Real Time PCR Machine, which is required for testing of swab samples for Covid-19.

If given permission, Mafsu may come as a big relief as it has three machines, of which one has the latest technology at its state-of-the-art Centre for Zoonosis at Nagpur Veterinary College, Seminary Hills.

Deputy director (health) Dr Sanjay Jaiswal and his team inspected Mafsu’s centre on March 28 and submitted a report to the state’s public health department.

Mafsu director (research) Dr NV Kurkure and registrar Chandrabhan Parate told TOI, “Mafsu is ready to take up the challenge in larger interest of country if given permission by the government. It is our social responsibility to serve the nation and people. We have experienced staff and mechanism, which can be easily utilized for testing Covid-19 samples. We have already sent six doctors for training at Mayo Hospital a day ago.”

Dr Kurkure added Mafsu has three Real Time PCR Machines at its veterinary public health department, pathology department and microbiology department, and all can be brought to Centre for Zoonosis to begin work as per protocol of WHO and government. “Centre for Zoonosis was developed 3-4 years ago and is equipped with all types of facilities,” he said.

As per officials, the government is also likely to give permission to AIIMS situated at MIHAN and GMCH. These two institutions have one machine each, and, most importantly, treatment facilities.

Another major advantage will be that all four institutions are situated in different locations of the city. The government, in association with the district administration, can chalk out districts and area wise distribution of samples. Reports can be delivered quickly and in large numbers if all four laboratories are in service in the city.

A private establishment — Druv Pathology and Molecular Diagnostic Lab — has also reportedly applied to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for permission.

Similarly, a German Shepherd, also without a name tag or collar, was found tied to a pole in Narayanguda Government Veterinary Hospital earlier this week.While the city’s streets have become deserted since the lockdown was announced, animal rescue teams say that they are witnessing an unusual increase in the number of pet dogs being abandoned on city roads due to the spread of Covid-19.The average number of calls received by Animal Rescue Shelter, an NGO, regarding such cases, has increased from one to two cases per week to at least three cases per day.“It is very concerning. We have been receiving at least two to three calls every single day. One of our recent rescues was of a Lhasa Terrier from Attapur. The dog was so scared that it used to constantly shake in fear when someone would go close to her. Another Pomeranian that we rescued was left at a car mechanic workshop in Jeedimetla,” said Shruti Darak, founder of Animal Rescue Shelter. Animal welfare organisations also say that the number of calls from pet owners wanting to give up pets is also on the rise.“There is a sudden surge in number of pet owners wanting to give up pets. Our Facebook page on pet adoptions is a proof that people are scared they might get infected. We are working on overcoming that by counselling them and disseminating correct information,” said Aanchal Khanna, an animal activist.Despite the World Health Organisation (WHO) clarifying that Covid-19 cannot be transmitted through dogs, many are either abandoning their pets on streets or frantically calling shelter homes to give them up.Clearing the air about the misinformation, Dr Jasleen Kaur from Allvet Pet Clinic said, “Pets do not get Covid-19.

Textile units will cater to the demand of protective gears for the entire state and kits will be distributed through a centralized supply chain from Bhopal, claimed officials.

The state government has roped in over half a dozen textile units in Indore such as Pratibha Syntex to manufacture PPE kits, masks, gloves and other medical essentials crucial to prevent infection in health care workers.

Madhya Pradesh Industry Development Corporation (MPIDC) Indore head Kumar Purushottam said, “PPE kits will be supplied from Indore to across the state. We have roped in Pratibha Syntex and many allied textile units to manufacture these kits for which the design and material have been approved by the state health department and initially over 2,000 PPE kits are being manufactured in a day. The target is to scale up production to around 5,000 PPE kits in a day.”

According to industry experts, the daily requirement of PPE kits in the state is about 6,000-7,000 kits per day.

Principal Secretary Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, looking after supplies of medicines and logistics, said, “We are targeting around 1 lakh suits, our present manufacturing capacity is 2,500 and very soon it will be 5,000 per day at Indore. We are also buying from other sources and expecting 10, 000 in next 10 days and another 20,000 after the delivery of first lot.”

He said efforts are on to start manufacturing of PPE kits in Bhopal.

To ensure continuous supply of PPE kits, the state government has called raw material from Pune, Gujarat and Bangalore and targeting to build inventories for around 70,000 kits.

HS Jha, vice president, HR said, “We are making one-time use protective gears, masks and gloves at our factory. Demand is huge and we are trying to meet the demand by enhancing production capacity but raw material and workers are a few challenges. We have set up a separate room for making these protective gears. We are also working to make reusable suits.” Jha said the factory is producing around 1,000 suits and 15,000 masks per day at the facility.

State government also plans to send some samples of the kit to Central testing laboratory in Coimbatore.

While senior police officers are working 15-16 hours at a stretch, field staff have 12-15-hour shifts in this unprecedented crisis. They have to face a lot of challenges, including the anger of people, who violate the lockdown.

A force of around 3,200 cops has been deployed across the city, day and night. Although the department has distributed masks, gloves and sanitisers yet many cops, especially the lower-ranked staff complained that they have not been provided any such protective gear. They said that they were arranging these items on their own.

Every police station has been given a budget of Rs5,000 for arranging sanitiser/ handwash and masks along with wash basins on their premises but several cops told TOI that it wasn’t enough as complainants, too, use the facilities.

“In this unprecedented crisis, police and health workers are the most exposed to the disease as they come in contact with a large number of people daily, especially while enforcing lockdown in crowded areas,” a senior officer said.

Little or nothing has been provided by the department as far as protective gear is concerned, said the officer. “I personally procured 200 litres of chemical to sanitise police stations in my jurisdiction. Masks and hand sanitisers are being procured by staff themselves,” he added.

A constable deployed at a checkpost near the airport said that 22 of them, including 10 from SAF, have purchased masks on their own.

RI Deepak Patil, however,said the police control room procured 9,000 masks and 2,500 gloves, which have been distributed at police stations. Small bottles of sanitisers have been provided to every cop on duty. Personal protection equipment (PPE) kits will be procured and provided by BMC.

SP (HQ) Dharamveer Yadav said that those who opt for police force are mentally strong and understand how to deal with the hazards of their profession. He said that policemen have been made aware to follow basic rules during duty, including maintaining social distance. “They have been directed not to go home during the duty hours to avoid infecting family members. Masks and gloves are being provided to the force and the distribution process is underway. If demand grows, more supplies will be provided”, he said.

PANAJI: One section that is feeling the impact of restriction on movement during the lockdown is children with special needs and their parents. Fifteen-year-old Guirim-resident Mahiya Vernekar, who has cerebral palsy, is growing restless being constantly indoors. She cannot make the weekly visit to her grandmother’s house in Mapusa. Parents of the Anand Niketan student, Mahiya, are also concerned over her not getting physiotherapy sessions.

“Mahiya has become naughtier and restless since being restricted indoors. We used to take her to her grandmother’s place in Mapusa once a week, besides, taking her for a joyride to Panaji. That kept her in good spirits. She is missing her physiotherapy and speech therapy. But we cannot do anything about the current situation, we have to deal with it,” Mahiya’s father Ramesh Vernekar said.

Special educator Snehal Verenkar is one of the founders of the Grey Blend Foundation, which offers services of special educators at homes across North Goa at a nominal cost. Since the novel coronavirus threat, many parents have themselves opted out of the service to avoid any possibility of infection.

In cases where parents have expressed the need to continue the service, most of the Foundation’s special educators and therapists are unable to travel as they are dependent on public transport.

“I have received calls from three parents already who said there is increase in behavioural problems in their autistic children. Autistic children don’t like their routine to be changed and when schools will open now after a long time it will take an extra effort to bring these children back on track. Parents do not have the same skills of special educators to deal with the children and we can be of limited help over the phone,” Snehal said.

She said that the lockdown has led to shortage of some food items and this is especially tough to deal with for parents of special children.

“One parent was frantically calling me today to ask where she can get biscuits from. Biscuits and other bakery products form a major part of her child’s diet and the special child is having trouble adjusting to rice and dal meals. Many special children do not understand verbal instructions, and special educators can help in convincing them,” Snehal said.

She said special educators are providing parents tips like how to engage children with autism with visuals such as cartoons on TV and picture books.

Headmaster of Sanjay School for Special Children in Porvorim, and with centres in Curchorem and Vasco, Tatu Kudalkar said that parents also have the added burden of taking extra care of their special children during this period, as many of these children have lower immunity.

“Children with cerebral palsy need physiotherapy on a regular basis. Without it, their muscles tighten and then you are back to square one once they return to school. We were considering arranging for such children and the physiotherapist to come to the school during the lockdown for continuity in therapy. But it was felt that it is not advisable as the immunity of many of the children is low. The older students at our vocational centre too have to deal with having nothing to keep them busy at home,” Kudalkar said.

109,['1/04/2020'],"Eerie silence, grim faces in Prof Colony","Bhopal: A week into the 21-day lockdown and five days after Professor’s Colony was declared ‘containment area’, residents are coming to terms with the hardships.

Supply of milk and essential items have dried up forcing residents to move out. Residents moving out of containment area pose a threat to the general population. The administration has failed to streamline supply of essentials in the area, complain residents.

Barring public announcement to stay indoors and maintain social distancing nothing has been done for screening of people or sanitisation of the area, alleged residents.

The containment area resembles a war zone—an eerie silence , with grim faces occasionally spotted from the balconies of the houses.

Majority of the residents of the colony are abiding by the rules and learning to live with the hardships. “We have been complying with the government orders, but what about the administration? Is it complying with its own order of containment area?” a resident, Dr Sumit Agrawal, asked.

“Two most important measures mentioned in the CA order, issued by the additional district magistrate of Bhopal on March 27 night, also include sanitization operations around the colony and screening by health officers at the exit points of the colony,” he stated. But nothing of that sort is happening, he added.

Another resident told TOI, “Even the supply of milk, an essential commodity, has been stopped, forcing the people to move out of the colony and violate the rules. Why can’t these be made available to the residents in the area.”

The first positive case of Covid-19 was detected on March 22 from the colony. Seven days since, on Tuesday, public announcement explaining the importance of ‘social distancing’ continue to blare through the speakers. An autorickshaw with a loudspeaker fitted atop went around the colony saying, “lockdown is a must in these circumstances, coronavirus destroys automatically in 10 to 12 hours, which is why staying indoors is necessary.”

The announcement also allayed fears about shortage of supply of essential commodities, saying medical stores are open 24 hours. “Please stay at home and spend time with your family for the safety of your family and yourself. All the essential commodities have been made available to you. We are working for your well-being.”

The public announcement also informed the people, “Stay indoors. You will also not be able to move out of Bhopal, now. No one will be able to enter the city also as all the boundaries are sealed.” Anxious residents are keen to learn about the fate of the two positive cases found from the area and the recent test reports on them, besides screening of people in the area, if and when it would be undertaken.

110,['1/04/2020'],MERC gives major relief to solar rooftop consumers,"MAJOR RELIEF

Nagpur: Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission ( MERC ) has given a major relief to solar rooftop consumers by rejecting MSEDCL’s demand to impose astronomical grid support charge (GSC) on them.

The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) had proposed the GSC ranging from Rs3.60 per unit to Rs4.08 per unit for high tension (HT) consumers and as high as Rs8.60 per unit for low tension (LT) consumers. GSC at this level would have made solar rooftop unviable.

The commission in its recent order stated that the total capacity of solar rooftop in the MSEDCL area is 460MW. This is way behind the target set by the state government. The commercial impact on MSEDCL is not significant. Therefore, to incentivize solar rooftop systems, the commission has decided not to impose any GSC on them. GSC will not be imposed until the total capacity of solar rooftop reaches 2000MW in the state.

Solar experts said the MERC has ensured there will be no GSC for another four to five years. According to a sample calculation done by the commission, GSC will be very reasonable when imposed.

However, to compensate MSEDCL for the revenue loss caused by solar rooftop consumers, MERC has imposed banking charge on the consumers. It is 7.5% for HT and 12% for LT consumers.

Explaining the banking charge, solar expert Ajit Ganguly said if a consumer uses more energy than he generates through solar, then he will not have to pay any banking charge. Same is the case if generation and consumption is equal. However, at the end of the year if the consumer has generated 100 units more than his total consumption and sold it to the MSEDCL then the discom will pay only for 88 units (for LT consumers) and money equivalent to 12 units will be the banking charge.

MERC has ruled that all consumers having net installed capacity up to 10KW will be exempt from banking charge. Those opting for net billing arrangement will also be exempt. Same is the case with solar rooftop systems behind the net meter and not opting for either net billing or net metering.

Solar experts Ganguly and Sudhir Budhe welcomed the order and said it would encourage more consumers to go in for solar rooftop. “New consumers had put their plans on hold due to the proposed GSC,” said Ganguly.

PUNE: The rural police on Monday impounded around 80 two-wheelers from residents moving on the roads without permission, valid reason or essential purpose.

The action was carried out in the areas under the jurisdiction of Shikrapur, Loni Kalbhor, Haveli and Loni Kand police stations, which account for several semi-urban areas.

“Many of the motorists had come out merely for fun,” a police officer said.

The impounded vehicles will remain at the police stations concerned till the lockdown period ends or until further orders. The rural police have also been maintaining a close watch on the movement of vehicles in semi-urban areas such as Wagholi, Shikrapur, Sinhagad Road, Lonavla , Khed, Baramati, Daund and others.

Sandeep Patil, the superintendent of police, Pune rural, said the police would take action against motorists violating the lockdown orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

“Such people will be booked under Section 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code,” he said.

A senior police officer told TOI,

“The riders had came out on the village roads and highways. When officers intercepted their vehicles, the riders told them they were going to meet their friends, family or wanted to buy vegetables. But they had travelled around 10-20km for the same. The riders were also lying to avert police action. So, their vehicles were impounded and were taken to the police station for further action.”

Some of the errant riders were found travelling in groups of two or three vehicles, the officer said.

Meanwhile, in a news that would be of relief to the people oin the area none of the family members of the railway guard have tested positive, so far.

“The guard’s wife and his two children tested negative. The spread of coronavirus in Bhopal is limited to people who contracted it from outside the city — except for the journalist, who got the infection from his daughter. We have been able to check spread of the virus at community level so far and it is very satisfying,” said district administration spokesperson, Arun Rathore.

He further said, people in the “containment area” should stay indoors for 14 days, and no one from outside should be allowed to visit anybody in the area. All residents of the area are screened for coronavirus and 50 houses on each side of the Covid-19 positive patient are being regularly monitored.

All essential goods are being supplied to the neighbourhood as per their needs by the administration to ensure that no one goes out.

A resident of the area, Jeetu Rathore, said that essential goods were being delivered to every house by a team led by the SDM and a food officer. The residents have to tell the on-duty cops about their requirement, and they forward the information further. He said, doctors also came to the area, but he isn’t sure whether they examined people in all households

Station house officer, Bajaria police station, under whose jurisdiction the area falls said the police was reasonably tough in not allowing people to venture out or let people from outside come in but it is not always possible to accomplish it 100% lockdown.

When a motorist is checked by police at a checking point, they would enter the registration number of the vehicle and the purpose of the trip in the app. The same information will be immediately synced to the devices of cops on duty at other checking points.“If the motorist roams around unnecessarily and is caught by the cops at any other location, he/she cannot use the same excuse they used give earlier as the police already have the information of their trip,” said Shibin.Varkala station house officer inspector G Gopakumar said they already conducted a trial run and the app was working fine.The Varkala police have five checking points at Palachira, Pazhaya Chantha, Maithanam Junction, Punnammoodu and Beach Road.Meanwhile, the city police have intensified the vigil during lockdown in the wake of the death of a Covid-19 patient at Pothencode in the district.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/now-roadvigilant-tohelp-track-violators/articleshow/74920115.cms

Meanwhile, the cyber cell of city and rural police is keeping a strict vigil on social media, as Wednesday is April Fool’s Day. Cops have urged citizens to refrain from sending fake news, or face action.

The two arrested persons, identified as Shoaib Sheikh and Mohd Irfan Qureshi, were booked for spreading a fake message on Tuesday regarding the deployment of military in some sensitive areas in the city. The other two, identified as Sanjay Chanekar and Ramdas Tonge, were arrested for spreading a fake message regarding disinfectant spraying in the city at night between 10pm and 5am, with a picture of municipal commissioner Tukaram Munde, earlier this month.

In both the incidents, cases were filed at Sadar police station under relevant sections.

Last week, city police had arrested three persons who had made a fake audio clip claiming that several patients, including a few doctors had tested positive for Covid-19. The audio clip had spread like wildfire among the citizens. An offence was registered and city police, with the help of cyber cell nabbed the trio.

In the latest incident, the WhatsApp number of Nagpur police enquiry had received a message claiming that some areas in the city were blacklisted, and that military would be deployed in those areas. The areas imcluded Mominpura, Shanti Nagar, Pili Nadi, Jafar Nagar, Gandhibagh, Tajbagh, Kamptee and Hasanbagh.

The message claimed that police could not control these areas, and hence the military force was being called in there. The message also said that lathicharge and rubber bullets would be fired by the military to control the crowd, so citizens should stay in their homes. In the end, the message read, “Please share this message with everyone and don’t go out of the house”.

Police officials later verified the message with the police commissionerate and district commissioner’s office and learnt that it was a fake news, following which Ashok Bagul, senior PI of police control room, filed a complaint with Sadar police.

126,['1/04/2020'],Telangana: Hundreds of Jharkhand workers eager to go home,"Workers from Jharkhand in Sangareddy

HYDERABAD: Fear of being stuck in an alien city far away from their families is haunting hundreds of construction workers from Jharkhand , who are working at a site in Kandi of Sangareddy district . They are eager to go back home as they feel their villages are better suited to protect them from contracting the dreaded coronavirus. “I am scared of something happening when I am all alone here,” 31-year-old Inderdev Kumar, a carpenter from Pallamu district in Jharkhand, said.

Explaining what home means to him, the migrant worker says, “Ma, biwi, gaon, parivar (Mother, wife, village, family).”

The sole breadwinner, he shudders to think what will happen to his two small children without him. “Work is not everything,” he says.

Kumar is among 2,000 workers, many of them from Jharkhand, hired by two companies working on the site. Till Monday, they did not have food but after activists raised their issue, the companies provided essential commodities under government supervision.

Anup Kumar Paswan, supervisor at the site, said, “We have tried reaching out to the Jharkhand chief minister’s office as well as the collector, but in vain.”

Paswan says with the spread of the virus, it is safer for them in their villages than here. “Our villages are better isolated and there are no cases that have been reported there.”

Paswan said some of the workers had left on foot for Jharkhand. He, however, could not confirm the numbers but said they remained small as most amenities were being provided by government here.

Activist Vinay Vangala, who has been instrumental in drawing the government’s attention to the plight of the workers, said, “We are directing migrants to Annapurna centres. For those who do not have access to this, we are providing food packets.”

Vangala and other activists were working on a site in Bhanur in the city on Tuesday where 50 migrants had been living on biscuits for two days.

Speaking to TOI, M Nagesh, revenue divisional officer, Sangareddy, said the two companies had given good facilities to the workers and after the government’s intervention they had provided ration and santizers as well.

“Most migrants want to leave because they are scared to be away from their families in a time of crisis. We are trying to convince them to stay and have informed them that road, rail and air networks are shut for now.”

With proper medication and care, they recovered,” Rathod said.As the service was free, word spread rapidly, and the other daily wagers from the vicinity rushed to Rathod’s facility for any health-related complaints.“Earlier, I would also go to their transit camps and distribute food, but I haven’t been able to do that since the lockdown came into effect. So we now distribute food directly from the hospital,” Rathod said.Soon, Rathod started getting phone calls from other people and volunteers’ organization, with requests for food. “We provide food to them too as per requirement.” he said.The food is prepared in the hospital’s kitchen, and Rathod has been funding the entire initiative out of his own pocket. “My social foundation is in its nascency and has no outside funding.

Both the sanctuaries in Pandharkawda wildlife division were under Pench Tiger Reserve. The state government had issued orders in this regard on January 30, 2020.

With better wildlife management in the last 4-5 years, Tipeshwar has come a long way and has hit the global map for presence of tigers and regular sightings. Tipeshwar hogged limelight when a collared tiger travelled 3,000km to reach Dnyanganga sanctuary in Buldhana.

In 2012 and 2014, Tipeshwar and Maregaon villages were relocated. In 2015-16, there were two tigresses and a male. Today, the park has 17 tigers with three males, five females and nine sub-adult cubs.

Now MS Reddy, APCCF & field director of MTR, will take over the control of these two sanctuaries with immediate effect. Reddy, who already controls over 3,058 sqkm area, which includes eight wildlife sanctuaries and one national park in three districts, will get an additional control of 574sqkm now.

The total area under MTR’s administration will be 3,633sqkm. But, Isapur wildlife sanctuary (121sqkm), which is under Pusad territorial division, has been left out.

The logic behind handing over both the sanctuaries to Melghat is that these protected areas (PAs) fall under Amravati revenue division. Till now the PAs were under the Nagpur revenue division.

The divisional forest officer (DFO), wildlife, Pandharkawda, used to look after Tipeshwar and Painganga. Now he will report to the Melghat field director. The area under Melghat will now be quite close to what APCCF (wildlife), East Nagpur, looks after.

As per the new GR, Reddy will straightway report to PCCF (wildlife) Nitin H Kakodkar, who will be his controlling officer. The fresh move will help expediting relocation of villages in which the revenue department has an important role to play.

HYDERABAD: Quarantined in star hotels in New Delhi, international passengers, many of them from Hyderabad, who flew into the country hours before the lockdown, have been hit by a double whammy— steep tariffs and an approaching ‘exit’ date. Some of the families that TOI spoke to said that the daily rent at these hotels ranges between Rs 4,000 and Rs 4,600 per day, which comes to Rs 56,000 to Rs 64,400 for the entire isolation period.

But the hefty bill is only part of their problem. Guests say that some of the hotels have asked them to vacate the premises by April 5, leaving them worried about where to go next. With all domestic connections suspended and several borders sealed, they are not sure how to get home once they check out.

“We have no relatives or family in Delhi. There is also no communication from authorities about alternative arrangements. I don’t know what my parents will do if they have to leave the hotel by April 5,” Naveen Amaravadi told TOI from Toronto. His elderly parents arrived in India from the US on March 22 and were taken to a star hotel. “We had to take a tough call and send them back (from my sister’s place in New Jersey) because my father is diabetic and he was running out of medicines. Also, the situation in the US was deteriorating so we thought they’d be safer in Hyderabad,” said Amaravadi, who even tweeted his story to officials in India, seeking help for his parents. He said there were at least 30 families from Hyderabad staying at the same hotel.

When TOI contacted the hotel, the staff confirmed that the exit date was fixed as April 5. “Maybe the government will make some arrangement after that,” said an executive at the front desk, adding that 100 families had been quarantined at the property.

Another resident from Nizampet shared a similar story. “My parents returned from Philadelphia on March 20. They were asked to wait for mandatory screening at the airport for 19 hours...Since my father is 60 years old, they were asked to stay in quarantine for 14 days. They are staying in a hotel by paying Rs 4,000 per day. These are such tough times...Do they have to keep paying and stay in Delhi...Can they not return home?” Navya tweeted, seeking IT minister KT Rama Rao’s help.

Vijayawada: The state government has urged the public to avoid large gatherings as part of Sri Rama Navami celebrations this year. The festival will be a low-key affair with the lockdown in place to curb the spread of Covid-19.

One of the widely-celebrated festivals in the state, Sri Rama Navami is observed for over five days with devotees offering prayers to Lord Sri Rama and the performance of the Seetha Rama Kalyanam in pandals on Rama Navami.

This year, authorities of the endowments department will perform the Rama Kalyanam at Vontimitta without permitting devotees as part of measures to prevent large congregations.

In a similar move, authorities at the Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada have announced that the Sri Rama Kalyanam will be performed at the temple without allowing any devotees. Officials are looking into the possibility of live telecasting of the Kalyana utsavam.

The Ram Mandiram at Eluru Road is also gearing up to celebrate the festival without devotees. Artisans selling Rama idols in Vijayawada are running into losses as no buyers have come forward with the lockdown in force. “We sell Sri Rama idols every year during Sri Rama Navami. Hundreds of pandal organisers used to purchase idols from us. But the situation is quite opposite this year. Not even a single set of idols has been sold to date. We are migrant workers from Rajasthan and the government should help us,” said Jaidheer, a seller from Kanuru.

He said immediately after the lockdown, there was a 25% spike in LPG cylinder refill booking between March 24 and 26. “It has tapered down to normal levels now,” he said, adding that all of IOC’s bottling plants in the state are functioning at more than 125% of their capacity, adhering to health protocols.

“All of our LPG distributorships are fully operational,” he reiterated, urging LPG customers not to resort to “panic booking” as there is sufficient stock. Customers needn’t visit a showroom to book refill, as all other modes of booking, including SMS, IVRS, WhatsApp, website and mobile app are operational.

133,['1/04/2020'],All eyes on Markaz Nizamuddin after spike in coronavirus cases,"The Charminar wears a deserted look, in Hyderabad on Tuesday

Hyderabad/Vijayawada: After a sudden spike in positive cases in AP and Telangana, the focus has now shifted to ‘Markaz’ (central office) of Tablighi Jamaat at Hazrat Nizamuddin basti of old Delhi.

About 1,800 people from both Telugu states had attended the biannual three-day session, which was held from March 15. Most of the positive cases reported in the Telugu states are either participants at the congregation or their close contacts.

All the six deaths reported thus far in Telangana are linked to old Delhi.

The virus spread among the locals, as some of the participants came from Covid-19 affected countries, including Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand. None of the participants had shown symptoms of Covid-19 when they left the Markaz before the official lockdown. About 1,000 people, including some from the Telugu states, are still stranded at the Jamaat headquarters. Most of them had travelled by train and a few by air. The first victim of coronavirus in Telangana went to Delhi by train and returned to Hyderabad by air after his health deteriorated.

According to Jamaat sources, 746 people from AP and 1,030 from Telangana attended the congregation at the century-old Markaz, which can accommodate about 10,000 people. Most of those who attended the meeting from the two Telugu states have been traced and kept under isolation, while about 300 are yet to be contacted. Some of them are in Delhi and could not reach their homes due to the lockdown.

Mohammed Ilyas Rizvi, principal secretary, minorities welfare, AP, has appealed to the attendees to voluntarily notify themselves before district collectors. “They can also inform 104 helpline immediately in their own interest as well in the best interest of the society to stop the spread of the virus,” Rizvi said.

“Markaz offers the entire premises as a quarantine facility to help the authorities tide over the challenge of current pandemic,” he said.

Out of the 40 cases reported in AP, 22 people had attended the Delhi meeting or came in contact with the participants. Of the 746 persons from AP, 122 are quarantined in the hospitals, 207 sent to government quarantine centres and 297 are in home quarantine. Search is on for the remaining.

134,['1/04/2020'],City sweet-makers want morning slots,"Kolkata: Sweet-makers in Bengal have appealed to chief minister Mamata Banerjee to consider changing the timings of their shops and allow them to operate between 8am and 1pm , instead of the current noon-4pm slot.

“We had written to the CM, requesting her to allow us to open shops as over 10 million litres of milk had been going waste every day. But the timing we have been allowed to operate is not conducive to sweet shops and hence, the fresh appeal,” said Jagannath Ghosh, joint secretary of Paschimbanga Mishtanna Byabasayee Samity that has written to the CM , asking for a time change.

While smaller sweet shops in residential areas opened around noon on Tuesday, bigger brands remained shut for want of workers, who had gone home following the lockdown. A review by the association showed most customers stepped out to buy essentials in the morning and there was hardly any buyer in the afternoon. Post 1 pm, it would be difficult to find customers for sweets, the association said.

“We are taking some time before we are able to start functioning normally,” said Dhiman Das, of K C Das. Among the big brands, Hindusthan Sweets and Balaram Mullick opened on Tuesday. But the entire range of sweets was not available on the first day, when the milk and chenna supply was yet to be restored.

Sweet shop owners said they would ensure safety for their workers and there was no question of crowding as not too many labourers were employed. “The question of crowding outside the shops also doesn’t arise because we will follow the same rules as that at grocery shops,” said Sudip Mullick of Balaram Mullick.

Child specialist Apurba Ghosh waited in a queue outside Hindusthan Sweets, said owner Rabindra Kumar Pal. “We were happy to see him. It helped to boost our spirit,” Pal said.

Quoting the World Health Organisation (WHO), the manual emphasised that “masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water. If you wear a mask, then you must know how to use it and dispose of it properly.”The manual, issued by the PSA office, will help people to make such masks at home with the help of simple household materials such as cotton cloth, scissors and sewing machine.The analysis of the US-based National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) says masks can minimise the risk of the Covid-19 spread. “If 50% of the population were to wear masks, only 50% of the population would be infected by the virus. Once 80% of the population wears a mask, the outbreak can be stopped immediately,” the PSA’s office in its statement said.The analysis further said, “Covid-19 virus spreads easily from person to person contact. Virus carrying droplets dry fast enough to form droplet nuclei and remain airborne eventually landing on different surfaces. The SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, has been detected in aerosols for up to three hours and on plastic and stainless steel surfaces for up to three days”.The proposed guide is meant to provide a simple outline of best practices to make, use and reuse masks to enable NGOs and individuals to self-create such masks and accelerate widespread adoption of masks across India.Besides, the PSA asked scientific institutions to self assess and prepare their labs for research and testing through the standard and rigorous protocol.The entire response is being monitored by the science and technology empowered committee for Covid-19.

Main complainant Pinku Kumar, who is a resident of Palia town, was not allowed to enter his village and was forced to stay in the quarantine camp. Another complainant, Sanjay Kumar, also belongs to Lakhimpur Kheri district and he had reached his hometown after travelling for nearly five days and spending much part of his savings.

In their complaint, the migrants also said that Jinping is responsible for all the deaths, lockdown and unemployment, “so he should be booked and compensation should be provided to the affected people”. Circle Officer Rakesh Nayak has received a copy of the complaint from them and handed over to the Palia SHO.

Palia SHO Vidhya Shankar Shukla told TOI, “A group of labourers have collectively given a complaint and asked for action against Xi Jinping for spreading novel coronavirus and unemployment. We cannot register an FIR on such a complaint and have forwarded the complaint to the SSP. Police and district administration are ensuring that proper food is provided to the migrants until they are quarantined.”

JAIPUR: Chief minister Ashok Gehlot deferred payment of 75% of his gross March salary to himself along with deputy CM, cabinet ministers and all MLAs. The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting held at the CM's residence on Tuesday. The move has taken due to the shortfall in the expected revenue of Rs 17,000 crore for the month of March.

Similarly, 60% and 50% of the gross salary of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Rajasthan Administrative Service (RAS) officers, respectively, has been deferred by the government. Other than Grade IV employees, 30% of the salaries of all other government employees will be deferred for some time.

The 30% deduction will be applicable also to pensioners. Health workers, policemen and contractual employees have been exmpted from this deduction.

The state had gone under lockdown even before the Centre announced a countrywide shutdown.

The revenue of most of the departments has gone down following the move. In a major relief to disadvantage groups, Gehlot has decided to give a financial assistance of Rs 1,500 to BPL families, beneficiaries of state BPL and Antayodya Yojna, 25 lakh construction workers and registered street vendors who are not covered under the social security pension scheme.

KOLKATA: Two FIRs were registered and a person was arrested in the last 48 hours as cops stepped up their fight against rumour-mongering. What was appalling was the fact that most of these rumour-mongers are well-educated students, bankers, chartered accountants and even government officials.

Worsening things was an ‘April Fool’s’ message stating that the lockdown will continue for 10 additional days after August 14. Only when an attached file is downloaded does the receiver understand that s/he has been ‘fooled’.

A day after a woman was arrested for spreading panic in New Alipore, it was the turn of Techno City police under Bidhannagar police to arrest a 26-year-old man who has been spreading rumours of as many as six people of a New Town housing complex being diagnosed with Covid-19. The accused — Muslem Ali Moll, a resident of Patharghata — is unemployed. He had forwarded a message that he had received and claimed to have no idea about the consequences.

“He was spreading fake information over social media and WhatsApp. He had also sent in the message that the owner of the security firm was also infected. After getting the message, locals were very scared and tried to leave the place. The security guards also refused to work due to fear. Soon, a suo motu complaint was lodged and the accused nabbed,” said an investigating officer.

In north Kolkata, netizen Jayanta Kumar Saha lodged a complaint against a woman for sharing a malicious video shot outside the city, passing it off as an incident that took place within Kolkata. “The complainant was surfing his mobile phone on Ahiritola Street when he noticed the post on his Newsfeed on Facebook. Sharing such content can lead to communal tension,” an officer said.

The case was recorded at Jorabagan police station under sections 153A/295A/504/505(1)(c)(2) of IPC. The port division has lodged another FIR over the same video. “We are investigating the charges. The video was shot in Ahmedabad, but was passed off an incident in our area,” claimed the second complainant Asraful Hossain.

The Kolkata police, meanwhile, have decided to question 100 people under CrPC 41 for sharing and sending fake messages. Both CID and Bengal police have warned against circulating fake videos.

Thousands of tonne of farm produce are either packed or ready for sale but due to low demand in the market farmers fear that they will be hit hard this year. Hastimal Rajpurohit, a farmer of pomegranate in Barmer district, said that he is not sure he will be able to sale even one fourth of his produce.

“Earlier, around 400 tonne of produce was sold in the market within a few hours. Now, not even 20 tonne of fruits is sold for two days. After harvesting, transportation from one place to another a permit is required the process of which takes days to complete. At the time of harvest, it is difficult to find labour as well,” said Rajpurohit. Farmers say that perishable items cannot be kept for more than two weeks. “If it was wheat or cumin, we would have stocked it until price becomes stable. But with perishable items, we cannot keep them for long. There is also no cold storage facility available. Many farmers have already packed their produce but nowhere to sale. My condition is better as I can afford this loss but small farmers who have taken loans on interest will be ruined,” said Rohan Vishnoi. There have been incidences in last week when due to low prices in the market, farmers sent tons of cucumber to the goshalas to be fed to the cows. “I am getting minimum price in the market. What is the point of letting them rot? Now, it is being used for some animals,” said Kishan Lal, a cucumber farmer. As per the wholesalers, it is not just the availability of produce in the market but also the supply of the produce to nearby town. Jinen Ghelani, one wholesaler explained that one big mandi in the city works to transport produce to the nearby town which has now stopped.

“Mandis are very important for the sale of produce. But with street vendors finding it difficult to go to mandis, restriction in transport to nearby cities and state is hampering our business,” said Ghelani.

HYDERABAD: Days after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s announcement, the distribution of 12-kg rice (per person) to white ration card holders will commence on Wednesday. Officials along with local leaders under each fair price shop (FPS) will distribute time slot tokens to the card holders from April 1 to ensure that a large number of people do not throng FPS for rice.

Civil supplies minister Gangula Kamalakar held a high-level review meeting on Tuesday and said 12-kg rice per person would be given to every card holder without fail and as such they should not rush to the fair price shops and ensure social distance is maintained.

Civil supplies commissioner Satyanarayana Reddy said the card holders who have been taking rice regularly under PDS need not give their thumb impression on the biometric equipment. They have to just show a copy of their white ration card and after verification on EPoS machine at the shop, they would be given the rice. However, those who have not taken rice under PDS for over three months have to give their thumb impression on the biometric equipment.

Tokens would be given at the door steps of the card holders who have been regular to FPSs as their residential address data is available with officials and local leaders. Those who have shifted or have been irregular can go to the shop and request for tokens. However, all of them should not gather at FPS at the same time and maintain social distance. FPSs in rural areas can also start distributing rice from Wednesday itself if their token distribution is finished. In GHMC area wherein every FPS has a large number of card holders attached with it, the rice distribution is likely to commence on Thursday. Officials, local leaders and FPS dealers can keep shops open from 7 am to 6 pm.

NEW DELHI: Delhi government may soon start delivering dry ration to a section of beneficiaries covered under National Food Security Act 2013 at their doorstep.

Sources said the food and civil supplies department is working on a plan to send the ration—wheat, rice and sugar—to senior citizens, widows, differently abled and other vulnerable sections. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday expressed his concern over sudden rush of people at city’s fair price shops to collect their monthly entitlement of foodgrains.

In view of lockdown to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading, the government has started giving 1.5 times of the actual entitlement of ration for the month of April free of cost to over 71 lakh beneficiaries covered under public distribution system.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday also announced that the government was trying to explore sources where it can procure foodgrain from to provide ration to those not covered under the NFSA – 2013.

While Delhi government officials said the food and civil supplies department was still working on the modalities and no final decision had been taken, sources said only vulnerable section would be covered under doorstep delivery of ration during the lockdown period.

According to the data available on the website of the food and civil supplies department, 71,08,074 members of 17,50,523 families are covered under the food security act in the national capital. There are 2,011 fair price shops in Delhi to cater to more than 17 lakh beneficiary families.

While the government had instructed distribution of ration from March 30, some fair price shops opened two days earlier and witnessed long queues of card-holders. This has forced the government to explore other options.

150,['1/04/2020'],"No waiver, schools only asked to defer fee demand till after lockdown","LOCKDOWN EFFECT

Nagpur: A state education department circular requesting schools not to demand fee payment till the lockdown period ends, was misrepresented by fake news peddlers on WhatsApp causing a lot of confusion. Many parents and schools were led to believe that a complete waiver of fee has been announced even though it was at best a ‘deferred payment’ suggestion.

The circular clearly mentions that all schools are being requested not to force parents to pay either pending or next academic session’s fee till the lockdown is in force. The circular probably assumed not only financial difficulty but also the fact that many parents still prefer to pay fee by depositing cash or cheque at banks or at school fee counters. With the traditional format of fee payment not a possibility in the current situation, the state education department rightly told schools to suspend fee demands till the lockdown ends.

Some messages on WhatsApp are twisting its meaning and causing a lot of confusion. Some schools too approached TOI after incorrect interpretation of the circular reached them. As per the circular, it is clear that once the lockdown is over schools can again start collecting their pending dues.

Rajendra Dayma, president of Independent English Schools Association (IESA), said they appreciate the government’s stance. “We will comply with the state education department’s guidelines on fee collection, as we too understand the restrictions on movement,” said Dayma.

However, the Pan-Maharashtra Trustee’s Association also reminded the government that school owners are also reeling under financial stress not only because of coronavirus effect but also because of non-payment of RTE bills. Dayma said, “We have so many schools that have not been reimbursed even a single rupee for the free RTE admissions. In some cases, the reimbursement amount is already with the district education department but they are not giving it to our schools on some or the other pretext.” IESA says it stands firm on boycotting all RTE admissions till every bill has been cleared.

The RTE lottery has already been conducted in the state with parents being informed about the school their ward has got admission in. However, due to the lockdown the entire admission process has been put on hold till the government removes restriction on movement of people.

152,['1/04/2020'],done2 foreigners in Ahmednagar who tested +ve had attended Delhi meet,"Nashik: The Ahmednagar district administration has picked up 35 people, mostly foreign nationals, who had attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation at Nizamuddin in New Delhi on March 13.

Two of these foreign nationals who tested positive for Covid-19 are undergoing treatment at Evangeline Booth Hospital here in Ahmednagar. The remaining 33 have been quarantined at the Ahmednagar civil hospital. While the swab reports of 21 of them are still awaited, the other 12 have tested negative for the infection.

Ahmednagar district collector Rahul Dwivedi confirmed that the group of 35 was part of the congregation at Nizamuddin. Some of them were scholars and the rest participants. “Majority of the scholars are foreign nationals,” he said.

The foreign nationals hail from countries like Indonesia, Tanzania, Brunei, Iran, Ghana, Mauritius and Ivory Coast.

District police sources said the 35 people came from Delhi to Ahmednagar in three batches by train in mid-March. “The first group of 14 people had put up at a mosque at Jamkhed taluka. The other two batches comprising 11 and 10 people respectively were put up at mosques in Ahmednagar city and Nevasa respectively,” police sources said.

“A congregation similar to the one that had taken place at Nizamuddin was planned in Ahmednagar city on April 3. But the district administration declined permission following the Covid-19 pandemic. The groups staying in the mosques could not move out of the district due to the lockdown restrictions,” the sources said.

District superintendent of police Sagar Patil said the local police has registered FIRs against some residents who had provided shelter to the groups staying in the mosques. “These residents were duty-bound to inform the local administration about hosting foreigners so that their medical examination could have been done in view of the Covid-19 situation,” he said.

The administration picked up the first group of 14 people from the Jamkhed mosque on Sunday after a tip-off. On Monday, the other groups were picked up from Ahmednagar city and Nevasa.

District civil surgeon Pradip Murambikar said three local residents who came into contact with the group at the Jamkhed mosque tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. “We are waiting for the reports of 80 other locals who were in touch with these groups,” he said.

“The district administration has sealed areas near the mosques in Ahmednagar city, Jamkhed and Nevasa. It is undertaking an extensive survey to detect persons who came into contact with these scholars,” Murambikar said.

It is learnt that the Ahmednagar district administration played a crucial role in telling the state government that the huge religious congregation had taken place at the Delhi-based headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat in Nizamuddin in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Highly-placed official sources told TOI that the district administration shared details about the congregation with the state government on Sunday after it picked up 14 scholars from Jamkhed. “Our feedback is that the state government shared this information with the Union government,” district officials said.

A police official said the group members who were picked up did not think it necessary to share details with the local authorities about their visit to Ahmednagar. “They were too casual in their approach about entire issue. Their local contacts in the district said they did not inform the authorities about the visit to these group members since they feared that the administration would quarantine them,” he added.

The RBI had on March 27 announced that all banks, including housing finance companies, could allow deferral of loan repayment by three months but “central government had announced the moratorium on EMIs. But unless we receive instruction from our central office, we can’t do anything. People are not listening to us,” said an assistant bank manager at Indian Overseas Bank (IOB).

Sathia Narayanan, senior regional manager at IOB told TOI that borrowers should inform the bank in advance in order to seek relief in loan repayment. “As per guidelines, borrowers can contact the banks and inform the concerned authorities about relief,” he said.

Many borrowers, however, were unaware of the procedure and regarded the announcement as a three-month EMI holiday. A private company employee Srinivasa Rao said, “When I inquired about deduction of EMI from my savings account, bank officials said they have not got any instructions from their head office. I kept the money for the ration of April month as nobody knows how many days this lockdown will go on.”

“Every bank has its central system linked with servers. If central offices of banks are not changing the procedure and providing relief as mentioned by the RBI, borrowers will not get relief,” said another banker.

156,['1/04/2020'],"West Bengal: Go for online classes, CISCE asks schools","Representative image

KOLKATA: The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( CISCE ) has asked schools to go for online teaching as classroom teaching has been suspended for a prolonged period due to the nationwide lockdown .

CISCE has expressed concern over the outbreak of Covid-19, which has affected every aspect of human life. The schools too had to put all the academic activities on hold.

Under the circumstances and keeping the interest of students in mind, the council has provided some suggestions for utilising the lockdown period productively.

Council secretary and chief executive Gerry Arathoon wrote to the principals that in order to ensure that the teaching and learning activities don’t suffer, all affiliated schools should make alternative arrangements, using modern and digital means.

Online learning platforms, which help schools conduct their classes online without any limitations on the hours or numbers of classes, can be an option.

“We are aware that many schools have already started using such systems. However, it is requested that schools that are yet to go for this should use these progressive alternative measures. Besides developing their own module, schools may also use those which are already available in the public domain,” said Arathoon.

Principal of a school pointed out that the council is especially worried about the delay in holding the classes for students who are set to appear in the board examinations in 2021. “We won’t be able to complete the syllabus on time. Also, it will help if the council postpones the exams by a month,” he said.

“To conduct online classes , some audio-visual online platform may be used by teachers,” added Arathoon.

CISCE has also advised teachers to utilize the resource material available on the council’s website.

“There is an abundance of material on the council’s website for every level — from Class I to Class XII, which may be used as assignments or practice material for students. These include past years’ question papers, specimen question papers, students’ performance documents for all major subjects at the ICSE and ISC level for the past 6 years,” reads Arathoon’s letter to the heads of the schools.

For the aspiring ICSE and ISC examinees, subject-wise analysis of Pupil Performance Documents have been suggested to be studied in detail by the teachers to prepare a set of guidelines for their students on how to prepare for the ICSE and ISC examinations, as well as how to attempt the questions.

“We have also asked teachers to encourage project work,” Arathoon added.

JODHPUR: The first batch of 22 quarantined suspects, who had returned from foreign trip, was released by the administration from two quarantine centres set up in the city. They were released after they completed the period of 14 days from their arrival.

Incharge of the quarantine cell and registrar of the ayurveda university, Arun Purohit said 15 of these quarantined were released from JIET College and 7 from Maheshwari Bhawan, the other centre in the city.

According to him, currently, there are 93 suspects quarantined in JIET College, while 37 have been quarantined in Maheshwari Bhawan.

The Jodhpur administration had decided to shift all persons, having reached Jodhpur after March 17 from any foreign visit, in the quarantine centres to keep them under 14-day observation and ensure they do not come into contact with other persons. Their family members had also been screened.

“The tracing of such persons continues and some new suspects had also been quarantined in these centres on Tuesday also,” Purohit said.

Meanwhile, the decision of the administration to shift these suspects to quarantine centres had met with stiff resistance by the family members stating that they would better be quarantined at home as they had already been doing.

“But given our experience with regard to the first case of the city and its history, we decided to shift them to quarantine centres for 14 days, deducting the days they had already spent in quarantine at their home,” Purohit said.

Complaints through videos poured in wherein inmates complained about lack of cleanliness in the rooms of JIET College and expressed concern that it could be a threat to them.

Admitting this, Purohit said, initially the sanitation workers were hesitant to go in, but they were counselled and provided with the required kits for safety, after which they agreed to begin cleaning from Tuesday.

Savitribai Phule Pune University ( SPPU ), Pune, Kavayitri Bahinabai Choudhari North Maharashtra University ( NMU ), Jalgaon, and Yashwantrao Chavan Maharashtra Open University ( YCMOU ), Nashik, said on Tuesday that all the colleges affiliated with these universities will consider the lockdown period as part of their summer vacations.

SPPU released a circular on Monday and instructed all heads of departments, administrative sections, principals of affiliated colleges and directors of affiliated institutes that the university has declared interim vacation from April 1 to 14.

Prafulla Pawar, the SPPU registrar, said: “Given prevailing Covid-19 situation, the management has taken the decision. Further decisions in the matter will be taken as the need arises.”

The circular states that the faculty members of the university and the affiliated colleges may be called to carry out essential work as and when required. Also, the non-teaching (non-vacation) staff shall continue to work from home during the interim vacation.

According to the university sources, SPPU is also planning to cancel the examinations of the first-year students, but the decision in that regard is yet to be taken.

Taking similar measures, NMU and YCMOU also declared interim vacations on Tuesday.

E Vayunandan, vice-chancellor, YCMOU, said: “We generally break for two months twice a year — once in May-June and then in November-December. This lockdown period shall be adjusted in the coming vacations.”

Deelip Mhaisekar, vice-chancellor, MUHS, said: “Our university functions with a different pattern. We are planning to adjust these days of lockdown in the next academic year’s vacations but no decision has been taken yet.”

163,['1/04/2020'],‘How many times can we revise the text?’,"New Delhi: For Class XII student Ayush Singh, all his Central Board of Secondary Education exams would have been over by March 24. He had everything planned for the month he would have to wait for the results to be declared. But the anti-coronavirus lockdown has upset all his intentions with two exams still to be written. Annoyed by his parents constantly asking him to study, Singh is desperate for the lockdown to end.

“How much can I keep studying the same thing repeatedly. I am so done,” said the commerce student of Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj, who has to write his Hindi and business studies exams. “Unlike a few friends who want to sit for their chartered accountancy exams and are studying, I only aim to pursue a BCom at Delhi University.”

The uncertainty of the exam schedule due to the lockdown has left parents and students stressed. Gauri Mathur, who apart from the Class XII exam also has to sit for competitive exams, grumbled, “I only have the computer science exam remaining, and, of course, the competitive exams. But everything has been rescheduled and this is a stressful time for me.”

Ritesh Anand’s daughter has just the Hindi paper to write. “It is just one paper, but it also means my daughter cannot feel free. Moreover, the NEET exams have also been rescheduled. CBSE should give us an idea of when the exams will be held.""

Mohammad Zunaid, a student of Government Boys Senior Secondary School, Sunder Nagri, is in a worse situation. He has three exams pending in geography, Hindi and English. “Due to riots, our English exam was postponed. A new date had been announced for it, but now we don’t know when it will be held. How much can I study? So I am sketching and painting instead these days,” said Zunaid.

Student counsellor Geetanjali Kumar recalled a distress call recently. “The mother was worried about her son’s exams being rescheduled,” Kumar revealed. “She wanted her son to study, and he wasn’t. So, she called me complaining that seeing him watch TV through the day was causing her anxiety and irritation.” Kumar advised her to let him relax and study at his own pace and not force him.

Since the students are not coming to the schools, the ration should be sent to them,” Jagtap said.According to him, out of 35 districts, only seven districts had delayed the process of distribution. The other 28 districts have actively started giving away the ration packets. The ration includes rice, pulses, spices and oil. It is to be distributed equally among all the students.The headmasters association of the Nashik district had told the state department that they want to postpone the distribution in view of the lockdown. S B Deshmukh, the secretary of the association, said: “We had requested that due to the police embargo, let us distribute the ration after April 14. Also, if there are any families that require ration urgently, we can make arrangements for them. But our request was turned down.”Deshmukh said there are nearly 900 schools that have to distribute the mid-day meal rations for the students of Classes I to VIII.Jagtap said the schools have to make arrangements to call the parents in small batches. “There are not many students in rural schools. The headmasters can call the parents in small batches each day. It is not an unmanageable task,” he said. He added that the schools can take assistance from the police.“If required, police can help in preventing crowding at the schools.

166,['1/04/2020'],Ministry’s mask-use advice at odds with PM adviser’s stand,"NEW DELHI: The health ministry on Tuesday said it is framing guidelines for home-made masks. However, its current guidelines on masks saying their use should be limited depending on the risk of exposure and that healthy people do not need to wear masks are at variance with a manual released by K Vijay Raghavan , principal scientific adviser to the PM, suggesting home-made masks as a strategy to prevent the spread of Covid-19 disease.On the other hand, ICMR chief epidemiologist Dr R R Gangakhedkar said India must not be compared to other western countries where the incidence of the disease is much higher. “Masks are to prevent the risk of exposure to the infection. Let us not compare India with the US where the Centre for Diseases Control has advised people to wear masks. The level of disease outbreak in India is not the same as in the US,"" he said.While Lav Agarwal , joint secretary in the health ministry, at the same briefing as Dr Gangakhedkar, said that masks were a scarce resource and everyone need not use one, earlier on Tuesday, K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific adviser to the PM, tweeted: “Masks lower the chances of coronavirus entering the respiratory system through droplets still in the air from an infected person, reducing the chances of inhaling the virus. Especially useful for people in densely populated areas.”The tweet was not necessarily at odds with the “risk exposure” criteria but suggested widespread use which the health ministry did not. Raghavan advocated home-made masks, noting “home-made masks are 70% effective and in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with soap and water or frequent hand rubbing with alcohol-based sanitiser”.However, home-made masks did not immediately receive approval of the health ministry with Agarwal saying guidelines will be issued soon. Gangakhedkar was more forthright, saying, “the US today is the second most Covid-affected country after Italy. Indian outbreak is at a very different level. The probability of exposure to Covid in India is low. So, only sick people should wear masks. The better way to prevent Covid spread is social distancing which India is following.”Agarwal also said people should wear masks only when needed and when they are suffering from cough and need to wear a mask to prevent the infection from spreading. “Masks are a scarce commodity which we must use judiciously,” Agarwal said. He said the PSA’s manual is being technically examined by the experts and guidance will be issued in time, even as he maintained that even the World Health Organisation (WHO) has not specifically advised countries on the use of home-made masks.As per health ministry’s current guidance, healthy persons need to wear a mask only if they are taking care of a person suspected with Covid-19 infection. Besides, one who is coughing or sneezing should wear a mask. “Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water,” the health ministry guidance says.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74921932,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-671342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/ministrys-mask-use-advice-at-odds-with-pm-advisers-stand/articleshow/74921931.cms
167,['1/04/2020'],MSEDCL artificially reduced distribution losses: MERC,"Nagpur: After years of manipulating agricultural pump power consumption figures, MSEDCL has been finally caught red-handed. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has accepted recommendations of a working group on agricultural sales, constituted by it, and stated that the distribution loss was far higher than that claimed by the MSEDCL.

The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) in its tariff hike petition had claimed that distribution loss in its area in 2018-19 was 14.7%. However, the working group stated in its report that it was 5.84% higher, that is 20.54%. The artificial reduction was done by inflating farm pump power consumption. MSEDCL has been for years not reducing power theft and claiming that farmers were using more units and passing off electricity stolen as electricity used.

The artificial increase in farm pump consumption was done in two ways. The first was to claim that unmetered farmers were using more electricity. There was no data to back this claim. MSEDCL put forth this claim every year in its tariff hike petitions. This could not be possible with metered farmers. So, the discom sent them inflated bills.

This problem was acknowledged by then BJP energy minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule. He had ordered MSEDCL to hold camps to correct power bills of farmers. In 2015, Bawankule also formed a three-member committee under MSEB Holding Company director Vishwas Pathak to find out actual power consumption by farm pumps.

IIT Powai was also asked to estimate it. Based on the IIT report, two members of the committee — consumer activists Pratap Hogade and Ashish Chandarana — concluded that MSEDCL was inflating agricultural power consumption. However, Pathak refused to sign the report and submitted a separate report exonerating MSEDCL. Now, Pathak has been proved wrong and Hogade and Chandarana have been proved right.

The commission has pulled up the MSEDCL for claiming more subsidy from the state government by inflating agricultural electricity sales. The government pays a subsidy on every unit of power sold to farmers because they get it at a highly subsidized rate. MSEDCL has thus duped government of thousands of crores over the years, it was bared.

The commission has, however, not charged MSEDCL with deliberately inflating farm pump consumption. It has claimed that accurate figures could be calculated by the working group due to use of advanced technology.

169,['1/04/2020'],"Sex workers run out of food, essentials","Deserted view of GB road during a nationwide lockdown, imposed in the wake of coronavirus pandemic in New Delh... Read More

New Delhi: “Are we not human that we have been left to die like this?” This was asked by one of the thousands of sex workers at GB Road , who are struggling to survive because of lack of income amid the countrywide lockdown.

More than 4,000 sex workers usually operate from the cramped multi-storeyed brothels. Of these, at least 2,000 are still staying in their dingy quarters, while the others have been shifted out by their handlers.

When TOI spoke to the sex workers, they said they have been making distress calls for the past three days as they have run out of food.

Virender Kumar, director of NGO Mission Mukti Foundation, said they along with officials from Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights rushed to check on the sex workers after getting the distress calls.

“We saw the women living in a very sad state. They had rations for only one meal. Since nobody is visiting the brothels due to the lockdown, there is no way for them to make money. They have not been able to buy the bare essentials, including milk,” Kumar said.

Kumar added that they are making a list of the brothels where help is required. “We will buy food for these women with donations so that they can stock it for at least a week. I urge agencies to help these women during these difficult times,” he added.

A sex worker lamented, “Delhi government is providing food in several schools, but we feel ashamed of going out. So, we have locked ourselves in the brothels. We don’t have medicines and haven’t eaten since the past two days. We’ll die like this.”

Many of these sex workers have children too, which is another reason for them to worry. “Some of us have savings. But even that will get over in no time if things continue like this. I don’t have milk to feed my child. We know we are outcasts in society, but even we are human. If the government doesn’t save us, we will starve and eventually die. Don’t save us, but at least save our children,” said a sex worker.

“People look at us with disrespect and treat us like untouchables. That’s why we haven’t been going to the hunger relief centres. The younger girls have been taken away, but we have nowhere to go. I have been at this brothel for the past 35 years and have never starved like this,” said a 50-year-old sex worker.

171,['1/04/2020'],They can’t cook to save their lives...,"New Delhi: Shikha Mittal, a resident of south Delhi’s tony Safdarjung Development Area, is a successful entrepreneur who lives alone, works from 9.30am to 9.30pm and travels frequently. Cooking, however, was a skill she neither possessed nor required — until the novel coronavirus upended everyone’s life.

The 36-year-old said, “I live alone here to be closer to my office and the airport, while my parents live in Kamla Nagar in north Delhi.” Hiring a domestic help, cook and gardener ensured the founder-director of Be.artsy, which helps organisations involved in financial literacy and prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace, didn’t have to worry about her home.

She returned from an overseas visit in early March and opted for self-quarantine, surviving 14 days mainly on milk and fruits. Just when her isolation ended, the nationwide lockdown was announced. Deprived of her cook, Mittal requested her mother to send her voice notes on how to cook basic things. She also looked up cooking instructions on YouTube. “I typed ‘aaloo ki sabzi basic’ and saw hundreds of videos,” said Mittal. Thanks to tech, the entrepreneur has quickly learnt how to make paneer parantha, papad ki subzi, tahri and other dishes. She has also got used to the jhaadu-pochha routine.

For thousands of Delhi residents who can’t cook to save their lives and depend on domestic helps, neighbourhood eateries or tiffin services for meals, technology has come as a saviour. From online cooking courses to voice notes and video calls from family members, it has saved the day for those who never thought a lockdown could leave them starving.

Videos with catchy tags, such as ‘lockdown recipes’, ‘Coronavirus cooking’ and ‘quarantine recipes’, are a rage on YouTube. Indian recipes requiring basic cooking skills are garnering lakhs of views. In fact, such videos are being uploaded every hour and the less fussy the recipe, the more popular the video. Most of the videos instruct newbies on cooking meals with the minimum resources, at times without even vegetables. Of course, the lockdown recipes of celebrity chefs like John Torode and Jamie Oliver are garnering outlandish number of views.

Sudhir Kumar, 24, a Munirka resident employed in a private firm, relied on his ‘aunty’ for meals, but the virus curtailed all her arrivals. Kumar learnt to make dal chawal when he found kneading flour for the more preferable chapati was beyond him. “But you can’t eat dal chawal twice a day for days,” Kumar laughed. “So, I started looking up online vidoes.”

Kumar experimented with continental food, which he liked but couldn’t find ingredients in Munirka. He replaced processed flour and butter with the readily available atta and ghee. “I even used atta to make white pasta sauce today,” he smiled. “I have huge stock of oregano seasoning and chilli flakes and I use these liberally for every dish.”

For Shaheen Bagh resident Aamir Aijaz, 32, a self-proclaimed foodie and a cookery illiterate, simple food wouldn’t do the trick. “During my wife’s frequent travels to Mumbai, I ate out. But now she’s stuck in Mumbai and the eateries in my area are closed,” said Aijaz. Unlike most caught in a similar predicament, online videos didn’t work for the development sector worker. “When in doubt, you can’t ask questions to a video,” he explained. Instead he chose to make a video call to his wife.

“I started with dal chawal and then moved to aaloo ki subzi. With the confidence I gained, I graduated to egg curry and yesterday, I made pulao and chicken curry,” Aijaz said with unhidden pride. His wife approved of his effort, but did he? “It was awesome,” Aijaz beamed.

The unprecedented situation is taking a toll on the mental and physical health of these saviours of humanity.With an aim to ease the pressure off doctors, city-based NGO Parindey Foundation has started a digital doctor consultancy helpline for coronavirus on WhatsApp. The helpline offers patients the opportunity to get free consultancy from specialist doctors.The initiative, christened ‘Niraamayaa Bhava’ was started by Siddhartha Roy, a 21-year-old author and community developer, and chartered accountant Niranjan Jadhav, supported by Dr Aarzoo Meghrajani — who manages the operational aspect of the advisory.When patients reach out on the WhatsApp number 7020844301, the doctor in-charge sends a symptom sheet to them to know their profile and travel history. After analysing the report, the doctor provides a solution and if needed, sets an appointment for a video/telephonic call.If the symptoms are severe, the patient is advised to meet the doctor in person. After the physical check-up, the patient is prescribed medicines or necessary tests.“I have been working on various government projects for innovation and social change, but this is the time when we all should come together and do our bit,” says co-founder Siddhartha Roy.“I had this idea in my mind from a long time, but felt that executing it alone would be challenging, which is why I collaborated with Parindey Youth Foundation and several doctors. It feels good to do our bit for the society,” he adds.“We had seen the sufferings of China and knew that if Covid-19 hits India, it'll hit us really hard. So we decided to make our citizens aware about it and reduce the stress on government hospitals. It has worked well and people have given a really good response,” says co-founder Niranjan Jadhav.The initiative was launched by district collector Ravindra Thakare on March 20, and around 110 people have been helped through this platform by now.Dr Geeta Pedgaonkar, a senior doctor who is associated with the initiative, says, “More than the disease itself, it is the fear which needs to be fought. The situation is such that even if people have regular cough, they start worrying of contracting the virus. The symptoms, travel history and other sources of exposure need to be carefully analysed for us to give measured advice. We are working on removing this fear from their minds.”“I was very scared when I developed coronavirus-like symptoms . After a detailed online consultation through the platform, I was advised some tests. However, my reports were negative and I was discharged from the hospital,” says a beneficiary on the condition of anonymity.The panel of doctors associated with the initiative comprises Dr Shailendra Mundhada, Dr Aarzoo Meghrajani, Dr Satish Deopujari, Dr Geeta Pedgaonkar, Dr Devika Jadhav, Dr Madhavi Deshmukh, Dr Shreya Kate and Dr Nishi Roy.

175,['1/04/2020'],...While they cook to make a living,"New Delhi: Perhaps antakshari comes first to mind when you have to while away the hours with your family in these days of the anti-coronavirus lockdown. But there’s something more interesting cooking. Chefs, barred from their hotel kitchens, are using the break to stream cookery sessions. These are helping people not only to bring out their inner cooks, but also proving it is more stimulating to wield a ladle than sing about one.

Home cooking and home workout are the only two online trends beating the news about the novel coronavirus. The drudgery of being imprisoned at home appears suddenly to be lightened by the cardamom and almond phirni of chef Abhishek Gupta, the carrot coconut and turmeric soup and tomato rice of chef Megha Kohli, the pancake recipe of The Grammar Room and the corn khichdi and green chilli prawns of Comorin restaurant. And for those inclined more to liquid sustenance, no antakshari success could outdo the sessions on how to make heady Quarantini and other cocktails by mixologists Nitin Tewari and Yangdup Lama.

These chefs are enabling people to prepare dishes with minimal, available ingredients. Chef Vanshika Bhatia related how her friends started messaging her for recipes of basics like roti and parantha. “Many singles in the city rely on ordering in or domestic maids for their meals. I realised many of them hadn’t cooked in their lives and were facing a genuine problem,” said Bhatia. “That is the reason I decided to keep my recipes simple and use readily available ingredients.”

Bhatia has posted videos on making pizza and bread as well as preserving and pickling. She taught how bread can be made without yeast and crepes with kuttu atta for Navratri, suggested ways to make pizza toppings and sauces and even showed how easy it was to make cough remedies. Most usefully, she suggested alternatives to fancy ingredients.

In one session, chefs Anchal Bhalla and Suchana Bera discussed how to enjoy the simple but popular Bengali staple, aloo makha (mashed potatoes), with flaxseed chutney. Both Bhalla and Bera concurred on the need to stop binging on unhealthy snacks at home, with still quite a few days of indolence left. Bhalla has posted videos, for instance, on healthy home-made crackers. “I am trying to post videos of essential dishes for single professionals and dishes that a mother can cook with a rkid, such as a cake, with the ingredients normally found in homes,” explained Bhalla.

From his home in Uttarakhand, chef Pawan Bisht has been countering the overall despair and panic through his videos. “There was so much negativity online that I thought rather than be an expert on the coronavirus, I would share what I know,” Bisht said. “When I started posting the cookery videos, the response showed that people needed a break from the information deluge on Covid-19.”

Bisht is also acquainting Indians with his native cuisine, cooking with ingredients from his home state. His videos teach people how to use alternative ways of cooking. Bisht laughed and said he never imagined that people would be able to destress themselves by looking at him making bhang ki chutney, aloo ke gutke, sarson ka saag and urad dal ke vade. He certainly helped the citizens go one up on the national isolation.

177,['1/04/2020'],17 Tablighi members visited Jaisalmer two weeks ago,"Jaisalmer: Around the time when cases of Covid-19 started increasing in the country, a 17-member group of Tablighi Jamaat arrived here from Delhi on March 17 and took part in programmes held at a few mosques. The group had arrived in the district on February 26 before heading to Jaisalmer three weeks later. The group went to Pokhran on March 19.

Though no case of coronavirus has been reported here, the visit of this group has alerted the local intelligence officials, security agencies and the district administration.

Jaisalmer SP Kiran Kang confirmed that the group came from Delhi in mid-March. “They went to various areas of Sadar police station. We are trying to find out the places they visited. We have received information about them going to Pokhran from Jaisalmer,” Kang said on Tuesday.

According to official sources, the group had started a 40-day tour to various parts of the country and was in Jaisalmer on March 17 during which they visited few religious places and mosques and took part in programmes in which dozens of people were present.

Sources said when CID and other intelligence agencies got information about the group going to different places in the city without permission, they objected to it following which the group left for Pokhran the next day. Reportedly, the group stayed in Pokhran and took part in some programmes and when security agencies got information, they were asked to leave Pokhran as well.

After this, their last local movement was found at a few places in Jodhpur division.

Sources said till now, there is no information about them, but intelligence and security agencies are trying to trace the members. Since the virus shows symptoms after a few days, therefore local administration and security agencies are worried and are trying to collect more details.

178,['1/04/2020'],What steps taken for migrant workers: HC to Rajasthan,"Representative image

JAIPUR: A division bench of Rajasthan High Court has sought a reply from the state government on what measures have been taken for migrant workers walking on the roads amid the lockdown.

The bench comprising Justice G R Moolchandani and Justice NS Dhadha sought a reply while hearing a petition by advocate James Bedi, which was converted as public interest litigation (PIL).

In the letter, Bedi informed the court that much discomfort was caused to migrant labourers while they walked thousands of miles amid the lockdown. He also brought it to the notice of the court that thousands were still trapped on the road without food, water and transportation facilities and alleged no facility of stay for these labourers.

The bench heard the advocate through audio calling. Advocate Bedi appealed to the court to protect the human rights of the workers.

The bench stated that they too have seen this in many news and videos, though the government has tried to provide food, transport and shelter. But such conditions were created due to fear among the workers. In this regard, the court has sought a detailed report on April 7.

179,['1/04/2020'],BMC starts ‘sealing’ hospitals if a patient turns out to be positive,"Disinfectants will be sprayed only by civic authorities.

MUMBAI/THANE: The number of nursing homes and hospitals being “sealed” after unknowingly treating Clovid-19 patients is increasing across the city. TOI found at least five nursing homes and small hospitals whose staff is under quarantine and they are unable to accept new patients. BMC officials refused to confirm any number, though.

Experts said the BMC’s idea to quarantine medical staff of such centres for 14 days would affect access and quality of healthcare in the city.

On Tuesday, a Chembur-based 100-bedded hospital became the latest to “shut” its doors on patients after a patient turned out to be Covid-19 positive. When TOI called the hospital’s reception desk, the operator said it isn’t taking new patients even in casualty. A Thane nursing home’s staff is quarantined there itself as a patient tested positive after being transferred to another hospital in Mumbai.

One of the first victims of Covid-19 from Deonar was admitted in a local nursing home and her positive reports came a day after she passed away. In another instance, an 86-year-old Ghatkopar resident who died in L H Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, on Monday had spent a week in a nursing home in Mulund. It was closed for a 14-day period.

A senior BMC official said there is no policy to seal a hospital or nursing home, but according to World Health Orgainisation rules, its staff has to get tested for Covid-19 and quarantined.

Kishore Gandhi, assistant municipal commissioner of BMC’s T Ward, said, ""After the 86-year-old patient tested positive for Covid-19, we immediately got the staff tested as per protocol.” Of the 55 persons tested, one nurse was positive. “We hence asked the hospital to not admit any new patients for the next 14 days and asked those who were tested to home quarantine for the next 14 days,” he added.

Hospital owner Dr Prince Surana said given the shortage of medical manpower, stopping every such nursing home or hospital would only worsen the crunch. Another doctor said the government should ask medical staff to use protection equipment and N95 masks even while treating non-Covid-19 patients.

In Thane (West), 32 staff and 11 patients admitted to a private hospital in Vartak Nagar were quarantined after a 34-year-old man previously admitted there tested positive on Monday. He has a travel history to the UK, said TMC deputy municipal commissioner Sandeep Malvi. He is the 11th positive patient in Thane.

181,['1/04/2020'],Rajasthan: 266 coaches to be made quarantine units,"These coaches will have extra space for oxygen cylinders, medical equipment and toilets

JAIPUR: The engineering wing of North Western Railways (NWR) is tirelessly working to convert 266 coaches into isolation wards for keeping Covid-19 suspects. On the direction of the railway board, the engineers and technical staff at the carriage workshop in Ajmer and in other divisions of NWR are burning midnight oil to complete the task.

These coaches will have extra space for oxygen cylinders, medical equipment and toilets. With the preparation of these coaches, NWR will be able to accommodate 4,256 isolation beds for patients to be brought for quarantine isolation.

Authorities of NWR on Tuesday said work was in progress and they were on the job of making the isolation coaches as early as possible.

As a part of Covid-19 preparedness, it was decided by Indian Railways to have 20,000 coaches with quarantine facilities. “We have been assigned the task to convert 266 coaches into quarantine isolation facility. Our engineers and other technical staff are on the job to get it done as soon as possibleWe are going to provide it to the state government to bring patients needing quarantine isolation,” said Abhay Sharma, chief public relations officer, NWR.

On specification and modifications of these coaches, a senior officer of engineering wing said, “We have been asked to remove the middle berth and ensure proper space for patients, dedicated space for doctors and para-medical staff attending to them. Extra electrical switches and holders in every cabin to facilitate the team of doctors,” the officer added.

Mosquito nets would be provided on the windows of the coaches. “Also for insulation of the coaches, bamboo/khus mats would be fixed and pasted on the roof. Also extra charging points for laptops, mobile phones and for medical equipment will be installed,” the officer added. “These are non AC sleeper coaches which are under modification. Each coach is expected to have 16 beds for quarantine isolation which means NWR would have 4,256 beds for patients,” the officer added.

Also every cabin in the coach would have three dustbins each with foot operated lids of red, blue and yellow colour suitably lined with garbage bags.

182,['1/04/2020'],Migrant workers get lukewarm welcome at native villages,"Jaipur: Even as thousands of migrant workers return to their native villages in Dausa, Karauli, Sawai Madhopur and other districts of the state, their journey does not just end there. The people residing in their villages are cautious about the Covid-19 pandemic, and are asking these workers to stay under quarantine and not to visit their homes directly.

In some districts, the villagers themselves are intimating the district authorities on their arrival and the administration is then keeping these people in isolation at schools, panchayat buildings and other places in the villages.

TOI on Tuesday spoke to many villagers in Dausa, Karauli and Sawai Madhopur districts where a sizeable number of migrant workers have arrived from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi.

“Five people have arrived from Delhi, where they work as labourers in Pitampura locality. We have informed about their arrival to the Patwari as soon as they were spotted entering into the village. They are kept at a house away from their home where they are given food. A team of paramedical staff and district administration had also visited them,” said Nekiram Gujjar of Bhandarez village in Dausa district.

Similarly people in Karauli, Sawai Madhopur and Sikar too have reported such arrivals to the district authorities and local officials like Gram Patwari. “Even there is good awareness in the villages, our teams comprising ANMs, Asha workers and others are doing survey. Yet, many cases in which migrant workers have arrived have been reported by the villagers themselves,” said a senior officer in district administration, Sawai Madhopur.

However, there are also complaints that health officials and other concerned officials are not going for door-to door surveys at many villages.

Health department has already directed various districts and its health, local administration and police to keep an eye on the migrant workers arriving there, who have come either from other districts in Rajasthan or from other states.

Although few traders are still dispatching onions procured in the past two days, onion consignments to domestic markets are expected to come to a grinding halt in a day or two.According to traders, this may create a scarcity in the next few days and may lead to a rise in wholesale onion prices if supply is not resumed.Around 30-35,000 quintal of onions are auctioned every day at Lasalgaon APMC and two of its sub-markets in Niphad and Vinchur. Nearly 20,000 quintal are auctioned at the Pimpalgaon APMC. The remaining 70,000 quintal are auctioned at other eight APMCs at Chandvad, Umrane, Malegaon, Sinnar, Satana, Kalwan, Deola and Yeola.Jaydatta Holkar, the former chairman of Lasalgaon APMC and an onion trader himself, said: “There is likely to be an onion scarcity if auctions do not resume.”“Prices may also increase,” added Sandip Magar, the secretary of Chandvad APMC.“The detection of Nashik district’s first positive Covid-19 patient — a resident of Pimpalgaon Nazik village adjacent to Lasalgaon — has sparked fear among the traders.

Orders were issued by chief minister Ashok Gehlot a few days back to establish a war room in every district to resolve citizens’ issues. Officials of all the departments – PHED, JMC, water, medical, animal husbandry and others have been made part of the war room.

Additional district collector (IV) Ashok Kumar said the main purpose of this war room is to resolve citizens’ issues as soon as possible. “About 16 officials have been appointed who will be on duty 24x7 attending calls of people who are facing difficulty in getting water, electricity or ration.

Officials have been asked to immediately inform their departments concerned regarding the complaints received. Any complaint, if not resolved in a day, should be informed to the authorities. A list of complaints received and resolved should be submitted to the collector every day.

“I request to all the citizens to stay at home and avoid going out without any reason to prevent the spread of disease. Anyone can call on – 0141-2204475 or 0141-2204476 to register a complaint for any problem during the lockdown,” Kumar added.

189,['1/04/2020'],"For women, dupattas turn protective gear","MADURAI: In view of Covid-19, it is important to wear masks as a precautionary measure to curtail the spread of the virus. However, many people, who come for shopping, predominantly women, are seen covering their faces with a piece of cloth, handkerchiefs or dupattas as protective gears while their husbands are seen wearing a proper mask.

Most men in the markets can be seen wearing the green mask sold in medical shops. “What is surprising is that some couples come to do the shopping, and while the husbands are seen wearing a proper mask, the women are seen using their sarees or dupattas around their face as a mask. This is so wrong in the current situation and I have told some of them that the mask was equally important for both,” said a policeman on duty near the Anna Nagar market.

There is also the problem of many people reusing the disposable masks after doing the shopping and that could be dangerous.

A corporation official said that many people seemed to be in holiday mode, shopping in pairs and some of the couples were carrying infants while shopping in crowded places like the Nelpettai fish market.

City’s leading pulmonologist Dr M Palaniappan said that wearing masks while going to public places was a must. “They should be wearing proper masks and not cloth and handkerchiefs as that would not serve the purpose,” he said. He added that a person may be asymptomatic or a sick person could have sneezed or coughed in a particular place and moved away. But, the aerosol containing the virus would be in the air for about one hour or more, hence wearing a proper mask was a must in these times.

“I have been trying to place an online order for groceries since last Monday. None of the online stores are accepting orders,” said Krishna B, a housewife. She said that unless these stores start functioning fully it will be hard to remain in self-isolation as people will be forced to step out to buy groceries.

“Despite the officials saying that they are issuing passes for delivery boys working with these online stores, the situation on the ground looks very different.

We are delivering older orders first and should begin taking new orders within a day,” read a message on its app.

TRICHY: Even as the Gandhi market facility has been closed indefinitely as part of the lockdown, vendors in makeshift vegetable markets are reluctant to pay the indirect user fee charged by the person who had taken the Gandhi market space on lease from the corporation . The user fee collection will impact the price of vegetables, vendors said.

While ensuring supply of vegetables amidst the lockdown remains an uphill task for authorities, vegetable vendors on Tuesday lamented the Trichy Corporation’s insensitive approach in charging indirect user fee. People continue to hand out tokens and collect user fee from vegetable traders at the behest of the lessee.

“Collection of user fee during such a difficult time is inhumane. Traders are using the land provided by the district administration, why should the corporation collect user fee?” Akbar Ali , a vegetable trader said. A section of vegetable traders said that the user fee, around Rs 25 to Rs 50 per shop, may force small-time traders to compensate their expense by hiking vegetable price. The user fee collection was reported at all the four makeshift markets including Anna Stadium and Cauvery bridge.

Understanding the difficulty in sourcing vegetables and since Gandhi market space is not used by vegetable traders, the vendors urged the corporation to stop the lessee from collecting user fee. However, the corporation seems unmoved. “The market was leased to a person for Rs 1.75 crore. If we insist him to stop the fee collection, we will have to repay the sum which is unlikely now,” a corporation official said.

A group of people from various walks of lives have taken permission from the city police to feed the dogs once a day through a common kitchen to prepare food.The closure of commercial establishments, particularly street food stalls, has hit stray dogs hard as they depend on them for their daily feed. Also, with public movement drastically reduced and with no littering, stray dogs have been roaming around for food. That was when a group of people formed a WhatsApp group called “Feed stray dogs” comprising around 30 people from various parts of the city. The group has also availed of vehicle pass from the city police to move around to feed the animals. “We have arranged a common kitchen in Singarathope to cook food for the stray dogs. Five volunteers will place the food on paper plates in the evening and night,” G V Karthik , one of the volunteers, said. On Monday alone, the group fed 50 stray dogs at Palpannai, Lakshmipuram and Ariyamangalam localities.Rice, egg and chicken waste from shops and sponsored by people were mobilised for the common kitchen to feed the canines. “We have planned to feed at least 500 stray dogs a day during the lockdown. Lack of food may prompt the canines to attack people,” M Sekaran, a social worker added. Besides the group, various individuals who usually complain about stray dog menace have come forward to help the animals craving for food.",trichy,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74925025,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-230874,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/locals-help-stray-dogs-beat-hunger/articleshow/74921047.cms

That would require all Americans to take seriously their role in preventing the spread of disease, she said.Trump called American efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus ""a matter of life and death"" and urged the public to heed his administration's guidelines. He predicted the country would soon see a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in the pandemic that has killed more than 3,500 Americans and infected 170,000 more.""I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead,"" Trump said. ""We're going to go through a very tough two weeks.""Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said the numbers are ""sobering"" and called on Americans to ""step on the accelerator"" with their collective mitigation efforts.""We are continue to see things go up,"" Fauci said. ""We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working and will work.""Birx said pandemic forecasts initially predicted 1.5 million to 2.2 million deaths in the U.S . But that was a worst-case scenario, without efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus through social distancing.Birx said states that have not yet seen a spike in cases as New York has could take action to flatten the curve of rising hospitalizations and deaths.As for the projection of 100,000-240,000 deaths, Fauci of the National Institutes of Health said: ""We don't accept that number, that that's what it's going to be. ... We want to do much better than that.""The comments came after Trump announced Sunday that he was extending to April 30 the social distancing guidelines that urged Americans to cease social gatherings, work from home, suspend onsite learning at schools and more in a nationwide effort to stem the spread of the virus.It was an abrupt reversal for Trump, who spent much of last week targeting April 12 as the day he wanted to see Americans ""pack the pews"" for Easter Sunday services.Many states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings.Trump spoke after another troubling day for the stock market, which has been in a free fall as the cononavirus ground the economy to a near-halt and left millions unemployed.

196,['1/04/2020'],Migrant labourers use farms to walk to avoid getting caught,"NASHIK: The fear of getting caught is forcing migrant workers off the roads and into the fields. Many workers from Mumbai and Pune are now walking through the farms adjacent to highways to approach their respective destination.

Many migrants from Mumbai were spotted walking through the fields to prevent getting spotted by the police amid the country-wide lockdown.

Those spotted outside their homes are being detained by the police and handed over to the district administration. On Monday, superintendent of police Arti Singh said that a large number of people were found walking through the fields and open spaces on either side of the highways in an attempt to hide from police at the checkposts.

On Monday, 750 people were detained by the police. While some were found travelling in six trucks and tempos, many were spotted walking.

“Those detained have been handed over to the district administration. They will be boarded in different facilities till April 13. They are being provided with food and medical attention,” the police said.

Police officers added that they did not find anyone walking on the roads on Tuesday. However, at around 4 am, 49 people were found travelling in a truck. They were heading towards the Nashik city from Trimbakeshwar.

DCP Vijay Kharat said they had put up a checkpost in Pimpalgaon Bahula on the Trimbak Road. Around 4 am, the police saw a truck approaching from the Trimbakeshwar side. They intercepted the truck and interrogated its driver who told police that his name was Pappu Abdul Khan (27) and he was a resident of Bhivandi in Thane district and a native of Baihiraich in Uttar Pradesh.

When police asked him the reason for travelling during the lockdown, he failed to give a satisfactory answer. When his vehicle was checked, police found 49 men cramped inside it.

They were immediately shifted to school number 26 of the Nashik Municipal Corporation in Swarbaba Nagar, Satpur. Police said that they were provided with food and accommodation at this facility, adding that their medical check-up will also be conducted.

Meanwhile, an offence was registered against the truck driver under various section of the Indian Penal Code including section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant).

Police are also keeping a vigil on open fields adjacent to the highways to check if more people are heading towards Nashik from Mumbai and Pune.

In the city, even on Tuesday, people as couples were seen visiting makeshift markets set by the district administration. Maduram school ground and Cauvery bridge markets saw multiple members of families thronging vegetable markets. “Though the authorities had made circular markings to maintain social distancing, people come as a family to purchase vegetables,” said S Ramachandran , a vegetable vendor. Since milk and vegetables are available nearby, villagers said that they hardly go out of their houses. “We move out only to check our agriculture fields.

GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government in a significant move eased lockdown restrictions on Tuesday through a government resolution (GR) freeing the movements of all kinds of goods carriers, while earlier only those transporting food and essentials items were allowed.

The GR issued by the transport commissioner says, “To control the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19) in the country the government of India under the Disaster Management Act 2005 banned movement of all vehicles except those carrying food items and medicines. However, with revised instructions from the government of India’s home secretary, it has been directed to lift the ban on the movement of all kind of goods carriers so hereby all collectors, police commissioners, district police authorities, RTO officers are directed to not restrict movements of any goods carrier. After this order any goods carrier may move without any movement pass.”

By this order, the government will freely allow all kind of goods carriers to move, which will help restart many economic activities that were hit by the lockdown.

“Restricted movement of transporters was hampering supply of several non-essential commodities which were used as raw materials for packaging industry. The move will help ease supplychain issues. However, manpower issues are still rampant."" Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transport Association (AGTTA).

Meanwhile, reacting to the development, president of Gujarat Trader’s Federation, Jayendra Tannna, said, “The government decision will add to the ease of movement of goods, at a time when the demand has gone up and the supply is slow. However, manpower issues are being faced by transporters as well as distributors and thus, special permissions for movement of drivers, labourers and others involved in transport should be done and they should not be harassed by police personnel.""

Trichy and Pudukottai also have a total of 30 attendees of the conference who have been isolated at government hospitals besides the Indonesians quarantined in Thanjavur. Participants of the conference are also home quarantined in Perambalur district .

“As many as 29 people, including a Kulithalai-based man who was tested positive for Covid-19, from the area had attended the Delhi conference. All of them have been admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital in Karur and blood samples taken for testing,” state transport minister M R Vijaya Baskar said. He said that the details about their residences, family members, the places they visited etc were collected by the officials.

After attending the conference, he returned to Kulithalai after landing at Trichy by flight from Chennai on March 26. As he developed Covid-19 symptoms, he approached the hospital and was admitted. The minister said two of his co-passengers have been kept under observation at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) and another one has been admitted to IRT Government Hospital in Perundurai.

MUMBAI: The cash-strapped Maharashtra state government has partly deferred payment of March salaries to its employees and elected representatives. The decision applies to the chief minister, cabinet ministers, MLAs as well as staff in government and semi-government establishments, universities and aided organizations. Salaries of police personnel and health staff, who are working round-the-clock to fight Covid-19, will be affected too.

Finance minister Ajit Pawar said the salaries will be paid in two instalments over the next few months. CM Uddhav Thackeray said, “There is no question of slashing anyone’s salary. We will be giving it in instalments due to the economic crisis the state is going through currently. Also, we will prioritize the instalments for all our staff engaged in providing essential services, like police and health workers.”

As per the decision taken by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, the CM, cabinet ministers and MLAs will be paid 40% of their salaries for March. Class I and II employees will be paid half their salaries and Class III 75% of their salaries. Class IV employees will get full salaries.

The state has nearly 17 lakh employees and pensioners. As the monthly salary bill comes to about Rs 12,000 crore, deferment of pay will save government up to Rs 5,000 crore this month. The state’s salary bill is Rs 1.5 lakh crore annually. Nearly 1.1 lakh people are Class I and II employees, five lakh are Class III staff and 1.2 lakh Class IV. Then there are two lakh in police and two lakh teachers.

“All our resources are being used to fight the coronavirus outbreak. The state government is also under a lockdown, which has also led to a decrease in state revenue. The state’s financial condition is such that some expenses need to be pushed,” said Pawar.

The Opposition criticized the decision to put off salary payment of health staff and cops. BJP MLA Nitesh Rane tweeted: “Why is Maharashtra Gov cutting salaries of Police and health department workers and officers.. they r the ones... risking their lives n working overtime for us!”

“The state has promised to pay the remaining part of the salaries in the next months. We accepted it in larger public interest,” said G D Kulthe, advisor to the Maharashtra State Gazetted Officers’ Confederation.

204,['1/04/2020'],"Kolkata: Pets suffer as vets refuse to visit, shops run out of food","One of Kashika’s dogs refuses to eat home-cooked chicken

KOLKATA: While keeping the home stocked with groceries and the constant need to check one’s hygiene to prevent contracting Covid-19, the importance of keeping a food supply for pets unhindered has been overlooked. Few pet stores are open and even those are low on stocks as distributors are refusing to deliver. Online portals, too, are cancelling orders.

Worsening things is vets’ refusal to attend to pets. In such an instance, a 7-year-old labrador — Buzo — died on Tuesday after vets refused to come and check on him. Buzo’s owner Anirudh Ghosh, a resident of Ballygunge, said, “I called multiple vets when Buzo’s condition worsened. But no one agreed to see him due to the lockdown despite veterinary services not being restricted.”

For 48-year-old Mitali Banerjee, it’s getting more difficult by the day to feed her cats. “I have five rescued cats and they all are used to eating cat food. Now that the stores are shut, I have no option but to feed them milk. But they are lactose intolerant and are falling ill,” she said. Two of her cats gave birth recently and are refusing to eat the homemade khichdi. “I tried ordering cat food online but they refused to deliver. I want the government to help get the supplies started,” she pleaded.

Aniruddha Bose, a Shyambazar resident, is in a similar situation with 10 dogs to care for. “I have food for my dogs that would last just a week,” Aniruddha said. Most pure-breed dogs grow up having a particular brand of pet food and have health issues if forced to change it. Kashika Arora, who runs a pet grooming salon, has 25 pets and her stocks are almost over. “I hope the government provides help to these poor animals soon,” she said.

Feeding her dogs — Honey and Tiger — has become a tough task for south Kolkata resident Ayesha Nadeem. “My German spitz and pug are used to only special dog food and are not willing to eat home-cooked food. I have exhausted my stock of pet food now,” she rued.

Not just food, medicines, too, are unavailable and with veterinarians staying indoors, pet parents are anxious. Goutam Guha, who runs a pet shop in Baguihati said, “We get supplies from Dhulagarh but they have shut shop because of the lockdown. Local suppliers, too, refuse to deliver as they are scared of being beaten up by the police. Only government intervention can solve the problem.”

206,['1/04/2020'],‘Maintaining psychological safety is more important’,"Psychologist Anagha Bhave is busy quelling the coronavirus fear in the minds of people, especially parents, who are seeking her solutions to problems of their own as well those of their children. Her phone is forever buzzing and by going the extra mile, she is injecting positivity. Bhave shared her tips with TOI on how to cope with the situation with a strong mind.

Excerpts...

How can one make up one’s mind to accept the coronavirus situation and yet find hope?

During such unusual and trying times, a lot of us may find ourselves dwelling on ‘what-if’ and worst case scenarios. One way that can help one to feel hopeful is by remembering that anxiety arises when we focus on the likelihood of a future’s negative outcome. Just as there is a possibility that the virus outbreak might worsen in the future, there is also a possibility that it may not.

People who are extroverts are feeling trapped inside their homes. How can they divert their mind positively?

A: Social distancing and self-isolation are bound to be more difficult for people who are extroverts and enjoy socializing on a routine basis. By remembering that you are not alone in this, you may find that the feeling of loneliness and isolation reduces. A lot of youngsters are staying in touch with each other through mobile applications which are safe. It may also be helpful to shift the internal narrative from temporary discomfort to long-term health and safety, keeping in mind how one’s individual contribution can lead to the greater good.

How should parents help their children positively?

Parents should understand that maintaining their own as well as their children’s psychological safety is more important. Depending on the age group of the child, an open and calm conversation is the need of the hour. For younger children, storytelling is a great way to give a message. Stories should have a similar theme (virus outbreak) with a positive ending on how it was contained. Parents must have credible information from sources such as CDC and WHO. Teaching good habits and staying away from fake news also help.

In what way can ‘quarantine’ feel like a ‘good time’?

It can be utilized to accomplish skills and activities that are otherwise difficult to pursue due to a busy schedule. A routine can be established. This routine can involve self-care activities such as cooking healthy meals, practicing relaxing meditation, yoga and engaging in artistic endeavours.

How can one control anxiety?

One should strictly stick to the information derived from trustworthy sources. Inaccurate information not only induces stress and fear but also spreads contagious negative emotions. One can also limit constant monitoring and checking for updates, which is more anxiety-provoking than calming. If anxiety is rising, take a break from the news and social media. Avoiding information overload is a must because it will lead to over-thinking.

How can parents deal with children who are curious and scared about corona?

Equipping their mind with information is vital. It will allow the extra clutter to go away. Answer your child’s curiosity. Don’t put a veil on their questions. Gently keep a check on their emotions. Normalize the hype at home and engage them in creative and mindful activities depending on their age. Replacement of negative thoughts with positive ones helps a lot. For example, instead of ‘I’m going to fall sick’, say ‘I’m trying everything in my power to stay healthy’.

How can one create a positive environment at home?

Most of us were used to spending a sizeable portion of our day outdoors, in school or at the workplace. It can be overwhelming to suddenly feel homebound with all the family members under one roof. Wisdom then lies in bouncing back from the conflict at the earliest and not dwelling on it. If one has the privilege of space, retreating to a quiet and peaceful corner of the house can allow one to take a break from the hustle bustle of a busy household. Designating duties in advance to every family member can be very useful. Additionally, families can see this situation as an opportunity to spend quality time with each other and enjoy each other’s valued company.

How can we equally divide time between watching news and performing refreshing activities?

If one is frequently feeling gloomy, anxious and fearful after watching news, then it may be due to excessive exposure. The best way out is to watch news just twice a day and that too from one trustworthy source. Practicing mindfulness and gratitude should top the list to calm anxiety. It allows one to be in the moment, instead of constantly focusing on the future. To perform a mindfulness exercise, one needs to close ones eyes and focus on breathing. If thoughts enter your mind, then allow them to come and go gently without being judgemental or critical.

How good does meditation help in such a scary situation?

Meditation has been scientifically proven to be effective in managing anxiety and stress. Breathing exercises are commonly used to help a person develop mindfulness and deal with worry.

Do soft skills and activities work equally well for adults and children?

Mindful activities work very well with children. YouTube has guided mindful and meditation activities for children which can be practised regularly.

MADURAI: Although the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Neet) has been postponed till further notice, students are more than happy with the extra time offered by the lockdown to prepare for the test using online coaching classes and video calls.

Neet aspirant Sowmiya said she feels the current lockdown will impact Neet exam and medical admissions as well. “We can still continue to study using books, online apps and videos to prepare best for exam. But, we are anxious about how the admission process will be this time. Even college opening could be delayed,” she said. However, students are asserting that the extra time to prepare is encouraging them.

Meenakshisundaram, a government school teacher, is coaching Neet aspirants through video calls. “It will not be the same as a classroom as you need interactive classes, which available online won’t work. I coach my students one-on-one through video call. It is time-consuming but still students are able to learn better this way since they can ask questions and clear doubts,” he said.

Many teachers from both government and private schools have shared their phone numbers with Neet aspirants from their respective schools so that they can ask and clear doubts whenever they need to.

However, coaching centres have been hit hard. “It is a unique situation for us since it feels like students get additional time but they can’t go for classes. We have also had to postpone indefinitely our crash courses which we conduct post board exams,” said Tamilselvam , coordinator at a private coaching centre.

VADODARA: To ensure there is no shortage of blood in the city and that hospitals receive stable supply of blood, the Vadodara district administration on Tuesday launched a unique initiative.

All the six blood banks in the city have been provided two vehicles each so that they reach to the doorsteps of the donors, take them to the banks, collect their blood and drop them back at their homes.

“We have assigned two wards each to every blood bank. The blood banks already have a list of donors with them. Two donors can be picked up and dropped using one vehicle,” said Vadodara district collector Shalini Agrawal, who flagged off the vehicles on Tuesday.

She said such a system had become a necessity to ensure continuous supply of blood to the hospitals. The blood banks are not being able to organize mass donation camps because of COVID-19 scare coupled with 21-day lockdown.

“The blood banks in turn will coordinate with SSG Hospital and GMERS Gotri Hospital to ensure that there is no shortage of blood,” she said.

As a futuristic step, Indian Red Cross Society will also put up a link on its website through which people can register their names as donors.

“This link will be provided within the next couple of days so that there is a proper database in place and everybody can contribute in their own way towards betterment of society,” she said.

However, the man’s two-year-old son tested negative. Meanwhile, the health department has admitted another man, who works in the same Noida firm, to isolation ward and his sample for Covid-19 test has been collected.

The man had returned to Bareilly from Noida on March 22 and stayed with his family in their house in Subhash Nagar locality. Health officials said the man claimed that he learnt through WhatsApp on March 26 that his colleagues have been tested positive and he went to the district hospital on March 27 to get himself tested. After the sample of the man was collected, he was admitted to the district hospital’s isolation ward. His six family members, including his two-year-old son, were shifted to the quarantine ward.

Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Vineet Shukla said, “Covid-19 cases in Bareilly increased to six on Tuesday and all of them are linked to the Noida firm. Besides, all positive cases belong to one family which resides in Subhash Nagar locality.”

219,['1/04/2020'],MSRTC to run 3 special buses for civil hospital staff,"Representative image

NASHIK: The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), owing to the lack of public transport system due to the lockdown, would be plying three buses for the staff of Nashik civil hospital .

These buses will ply from Nashik civil hospital to Panchavati, Adgaon, Gangapur Road, Nashik Road and Deolali Camp. Around 70 employees of the hospital will benefit from this service.

Additional civil surgeon Nikhil Saindane said, “Due to the lockdown there are no buses and autorickshaws. Hence, we had approached senior officials of the MSRTC, who came to the hospital, gauged the situation and decided to run three city buses for the hospital staff.”

Other precautionary measures like ensuring that only one person sits on one seat of the bus and sanitisation of the bus will be taken care by the Nashik civil hospital. These buses will run in the morning, afternoon and evening sessions.

The nurses and class IV employees of the Nashik civil hospital were demanding that a bus facility should be arranged for them as they do not have any vehicle to reach the hospital from different parts of the city.

The capital city has 20,000 stray dogs. The dogs, which were largely dependent on leftover food of hotels and restaurants, are facing a tough time with all the hotels being closed. They are more aggressive when they are hungry and this may lead to rise in incidence of dog bites at this juncture, an expert said.

BMC deputy commissioner Shyam Sundar Sethi said the existing supplier of dog food under Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme will supply food at the rate approved by the government for 18 days starting from April 1. “We will supply food to stray animals at more than 200 identified locations in the city. Three vans have been requisitioned from BMC mechanical section to transport the animal food,” said Sethi.

A BMC official said four personnel will be deployed for each vehicle, of which two each will be from cattle drive squad and dog catching squad. The food will be supplied twice daily by the teams between 7am and 10am and between 4pm and 7pm. The cattle feed will be bought from local markets.

The BMC has also appealed to people through different media, including social media, to provide food to the distressed animals during lockdown period. Earlier the People for Animals had written to the FARD department to alleviate the distress of the animals.

AHMEDABAD: When the coronavirus pandemic has gripped the world, city police cops seem to be busy capturing how they deal with people to show to cops of all the other police stations of Ahmedabad city.

Some 50 cops, including a PSI, a PI and two ACPs were stationed in Laldarwaja in front of the Sidi Saiyyad Mosque with four cameras set up. Constables were stopping people, most of whom were involved in providing essential services, and interrogated them about why they were on the road.

The cops also did not miss the chance to issue memos for traffic violation and put people in a queue to question them. When a police officer was asked about this, a person with a DSLR camera intervened and said, “We are shooting for Saheb”. At this, a crime branch ACP, who was present at the spot, cut off the person with the camera and said, “This is a routine procedure.”

An official of Karanj police said they were shooting for a film to demonstrate to cops how they should work during the coronavirus lockdown. On why a crime branch ACP was present, the official said he also wanted to understand how to work in this situation.

“We will show this film to every police station to teach cops on how to work during the coronavirus outbreak,” said the official.

The official said as the coronavirus situation is unprecedented, they are filming the standard operating procedure for future reference.

Worried over financial losses and the volatile markets, the Hotel Association of India (HAI) has sought help from the Centre and the state government, urging them to grant tax holidays and waive some taxes and bills so that the industry can revive from the deep downturn in earnings.

In a letter to chief minister Naveen Patnaik, HAI president Puneet Chhatwal said the hotel occupancies were nearly zero owing to the wave of cancellations and suspension of airline services. “The revenue is at an all-time low and is on the verge of drying out,” the letter further said. “In this unprecedented time, the industry is in dire need of support from the government for its survival and subsequent revival,” the letter said.

HAI’s honorary secretary J K Mohanty said, “Following the lockdown in the state, hotels across Odisha became empty as the guests were asked to vacate their rooms. Even the hotels that are being used as paid quarantine facilities are not yielding good response. However, we have to pay the staff and maintain the properties.”

The HAI has urged the government to provide GST, licence fee and excise and other licences’ holidays for six months. They have also requested the government to defer utility bills and waive electricity duty for one year and property and municipal taxes and miscellaneous charges for six months. “The hospitality sector contributes significantly to the state’s revenue and is among the top foreign exchange earners and employment generators. We are confident of your support,” the letter said.

Saif Sultan, a management trainer and founder of Hope Foundation, told TOI, “With the lockdown, several people especially labourers are stranded in the city. Many have started walking towards their homes. We are also reaching out to essential service providers like police constables and Mescom workers, who have to struggle hard for a meal while on duty. With Suhail Sayed and Abdul Rishan and two cooks, we decided to set up a kitchen and distribute 150 food packets everyday. Several lorry drivers are stranded near the Baikampady industrial area and since we have obtained passes from the district administration, we will go around distributing food packets till the lockdown period is in force,” he said.

Dal, rice and pulao packets are served thrice a week and veg biryani once. “We have enough funds for the time being,” said Saif, asking donors not to contribute funds.

Earlier, Saif Sultan and Safwan Sayed donated 120 bottles of hand sanitizers to police stations and traffic police in and around Mangaluru. Neil Zackaria from St Georges Homeopathy gave these bottles at a discounted rate to Hope Foundation. “We wanted to distribute masks, but due to their shortage in the market, we could not take it forward,” he added.

238,['1/04/2020'],Manpower shortage affects goods supply in Bengaluru,"With more people staying home and most restaurants closed, demand for staples has shot up

BENGALURU: Thanks to bulk purchases made by consumers due to the nationwide lockdown, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) are flying off the shelves of wholesale and retail shops in the city.

With more people staying indoors and most restaurants shut, consumption of staples has already gone up. Traders say there is a huge demand for milk and dairy products, grains and pulses, vegetables, processed food, bread, liquid hand wash, sanitisers, antiseptic liquids, infant food, diapers, sanitary napkins, tissues and disposables.

In fact, many shopkeepers have restricted their shop timings mainly due to staff shortage and low supply from distributors.

Many shopkeepers have marked social-distancing lines, mandated customers to wear masks and use sanitiser before entering the shops. Some even put up tapes and ropes in the shop to block entry of buyers.

“These shelves are probably empty for the first time in recent years. Though there is demand but supply from distributors is low. My staff is also worried about safety as people are coming from different places. I don’t have a thermal scanner either. I don’t want to close it fully so I open only for a few hours to sell essential items like flour, oil and biscuits. I don’t want to put the safety of my workers at risk. I have also stopped distribution of drinking water cans to households,” said a shopkeeper on Lakshmi Road in Shantinagar.

R Jayant Ganig, president of Karnataka FMCG Distributors Welfare Association, said: “Most FMCG manufacturers have stocks for more than two months. But we are facing manpower shortage to deliver these products. Many workers who went to their native places for Ugadi have not returned. They are finding it difficult to return to Bengaluru due to limited transport options. There is a demand for essential items like sugar, grains and pulses.”

He said the government should provide transport facility to ferry workers from nearby places, including Tumakuru, Mandya, Hoskote and Chikkaballapur.

GR Shanmugappa, president, Federation of Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association , said there should be at least one dhaba opens (roadside eateries) every 50km for the convenience of drivers. “We are now carrying only essential commodities due to the lockdown but, unfortunately, some traders are resorting to black-marketing to create artificial shortage and also jacking up prices.”

There is also panic among drivers. B Chennareddy, leader of another lorry association, said: “The situation has improved in the last two days but still many drivers are hesitant to report to work due to Covid-19 fear. So they are still at their native places.”

239,['1/04/2020'],Telangana high court commutes life sentence of rape convict to 10 years,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Tuesday commuted the life sentence of a man who was convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl from Maripeda mandal in Warangal district.

The sentence was reduced to a 10-year term by a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy after hearing an appeal filed by the convict. He had been sentenced to a life term by a trial court in Warangal.

The HC bench upheld the conviction but disagreed with the trial court’s finding that this was a “rarest of rare” case. In October 2014, the 30-year-old who was a neighbour to the minor, had initially approached the girl with a proposal of love which the latter rejected. Angered by rejection, the man took the minor to his relative’s house where he sexually assaulted her for three days.

The girl managed to escape from his captivity, reach her parents and lodged a complaint with police. The man was then arrested and sent to jail. A trial court sentenced him to a life term in prison following which the man filed an appeal against the court’s judgment.

The high court bench examined the material and concluded that the man deserved punishment as he had outraged the minor’s modesty by force.

At one stage, the convict claimed that he had the consent of the minor to which the court said that a minor’s consent could not be considered. The convict also argued that he had not raped the girl at all saying that medical reports did not find any such marks on the minor’s body. However, the court said that inflicting injuries on the minor’s body and threatening her with dire consequences were sufficient grounds to convict him.

“Moreover, he (the convict) did not take this total denial stand before the trial court and he is not free to take such a stand before an appellate court. But this case cannot be treated as a rare case,” the high court bench said while modifying the trial court’s order.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

HYDERABAD: A fortnight after Molotov cocktails (bottles filled with flammable liquid and with a means of ignition) were hurled into a place of worship in Old City, two youths were arrested on Monday night. According to police, the accused duo had taken part in CAA/NRC protests, damaged an ATM centre and an RTC bus before targeting the place of worship.

Task Force team nabbed the offenders from their houses in Chandrayangutta and handed them over to Madannapet police for judicial remand. “The accused have confessed to committing the offences. They will be produced before the magistrate,” Madannapet police said. A case was registered under section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of IPC against the duo.

The secretary of a worship place in Madannapet had lodged a complaint with police on March 14, alleging that some unidentified persons had hurled a petrol bomb into the worship place premises. “Broken pieces of the bottle were found in front of the worship place’s door at 4.30 am when one of the workers went there to open it. When the premises was searched, two more petrol bombs were found atop the worship place,” the complainant said.

Taskforce Additional DCP G Chakravarthi said during the interrogation, the duo confessed that during protests against CAA and NRC, they had resorted to acts of arson by setting fire to a private bank

241,['1/04/2020'],"Amid corona constraints, Bengaluru couple hosts virtual naming ceremony for twins","Relatives from across India took part in the newborns’ naming ceremony via video call.

BENGALURU: Picture this. A priest chanting mantras on a TV screen and well-wishers from across the country participating in online polling to pick the names of two newborns. This was the scene at Sachin Sethi and Amita Jain’s Whitefield home, which witnessed a virtual naming ceremony on Sunday.

The couple was blessed with twin boys on February 1 and had planned a naming ceremony in March with their entire family, some of whom would fly in from Rajasthan, Arunachal Pradesh and even Assam. However, amid the Covid-19 scare , a large family gathering looked unlikely.

“I didn’t want a small ceremony with just two of us and my parents. Neither did I want to put anyone’s health at risk by inviting them here. I had to do something to make sure the ceremony involved all our family members,” Sethi told TOI.

The India head of channel services at a major IT company then took a leaf out of his new work-from-home schedule. The video conferences he took part in inspired him to conduct a virtual naming ceremony for his boys. “If we can work in that manner, why not organise a family function?” he wondered.

Sethi planned it a few days ago and connected with his relatives via a video calling app on Saturday as part of a trial run. The call lasted almost four hours. “Most of them are not very comfortable with this technology and I had to make sure we were on the same page during the ceremony. From ensuring that the internet connections were functioning to showing them how to go about the proces, it was all worth it,” he said.

Almost 30-35 people joined the ceremony through 12-15 phone lines. Among them was Amita’s father, who has been stranded in Arunachal Pradesh due to the lockdown. Her mother joined from Jaipur while other relatives participated from Kishangarh in Rajasthan, Guwahati and even Imphal.

The couple also ensured the ceremony was not bereft of any traditional ritual. They had purchased all the items required for the puja a day earlier under their priest’s guidance. “Digambar Jain Guru Muni Shri Punya Sagar Maharaj guided the ceremony online from Sri Sammed Shikharji (Bihar), a sacred place for Jains, along with Didi Veena. Pandit Praveen Kumar Jain also joined the ceremony online from Shri Shantinath Digambar Jain Temple in Wilson Garden,” Sethi explained.

Though separated by physical barriers, the elders gushed over the newborns and participated in the puja attentively. After an online poll, two names were picked from a list of eight — Avyukt and Avyaan. “Normally, the names would have been decided through picking of lots. But conducting the online poll was a wonderful experience,” recalled Sethi.

The new parents are taking all precautions in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. “It all comes down to planning. I feel the country is moving in the right direction to arrest spread of the virus. What’s most important is making the most of every situation,” he added.

245,['1/04/2020'],Staff crunch may hit LPG distribution in Bengaluru,"Representative image

BENGALURU: Supply of cooking gas is likely to be disrupted in the city because of shortage of delivery staff following the Covid-19 lockdown.

Industry sources say consumption of domestic LPG cylinders has gone up with more people working from home, most restaurants closed and online food deliveries disrupted. On the other hand, sale of commercial cylinders has reduced due to shutdown of eateries.

Distribution of gas cylinders may be disrupted due to panic booking and staff shortage. Oil companies and distributors clarified that they will deliver cylinders at houses. Ramesh Kumar, secretary, All India LPG Distributors Federation ( Karnataka Circle), said they are catering to 80% of the demand.

“There is no shortage of LPG cylinders as of now. But our delivery boys are finding it difficult to reach the agencies due to transport restrictions. Customers should not come to distributors to collect cylinders.”

Kumar said some boys are reluctant to deliver cylinders. “In Mysuru, a quarantined person directly handed over cash to a delivery person. Such people should avoid direct contact with delivery persons since LPG distribution is a large network. These boys visit multiple houses, install cylinders, give receipts and collect cash from customers,” he said, adding the delivery boys have been provided with masks and gloves.

“The number of trucks operated from LPG bottling plants to distributors has also reduced. The booking has been increased by 30-40% due to panic buying but we are doing our best to ensure that supply is not affected. The Centre should provide an insurance cover to all our staff” said Kumar.

The state run oil marketing companies- Indian Oil, BPC and HPC – says they are ensuring the supply of LPG across the state. “Delivery operations including distribution of cooking gas cylinders are functioning and the supplies are maintained normally. Gas agencies have also stocked sufficient filled LPG cylinders to cater to public demand” said an IOC spokesperson in a statement. “The state government is also giving special provision for LPG refill supplies treating it as essential commodity. Public need not resort to panic booking as people in genuine need may not get their supplies on time. All customers may book refills as per regular requirement and supplies will be ensured”, it adds.

246,['1/04/2020'],Apartments in Bengaluru report 8-10% jump in water usage,"Representative image

BENGALURU: With a large number of people staying home and with an added focus on washing hands through the day, several apartments in the city have reported an 8 to 10% jump in water consumption over the past week when Bengaluru remained under lockdown.

According to Beautiful Bengaluru , a citizen intervention movement, each individual wastes around a litre of water while washing hands (for a 20-second period) as the tap is not closed. This wastage happens 10 times a day for each resident, said members of the group.

“Water requirement for cooking and drinking has gone up. Consumption is also more because everyone is now very careful about washing hands several times a day. One should ensure the tap is turned off while soaping hands and reuse RO waste water for other purposes such as watering plant and mopping the floor,” said Odette Katrak, co-founder of Beautiful Bengaluru.

“Overall, water consumption has gone up. A lot more people are staying home right now as a majority of residents are working professionals. The amount of water used for cooking at home and washing hands has also gone up,” said Vishnu Gattupalli , Secretary of Bangalore Apartments Federation’s Whitefield cluster.

The BWSSB is now diverting water away from industries, commercial establishments and towards residential consumers. “We have decided to stop water supply to industries and commercial establishments during the lockdown. They account for 7-8% of the total water supply. We have been instead diverting 100 MLD water to residential areas over the past week,” said Tushar Girinath, managing director of BWSSB.

“Not only has there been increase in consumption, usage patterns have also changed with people staying indoors now. Larger apartments with more than 50 units have seen an 8 to 10% increase in consumption, while smaller apartments’ consumption has gone up by 10% and above,” said Mirza Anwar, BWSSB assistant executive engineer for Mahadevapura zone.

Some report dip in consumption

A few apartments have, however, said their water usage has gone down ever since the lockdown was imposed in the city.

“While we used to get 19 to 20 tankers of water every day, this number is now down to 13 or 14 tankers a day — the main reason being that in all our households, the househelps are on leave. They consume a lot of water while washing dishes or mopping the floor. Now that we are doing the work ourselves, people are becoming more conscious about water usage,” said a member of the management committee of Sobha Hillview apartment in Uttarahalli .

Other two revenue heads — motor vehicle tax and stamps and registration duty — have also missed the target by Rs 628 crore and Rs 450 crore, respectively. Registration of vehicles and properties is normally expected to peak in March, but the activities nosedived this year due to the lockdown, said official sources.The only silver lining is revenue collection by the excise department, which has exceeded the target by Rs 450 crore. The department has collected Rs 21,400 crore through liquor sales as against the target of Rs 20,950 crore.The biggest setback has come from commercial tax revenue collection, which includes GST, sales tax on motor fuels and professional tax. The target was fixed at Rs 76,046 crore in the budget for 2019-20. However, the collection stands at Rs 72,138 crore as on March 31.Officials in the commercial tax department said the shortfall is mainly because of the economic slowdown and the Centre’s failure to pay GST compensation to the tune of Rs 4,500 crore. However, sources said the worst is yet to come. Revenue collections are expected to dip further as the impact of Covid-19 will be felt more in the coming months because of the 21-day lockdown.“As commercial activities came to a grinding halt in March, the revenue figures in April are obviously expected be much below the monthly target,” said BT Manohar, member of consultative committee on GST, Government of Karnataka.On an average, the monthly collection of commercial taxes stands at Rs 4,500 crore. It includes sales tax of Rs 1,200 crore from the sale of petrol and diesel. This is expected to come down by Rs 1,500 crore.“Fuel consumption has taken a major hit although petrol pumps are not closed. We can only hope the virus spread is curbed and the lockdown is not extended beyond April 15,” said KM Basave Gowda , president of Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Dealers Another reason why GST collection would be low in the next three months, say experts, is Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement extending the last date for filing of GST returns to June 30. “Most traders would like to avail the benefit of the moratorium on filing GST returns and would defer tax payment. Because of this, there will be a sharp dip in collection,” said S Prakash, former president of Karnataka State GST Practitioners Association.Could have collected Rs 1k cr moreWe could have collected Rs 1,000 crore more without the lockdown.

The complaint has been lodged by Rohit Binkar, Om Yadav, Lalita Yadav, Mangala Shahu, Rajesh Shahu and others. “NMC staffers are spraying normal water instead of disinfectant in our area. The people residing in our society have seen NMC staffers filling water from borewell situated in the city and spraying it. Critical situation about Covid-19 is prevailing in the country. Therefore, stringent action should be taken against them,” they said.

On Monday, Yadav was spraying disinfectant in Kasturba Nagar. He claimed NMC staffers spraying normal water. In a video clip that went viral on social media, he showed a milky white compound spraying from his machine while normal water in the machine of NMC staffer. He also emptied entire tank one of NMC staffer to show it.

This comes in the wake of an advisory from the Union Ayush ministry, suggestions from siddha doctors through media as well as anonymous WhatsApp forwards prescribing it as a shield to boost one’s immunity level.The government siddha hospital has been functioning on the campus of Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH). “Nearly 800 people collected the mixture of Kabasura Kudineer Chooranam and Nilavembu Chooranam from us in a single day today,” district siddha medical officer (DSMO) Dr S Kamaraj told TOI. Since the supply of Kabasura Kudineer from Tamil Nadu Medicinal Plant Farms and Herbal Medicine Corporation Limited (Tampcol) is limited, government siddha doctors have prescribed the combination of 25 grams of Kabasura powder and Nilavembu powder.DSMO Kamaraj said the quantity will be enough for five days of medication to a person. “The concept of siddha medication is mixture of herbals. So, we mix Nilavembu with Kabasura chooranam and prescribe it,” he said. While Nilavembu Kudineer is an anti-viral available every day at the government health centres to tackle dengue, Kabasura Kudineer Chooram is an anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory prescribed regularly for treatment of fever, cold, cough, sneezing and sore throat — symptoms of Covid-19 also. Another siddha medicine, Aadathodai Manapagu for 10 ml, along with Kabasura Kudineer and Nilavembu mixture has also been suggested by the Ayush ministry.“Kabasura Kudineer Chooram acts as an immunomodulator because of the ingredients in the medicine. It will boost the immunity level of those taking the extract as a prophylactic measure as advised by the physician,” said government assistant siddha medical officer Dr M Vathsala. “Not everyone is required to take Kabasura Kudineer. Those with the exposure to the disease can take as a preventive measure. People are under the wrong impression that taking medicine and roaming around the town will keep them immunized against the virus. Stay at home is the medicine they should follow mandatorily,” said Dr Vathsala.

Residents of three villages-Valagiri, Valangulam and Moolaiyaru-have been reeling under shortage of essential commodities since the national lockdown was announced. Ever since the lockdown came into effect, the villagers have been out of work and with their access to the outside world has been cut off.

Around 120 families living in these villages have been suffering from food shortage and their children plagued by malnutrition. When these issues came to light on Monday, social workers and organisations like Childline stepped in to pool in relief materials. The collected relief materials including rice, pulses, milk powder, health mix and biscuits were distributed to the villages by a team led by Kodaikanal revenue divisional officer, Sivakumar on Tuesday. There are more than 60 tribal villages in the hilly terrains of Kodaikanal and activists say the living conditions in these villages are abysmal. They have urged officials to make sure that people residing in these villages have access to food and drinking water. The movement of elephants has cut off their access to forest areas as well, from where they could have gathered some food.

S Thanaraj, a tribal activist, said that the lockdown has disrupted the normal life of many villagers while a few of them have ventured into interior forests for their livelihood. Revenue officials said that all efforts are underway to provide medical access to the villagers. The tribal population will be the first batch of people in Kodaikanal revenue division to get Rs 1000 dole announced by the state government, they said.

AHMEDABAD: In a measure of relief for electricity consumers in the state, Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission ( GERC ) has kept power tariffs unchanged for the 2020-21 fiscal. The commission has also given relief to Below Poverty Line (BPL) customers and agricultural consumers using power for lift irrigation.

“There will be no increase in power tariffs for consumers of state-owned discoms and Torrent Power Ltd,” the state power regulator said on Tuesday.The private sector Torrent Power had sought a 21 paise per unit increase in tariffs for 2020-21 to make up for its earlier dues. TPL supplies electricity to Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Surat.

On the other hand, state-owned power distribution companies (discoms) did not demand an increase in tariffs in their petitions filed with GERC in December 2019. These four discoms are Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (UGVCL), Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL), Dakshin Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (DGVCL) and Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (MGVCL).

In what could reduce monthly electricity bills of Below Poverty Line (BPL) consumers by more than 30%, GERC raised the applicability of Rs 1.50 per unit concessional tariff to 50 units per month from 30 units.

Energy charges for agriculture consumers using electricity for lift irrigation has been reduced from Rs 1.50 per unit to Rs 0.80 per unit.

“With this modification, electricity bills of this category of consumers will reduce by more than 43%,” GERC added.

Night time consumption concession for HT consumers of state-owned discoms has also been increased from 40 paise per unit to 43 paise per unit.

The commission also noted that all distribution companies achieved noticeable reduction in power distribution losses. “During FY 2018-19, all distribution companies except PGVCL and UGVCL in the state exceeded the target of distribution losses reduction set by the commission,” GERC said.

HYDERABAD: In spite of the city being locked down, families across the city have not faced a dearth of potable water, thanks to the over 3,000 water and sewer linemen who are working on a war-footing to keep the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad afloat.

“We use ‘key rods’ to open the valve of the water supply source to release potable water,” Mohammed Sharfuddin, a senior lineman working in Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) told TOI.

Sharfuddin, who joined HMWS&SB as a daily wager in the Water Board under ‘nominal muster roll’ (NMR) category for a salary of Rs 350 per month, has been working with the Erragadda section for the past 35 years as a lineman. “I deal with 20,000 consumers in my jurisdiction. Complaints such as low pressure and shortage or delayed water supply are common. I’ve never been angry or upset over a complaint. It’s my job to sort such issues out. Like they say, work is worship,” he said with a smile.

Sewer linemen make sure that our roads are not inundated with sewer water. Despite police implementing the lockdown strictly, G Laxmaiah, senior sewer linemen working at SR Nagar operation and maintenance (O&M) Division, rushed to Hajimasthan Lane in Borabanda along with other six sewer workers and unclogged a clogged manhole within half an hour of receiving the complaint.

“For me, all days are working days,” Laxmaiah, who is an illiterate, said.

MADURAI: An octogenarian couple in Madurai turned saviour for nearly 800 families in their village in Sivaganga when they came forward to distribute free rice to the families of mostly daily wagers so that they did not go without food during the lockdown period. R Sekkappan, a businessman of Anna Nagar , and his wife S Nagammai , both 80, told TOI that they were disturbed when the lockdown happened and wanted to do something for the families in their native Okkur village. “We know that many families in our village are daily wagers who buy their day’s rice after they get their wages. The sudden lockdown would mean they would go hungry without jobs,’’ said Sekkappan. Relatives in his village told him that the free rice and groceries for ration card holders were to be distributed only on April 2.

The staple for all these families was rice and so the couple decided to provide it to them and help tide over the next 20 days. He made a few phone calls to Okkur panchayat president Raja, village committee member Andiappan and a group of volunteers to find out how many were in dire need of rice. They identified 800 families for him. With his own funds, he purchased 8 tonnes of rice so that each family could get 10 kilograms. “Then someone told us that there were another 40 families that did not have family ration cards but were elders without support. So we purchased another 400 kg of rice,” he said. They purchased ponni delux rice from a mill in Madurai at Rs 45 a kilogram. However, they needed permission for inter-district transport of the large quantity of rice to Sivaganga district . This was obtained as it was an essential commodity. A family friend came forward to provide three vans for transport. The rice was transported from Sunday and distributed to all 840 families by Tuesday.

The civic body has reportedly started to get information from private medical services.

NMC additional medical officer (health) Dr Praveen Gantawar told TOI, “The directives were necessary to control Covid-19. Two patients were tested at two centres and one of them was admitted at Janata Hospital. Later, these patients tested positive. We had to seal Janata Hospital, Dhande’s Panorama MRI Centre and Rainbow Medinova Diagnostic Centre.”

Gantawar added, “We also had to quarantine large number of doctors and related staff. Such instances and spreading of Covid-19 can be avoided if we get information in advance. We will send our team of doctors and get such patients tested in earlier stages.”

Private hospitals and centres had started to give the information, he added.

A North Nagpur doctor informed NMC that a group of eight persons from Minimata Nagar slum had returned from Lucknow the previous day and one of them contacted him, complaining of dry cough.

“Despite sealing of borders, the group managed to enter the city, misusing a vegetable-laden truck. One of them visited my clinic complaining of cough on Tuesday. I alerted the NMC to check him,” the doctor said.

The NMC team immediately attended to the person and directed all eight persons to observe home quarantine. The NMC is yet to decide on giving approval for restarting Janata Hospital and the two diagnostic centres.

Gantawar said, “30 staffers of Janata Hospital — doctors, nurses, pathologist etc — are shifted to MLA Hostel for quarantine. Around seven staffers of the two diagnostic centres were also sent to MLA Hostel. One of the two patients was also admitted in GMCH after Janata Hospital.”

“Therefore, GMCH has started quarantining its doctors who examined and treated him. GMCH sent nurses and ward boys for quarantine at MLA Hostel. All are doing well and have no symptoms,” he said.

Mayo Hospital and GMCH informed that all patients, excluding two from Buldana were negative.

The NMC continued its door-to-door containment drive across the city. The drive is also being carried out in the housing society situated in front of Gandhisagar in Central Nagpur, from where one of the flat owners tested positive a day ago.

With several bridges having been brought under police control and only essential movement allowed through select bridges between north and south Madurai, two-wheelers were seen buzzing past across the dry river at will and at a few other places.

Out of the nine bridges in the city, essentials were allowed through only four. An alternative road connecting the south and north banks of Vaigai river next to the Kuruvikkaran bridge was closed. But, bikers were found crossing the dry river at Thathaneri and Iravathanallur with help from locals, who pushed the vehicles.

The city police have been registering cases against shop owners for opening in violation of the curfew restrictions. Cases were also registered against those loitering on streets without any need. However, life in interior areas is normal for residents and shops opened as usual and people roam around like any normal day. “All the shops are open in the interior areas of Yagappa Nagar and there is no restriction in people’s movement. Only shops at Yaanakuzhai have been closed,” said Syed Ahamed Basha , a resident.

For the second day, a large number of people thronged the market at Yaanaikkal Puthupalam. The fear of vegetables getting sold off made the public forget the social distancing norms. A health official from the corporation said, “We have been making frequent rounds and asking people to follow a minimum one metre distance, but they observe only till the time we are there.”

City police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham said that stringent action is being taken against the violators. So far, more than 1,000 vehicles have been seized and more than 500 cases have been registered against violators of curfew restrictions. Crowds can be better managed once the proposed 100 markets at 100 places begin fucntioning, he said.

The 76-year-old person (P6) from Kalaburagi died on March 11. A day later, tests showed he had died of Covid-19, forcing the district administration to take stringent measures like isolation of primary and secondary contacts. He was the first fatality in India.

On Tuesday, a fresh case was reported — the 60-year-old wife of a doctor who treated P6 was confirmed positive, taking the tally in the district to 4. So far, there’s been no community outbreak.

Four of P6’s family members were quarantined in the hospital after they developed symptoms and kept at ESI Hospital. On March 15, the 45-year-old daughter of the deceased, identified as P6, tested positive pushing the administration to lock down the district. On March 17, the 63-year-old doctor who treated P6 on March 6 in the patient’s house too tested postive.

Now, the daughter has recovered fully. The test conducted after the 14-day in hospital isolation came back negative. For confirmation immediately after 24 hours, her samples were tested again and that was negative too. Health officials declared her safe.

Along with the 45-year-old woman, three more were isolate and all three tested negative during the first test. Deputy commissioner Sharath B said: “The woman is safe to return home and she has overcame theCovid infection.”

The 63-year-old doctor who is in hospital quarantine has almost recovered. The DC said he has been recovering fast and is in good health. The swab and blood samples were sent for testing and once the results arrive, a decision about discharging him will be taken, he said.

Another worry is that his wife tested positive. According to the health bulletin, she has been isolated in the hospital and is under treatment.

The south zone and the west zone of the city consist of 26% and 25% slum populations respectively, while in the rest of the zones — north, central, and new west — the slum population is between 10% to 14%, according to the AMC’s own 2014 slum atlas. A senior AMC official says, “The overcrowding of slums makes it difficult to follow recommended measures such as social distancing and self-isolation.”The disinfection drive will cover slum areas like Abhuji ka Chapra, 13 slum clusters of Gomtipur, and other slum clusters like Bhudarpura ka Chapra, Dhor Vada, Jiva Dosa na Chapra, Marwadi n Chali, Govindbhai ni Chali, Ramapir no Tekro, Chandrabhaga, and Gopal Nagar. “We are talking about a concentrated 1.86 lakh households which need to be monitored.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74922660,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-276166,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/disinfection-drive-begins-across-slums/articleshow/74921371.cms

MADURAI: The district administrations of Tirunelveli and Kanyakumari have isolated areas from where fresh Covid-19 positive cases were reported en masse on Tuesday. As many as 30 new people tested positive from the southern districts on Tuesday, taking the total number to 36 from the 10 districts. The fresh cases included 22 from Tirunelveli, five from Kanyakumari, two from Madurai and one from Tuticorin.

In fact, 29 of the 30 had attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi while more people from the region who attended the conference have been isolated in the respective districts and samples sent for testing. “All 22 patients admitted to Tirunelveli medical college hospital are stable. All of their family members are kept under home quarantine. We are working to identify all their primary and secondary contacts and keep them under quarantine,” Tirunelveli district collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish told TOI.

She added that they will come up with a containment plan for each area. She also wrote to the city police commissioner seeking police support to isolate Melapalayam area from where most of these people hailed. She said many from the locality who had travelled abroad have returned and there was a chance of the virus spreading. “All roads leading to Melapalayam should be disconnected for traffic,” she said. The police were requested to ensure that people of the locality stay indoors.

Kanyakumari collector Prashant M Wadnere said four of the infected had attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi and returned on March 23. “The other person works in the Chennai airport,” he said. He announced Dennison Street and Velladichivilai in Nagercoil and Manikattipottal and Thengapattanam Thoppu in rural Kanyakumari district – where the five positive cases hail from – as containment zones. The collector said that disinfection has been carried out at the above areas which have been isolated. “We have deployed 270 field workers under 40 supervisory officials and five doctors for door-to-door verification to check if the people are showing influenza symptoms,” he added.

In Madurai city, a 40-year-old man from Narimedu and a 45-year-old man from Thabaal Thanthi Nagar who attended the Delhi conference tested positive. They are currently undergoing treatment at the isolation ward in GRH and are stable. A total of 42 Tablighi members, including eight Thai nationals in Madurai, had attended the conference. “Currently, 12 Tablighi members are under observation in the isolation ward at GRH. Nine persons have meanwhile been isolated at a local quarantine facility, all of whom have tested negative for Covid-19,” said district collector T G Vinay.

Tension prevailed near a lodge at Melagaram on the Tenkasi - Courtallam Road in Tenkasi district as six people from there who attended the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi had returned and were kept under isolation. Following protests from the local villagers, they were about to be shifted to Courtallam amidst police protection in the presence of health officials.

However, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the government has never demanded that doctors should prescribe alcohol. “We are not going to run behind doctors urging them to prescribe. We will not take any action against doctors who are not willing to prescribe,” he said. The order issued in this regard says that doctors need to confirm that a person is showing alcohol withdrawal symptom. The diagnosis will help him seek speial allotment of liquor from excise department.

Kerala Government Medical Officers Association (KGMOA) has urged all the doctors to wear black badges while on duty on Wednesday.

The state chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also urged its doctors not to prescribe alcohol since it is against medical ethics.

The state branch of Indian Psychiatric Society, Kerala Government Specialist Doctors Association, KCBC and other associations working in the healthcare sector have come out against the government order.

Meanwhile, health minister K K Shailaja said that the government has not insisted doctors to prescribe alcohol. Since suicides are increasing in the state due to the lockdown and non-availability of alcohol, the government explored a possibility on how to solve this issue.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala who came down heavily on the government order said such a decision would have severe consequences. Hence the government should immediately withdraw this controversial order, he said.

Former KPCC president V M Sudheeran also came out against the government decision. He said the government was compelling doctors into unethical practices which should not be encouraged. He urged the government to immediately withdraw the order and alleged that the government is again showing the world that they are with the liquor mafia. tnn

The state and civic authorities had earlier claimed a 5km radius would be cordoned off, to thwart the spread of the infection, but in reality anyone can easily access the house of the deceased, which the authorities claimed was sanitized after the 47-year-old man’s death.Jayanti Vaghela, a daily wage labourer and resident of Gajanandnagar chawl, said that civic body personnel had disinfected the deceased’s house and 15 other houses in the same row.“They (civic workers) come regularly and spray some powder around his house to disinfect the area,” said Vaghela showing patches of gammaxene powder on the ground near the house.On whether anyone else in the neighbourhood had been checked by the health department personnel, Vaghela replied, “No.”Another resident of the chawl, Dinesh Parmar, stated that they were not examined by health department personnel. “Some members of the deceased’s family and his immediate neighbours may have been examined.

GANDHINAGAR: With over 19,000 persons in home quarantine and many more suffering from anxiety because of the lockdown , the psychological counselling helpline of the government drew 250 callers within 15 hours of becoming operational.

Among the common problems the callers have been reporting on the helpline are the urge to go out of the house or quarantine facility, feeling of loneliness, gynaecological problems, lack of sleep, feeling uneasy and even the feeling of fear.

The CM has announced the launch of the ‘1100 psychological counselling helpline’ after receiving feedback that citizens have been experiencing trauma because of the lockdown or quarantine.

State health commissioner Jayprakash Shivhare said the helpline provides 24X7 counselling to callers. “Considering the rush of callers, we are expecting more calls in the coming days,” Shivhare said. To begin with, the state government has made arrangements to handle about 1,000 calls a day, but this capacity will have to be increased, said Shivhare. The helpline first takes primary details of the caller such as gender, age, factors that are causing the person stress or trauma. On the basis of these inputs, the caller is then connected to an expert.

“Unlike the 104 helpline, which guides people on COVI-19 symptoms and thus calls are short, in case of the 1100 helpline, the calls last much longer and workflow has been designed accordingly,” Shivhare said.

One of the 1100 helpline workers, Surendra, said that people call in to report that they are feeling lonely and want to go out of the quarantine. “In such cases, we divert the calls to psychologists who counsel them.” He added that calls related to physical health are diverted to the 104 helpline.

COIMBATORE: A DMK functionary was arrested on charges of spreading misinformation about Covid-19 in the city on Monday night.

The functionary, N J Murugesan, a ward secretary of DMK was produced before a judicial magistrate and remanded to Coimbatore central prison . The DMK cried hoarse alleging that Murugesan was booked because he pulled up corporation authorities for not spraying disinfectants properly. It was to cover up the shortcomings on the part of the administration that the authorities filed a false complaint and got him arrested, DMK MLA N Karthik said.

Murugesan was booked four counts of the IPC under section 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by civil servant), section 353 (assault of criminal force to deter civil servant from discharging duty), section 270 (doing an act likely to spread an infection dangerous to life) and 506 (1) (criminal intimidation) based on a complaint from a corporation official.

Police said Murugesan told vegetable sellers there was no need to maintain social distancing. He also picked up an argument with the corporation authorities who were involved in anti–Covid activities in the city and threatened them, police said.

However, Karthik refuted the allegations and said that Murugesan was questioning the officials for not carrying out the works properly. “Public in his locality had complained about disinfectants not sprayed properly. He raised the issue with the officials and demanded better prevention measures in their locality,’’ Karthik said.

He said they would face the issue legally in the court.

MADURAI: People with disabilities in Madurai has called for better financial assistance from the state government and slammed the Centre’s announcement of issuing mere Rs 1,000 as additional allowance during the lockdown.

“It is inhuman to announce such a meagre amount as additional allowance. The government says that it will be split for three months, which would make it around Rs 300 a month. This is extremely depressing,” said S Raja, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Crawling Differently Abled Persons Federation . He further pointed out that most people in the community don’t even have jobs and depend on the special monthly allowance of Rs 1,500.

An official at the District Differently Abled Welfare Office, Madurai, said that there is a plan to provide a special allowance of Rs 1,500 for the months of April and May in advance. “This would be helpful for the community. However, so far the state government is yet to announce any additional allowance,” he said.

Raja alleged that there were always delays in providing special allowance every month and that all the members from the community are not able to avail it. “We are also eligible for the extra allowance such as the daily wage workers or migrant workers. Only around 6,000 out of the more than 50,000 people with disabilities in Madurai have all necessary documents and can avail the special allowance. The government must bring in some measure to ensure that help is provided to all members of the community,” he added.

293,['1/04/2020'],"NREGS wages go up, thanks to inflation","Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: Thanks to inflation, the Centre has managed to stub the controversy of zero increase in employment wages under the flagship rural job guarantee programme, a source of raging row for last few years.

As new rates come into force from Wednesday, the national average wage stands at Rs 202 per day, which is Rs 20 higher than 2019-20. None of the states has registered zero increase while the lowest hike is Rs 13 and the highest Rs 34.

The welcome change from past years, ironically, has been possible because of a spike in retail inflation for agriculture labourers -- Consumer Price Index ( Agriculture Labour ) —on which MGNREGA wages are indexed for annual revision.

As inflation remained low in past years, the wage revision resulted in negligible hikes, with certain states even clocking zero. In 2019-20, Karnataka , Goa, Kerala , Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar Islands and West Bengal saw no rise in wages. This has been touching off intense criticism from experts and social activists alike for last few years.

Given the anomalous situation, the rural development ministry in 2018 urged the finance ministry to shift the index of wage revision from CPI (AL) to CPI (Rural). An internal committee of the RD ministry had recommended the course, arguing that CPI (AL) was an old basket while CPI (R) better reflected the consumption pattern. Crucially, food items account for considerable weightage under CPI (AL) and their prices have registered a sharp decline in recent times, especially because of the Food Security Act. This has kept wage revision under a check.

However, the finance ministry has been averse to heed the request of the RD ministry, possibly concerned about the burden on exchequer it will entail.

“As the formula for wage revision remained the same, not much was expected in 2020-21 in terms of shift from past years of minuscule or zero hikes. But then rise in inflation came into play,” a top official explained to TOI.

As economic activity has ground to a halt owing to coronavirus crisis, the MGNREGA too remains shut for work. However, there may be a spurt in demand once the lockdown lifts and the desperate poor run to seek employment.

This week, the RD ministry released Rs 4431 crore to states as part of wage and material arrears for this financial year.

The low or zero hikes have been a problem since 2015. In 2018-19, Uttarakhand, Arunachal, Jharkhand and Bihar registered no increase while MP, Gujarat and Maharashtra got a wage hike of Rs 2. In 2017-18, Bihar, Jharkhand, Assam , UP and Uttarakhand got a hike of Rs 01.

This year, Dadra and Nagar Haveli has notched the highest increase of Rs 34, followed by Maharashtra (Rs 32), UP, Uttarakhand, Manipur and Odisha (Rs 19), Kerala and Assam (Rs 20), Rajasthan (Rs 21) and Punjab (Rs 22). Bihar and Jharkhand have an increase of Rs 23.

294,['1/04/2020'],Madurai: Lockdown a double challenge for disabled,"Representative image

MADURAI: Many among those with disabilities in Madurai , especially from the financial backgrounds, have been struggling for survival since the beginning of the lockdown . Despite being a vulnerable group, the community has little help from the government during the difficult times, said people with disabilities in the city.

“It is very difficult for us. Both my husband and I are disabled and we have a school-going daughter. My aged mother who stays with us is only getting us groceries. Financially, we don’t know how long we can continue and manage our food,” said Mangayarthilagam M, who resides with her family at Kamarajarpuram. Her husband Muthukumar does repair work for electronic gadgets and earns a salary of Rs 6,000 a month. But, now there is no other means for them to eke out a living.

For Jeyaraman M from Nagamalai-Pudukottai area, his physical disability is hurting him and his family far more than ever during the lockdown period. Unable to procure essentials, he is forced to seek the mercy of others to help him and his wife, who is also a disabled person. “We have to beg to our neighbours for getting groceries and are unable to go to the town. I eke out a living by writing petitions for Rs 10-20 in front of the district collectorate. Now, even that is not possible. How can I support my wife and two children?” asked Jeyaraman.

For female with disabilities, it is doubly difficult to stay safe during lockdown, said Mariammal R, a disabled woman who is part of a welfare association. “Many of the disabled people, especially women, are staying in rented houses. They are unable to pay rent. They are unable to even get loans and cannot afford to pay them later too with interest. Their future has become uncertain as most of them don’t have regular income and survive on government allowances or pensions,” she said. Though the most recommended preventive measure for Covid-19 is washing hands, people with disabilities ask how they can protect themselves when they use their hands to move around on roads.

Meanwhile, an official at the District Differently Abled Welfare Office, Madurai said that a state-wide toll free helpline for people with disabilities (18004250111) is currently functional. “We have two teams of volunteers working with our office. We follow up on the calls we get and provide assistance. As of now, people with disabilities are mainly requesting help for buying essentials,” he added.

295,['1/04/2020'],Uttarakhand allows farmers to work on fields,"NAINITAL: Days after TOI reported the crisis faced by farmers across the state due to the country-wide lockdown, the state government has issued a series of guidelines allowing farmers and farm labourers to work on their fields.

The guidelines issued by agricultural secretary R Meenakshi Sundaram state, ""For agricultural purposes, both farmers and farm labourers will be allowed to go to the fields. However, they will ensure that all precautions are taken to stop the spread of the virus."" The month of April is the peak harvesting season for Rabi crops such as wheat in plains while in hills, this marks the beginning of the sowing season. Therefore, several farmers were worried about the availability of farm labourers, machines and the breakdown of supply chain for both fertilizers and seeds.

Sundaram added that the farm machinery as well as seeds, fertilisers and pesticides will be made available across all the district. ""The shops selling seeds, fertilisers, pesticides will remain open as per the timings decided by the government. Social distancing, however, will be maintained at all these shops and sanitisers will also be kept there,"" Sundaram said in the letter which has been marked to all the district magistrates as well as SSPs.Meanwhile, speaking to TOI, farmers, who are already facing losses due to untimely rains and hailstorms in February and March, said that they are relieved that the government has allowed the movement of machinery and even opened shops where they can buy seeds.

“We don't know how long the lockdown will continue. Therefore, it was necessary that crops like wheat are harvested before they start to fall in fields. Once the harvesting is done, the sowing season will start and we are thinking of buying seeds as soon as possible because there is grave uncertainty over their availability as well,” said Ramzani, a farmer from Kichha.

BIJNOR: Eight Indonesian nationals who attended an event organised by Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi’s Nizamuddin between March 13 and 15 were found staying at a mosque in UP’s Bijnor on Monday. They were quarantined at a government hospital after medical examination, officials said.

Later, police booked two clerics of the mosque and three others for not keeping the local authorities in the loop over the foreign nationals’ stay, who had come on tourist visa but were involved in religious activities.

According to police, the foreigners were staying at Nagina town’s Jamunwali mosque. They came to India on a 6-month tourist visa and visited Odisha and Delhi, where they participated in the religious event. They came to Bijnor on March 21 and had plans to leave for Delhi on March 25, before the lockdown was imposed.

Superintendent of police (rural) Sanjay Kumar said, “The foreigners were taken to district hospital for medical check-up. They all are in isolation ward of the hospital for 14 days.

“The Indonesians have admitted that they had taken part in Delhi’s religious event. Police have asked all the people coming in their contact to quarantine themselves.”

The SP added, “We have registered a case against five persons, including two clerics and three members of the mosque.”

BENGALURU: With no income over the last fortnight, migrant workers are stuck between a rock and a hard place — they neither have shelter nor can they return to their homes in the wake of the nationwide lockdown .

On Tuesday, the government identified 65 locations across 30 districts in the state where such workers are stuck. More than a 100 camps have been set up at these locations to accommodate more than 25,000 workers (see graphic), but the exercise of identifying more such workers is a work in progress. Officials in the know said the number could even cross one lakh.

N Manjunath Prasad , principal secretary (revenue) and the nodal officer for migrants, has instructed all DCs to “register each migrant who requires board and lodging and also collect data on number of family members, name and destination where they intend to go”. This data was used to group them in the same location. All camps have been provided with medical assistance.

So far, 25,433 migrants have been identified. Of these, more than 14,000 are in Bengaluru’s Mahadevapura zone. BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said there could be more than 60,000 migrant workers in BBMP limits and Bengaluru rural. “...According to the labour department, there are at least 67,000 in BBMP and rural limits. But we are trying to do an on-ground assessment and we should have the accurate number soon. We’ve already identified 200 choultries for this,” he said.

BBMP special commissioner D Randeep said five community halls in Mahadevapura have been requested, but so far no worker has been placed there. “As of today, we have identified people and are supplying food packets to them. So far there appears to be no problem with shelter for them as they are living in their respective labour quarters or makeshift places they already use,” he said.

22L construction workers

Although the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has said all migrant workers must remain in their present locations and the state government must provide food and shelter, there could be lakhs of people who are outside the ambit. While there is no requirement for states to register inter-state migrant workers, identification of such people during a crisis is a difficult task.

Labour secretary P Manivannan told TOI: “There are about 22 lakh construction workers registered with us (across Karnataka), most of who are migrants. About five lakh of them have provided details of their work so as to avail benefits from us.”

While construction workers register with the government, most other migrants — such as those employed in the hospitality sector or working as security guards, do not register with the government.

One estimate suggests Bengaluru alone has nearly 80,000 security guards from other states, while 40% of the 1.4 lakh people working in the 7,000-odd licenced hotels and restaurants are also from other states.

Census data suggests at least four out of 10 people in Bengaluru have registered their mother tongues as other than Kannada. It’s about 18% across Karnataka. However, a majority of non-Kannada speakers are those who’ve settled here many years ago, which makes it difficult to ascertain if they are migrants or settlers.

The incident took place after an Accredited Social Health Activist ( ASHA ) worker of the two-member team - who also belongs to the same village - inquired about two members of a family who had returned from Noida and Ghaziabad a few days ago.

Protesting why they should reveal the whereabouts of the two, the family allegedly slapped the ASHA worker. They also allegedly attacked her husband and brother-in-law when they intervened.

Four people have been booked and sent to jail.

Anita Verma, the ASHA worker, claimed, “I had gone for coronavirus survey at the home of one Daata Ram. According to norms, we were asked to note down names and phone numbers of those who had returned from any other district to Meerut in the past few days and get them to undergo a routine check-up from a doctor.

The machines are given by Yenepoya Medical College and it would be installed in Kasaragod till the Covid-19 fear is over, said the MLA, who received the machines in Thalapady on the border on Tuesday.

“I intervened because the travails and wailings of those who are undergoing dialysis are beyond anybody’s imagination, but the apathy on the part of Karnataka government has affected their medical thus putting their lives at stake,” he said.

Since the treatment of Covid-19 patients and those under surveillance has taken the centre stage, the regular treatment of other patients, including those in critical condition, has been affected, he said.

Though the dialysis patients require continuous treatment, and many from Kasaragod depend on the hospitals in Mangaluru for that, the Karnataka government has refused them permission to cross the borders, said the MLA.

Though the hospitals in Mangaluru are willing to admit such patients, they are helpless and hence this hospital offered five machines, he said.

Though he had contacted the officials here to get the facility arranged in some government hospital, he hasn’t got any response so far, and he decided to install it in a private hospital. Only those who undergo regular treatment in Mangaluru hospitals would be provided the service, which would be free, he added.

This is when district collector K Rajamani has asked them to start admitting Covid-19 patients Some hospitals said sourcing of PPE kits has been becoming difficult and more expensive, with distributors charging massive premiums as demand has overshot supply. Many doctors, who have been consulting fever patients in private hospitals, said they were provided with just three-ply masks, and some plastic aprons and gloves.The picture isn’t much different in some government hospitals, which are also facing shortage of PPE kits. However, ESI Hospital and Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital said they were not facing any shortage.A young general medicine doctor, who works with a private hospital in Gandhipuram, said she hadn’t told her family that she was asked to handle the fever ward once every four days for a period of eight hours. “This is because they will become paranoid. They know that my hospital has given us no personal protective equipment, except a plastic apron, a three-ply mask that ensures no protection from infectious droplets and gloves. Our hands from wrists to elbows are exposed, so are parts of our face, eyes and neck. A proper PPE kit is a hazmat suite that covers us from foot to hair, including shoes and socks.”Another private hospital near Neelambur that has created an isolation ward to handle Covid-19 patients said they were facing an 80% shortage of PPE kits. The hospital administrator said, “Including the supplies that we expect in the near future, we have very few PPE kits. So, we have allocated hardly 25 to 30 staff, including doctors, nurses and other paramedical staff, to handle fever patients and Covid-19 patients that too in three shifts. We have requested them to use the PPE kits sparingly.”He said their suppliers were overcharging them owing to the high demand for kits. “Due to lockdown, we are also facing difficulties in getting supplies from vendors in other parts of the country.”Another hospital on Avinashi Road has, meanwhile, turned down the request to provide PPE kits to some health workers, citing shortage. It has, however, offered to connect them to its distributor.The government hospital in Mettupalayam is also facing shortage of PPE kits. The hospital that houses nearly 21 patients whose Covid-19 tests were inconclusive has only 15 PPE kits. They have a doctor and four nurses handling the ward. Hospital dean Dr Seralathan said, “The government has placed an order for more kits. Anyway, the patients will either be shifted to ESI Hospital or discharged once their results come. So, we are not panicked.”Meanwhile, a group of youngsters in Chennai are raising funds to procure N95 masks and coverall protective suits for doctors and nurses.

Despite repeated requests and showing their permits, the cops took them to police station where they allegedly thrashed them. They were stripped and put in the lock-up. A case was lodged against them under Section 151 of CrPC, the men told media.

Vikas had requested SHO Subash Parmar to speak to the SDM to verify their permit but he paid no heed.

“One of the three men called me over phone past midnight and said that the police was thrashing them. However, the SHO didn’t speak to me. I could hear the police hurling abuses and hitting the men. Police shouldn’t misbehave with people who have valid pass,” SDM Anil Kumar said.

Meanwhile, ASP Attur Rehman said that the three men had fled the check-post at Rishabdeo. Hence, the police caught them at Parsad. They misbehaved with the cops and tried to make calls despite warnings. So, a case was lodged against them.

MUMBAI: Treatment for Covid-19 will be free in the state from Wednesday under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY). The state will bear the cost of treatment of even those who don’t have the MJPJAY card or fall under the BPL category, TOI has learnt. Additionally, the state has extended the insurance cover of Rs 1.5 lakh per family to each member of the household.

“As long as a coronavirus patient is admitted to one of the empanelled hospitals, his/her treatment cost will be fully covered by the state. Essentially, we have insured all 12 crore citizens of the state,” said health minister Rajesh Tope.

Under the scheme, the state has doubled the number of empanelled hospitals—to 1,000 hospitals up from 492. “We now have over one lakh beds and about 4,000 ventilators,” Tope added.

There are around 60 hospitals from Mumbai, though the big trust-run hospitals continue to avoid the scheme. “If people get themselves admitted to Mumbai’s five-star hospitals, we may not be able to support as those hospitals have not joined us. But in empanelled hospitals, we will cover everyone. Even people who don’t have relevant documents or ID proof will be covered,” said Sudhakar Shinde, CEO of MJPJAY. “By Covid patients, we don’t mean those who have tested positive, but the scheme will broadly cover everyone who land in acute respiratory distress syndrome and those who need a ventilator,” he added. Explaining the increased cover for families, Shinde said Covid is extremely contagious that has affected more than one member in many families.

In a first, the scheme has also empanelled hospitals outside the state that cater to people in bordering districts such as Sindhudurg and Palghar. “People from Sindhudurg often travel to Goa or those from Palghar to Daman-Diu. We have included such hospitals in the scheme,” he said.

The premium the state government will be paying too has doubled. “From Rs 640 per family, we will be paying a premium of Rs 797 per family this year. This will cost the exchequer an additional Rs 330 crore,” said Shinde. He added that at least 230 talukas have been covered under the scheme from the previous 120.

The scheme has also done away with 130 less popular packages and included around 170 news ones, including knee and hip replacement and psychiatric illnesses. The rates for certain surgeries, such as fractures, have been increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000. It also said rates for 12 dialysis sessions have been revised from Rs 10,000 to Rs 13,200.

AHMEDABAD: In the times of lockdown, Dr Mohil Patel, who runs a maternity home in Naroda, received a call from a migrant labourer that his wife was to deliver a baby. The doctor rushed to the clinic and immediately made arrangements for the Caesarean operation.

After a successful delivery, when the doctor realized that the patient, Arti Thakore, is a migrant labourer and has no money to pay the bill, he decided to do something for her. “In the lockdown situation, Arti and her husband Mahesh are struggling to make ends meet,” said Dr Patel. “I called up the anaesthetist and the pharmacy shop and ensured that they don’t have to pay any amount for the delivery.

Patel said that ever since the lockdown was announced, he and a group of his friends have been ensuring that the poor get food. “With the help of a shop owner, we have been making khichdi and distributing food among the needy,” he said.

Since March 23, the group has regularly been going to slums to distribute khichdi.

Arti Thakore said that the doctor from whom she was regularly taking treatment, refused to conduct the delivery because of the novel coronavirus. “We went to some other hospitals but they too refused to do anything. Finally, we contacted Dr Patel who agreed and to our surprise did not even charge us for the medicines,” said an overwhelmed Mahesh Thakore.

Dr Patel said that after some days of the lockdown, other residents too joined them in making khichdi. The group now feeds nearly 12,000 people daily. “People from nearby areas come with their utensils and take khichdi for distribution in slums,” said Dr Patel.

He says that the group is becoming bigger and bigger and the activity which began with four people now involves 30-odd people.

The prohibitory orders were issued by Aurangabad commissioner of police Chiranjeev Prasad on Monday evening under section 144 of the CrPC.

For the effective implementation of these orders, new checkposts have been set up on all the important roads of the city.

According to sources, the decision was taken after the earlier imposed restrictions failed to keep people indoors. Only vehicles associated essential services defined by the district administration, state and central governments have been exempted from this rule.

“We have been compelled to impose fresh set of restrictions after it came to fore that our repeated request to the citizens fell on deaf ears,” Prasad said

According to him, those flouting the new orders will not only be booked, but their vehicles will also be seized for the entire lockdown period. Different districts of Marathwada region have already imposed restrictions on movement of vehicles.

Jalna superintendent of police S Chaitanya said in the past three days they have already seized around 200 vehicles of which 180 are two-wheelers. “To keep a check on unwanted movement of vehicles, we have installed barricades at all the important crossroads and chowks in Jalna,” he said.

Beed police have also imposed similar restrictions and have asked petrol pumps to not sell fuel to private vehicles. “We have seized around 80 vehicles and the process of seizing more vehicles is under way,” superintendent of police Harssh Poddar said.

Latur as well as Osmanabad police have also seized hundreds of vehicles in the past couple of days for violating lockdown orders.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: A sanitary supervisor, 49-year-old S Manoharan is well aware times are such that sanitation can’t be taken a back seat now. He is equally aware of the woes of his team members, who have to walk long distances that too in the early hours of the day to report for duty that would go up until late in the evening. To ease some burden off them, he has taken the responsibility of serving them lunch on his shoulders.

“I can’t bear to see some of the team members starving, while others are having food. So, I decided to arrange a cook and prepare lunch for my team members,” said Manoharan, one of the two sanitary supervisors with the Ooty municipality.

He said the workload of sanitary workers has almost doubled with the Ooty municipality stepping up efforts to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

“While we report for duty by anywhere between 6.30am and 7am, we call it a day only late in the evening. Of the 42 sanitary workers in my team, 22 are women. Many could not bring lunch, as they have to leave home for work early in the morning. Almost all the women workers have to walk at least 3km to 4km to reach the workplace, as no transportation is available,” Manoharan said.

He has been providing lunch for all the 42 sanitary workers under him since the first day of lockdown. While some money is pooled in by workers, a lion’s share is met by Manohar. He also takes the trouble of distributing them lunch at their workplace.

“I know the pain of workers. Making arrangements and providing them food give me immense satisfaction, that too in this time of crisis,” he said. He also ensures to drop the workers, who are coming from long distances, at their places in municipal vehicles. The wards he takes care of comprise Garden Road area, Kotagiri Road area, Coonoor Road area and Kozhipannai.

Stating that even construction workers have been considered for relief measures, the unions have stressed on the need for similar arrangement for autorickshaw drivers citing financial crunch.

Nisar Ahmed Khan, an union leader, said families of autorickshaw drivers are struggling to make ends meet.

“The daily income of the majority of autorickshaw drivers has reduced to zero. On the other hand, there is no escape from daily expenses and other liabilities. The government must extend a helping hand to the families of autorickshaw drivers during the current crisis,” he said.

In a memorandum submitted to the state government, the autorickshaw unions have said that they do not oppose the lockdown, but the government must pay attention to the deteriorating financial condition of auto drivers.

Several auto drivers said they were facing unnecessary action even if they ferry passengers as per rules. “The government has imposed a ban on sharing of auto rickshaw by passengers, but couple of passengers can easily travel in case of any urgency. The police standing on streets, however, are deterring our members against such trips as well,” Khan said.

An auto-rickshaw driver said he had borrowed money for his daughter’s marriage and now he is no position to repay it. “While banks have been told to delay recovery of EMIs for three months, private lenders are not willing to wait. As earnings have taken a dip, I do not know how to repay the money,” he said.

As per official data, Aurangabad city has over 27,000 autorickshaws. State Congress delegate Jitendra Dehade said issues faced by auto rickshaw drivers would be brought to the notice of the state government.

319,['1/04/2020'],"Let migrant workers go, they will return: Traders","Ludhiana: Amid the Covid-19 crisis and exodus of migrant labourers and workers from Punjab and the neighbouring states back to their home on foot, a large number of Ludhiana businessmen doesn’t seem to be unnerved as according to them factory workers in Ludhiana are still staying in the city, and even if they leave they will return to the city.

They said there were several reasons like high earnings and prosperity as compared to their home states and therefore they will return after the situation turns normal.

In an unusual request, businessmen are urging the state and the central governments to not stop people who want to leave Punjab and the neighbouring states as they are in panic and stress. If stopped, they would take to more desperate ways to reach their homes. The governments should instead systematically send them to their native places by adopting all the precautionary measures.

Giving more information, Harish Kairpal, a leading garment exporter and finance secretary of the Knitwear Club, said, “Panic has gripped the migrants living in Punjab ever since the lockdown started and in a bid to be together with their families at their native places, they set upon journey on foot to their home states. It is a sad situation indeed, but as far as factory workers are concerned, there is a very small percentage of who have left Ludhiana as of now. This is because businessmen are doing their best to help these workers with money, ration and other facilities. Moreover, almost all the factory workers have mobile phones and use social media and they are aware that at this time of the crisis, it is better they stay where they are.”

Kairpal also added, “On behalf of our association, we request the central, Punjab and other state governments that instead of stopping the migrants send them to their native states systematically. If this is not done, then consequences will be dangerous as these people can go to any extent to reach their home state.”

According to Bobby Jindal, president of the Ludhiana dyers’ association, “There is no harm if migrant labourers and factory workers who want to go back to their native places are sent back by adopting all the precautionary measures. This will reduce their tension and will also do away with the risk of spread of coronavirus among them. The governments should help them in reaching their native states. If we stop them now, it will be a futile exercise as they are in panic. Moreover, these people know that their earnings and chances of prosperity are high in states like Punjab as compared to their home states, and when Covid-19 crisis is over, they will certainly come back.”

AHMEDABAD: As the 21-day lockdown entered the seventh day on Tuesday, manufacturers of edible oils and spices and flour, among other food products, raised concerns over production problems and the consequent shortage of essential commodities.

They cite the exodus of migrant labourers as a factor. Left without work in the lockdown, thousands of migrant labourers — a large part of the workforce in factories and in transport and distribution sectors — have returned to their villages in Gujarat and in neighbouring states. Without the workers, manufacturers say they are neither able to operate at full capacity nor keep the supply chain of essential commodities and FMCG running smoothly.

Industry estimates suggest that factories are either shut or are operating at 50-60% production capacity against the pre-lockdown period. “Several labourers have left for their home states and even though factories are up and running, the production is not at full capacity,” said Angshu Mallick, deputy CEO, Adani Wilmar Ltd, which has three edible oil manufacturing plants in Gujarat. “Despite automation, one needs manpower for several processes,” Mallick said. “However, with the labour shortage, these processes get slower.”

Mallick also spoke of shortage of packaging material faced by manufacturing units. “Cartons used for packaging are in limited stock and are unavailable due to transport constraints,” he said.

Samir Shah, president, Saurashtra Oil Mills Association (SOMA), said, “Production at factories is getting impacted at units where the raw material stocks are diminishing.” Shah said: “Due to transport constraints, raw materials which are not essential commodities are not getting transported. This is hitting production.”

Even as the government has facilitated the transport of non-essential items, transporters are also plagued by a severe manpower shortage with the migrant labourer exodus, thus causing supply-chain problems.

“At least 90% of my workforce of drivers as well as labourers is absent and the ones working are unable to reach the transport hub due to the stoppage of public transport,” said Mukesh Dave, president, Akhil Gujarat Truck Transporters’ Association (AGTTA).

In his order issued on Monday, Karunesh Garg, member secretary of PPCB, said, “In view of the lockdown due to outbreak of the pandemic novel coronavirus, it has been decided that the validity period of the consent to establish, operate, authorisation, registration or any kind of mandatory regulatory clearances which comes under the domain of the Punjab Pollution Control Board and having expiry on and after March 15 shall be extended up to June 30, 2020.”

However, businessmen are divided over the decision of the PPCB. Garg also added, “This initiative of the state government will help those businessmen immensely who want to operate their factories in the wake of the present lockdown. On behalf of the PPCB, I request the industrialists who meet the eligibility criteria for operating their units laid down by the Punjab government that they should come out in large numbers and make use of this opportunity.”

However, it is yet unclear whether this initiative of the PPCB will be able to encourage businessmen to open their units as already a majority of business associations of Ludhiana have refused to avail the offer.

Meanwhile, commenting on the decision of the PPCB, Sanjeev Goyal, a manufacturer of auto parts, said, “The PPCB’s decision to extend the existing permissions automatically and auto approval of new permissions till June 30 is commendable and it will prove to be of great help.”

According to Inderjit Singh Navyug, former president of the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), “The decision of the PPCB to extend the already given necessary permissions is of no use and is a futile exercise. Rather than asking its departments to indulge in wasteful exercises of issuing such orders, the Punjab government should come out with a relief package for us which will be of great help.”

323,['1/04/2020'],"Sale of petrol, diesel goes down from 6,000-litre daily to 1,000-litre","Ludhiana: Due to coronavirus, only essential things are going to be in service for the people. Petrol is an essential thing, but somehow, petrol pumps are not even making their daily sales properly.

While talking to Kamal, an employee at a petrol pump near Bharat Nagar Chowk, said, “It is a tensed situation. I used to come to the petrol pump at 9 am daily and I used to fill 100 vehicles per day, but now not even a single vehicle comes to the station because of the curfew.”

Deepak, another employee working at a petrol pump on Pakhowal road, said, “The sale is zero, but what to do, we have to be there for people. When there was no curfew, we used to sell around 5,000 litre of petrol and diesel, but now it has come to only 500 litre, including diesel and petrol, which is problematic. We know how we are taking salaries from our employer.”

“There are at least 20 persons working at our petrol pump, but due to this problematic time, we just allow 5 persons to work and we change the shift after one day. Earlier it was changing two to three times daily so the employees could take rest, but now the daily service is too low that we don’t need to change fillers as they are not tired. I guess, nearly 1,000 litre of petrol and diesel is being sold daily which was around 6,000 to 7,000 litre earlier,” said Rajesh Sood, manager of a petrol pump near Fountain Chowk.

While talking to Palak, a student who was at a petrol pump to get her vehicle filled, said, “The lockdown has left a great impact on people and their earnings. Being from a business-class family, I know how it feels if the sale decreases. Petrol pumps used to sell 6,000 to 7,000 liter petrol and diesel per day, but the lockdown has reduced their sales. The government should take a step towards the petrol pumps.”

VADODARA: Three days back 66-year-old Rama Panchal received a call from Vadodara Central Jail to inform him that his nephew Sanjay Panchal has been given bail and that the elderly man should reach the jail to pay bail amount of Rs 500.

After the call, Panchal was ecstatic that his nephew whom he had brought up like his own son will be back home. At the same time he was worried thinking how he will raise Rs500.

On Tuesday, Panchal decided to mortgage his television to his neighbour at Hirapur village in Daskroi taluka of Ahmedabad for Rs1,000 and set off on 110 kilometre journey on his bicycle around 8am. Around 4pm, Panchal, exhausted without food and water reached Chhani octroi post. On seeing his condition, members of NGO Team Revolution stopped him.

“We were distributing food packets and on learning that he had cycled all the way from Ahmedabad without food and water, we were left shocked. Our volunteers gave him tea and snacks so that he could get some energy and took him to jail in our vehicle,” said Swejal Vyas of the NGO. Panchal’s problem did not end there. The elderly man suffered a setback on reaching the jail to know that the three-day-old bail order had been cancelled and Sanjay cannot be released anymore.

“The man has been left broken as he managed to reach here after so many hardships and will not be able to take his nephew back. We will be taking him to the district collector as the jail officials didn’t even care to inform him again that the bail order has been cancelled,” Vyas said.

Panchal said Sanjay, who owns a bicycle repair shop, was arrested three months ago for unknowingly buying stolen tyres from a gang of thieves. Asked why he decided to cycle, Panchal said he could not any vehicle. ""There was a car driver who offered to drive me to Vadodara, but he demanded Rs500. But since the money was for bail, I had to cycle down,"" Panchal added.

Earlier in the day, four samples that were tested were all negative for Covid-19.

The virology laboratory was made functional on Sunday after a trial late Saturday evening. “Earlier in the day four samples were tested and the 14 samples tested in the evening will be ready by 12pm,” health minister Vishwajit Rane said.

Rane said head of microbiology department at GMC Dr Savio Rodrigues has informed him that the entire set up of the laboratory is ready. “The laboratory testing facility has been streamlined. Tomorrow (Wednesday), we expect to test 20 to 25 samples,” he said.

After the new laboratory developed a problem early Tuesday, 62 samples were sent for testing to the National Institute of Technology (NIV) at Pune.

The state government fast-tracked the setting of virology laboratory as it was compelled to rely on facilities outside Goa. It also meant a waiting period of two to three days to receive results. With its own facility now, test reports will be received within a shorter span. Rane said they will get results within a day.

Of six samples sent to the GMC laboratory on Monday, four tested negative for Covid-19 while two reports are awaited.

As many as 16 suspects were admitted to the isolation ward of GMC and 17 persons were quarantined on Tuesday.

326,['1/04/2020'],Covid-19 may cause lung ailments even after patient recovers,"Intishab.Ali@timesgroup.comJAIPUR: Those recovering from Covid-19 have a long battle to win. Chances are high that they will develop pulmonary fibrosis, a group of disorders that cause progressive scarring of lung tissues.Health minister Raghu Sharma announced that 14 persons have already been tested negative for Covid-19 after undergoing treatment in government hospital.Health experts claimed that virus infiltrates into lungs and damages it. Recently, a 69-year-old Italian tourist, who tested positive for Covid-19, recovered from the disease but he died of cardiac arrest. The doctors who treated him told that since he was already suffering from pre-existing lung diseases, Covid-19 further damaged it.Pulmonary fibrosis , is also known as fibrotic scarring, occurs when the lung tissues become damaged and scarred. “Even after a patient recovers from Covid-19, there are chances of developing interstitial lung disease, which will remain throughout his life,” Dr CL Nawal, senior professor (medicine), Sawai Man Singh Hospital, who was treating two Covid-19 patients who were brought from Jhunjhunu after being diagnosed with the disease, said. Both the patients later tested negative for the virus.However, doctors also claimed that the ILD due to Covid-19 is not progressive. “There are western literature available which shows that 80% of patients recover from the disease. However, in 15% of the cases, it damages the lungs and in 5% cases it damages lungs severely,” said Dr Virendra Singh, national coordinator, ILD India Registry, who is based in Jaipur said.Singh said fibrosis was present in swine flu cases too, who required ventilator support. “It is not that kind of ILD, which is progressive in nature. Since it is caused by virus, fibrosis is non-progressive. Once the patient tests negative, the virus will not damage the lungs further,” he said.However, Dr Narendra Khippal, senior professor (respiratory disease) SMS Medical College, who is helping Bhilwara doctors in providing treatment to Covid-19 patients said, “People who have comorbidities or underlying diseases such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease or having pre-existing lung diseases should remain careful. Once they are infected with Covid-19, there are high chances of them getting scarring on the lungs due to virus. Among these patients, the CT scan of lungs shows the presence of hazy lung opacity. However, among other patients who do not have comorbidities and underlying diseases, there are very less chances of fibrosis. Those five patients, tested negative in Bhilwara, we did not find any hazy lung opacity.”",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/covid-19-may-cause-lung-ailments-even-after-patient-recovers/articleshow/74921293.cms

Most of the positive cases reported in the two states are either participants at the congregation or their close contacts.

The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) charges Rs 1,100 in advance for supplying 200 litre water every alternate day to areas like Misarwadi, Jai Bhawani Nagar, Mukundwadi, Bharat Nagar, Vishranti Nagar, Chikalthana, Harsul, Jatwada and Padegaon which do not have tap water supply.

In a letter directed to municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey , Congress group leader in AMC Bhausahab Jagtap said that many people living in the areas, which have no pipeline connection, were jobless due to the imposition of the lockdown.

“The AMC should consider giving them free water supply at least till the lockdown ends,” Jagtap said.

A similar demand has also been raised by Aurangabad East MLA Atul Save. A large part of Save’s assembly constituency comprises of gunthewari areas which are dependent on the AMC for water supply. The residents have been pursuing the legislator for piped water supply for long.

Civic activist Rahul Ingle has been raising the demand for free water supply in the no-pipeline areas for more than two years. “The tap water users are charged Rs 4,050. The residents using tanker supply pay a whopping Rs 4400 that too for limited supply,” he said.

Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey told TOI, “The AMC is already low on funds and the tax recovery has also tanked. We can continue to provide essential services when we have some money with us otherwise the existing system will also collapse.”

Several not-for-profits have started delivering rations and cooked meals to the needy — daily wage earners, migrant labourers and old age home inmates, among others.Mercy Mission, a conglomerate of 17 NGOs in the city formed on March 19, has delivered around 9,000 food packets made in its five kitchens and 900 ration kits. It has a team of doctors and nurses that can help people in quarantine and stranded conditions. They have also kept a team ready to help with funerals in case the need arises. The group has also formed a team of volunteers to help the elderly procure daily essentials and another one to raise awareness.From its kitchen at Palace Grounds, the Jain International Trade Organisation has sent out two sets of meals to 14,000 needy people. The group received the list of people from the labour department, police and BBMP and has divided the city into six zones for delivery. With a current budget of Rs 1.5 crore, the group hopes to continue the service till April 14.Apart from giving groceries, the archdiocese of Bangalore of the Roman Catholic church has made arrangements to house the migrants and homeless in different places, including St. Philomena’s School, Railway Colony; St. Joseph’s School, Briand Square and St. Xavier’s School, Shivajinagar.However, some volunteers are finding it difficult to procure goods. “People were extremely generous in contributing money. But to procure items in bulk quantity—like 4,000kg of rice—was difficult as everyone is running out of stock.

336,['1/04/2020'],Indore under total lockdown till Monday,"Indore: The Indore administration is preparing for a surge in Covid-19 cases, possibly as high as 150 in the city itself, and the first step was to extend the total lockdown to a week. Till next Monday, everything in the commercial hub of Central India stays shut — medicines, milk supply and print and electronic media being the only things open.

“We are anticipating a rise in number of Covid-19 patients up to 100 or 150. We all should be mentally prepared for this. Areas like Ranipura, Nayapura, Daulatganj and Hatipala will need to be contained. We have started a survey in these areas to identify primary and secondary contacts of the Covid-positive cases and they are being shifted to quarantine facilities,” said Indore collector Manish Singh.

All 17 coronavirus patients, identified in Indore on Tuesday, were in the quarantine facility in Asrawadkhurd area as they were in close contact of those who had earlier tested positive for the virus, the collector said .

The administration is gearing up for the challenge. The required number of quarantine facilities, including those set up in marriage gardens and hotels, have been arranged while hospitals have been classified into different categories for treatment of patients, he added.

“Dedicated teams of administrative officials and doctors have been formed to survey suspected cases and for sampling, treatment and inventory management,” Singh said.

The collector appealed to Indoreans to stay at home for the duration of the complete lockdown and assured them that arrangements have been made for home delivery of milk, medicines and ration.

“Safety of government employees and others involved in battling the Covid-19 outbreak has been ensured,” said collector, adding that all health employees will be insured under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package — Insurance Scheme for Health Workers Fighting for Covid-19 — and are being provided with personal protection equipment.

Covid-19 may have spread fast, but it is not as deadly as swine flu as maximum coronavirus patients get cured, he assured. “Indians have resistance power to combat the virus but there are densely populated areas, where we are working to check its spread,” said Singh, adding that Aanganwadi, Asha and ANM workers have been roped in to distribute ‘immunity-boosting medicines’ in different areas.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh said a control room has been set up in AICTSL’s building, where calls are received on suspected Coronavirus patients and information is passed on to rapid response teams for checks. On an average, 100 calls come in a day.

Sources in the health department said, “Lack of security arrangements of the hospital authorities has been exposed. The local health authorities admitted the two brothers to the isolation ward of the hospital for conducting sample test, but they escaped from the ward.”

A sense of fear has aroused among the medical staff of the civil hospital after they got information about the two brothers running from the isolating ward. The medical staff has demanded to increase the safety of the hospital authorities.

Giving information, in charge of the civil aviation police station, Rajinder Singh, said, “After being informed, the local police caught the two within no time as they were roaming in Field Ganj. They were brought back to the isolation ward of the hospital.”

Some areas in the state had experienced shortage of water supply after the nationwide lockdown became effective. PWD officials said that some of the pump operators were afraid to step out or that there may be have been delay in releasing water as some operators had to depend on public transport. “Some of the operators feared action against them if they stepped out. Now operations have been streamlined after the operators were issued cards. We have ensured that supply is not affected to any area during these times,” said an official.

With access rainfall during the last monsoon season and additionally with the new 27MLD plant at Opa operational, the state can expect better water supply during this summer, after acute drinking water shortage last year.

For residents of Kadamba plateau, however, the struggle for access to water continues. They were expected to get water supply connections for the first time after the treatment plant at Opa was commissioned. But the work of getting the connections is now at a standstill. Residents continue to receive supply by water tankers, whose movement has reduced since the lockdown. It means that Kadamba plateau residents have to ration their use of water.

The cooked meal is being supplied based on schedule requests and distress calls. Branch manager Sudarshan Potbhare said, ""We are able to meet all the requests coming to us. We do not know for how long the lockdown will continue so it is important that the resources are used wisely. We should be able to zero in on persons who are incapable of cooking food or those who depend on eateries for distributing food packets,” he said.

Sameer Rajurkar, former corporator, has identified marginalized families in Samarth Nagar area and is providing groceries to them. “Instead of going pan city, it is better to stick to one's own ward, identify those who are poor and cannot get grain from public distribution system shops. This way each of the poor families can be covered,"" he said, adding that civic administration can also help in the process.

When asked, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey said it is a good suggestion and the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) can help in coordination. “A meeting of all NGOs willing to help has been called. We have decided that their areas will be divided so that they can focus on their efforts,"" he said.

Pandey has also appealed to all the corporators to adopt 20 families in their respective wards and take care of their grocery needs as a moral responsibility towards the people.

DAVANAGERE: Many onion growers in Challakere taluk of Chitradurga district are finding it difficult to sell their produce, as all the markets are closed due to the lockdown. The harvested onion has been heaped on their fields , or they have packed them in gunny bags and kept them in stacks, in wait for a purchaser. However, there are no buyers for their produce, as all the markets are closed. Onion growers fear that their produce may decay, if they are not stored in the warehouses of government agencies. There are no transportation facilities available in the region due to the lockdown , and they are hence helpless, said Puttamma, a farmer from Gopanahalli in Challakere taluk. “We have spent over Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000 per acre for cultivating onions,” she added.

“Even muskmelon and watermelon growers in Challakere and Hiriyur taluks of Chitradurga district are facing the same situation, and their produce is lying in the fields. If the government does not provide storage facilities or purchase the produce immediately, the farmers will sustain heavy losses ,” Puttamma observed.

A senior official from the Chitradurga horticulture department said that they have issued over 75 passes to farmers through tahsildars, for transporting their produce. “We are buying the produce from farmers through Hopcoms. Onion is being sent to Yeshwantpur Market in Bengaluru, and tomato is being sent to Kolar and Bananan, and is being sold locally there. Tomatoes are also being sent to the Yeshwantpur Market,” the official added.

JAIPUR: While lockdown has slowed down the daily life of many, it is a completely different story for 24-year-old Sahil Qureshi.

He used to sell fruits at Johari Bazaar which is under curfew. Now, Qureshi with his push cart covers around 20 kilometre in residential areas like Adarsh Nagar, Jawahar Nagar and Raja Park to earn his daily bread.

Life has been difficult for him since the lockdown as business is affected and procuring fruits too is a major task. Previously, fruits would arrive at Mohana Mandi around 6 am. But now, he has to arrive much earlier to pick the produce.

“I have to wake up at 3am to procure oranges and grapes from Mohana Mandi. I get a couple of hours to catch up on sleep and by 7 am I am back on the streets,” said Qureshi, who has a family who is the sole bread winner of eight-member family.

His father is a gem polisher who has been out of work since the lockdown. “I have four brothers and a sister. None of them work as yet and with a reduction of daily earnings, a decent meal is now a dream,” he said.

Despite the challenges, Qureshi has vowed not to overcharge his customers. He said he was shocked to see exorbitant rates that some vendors were charging.

“I charge according to the day’s rate and not a penny more. So many people, mostly strangers, have shown concern for me. Many handed me masks, gloves and sanitizers, while some women in colonies provided me with food and water. Everybody is trying to help one another, so how can I be selfish at such times?” he added.

He said he has also been provided food packets by the police and civil groups. “It is a very big help for people like me.

Earlier, I use to have chai and kachori when hungry but because of lockdown nothing is available,” said Qureshi, who himself also makes it a point to distribute a little fruit among street children. Not charging extra and distributing fruit to needy has made him quite popular among the locals.

Qureshi takes all necessary precautions to keep himself and his family safe. “I wash my hands, legs and face with a soap before entering my house every day after finishing the work. Moreover, I take a bath soon after. When out, I wear my masks and keep washing my hands as many times at possible,” he says.

All the walking and disturbed sleep has left him tired but he admits he does not have much choice but to continue. “I do wish I can manage an uninterrupted sleeps of 8 hours. But that would be possible only after the lockdown is over,” he added.

Satish Mahajan, 72, and Chanchal Mahajan, 70, an elderly couple residing in Sector 32, Chandigarh road, are an example of the same.

“We understand that the situation is not easy, but we are trying to see things in a positive way. We have worked hard and now we see our children doing the same. It is not daily that the whole family sits together and spends time. Everyone is busy with their life. Meditation and taking care of our diet is another thing that we are focusing on.”

There are others too who are braving the adverse conditions on their own. Daljit Kaur, a resident of model town extension, shares her ordeal, “We are managing on our own. Wellbeing of our children in Toronto, Canada, is always on are mind. Our children call us regularly in a day to check on us. My husband is diabetic and he has to go out sometimes for getting essential items. I own a boutique and I miss my work a lot. We are taking care of our health. I practice yoga and meditation every day. Also, we are eating home cooked meals.”

Regular exercise, meditation and taking nutritious diet along with precaution is the need of the hour.

He didn’t disclose his participation at the major event where over 1700 persons were present.His 13-year-old son tested positive on Monday and has been admitted to a Bengaluru hospital.“He moved around till the day before his death and met scores of people in Maralaur Dinne and Sira,” said district in-charge minister J C Madhuswamy.“Only after his death did we realise that he had two more children he had met. He didn’t tell us about them and we heard about it when P60’s son-in-law was speaking over the phone, alleging the government was trying to blame his father-in-law for quarantining the entire mohalla,” Madhuswamy said.Worse, P60 had visited Sira and prayed at the masjid with six others.“We had to pull out CTV footage of the masjid which showed that P60 had a meal with another man from the same plate. This was not disclosed to district authorities,” said Madhuswamy.The Tumakuru district administration announced a red alert in Sira. The district authorities have traced two associates of P60 -- from Tiptur and Hebbur-- and quarantined them. Seven others are from Maralur Dinne and have been quarantined.“While these are only two cases, his other children tested negative in the first round, there is a possibility of the virus affecting people in the mohallas,” said the minister. The government has forcibly home quarantined 2,000 people in Sira Mohalla and 12,000 people in Maraluru Dinne.According to the district health officer, 82 primary contacts and 162 secondary contacts are in isolation in Tumakuru. “We’re tracing tertiary contacts to minimise the damage” he said.Karnataka police on Tuesday said around 300 local Tablighi Jamaat outreach workers and 50 foreign nationals (19 from Kyrghistan, 20 from Indonesia, 4 from South Africa, 3 from Gambia and one each from USA, UK, France and Kenya) have been quarantined in the state. Police said all have been subjected to stringent medical tests.Meanwhile, the 50 foreign nationals who have come to Karnataka have been ascertained as being those who had come to the Markaz in Nizamuddin and later arrived in various parts of Karnataka.According to Tablighi community leaders, the foreign nationals made their way to Karnataka after the lockdown in Delhi and their flights were cancelled.(Inputs from Kiran Parashar)",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74922426,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-192851,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/how-tumakuru-victim-spread-viral-fear-among-family-and-mohalla/articleshow/74920697.cms

The duo sought help from Techno City police station, whose personnel convinced the landlord to let the workers stay. “Our officers cleared the air that they had neither been to Bihar nor been in contact with anyone from their district recently,” said an officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.

Also on Tuesday, 42 migrant workers — 19 from Jharkhand and 23 from Murshidabad — were found on highways in East Burdwan’s Katwa and Murshidabad’s Beldanga.

The 19 from Jharkhand, who lost jobs in two Kolkata units in the lockdown aftermath, were seen resting at Bhabta in Beldanga. Locals served them food after finding them exhausted. The 19 continued their journey on foot. Police in Murshidabad feigned ignorance about the workers.

Incidentally, CM Mamata Banerjee had only on Monday reprimanded police for not stopping migrant workers who entered Bengal via the Gazole border during lockdown.

Meanwhile, 13 masons who worked in Howrah’s Domjur were abandoned in Katwa while on their way home to Lalgola on board a pick-up van. The pick-up driver apparently feared police action for driving during lockdown.

Katwa MLA Rabi Chatterjee arranged for their stay and meals at a local school. He arranged for another 10 migrant workers, returning to Sagardighi from Odisha, to stay in the same school. Their bikes were seized by police.

Rupesh Kale (30), a resident of Pimpalgaon-Nawale village in Majalgaon taluka of Beed district, died on Monday evening after being struck by lightning.

Narendra Kulkarni, tehsildar associated with the disaster management department, said, “Jinat Kale, a resident of Beed, also sustained injury in lightning-related mishap. One cattle from Nanded district also died due to lightning.”

Ganesh Lokhande, divisional disaster management officer, said the family of deceased would get relief from the government as per rules after panchanama. “The local authorities have been asked to assess the damage, if any, in the region,” he said.

As per official data, among all the districts, Parbhani and Hingoli reported the highest 6 mm rainfall. The latest showers, which was third such spell of untimely rainfall in the region, has taken the tally of rainfall received in March to 15 mm – over 200% of the average expected rainfall.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), which had predicted untimely showers till around April 3, has forecast clear skies ahead over Aurangabad and many parts of the region.

The maximum temperature in the city, which has dipped to 35.7 degrees celsius, is likely to increase gradually further over a period of the next few days. Aurangabad reported a minimum of temperature of 19.4 degrees celsius. The minimum temperature is also likely to go up in the next few days.

Meanwhile, farmer activists have accused the government of not taking any serious steps for farmers who have incurred crop damage due to the unseasonal rainfall.

“The standing rabi crops, including chick pea, wheat and maize, witnessed damage due to unseasonal showers. The orchard cultivating sweet lime, papaya and bananas have also faced the wrath of the nature. The government is not paying any heed to the agricultural crisis amid the outbreak of Covid-19,” farmer activist Deepak Joshi said.

When anyone comes inside the temporary shelter home at Agrasen Bhavan near Ravi Nagar Square, where she has been lodged along with 195 others, she has only one question to ask when she would be able to go home and when would this lockdown end.

A resident of Gwalior, Nirmalabai has four children, all of them staying with her husband in a village there. She came to the city as a labourer to work at Gorewada Zoo. After the lockdown, she has been stuck in the city with no money.

This is the common fate of all 196 homesick inmates who hail from various states like Rajasthan, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. Though no one complains about food and facilities, the feeling of being kept behind bars has crept in.

While a majority of them had attempted traversing on foot to their native place, some were caught sitting in cramped spaces in trucks and other vehicles which were intercepted by the cops.

“We were going back home when the authorities caught us and brought us here. They are not telling how long we will be kept here. We don’t even have mobiles to get in touch with our kids and relatives. We’re using mobile of a man from our village who was working with us,” says Padmabai, who hails from a village in Rajnandgaon in Madhya Pradesh, pleading “Sahab, hame ghar jane dijiye.” Mother of two, Padmabai was working with Nirmalabai at Gorewada Zoo. Another woman from Gondia also has same tale to tell. According to her, both her kids have become upset over their mother’s absence.

Like these three, there are 12 other women from various states who have been kept separately on the first floor of the building, which is being guarded by cops outside.

Some of the labourers from Rajasthan had started their journey from Telangana where they were working as daily wagers. They were caught by Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), police and other agencies and brought to this shelter home. “After walking some distance, we were helped by a truck owner, who brought us till Nagpur. But the cops intercepted and took us here. We badly want to go home as our families are waiting for us,” says Sukharam.

Echoing the same sentiments, another inmate Shakti Singh said, “Around 600 labourers from Nagaur in Rajasthan and working in Telangana had to leave immediately after the lockdown was imposed.” “While most of them have reached home, we’re stranded here for the last couple of days. For no reason, they’ve detained us,” he says.

Many of the inmates were working as daily wagers in some factories in MIDC in Hingna and Butibori and were returning after the lockdown was announced. “We were working with a rolling steel plant. Our contractor has fled, leaving us with no money. He’s not picking up the calls,” said Vikram and Nitish Dahiriya, who hail from Chhindwara. The younger siblings badly want to go home to meet their ailing parents.

Department officials expressed concern over the safety of the farmers in view of the ongoing harvesting season and advised farmers to adopt simple measures that include social distancing, maintaining personal hygiene by washing hands with soap, wearing face masks and protective clothing, and cleaning implements and machinery.

All transport vehicles, gunny bags or other packaging material should also be sanitised, too, farmers have been told.

The virus has so far claimed four lives in Punjab, all elderly patients, and infected 41 people.The Punjab government has been approached by four units, three in Mohali and one in Chandigarh, for permission to develop prototype of low-cost ventilators. The government has granted permission to Mohali-based Andel India and the process for giving permission to other two Mohali units is underway. The Chandigarh administration has been approached to give permission to the city-based unit for starting work on the prototype.Hi-tech ventilators are available in the range of Rs 2-5 lakh per unit in market, Andel India, which has been manufacturing medical equipment from past 22 years, claims its ventilator will cost about Rs 5,000 per unit, and its prototype is expected to be ready in the next couple of days.Explaining the functionality, Anu Bhutani, managing director of Andel India, said their mechanical bag valve mask ventilator will have all required clinical functionality. “The ventilators available are imported and have fancy features which are not required. Whereas our ventilator meets all the basic necessary requirements,” said Bhutani, who urged the state and central governments to launch a financial scheme to help small-scale industries in manufacturing indigenous medical equipment to fight coronavirus.Once complete, the prototype will be tested by a team of doctors of state health department.

Sample collection of these persons is expected to begin on Wednesday which will kick off a massive screening exercise. This is again based on assumption that one of them could be a source.The police will also lend a helping hand in cases where there have been resistance to co-operate. It is learnt that police will directly pick persons suspected as sources of infection from their homes. However this again is a small part of the picture; as there are persons with travel history who attended the marriage and reside in other districts and it needs to be verified whether they have flown back or not.A call made from the control room to one person in the district went unanswered forcing health authorities to seek police help. The team had to source wedding videos and collect information on invitation list of families of bride and groom to make a list of probable persons with travel history. Besides a chain of contacts was established to probe further, however the results are still considered premature.Till now, the district has dealt with sporadic cases alone; one or more cases imported or locally acquired as per WHO guidelines.However the case at Pothencode can't be categorised as a sporadic case, because source of infection remains unknown. Th next possibility is clusters of cases which means most cases of local transmission linked by chains of transmission. If at least 10 out of 40 samples being collected on Wednesday turn positive, this would create a condition of community transmission which are outbreaks with the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases.While minister Kadakampally Surendran keep repeating that all contacts have been traced and everybody has been quarantined, the need to go for a blindshot by shutting down an entire panchayat for 21 days is enough indication that clues are nil regarding probable sources that could be linked to the patient. More details keep emerging which add to the task. The route map mentioned about funeral, wedding, prayer, visit to sub-treasury office, however local bodies had to chip in with additional data that the person had attended PTA general body meeting at Government LPS, Thachappaly on March 5 and visited KSEB office on March 10.

They even got a taxi, unlike many others walking hundreds of kilometres to reach home.

The ailing woman, Dhanrajawa Patel (50), accompanied by four family members, had come to Nagpur on March 18, days before the lockdown.

Having complaints of chronic headache, she was prescribed EEG and MRI tests on the same day. She was also advised to stay back in Nagpur as doctors wanted to monitor her condition after she took the prescribed medicines.

As the family is of poor economic background, they went to a relative’s place in Mankapur slums. Their stay increased after she complained of drowsiness and again went to see the doctor at a private hospital in Dhantoli. Her medicines were changed and her condition improved.

By the time she was allowed to leave the city, the family had ended up spending all its money here. Meanwhile, the countrywide lockdown was announced, leading to closing of all borders on both sides.

The family, mostly labourers, went back to the relative’s place at Mankapur slums, but after two days they too asked them to make alternate arrangements. The relatives too was labourers and didn’t have enough to feed their own family.

The Rewa family too had no money left, and almost lost hopes of returning home.

It was then that teacher Sapan Nehrotra, who is also divisional secretary of Shiksha Bharati organization, came to know o their plight. “One of my ex-students, Biresh Kumar Patel, sought my help. They are his distant relatives. I asked the purpose of their visit to Nagpur. When I came to know it was a medical emergency, I decided to help them,” he said.

Nehrotra had to convince the private hospital to issue a certificate. “Their relatives here too were unable to host them because of financial crisis. I went to the hospital where she was treated. Initially, they were not willing to give a certificate. I reminded them that the prime minister has asked to help our poor citizens. I took the letter and went to Dhantoli police station to get them a pass,” he said.

On Sunday, the family finally reached Rewa in a taxi hired by Nehrotra.

MARGAO: Six days after having had to make do without fish , the favourite component of Goans’ staple diet was available aplenty at several parts of South Goa.

Though fish markets remained closed, enterprising youths did brisk business by purchasing fish in bulk from trawler owners at the Cutbona jetty and selling it in cities and villages.

Many fishing vessels, which were out at sea when the lockdown was announced, have begun returning to the jetties to unload their catch. As Tuesday was the last day for them to do this, bumper sale of fish was witnessed at the Cutbona jetty on Tuesday.

Sources said that mackerels and kingfish as well as assorted varieties of small fish (korbott) was sold at reasonable prices at various places in South Goa. However, as people rushed to buy fish, social distancing norms were observed largely in the breach. In some places, as the stock soon exhausted, it had to be replenished by making another trip to the Cutbona jetty, which was also soon sold off.

The department of fisheries has directed that the fishing activities will be completely stopped from Thursday until further intimation, and this explained the rush of people to stock on supplies.

PUNE: The prices of all vegetables would be stable at least for the next two days with adequate produce reaching the Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard on Tuesday.

“There was surplus supply of vegetables on Tuesday. So, their prices came down within the budget of common people,” said Dttatray Kalamkar, the head of the vegetable division of the market.

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard on Tuesday received 13,700 quintals of vegetables, higher by 1,300 quintals when compared to the last bazaar day on Sunday. The Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) officials stated that the five sub-markets in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad also received more vegetables than expected at 6,290 quintals. Thus, prices of all vegetables, including leafy vegetables, and staples like tomato, cabbage, cauliflower and ladies finger stabilised.

Tomato was sold in the range of Rs8-12 per kg, ladies finger for Rs10-20 per kg and green chilli for Rs20-35 per kg. Garlic was sold for Rs80-140 per kg in the wholesale market.

“The vendors will sell these vegetables at a little higher rates, but people don’t need to panic and stock vegetables. They would not have to pay very high prices as there is adequate supply of all vegetables,” Kalamkar said, adding that holding market on alternate days was one of the reasons behind the increased supply.

Last week, some retail vegetable shops in Shivajinagar sold tomatoes at Rs80 per kg, while people had to shell out Rs350 for a kilo of chilli.

The wholesale prices of leafy vegetables, too, crashed to as low as Re1 per bunch of coriander. “A bunch of coriander, fenugreek and spinach was sold in the range of Re 1 to Rs6. The retail vendors are selling these leafy vegetables in the range of Rs5-10 per bunch,” said Kalamkar.

About 190 quintals of vegetables were not sold in the open auction at the Market Yard. “The quality of some produce was substandard and there were selected traders in the market. Eventually, this produce was also sold at low prices,” said an APMC official.

“This would again maintain the prices at reasonable level in the retail market,” Kalamkar said.

An APMC official said more supplies would come to the market on Wednesday onwards as the commission agents would open their shops from April 1.

“Farmers are worried that their produce will get damaged because of the rain in the district. Since there is no market every day, they are bringing their produce in large quantity. But it may have an adverse impact on the supply in the coming days,” Kalamkar cautioned.

Chief administrator Balasaheb Deshmukh said the Market Yard would not allow more than 400 vehicles of vegetables from Wednesday onwards. “We have taken the decision to maintain the required social distance and avoid mass gathering,” he said.

City residents have been raising queries about Bittu and many had also taken to the social media asking about his whereabouts.

When TOI reached out to him, Bittu said his job was to ensure that essential supplies reached city residents and for this there wasn’t need for him to be seen on roads.

“I am not interested in getting some bags of grocery along and gather people in large numbers for clicking pictures. My job at this moment is to see whether the administration is performing its duty,” said Bittu.

He said he had already given authority to deputy commissioner Pardeep Agrawal to utilise Rs 5 crore of his MPLAD funds. He also claimed that a fund of Rs one crore too would be released shortly.

Bittu claimed that he was sitting at home, but refused to disclose his location saying his disclosure at this moment may prompt people to visit him, which he wanted to avoid at this moment.

“If being an MP I do not follow the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and advisory on coronavirus lockdown, then how he will ask others to comply?,” he asked.

“The situation is becoming serious now, so all the residents should follow the instructions and sit

back at home. I had already conveyed the deputy commissioner and the commissioner of police to take strict action against violators so that we can control the outbreak,” he said.

AURANGABAD: Two clerics have been booked by police in Aurangabad and Beed after more than four people were found gathered at the mosques.

The first offence was registered on Sunday in Aurangabad, while the second came to be registered in Ambejogai on Monday.

In the offence registered with the City Chowk police station, 64-year-old Maulana Habib Khan has been booked after he allegedly led prayers for a group of about two dozen people on Sunday evening.

The congregation was noticed by special branch sleuths following which a complaint was lodged by head constable Azimuddin Inamdar.

In Ambejogai of Beed district, 10 people had gathered for offering prayers at Fareed Madrassa Masjid Pensionpura following which the policemen belonging to the special branch alerted the area police station.

Beed superintendent of police Harssh Poddar said the police action is aimed at ensuring social distancing and effective implementation of the lockdown.

“Stepping out of your house, without any valid reason, is itself a violation of the lockdown orders. There are specific instructions to people from across all communities to abstain from gathering for any kind of social or religious events,” he said.

The suspects have been booked under section 188 (disobeying orders duly promulgated by government authorities), 269 (whoever unlawfully or negligently does any act which is, and which he knows or has reason to believe to be, likely to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the IPC along with section 51-B of National Disaster Management Act. Meanwhile, around 58 people were booked by city police on Tuesday for violating lockdown orders.

369,['1/04/2020'],Norms violation by do-gooders worries officials,"Nagpur: The private NGOs, groups and individuals rushing with cooked and uncooked food to help the people in distress during the national lockdown have raised the eyebrows of the government agencies.

With the threat of community transmission looming large, many citizens and NGOs are going berserk in their zeal to serve and distribute food to the needy. This often sends social distancing, hygiene and cleanliness norms for a toss at several places.

Around 65 organizations from different communities and groups have come forward to distribute food following an appeal of the police department. Even a social media group, a call-centre for food and other facilities have been started by the police with the initiative of Addl CP Nilesh Bharne and others.

Through the group, police have managed to reach out to more than one-lakh population across the city and in the outskirts. The group members also coordinate with each other to locate the needy and reach out to them with prepared food, ration kit and other materials.

Bharne, who attributed the success of the group to the top brass including CP BK Upadhyay and Joint CP Ravindra Kadam, said every community had come forward and joined hands with each other to distribute food to the needy. “We have made every one aware of the need of social distancing and hygiene and are trying to improve upon the practices,” he said.

TOI has pointed out aberrations in the functioning of the groups who on many occasions were found flouting the social distancing norms and hygiene while preparing food, packing and distributing it. A group member left many cops red-faced after she admitted using banned plastic to distribute water in social media. There were also images of people packing food packets on the floor close to walls stained with tobacco spitting.

District collector Ravindra Thakare said the agencies, police, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and his district administration, had brainstormed over the enthusiasm of private groups distributing food compromising with cleanliness and hygiene. “We have issued directions to all to maintain hygiene and follow social distancing,” he said. “We have prepared Google spreadsheet among us with the lists of the NGOs, groups and individuals distributing food. This would help in better coordination and avoid duplication,” said Thakare.

He also extolled the police department for channelizing and roping in groups to distribute food in such numbers. “We have also instructed the NGOs or individuals not keeping well to refrain from offering services,” he said.

NMC chief Tukaram Mundhe has also appealed to the groups and individuals to avoid coming together in a large number at one place and follow the norms.

370,['1/04/2020'],Karnataka government to launch portable PDS to ease migrant crisis,"MYSURU: In a bid to prevent thousands of workers fleeing cities, facing hunger and distress in the aftermath of the coronavirus lockdown , the state government has decided to introduce portable public distribution system (PDS) across all districts.

Launched last year by the Centre, portable public distribution system (PDS) was to be a boon for beneficiaries who lose out on their monthly quota of subsidised food when they migrate.

According to the state government’s plan, migrants will receive two months’ quota of food grains — both April and May — together at the local fair price shops in the state for the cards issued in their native states. The move, the authorities hope will prevent families from returning to their native villages due to food shortage.

Shivamogga deputy commissioner KB Sivakumar said these migrant families have been divided into two categories — families with PDS cards of their native states/ districts and those without any cards.

“For those families which have cards issued in any district of the state or any state of the country, two months’ quota of food grains will be distributed at the local fair price shops. Those who don’t have card will receive food kit containing all essential items,” he said.

According to sources in the department of food and civil supplies, the biggest hurdle to successful implementation of the scheme is poor publicity among the migrants.

Publicise the initiative widely, say activists

Several activists backed the move and said the need of the hour is popularising the scheme among the migrants. “This is a good initiative. But most migrant families travelling back home on foot are not aware of this. The government agencies must ensure that all the families gets this message,” said Kannan G Sukumar, a consumer activist.

BENGALURU: The lockdown has halted Bengaluru in its tracks. But a few Bengalureans are on the move, providing the city and its denizens with essential services.Meet BMTC driver Muthyala Raghavendra, 43, and conductor Ramesh RP, 39, who have been ferrying hospital staff and employees involved in other essential services for the last three days between their workplace and home.Both Raghavendra and Ramesh are from the Koramangala BMTC bus depot. While the former is a resident of Koramangala, the latter lives in Ejipura. Every day, they complete at least 7-8 trips between Koramangala depot and Shivajinagar bus stand and their route covers important spots like St John’s Hospital, MG Road and St Philomena’s Hospital, among others.Raghavendra, who earlier worked as a truck driver, told TOI when his department asked him if he’d be willing to work for the special hospital BMTC services, he did not think twice before saying yes. “I had observed hospital staff trying to get to their workplace on foot and I felt terrible about it. When this chance came, it was like a calling from God and whatever we are doing is God’s work,” says Raghavendra.Though their families are scared as they have to step out of home every day, Raghavendra and Ramesh say they are armed with gloves, sanitisers and masks. “We also make sure to take all necessary precautions while on duty and even later,” says Ramesh.“There is no question of fear. I comfort my family saying we are doing a job that will help hundreds of people. I feel fortunate to have this chance to serve my country at this time of need,” adds Raghavendra.The duo is also greeted with some heart-warming gestures from people they meet while on duty. “Several of our passengers have thanked us for continuing to work and helping them travel across the city. Some were even teary-eyed on seeing us stop for them,” Raghavendra says, adding that they only allow passengers with passes and on average have 30-35 people travel the whole day in their bus.Even with the Covid-19 scare, they says their duty is a lot less stressful and even fun. “My mood has improved on watching the empty roads. I can feel the dip in pollution level when I breathe, I can see trees. Generally, there is a certain calm in the surroundings,” says Ramesh, adding that it’s a welcome change from spending the entire day within the four walls of his home.Raghavendra adds that driving on empty roads is a joy. “However, we have been directed to drive slowly and make sure we don’t miss out on passengers on the way. Even though the roads are empty, I drive between 30-40 km/hr,” he says.Just as they leave for their third trip of the day from Shivajinagar to Koramangala at 11am, the two say that everyone has a role to play in the fight against Covid-19 and they are happy to be a part of it.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74922460,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-175881,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/ferrying-people-is-gods-work-says-driver-conductor-duo/articleshow/74920721.cms

There was also a reminder that they were under home quarantine and sample results were being awaited and usual advice is to stay isolated. The family replied that they would stick with home isolation and wouldn't want to see his lifeless intubated body through the window.

He said India was conducting only 32 tests per 10 lakh persons while the number stands at 2,600 in the US.

378,['1/04/2020'],Home-grown crops to the rescue of rural Goa,"Villagers in Cavrem are helping each other through bartering

KERI/QUEPEM: In these times of food shortage due to the lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19, it is the villages of Goa that still continue their agrarian traditions that are least affected as they turn to their home-grown produce. Farmers from these villages are sustaining their neighbours by either providing them with fruits and vegetables freshly sourced from their fields or bartering produce like in ancient times.

In mining-ravaged Cavrem-Pirla, a village nestling in the foothills of the Sahyadris, locals said they can manage their resources and sustain themselves for long periods. “Since the lockdown, things have been going on as usual and not a single package of essentials has been supplied here by authorities,” deputy sarpanch of Cavrem-Pirla panchayat, Tolyo Gaonkar said.

Mining was a major activity here, but villagers sustained their agricultural practices and some are bulk suppliers of vegetables to the Quepem Sunday bazaar and surrounding areas of Sanguem and Salcete talukas.

In Pirla in Quepem, Vitthal Khandeparkar has been growing coconuts, betel nuts, various spices and bananas among other horticulture and agriculture crops on the banks of the Kushavati since his retirement. He also has Gir cows. All of this means he has ensured his day-to-day food needs even as in parts of the state, especially the urbanised sectors, people are struggling to meet their needs for essential commodities.

“I follow the practice of organic cultivation and it is helping me to live happily. People come to my farm to buy vegetables, fruits and other crop. I receive good demand for milk and cow urine, too,” Khandeparkar said.

Another village also on the banks of a river, Sal, grows a variety of seasonal crops — vegetables, onions, chillies and cowpeas. Dilip Desai from this village on the banks of the Colvale says, “Our village is blessed by Bhumka-Mahadev. We have traditionally been growing seasonal vegetables like amaranthus, radish and brinjal among others. In this food crisis, we are helping each other by exchanging various commodities.”

Explaining that villagers believe in community over individualism, local activist Ravindra Velip from Cavrem-Pirla said, “Villagers provide a helping hand to their co-villagers, mostly during such crisis, which is characteristic of their unbreakable community bond.”

In Keri, situated at the foothills of Western Ghats, Prashant Rane has begun growing vegetables. “People in our vicinity are aware that we grow organic vegetables and buy from us,” he said.

“This is the season for jackfruit and mango among other fruits. Raw mango pickle and vegetables cooked with jackfruit provide us with sustenance,” wildlifer Vitthal Shelke from Keri said.

While the demand for disinfection drive is forcing KMC ’s solid waste management to roll out more vehicles to reach more localities, ‘wastage’ of nearly 2 lakh litre precious filtered water in the clean-up activity is forcing civic authorities to do a rethink.According to a department official, the civic body began the disinfection drive 10 days ago as advised by a section of public health experts after a couple of Covid-19 cases. Initially, five vehicles loaded with filtered water mixed with sodium hypochlorite (the disinfecting agent) did the rounds of south and central Kolkata.Demand for the drive escalated after it was applauded by residents of localities where it had been carried out. Bollywood legend Amitabh Bachchan’s tweet praising KMC’s initiative fuelled pressure on the civic body to not only continue the drive but also extend the coverage.Now, KMC has deployed 20 vehicles for the disinfection drive. But there is demand for more. “We are flooded with requests from councillors, MLAs and even celebrities to disinfect their localities. We are also getting calls from housing complexes,” the civic official said.However, civic bosses are worried over shortage of filtered water as the temperature soars and demand for drinking water shoots up. According to a KMC official, each vehicle that is being used for disinfection drive carries 9,000 litres of filtered water. “Every day, we need to fill up all the vehicles at booster pumping stations. At this rate, it will not be possible to meet the demand for drinking water. We have to then curtail this disinfection drive as providing adequate drinking water is priority,” he explained.The civic brass is assessing whether to continue washing major thoroughfares with disinfectants or concentrate only on specific localities from where positive cases have been reported. “It makes sense to actually carry out the drive in slums where density of population makes social distancing difficult, and hence, vulnerable to the virus,” a civic official said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/disinfection-drive-may-trigger-water-scarcity/articleshow/74921349.cms

The Telangana State employees, teachers, pensioners, public sector and contract employees Ikya Vedika on Tuesday strongly condemned the decision to impose salary cuts and demanded that the GO on deferments be withdrawn immediately.

They said that it is hard to believe that the state is facing a financial crunch and added that even if there is an issue, the government should first seek assistance from the Centre or focus on other sources of revenue generation. “The state went into lockdown only nine days ago. It is hard to believe that we are already facing a financial crunch. This move of the government will have an adverse effect on the morale of employees, who are working hard to prevent the spread of coronavirus,” said Chava Ravi, general secretary, United Teachers Federation.

Telangana Joint Action Committee (JAC) chairman Karam Ravinder Reddy and secretary general V Mamata urged the state government to reconsider its decision to cut salary of employees in view of dwindling revenues. The JAC leaders met chief secretary Somesh Kumar and said the government should pay complete salaries of employees.

“There is a huge variation between gross pay and net pay. If they deduct 50% from gross salary, we will be left with nothing. How are we going to survive with a few thousand rupees?” questioned Ch Sampath Kumar Swamy, state president, Telangana Employees Association.

Pensioners said that they hardly get any money as pension and said most of them are worried that the amount would not even be sufficient for medical expenses.

Nagpur: The smartphone that Shyam Singh, a painter, purchased by saving his two months’ wages has paid off. As part of the lockdown exodus, Shyam and two others-- Hiren Kumar and Arjun Singh— set off from Hyderabad for their village in Hamirpur district of Uttar Pradesh, over 1200 kms away.

Clueless about the route, the tech savvy migrant workers started GPS on their phones and reached till Nagpur. The last phone’s battery died just as they reached Nagpur. TOI spotted them around 12 km from Mansar on Nagpur-Jabalpur highway.

Wanting to reach Sagar and Madhya Pradesh, they planned to enter Jhansi from there and then to Hamirpur. From Nagpur, however, they taken a wrong road. They were on the Nagpur Jabalpur road while the Nagpur-Chhindwara road leads to Sagar and then to Jhansi.

“When we got the job, we went by train to Hyderabad, and did not know the how to get back by road on foot. We got rides only for short distances throughout Telangana, so the GPS came in handy and we could reach Napgur,” said Shyam. In Hyderabad, for four months, they could not understand Telugu language.

They got a ride a little away from the city and were on foot again. As the trio waited on Nagpur-Jabalpur highway, waving at trucks, none stopped.

In their 20s, the three have studied till high school and said conditions back in the village forced them to quit studies. “We keep looking for work and this time we got it in Hyderabad. The contractor gave us Rs 12,000 a month but no salary was paid for the month of March. The contractor was also not traceable. Finally three of us moved out,” said Hiren Kumar.

“A little can be saved, money has to be sent home too. We do it through internet at the nearby shop. Staying back would have left us starved,” he said, the stock reason every migrant gave for moving out.

Shyam said he had bought the phone for Rs 11,000 saving from his wages for two months. But his phone lasted only till Nagpur. “Mine went off long ago,” said Hiren Kumar, “I sent Rs 20,000 home,” said Arjun when asked if he had a smartphone too.

Asked if they knew that the Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekhar Rao had annouonced all migrant workers will be fed, Shyam quipped, “they are giving rice, we can’t eat that.” Soon another trio that had started from Hyderabad came there searching for the road to Bhopal. “Nobody is ready to take us,” said Ashok, showing his blistered feet.

This was the third group of long distance hikers TOI found. On March 31, TOI reported about a group that had set off from Visakhapatnam to Karuaili in Rajasthan, a distance of 1600 km. They were stopped and put in a shelter home here.

On Tuesday, TOI continued to find groups of labourers walking back to their native villages. On Amravati road, a group of Korku tribals including four women was heading towards their village in Melghat hills, more than 300 kms away.

Another group engaged in constructing Samruddhi Expressway walked from Pulgaon towards Lakhnadon, also over 300 kms away in Madhya Pradesh.

383,['1/04/2020'],Citizens throng supermarkets for supplies on Day-7,"Panaji/Margao: With many retail grocery shops finally opening following the government’s directions to that effect, Day-7 of the 21-day lockdown was marked by a sense of reassurance among people.

In Panaji, ever since the lockdown, only medical stores across the city were kept open in addition to a few vegetable stores. On Tuesday, however, milk booths and vegetable vendors opened from 6am onwards.

Each of the grocery stores that were open had a long queue outside the shop, wherein people maintained social distance on their own. Even Modern Bakery had a queue, with people lining up to purchase bread and snacks.

Over the past week, a serious shortage of eggs and chicken had driven most locals to a vegetarian and pulses diet. Royal Foods opened in the Panaji market and drew a crowd of eager shoppers who purchased two to four chickens at a time.

Even the superstores kept their doors open for people to purchase basic commodities while the police kept vigil to ensure there was no crowding. These were Vishal megamart in Panaji, Magsons supercenter at Taleigao and Shenaz supermarket in St Inez. The Panaji municipal market however remained shut.

In Margao, home delivery service offered by a couple of stores has been getting encouraging response.

Fair price shops in various parts of South Goa began distributing ration to card-holders for April. Sugar and oil have also been made available to ration card holders in addition to rice and wheat.

Though vegetables were sold at horticulture outlets at many places across South Goa, the stock failed to reach several outlets, sources said.

Coconuts were also seen being sold in vehicles at many places in South Goa.

384,['1/04/2020'],High time fund-starved corporation increased its revenue sources,"COIMBATORE: At a time when the wait to avail the central government ’s fund continues for the civic body due to the absence of council and a final decision pertaining to the property tax hike is yet to be taken, the city corporation’s financial backbone does not seem to be strong this year. It is high time the corporation should take steps to increase its revenue sources, say activists.

The corporation has proposed budget for the financial year 2020-21 with meagre Rs 1.14 crore as surplus revenue on Monday. Its estimated revenue for the upcoming year is Rs 2,156 crore and expenditure Rs 2,155 crore.

If only the corporation had not proposed to obtain a loan worth Rs 223 crore – Rs 158 crore from the state government and Rs 64.58 crore from Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO), the budget would have gone deficit this year. It has been four years since the corporation had presented a deficit budget.

Last year, excited by the state government’s move to hike the property tax, the corporation had eyed to increase the tax revenue by 73%. But, a few months ago, the state government had withheld its decision and directed the local bodies not to collect revised tax until further notice. The revised tax revenue for the financial year 2019-20 has come down as Rs 308 crore against the projected estimate of Rs 501 crore. As per the revised estimates, the corporation’s surplus revenue has come down from Rs 4.75 crore to Rs 82,000 for the financial year 2019-20.

This year, the corporation aims to earn as much as Rs 326 crore as tax revenue.

“We could not say that the corporation is financially strong. But there are avenues to increase their revenue and it is high time they take necessary measures to increase their revenue,” said K Kathirmathiyon , a city-based activist.

The corporation should revise the rent of its shopping complex to increase its revenue and should slap penalty against the defaulters, he added. The pending tax amount that the corporation projects to collect this year stands close to Rs 96 crore.

He said the corporation should take steps to renovate and modernize its community halls so that people from different social sectors would also come forward to use it and it in turn would increase the revenue for the civic body.

The budget shows nothing but how weak the corporation is financially, said DMK MLA N Karthik. Pointing out how the corporation has been struggling even to settle bills to the contractors, he said that it is high time corporation ensures transparency in its work. Ever since the council was dissolved, the civic body is neither uploading its resolutions in its website nor ensuring transparency in its work, he added.

QUEPEM: Around 39 migrant labourers working at the under-construction Quepem municipal fish market complex have been left to fend for themselves for nearly ten days since the janata curfew was announced, in view of the Covid-19 threat.

All the men have been living in the building’s underground basement since construction commenced. Of these, 15 hail from Odisha, nine from Jharkhand, six from Kolkata, five from Bihar and four from Madhya Pradesh.

“We were without food for the last three days. We do not have money to buy essential items. After one lady approached us and heard our plight, we received one bag of rice and dal ,” Monoj Gopal, a native of Odisha, said on Tuesday.

The Rs 7.8 crore four-storey market complex is coming up at the existing place, and the contract was bagged by Shivam Infratech.

Quepem resident Patricia Fernandes told TOI that when she apprised Quepem deputy collector Rohit Kadam of the issue on Monday, he replied that it is the contractor ’s responsibility to look after the well being of the labourers.

Later in the evening, the deputy collector directed Quepem municipality to supply rice and dal on priority for the migrant workers.

“Two days after the lockdown was imposed, we called the engineer up and sought his help to provide us food and money, but he told us the situation would normalise after four days. Now it has been 10 days since the lockdown, neither the engineer nor the contractor has come here to check on us,” said Anil Singh, who is a native of Madhya Pradesh.

The aid tokens are supposed to be distributed at the doorstep of every ration cardholder. However, at some places in the city, including at Ratinapuri, beneficiaries were asked to collect their tokens at the respective corporation schools in their locality.

Raja Mohammed, a social worker who has been working along with government officials at Ratinapuri, said, “There are five ration shops in the locality. Whenever officials from a particular shop reach a street, almost all of them living in that street surround the officials. It is to avoid such a situation that we have asked the public to collect the tokens from the officials at school.”

The school premise is spacious enough to accommodate cardholders of five shops and we have ensured that people follow the social distancing norms while collecting the tokens, he said.

But, people were seen moving in closer contact at the entrance of the school premises and the crowd was dispersed only after the intervention of police. Ration shop authorities said that they would take necessary steps to ensure that people don’t crowd in front of the school.

The district administration is to distribute Rs 1,000 along with essential commodities to 9.76 lakh rice cardholders in the district. Officials from the office of district supply officer (DSO) have already started to distribute token to the beneficiaries. A senior official said that they had deployed salesmen of the ration shops to distribute tokens at doorstep of the beneficiaries to avoid thronging the shop during distribution.

Considering that it would take at least 10 minutes to distribute the commodities to a beneficiary, we have decided to distribute around 100 tokens per day, the official said. The date and time a beneficiary should visit the ration shop will printed on the token itself.

The aids would be distributed from April 2 to 15.

According to vendors who supply milk to Pune, Mumbai and many areas of Belagavi, agents of big dairy traders are demanding milk for a pittance of Rs 10/l. In normal days, buffalo milk is sold at Rs 32/l and cow’s milk at Rs 22. This is the situation since a weekOn Tuesday morning, around three to four vendors gathered near Ghataprabha irrigation channel at Palabavi village at Raybag in Belagavi, and threw away 2,000l of milk from over 40 cans.Hazrat Ali, a milk vendor, said that he and his colleagues had no option in this regard. “We sell milk to agents in Pune, Mumbai, Kuduchi, Terdal and Bagalkot. Now the supply of milk has taken a blow due to borders being closed, although the government has relaxed norms for the trading of milk.”Ali said that cashing in on the crisis, the agents of large dairy traders are refusing to buy milk at the market price. Another vendor said that citing trouble faced during transportation, these agents are asking for milk at Rs 10/l.He said that selling milk at Rs 10 /l will result in a huge loss, and milk, which is a perishable item, cannot be stored. Hence, we were forced to throw the milk away. The police have tightened security at the Maharashtra border, and travelling between districts is also restricted.Karnataka Milk Federation(KMF) manager Jayaprakash Manneri said earlier 2 lakh litres milk was being sold, and now it has come down to 50,000 litres. KMF supplies milk to Goa and Pune.He also said that police action on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border has reduced trade in milk drastically. He said that the Goa government has ordered not to supply milk to them. The KMF was supplying 35,000 litres milk to Goa and 45,000 litres milk to Maharashtra.PC: A vendor throws away milk in Rayabag",hubballi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74926349,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-356635,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hubballi/facing-losses-vendors-throw-away-2000l-milk/articleshow/74920732.cms

So far, a dozen from the pharmaceutical company have been infected.Even owners of medical shops were afraid to conduct business, but eventually opened after much persuasion by authorities. Stocks of medicines and groceries though were fast depleting. Given that the town is a containment zone, supplies are not easy to come by. District officials are making efforts to ensure a steady supply of essential goods.Fuel bunks too are running dry while clinics and secondary hospitals are wary of treating fever cases as doctors allege some of those advised quarantine have rubbed off the seal. While plans are afoot to shift family members of positive cases to government hostels as a precautionary measure, it is being opposed by locals, who fear infection.While the 12 positive patients have been moved to a dedicated Covid-19 hospital in Mysuru , 753 other employees of Jubilant Life Sciences have been ordered to stay indoors. They are being tracked by the police to ensure they don’t jump quarantine. Industries in both Nanjangud and Tandavapura industrial stayed closed.Meanwhile, authorities are still trying to achieve a breakthrough in finding the source of the infection. Police are scanning CCTV footage to check primary and secondary contacts of employees, while employees are also being questioned.

395,['1/04/2020'],"No functions to deck up, flower markets wear a sombre look","Representative image

PUNE: The coronavirus lockdown has hampered flower trade at wholesale and retail markets. The city’s wholesale flower market will continue to remain shut for trade until the next 15 days.

The traders said there has been a sharp drop in demand for flowers due to absence of public functions, wedding and other celebrations as well as temporary closure of all places of religion. A lull in the market has prompted authorities to suspend trade during the lockdown.

The wholesale trade of flowers is held in the Gultekdi Market Yard area. “The space marked for flower trade is very congested and overcrowding in the area would defy social distancing norms. The trade can’t be held at another location or in open market since flowers are delicate produce,” a trader explained.

Retailers in the city market said that most flower shops have been closed since the past week. “March onwards, we usually get enquiries for decorations for marriage functions but with the shut down all functions have been postponed and there is absolutely no demand for flowers, said Sachin Shinde, a flower trader.

Sanjay Satav, who supplies marigold and other flowers to the city market, said that he hadn’t been able to supply flowers to the city for the first time in years. “The market was shut and there were no buyers for marigold. Like me, many faced financial losses because of the drop in demand and the ongoing restrictions over trade,” Satav said.

Ramesh Wachal, who runs a flower shop near Mandai, said that flower markets usually witness a lot of trade around Gudi Padwa, followed by Ram Navami and other religious festivals. “The flower trade during Gudi Padwa was almost nil. At the moment, revival looks difficult for at least the next couple of weeks,” Wachal said.

The officials from the Agriculture Produce Market Committee said that the trade of flowers was expected to resume after April 15. “We will take stock of the situation before taking a call on resumption of trade,” said an official.

396,['1/04/2020'],Posters circulated to tarnish our reputation: MLAs,"Panaji: The three MLAs who were reported to be ‘missing’ on social media said the posters were terribly out of place and circulated only to tarnish their reputation.

Thivim MLA Nilkant Halarnkar, Mapusa MLA Joshua D’ Souza and Vasco MLA Carlos Almeida all said they have been doing enough during the coronavirus pandemic.

“This message has been circulated on social media by opposition and those who are drunk. If I am not doing any service for the people then I am ready to resign as MLA”, said Halarnkar, adding that he started distribution of essential commodities as soon as the Janata Curfew was announced.

Almeida, the Vasco legislator, said he was in constant touch with government officials and booth-level officers to ensure that the food chain in his constituency is not disturbed.

“Whatever post is circulated on social media needs to be verified. A lot of things get circulated but that needs to be verified,” Almeida said.

In Mapusa, Joshua may not be seen out in the open, but the legislator said whenever there is an emergency, he’s not one to stay locked indoors.

“I am monitoring and ensuring that food supply is maintained. This is a political trick (to show him missing). We should not play politics over this issue,” he said.

Son of former deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza, Joshua said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message was for everyone to stay indoors, so that the spread of the deadly virus that has brought the world to a standstill, is contained.

“We are not fighting a food crisis. Our battle is against Covid-19. As appealed, we must stay indoors and must maintain social distancing.

“We have supplied essentials not only to our voters but also migrants, stranded foreigners and others. We have completed one week (of the lockdown) and there are two more weeks to stay inside. If all of us stay indoors, then only we will be able to step out of our houses at the earliest,” said the Mapusa MLA, who took to social media to say they are doing the best to “reach out to everyone.”

The flight made a technical halt at Ahmedabad airport to refuel and then headed for the Gulf en route to Armenia.The 115 flyers that departed on Tuesday morning included many British citizens of Indian origin who had come to India to visit their extended families and then got stranded.

British deputy high commission Nicholas Low, whose office was coordinating with the flyers, was at the airport to see off passengers. After clearing mandatory check, they waited for the flight. The aircraft touched down at 8.30am. When the 236-seater plane pulled out, there were only 115 passengers on board.

The decision was taken after people failed to adhere to the physical distancing norms.

A senior city corporation official, meanwhile, made it clear the temporary market at Ramalinga Chettiar Higher Secondary School on Alagesan Road in the city would continue to function.

The civic body also appealed the residents to ensure that only one of the family members was sent to the markets to facilitate physical distancing.

Earlier, the city corporation had shifted some of the shops from Anna market to the new bus stand and the school four days ago to ensure strict adherence to physical distancing norms at the farmers’ market by decongesting that.

Of the 300 shops at the market, 40 were shifted to the bus stand and another 160 to the school premises. The city corporation had also equipped the two premises with water and lighting facilities, besides marking slots for customers at every 1m gap to ensure physical distancing.

However, most of the shopkeepers, who were allotted space at the school, have been selling vegetables at the bus stand, congesting the premises, the official said. “On Tuesday morning, they closed the shops before 7.30am, forcing many customers to look for other options. And they eventually crowded other shops.”

Following the directions of corporation commissioner J Sravan Kumar, the temporary market at the bus stand was subsequently sealed.

The city corporation is also planning to merge meat shops that are functioning in its limits after people crowded them on Sunday, throwing physical distancing norms to the wind.

399,['1/04/2020'],"Goa: A day not enough, say boat owners on March 31 deadline","Fishing activities continued at Cutbona Jetty

PANAJI: With the fisheries department giving them only until Tuesday to unload their catch at jetties, boat owners are worried about the fate of the vessels that are still at sea.

Fishing activities will stop from April 2 onwards till further intimation as per the government order.

“Unloading was done after all boats arrived and anchored. Any leftover vessels may arrive late in the night, but they will be stuck within the jetty since the gates are locked,” boat owner from Malim jetty Francisco Fernandes said.

These are big boats that had left before the lockdown was announced and out at deep sea it is difficult to communicate with them even by wireless. The North Goa collector’s office sealed the jetty on Tuesday morning, Fernandes said.

“Some trawlers have therefore started throwing their fish out because fish like tuna, horse mackerel, catfish, etc, are not eaten by Goans and the fishmeal plant is closed,” he said.

General secretary of the All Goa Purseiners’ Association Sebastiao Cardozo said that unloading cannot stop for at least the next three to four days since some boats are still at sea. “Locking the jetty entirely is very bad for boat owners. The boats that have gone earlier must be allowed to unload because fish is a perishable item. The natural resource will be wasted,” he said.

The latest order signed by fisheries director Shamila Monteiro reads, “All the vessel owners are hereby informed that after unloading their catch from the fishing vessels, shall leave jetty with crew members to safe zones offshore and vessel should remain anchored. They will not be allowed to return on the jetty till lockdown period is lifted by government.”

However, at Cutbona jetty, boats unloaded their catch, but fishing activities do not seem to have come to a halt. “There is a ban on fishing activities from April 2 onwards, but some trawlers are preparing to venture back into the seas. The fisheries department must take action against these violations,” president of the Cutbona boat owners co-operative union Savio D'silva said.

Rajkot: The adversities seem to be bringing out the true colours of men in khaki, with yet another policemen , that too , a retired ASI volunteering to do honorary services, merely to help his brethren in times of crisis.

Our lockdown warrior, Hamir Lunasia (58), had retired as an assistant sub-inspector from Upleta police station in Rajkot district on January 31, this year. “With the entire Saurashtra under the grip of Coronavirus, I felt that sitting idle at my home would be shirking away from my responsibility. Therefore, I offered my honorary services to Upleta police station inspector, V M Lagaria. He asked me to don my uniform and resume duty from March 25,” Lunasia said, while talking to TOI.

Lunasia has been provided with a police van, which he drives through the streets of Upleta, enforcing lockdown orders strictly. “I have got three persons arrested and five vehicles seized for allegedly violating lockdown orders,” said the man, who is also a firm believer in humanity.

Lusania on Sunday also caught 35 labourers from Madhya Pradesh walking to their native after abandoning their worksite for lack of necessary resources and amenities. After he came to know that they were hungry, Lusania provided them meals at his own expenses before dropping them back at their working sites asking them to stay put for the time being.

He also shows leniency. “I don’t misbehave with people. I request them to stay indoors and take precautions prescribed by the government to stop the further spread of Coronavirus,” he explained, adding that firm handling is needed as Upleta so far does not have a single COVID-19 positive case recorded, but nobody should be lax.

Lunasia had joined the police force in 1986. In his 33 years of services, he had served in Dhoraji, Padadhari, Gondal, Vichhiya, Patanvav and Jamkandorana of Rajkot district and Maliya-Miyana of Morbi district. For the past five years before his retirement, Lunasia had been serving at Upleta police station.

408,['1/04/2020'],Guest workers are hosts in this kitchen,"Thiruvananthapuram: A group of voluntary service activists in the city has launched an initiative showing feasible ways to help guest workers run their own community kitchen.The initiative has been launched by the members of Rights, a human rights organisation, and Oxfam India, an NGO. On Tuesday, they launched an initiative by funding a small group of guest workers residing at Poojapura in the city to set up their own community kitchen.V B Ajaykumar, executive director of Rights said even though there are many community kitchen initiatives by various government agencies and organisations to provide food to guest workers, letting the workers handle their own kitchens was the most effective way to ensure that these workers remain happy.‘’They come from different parts of the country and their food habits are very different from ours. Their staple diet is not like ours, which is unfortunately being prepared in these kitchens,” Ajaykumar said. Hence, the easiest way to ensure that the guest workers remain happy is to let them cook their own food.Rights and Oxfam provided essential commodities to a group of 25 guest workers residing in Poojapura. Their representatives were invited to a margin-free supermarket in the locality and were told to purchase whatever commodities they needed for the next 10 days.“Surprisingly, it turned out to be very cost-effective too,” Ajaykumar said. The entire purchase cost only Rs 12,000. This means three meals of a person for a day cost us only around Rs 50. Besides this, letting these labourers run the kitchens in small groups instead of rallying them to large camps will also ensure the cause social distancing.He added that they will be launching similar initiatives in more places from Wednesday. They have already identified other similar small groups of guest workers dwelling in different parts of the district. They will also be launching similar measures in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts where they have sufficient strength of volunteers.Meanwhile, district labour office started operating a call centre where executives have been employed to speak to migrant labourers in their native languages, Hindi, Oriya, Assamese and Tamil.

412,['1/04/2020'],Alcohol withdrawal symptoms may increase in coming days,"Visakhapatnam: So far, there have been fewer cases of alcohol withdrawal cases in Vizag city and other parts of Andhra Pradesh as compared to neighbouring Telangana. There have been scores of cases of people showing alcohol withdrawal symptoms as liquor shops, bars and toddy shops have been closed in view of the ongoing lockdown to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus. However, experts say that the number of cases in Andhra Pradesh may increase in the coming days. In Vizag city, so far only three cases have been reported at the Government Hospital for Mental Care (GHMC) in the past week.

Speaking to TOI, Dr S Radharani, medical superintendent of GHMC, Vizag said that alcohol withdrawal is the changes the body goes through when a person suddenly stops consuming liquor after prolonged use of the liquor. “There are three types of symptoms (mild, moderate and severe) of alcohol withdrawal, which including trembling, insomnia, anxiety and other physical and mental symptoms. Fortunately, so far only three persons approached the GHMC with alcohol withdrawal symptoms,” she added.

Sources said that over 140 cases of alcohol withdrawal symptoms have been reported at the Institute of Mental Health in Erragadda in Hyderbad, Telangana in the past week.

Dr Uma Mahendra Raj of Greenvalley Foundation in Vizag, which deals with substance-addicted patients, said that she has been receiving at least two to three phone calls related to alcohol withdrawal symptoms. “Since it is difficult to run the de-addiction centres during the lockdown, I have been suggesting them to visit GHMC,” she said. Psychiatric consultants are available in all the district hospitals also in case required, she added.

Hundreds of alcohol addicts may suffer in the coming days and hospitals may need to open additional de-addiction wards as the many people may approach psychiatric consultants.

415,['1/04/2020'],MERC increases tariff more than MSEDCL sought,"Nagpur: Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has increased power tariff for all categories but has claimed that it has reduced it. In fact, MERC has increased the tariff much more than that demanded by MSEDCL. For example MSEDCL had sought a reduction in wheeling charge from Rs1.28 per unit to Rs1.15 per unit. Commission has increased it to Rs1.45 per unit. The energy charge for 0-100 units domestic slab was proposed to be Rs3.30 per unit. MERC has increased it to Rs3.36 per unit. This has been done for all slabs and all categories.

Consumer activist Pratap Hogade has slammed the commission for misleading consumers. “If MERC has increased the tariff it should say so. Consumers will realize that tariff has increased when they receive bills for April. The Commission has claimed a reduction by adding fuel surcharge (FAC) to the existing tariff, which is not correct,” he told TOI.

According to power expert RB Goenka while there is an increase in tariff, consumers may benefit due to lower fuel surcharge. This however, depends on whether the surcharge is negative in some months.

MERC has set up a FAC fund of Rs1,500 crore for 2020-21 to ensure that fuel surcharge is either zero or on the lower side. This money is to come from negative FAC. Fuel surcharge in some months is more than Rs1 per unit and hence the power bill is far higher than that according to the prevailing tariff.

According to the order the FAC fund will increase by 3% for next four fiscals and hence fuel surcharge will continue to be on the lower side. Low fuel surcharge is very important for industrial consumers as they know beforehand what will be their power bill for a particular month. Fluctuations in surcharge create problems in pricing their products.

Vidarbha Industries Association (VIA) has wholeheartedly welcomed the tariff order stating that all its suggestions were accepted by the Commission.

Goenka said that three months moratorium period has been provided for paying demand charges for commercial and industrial consumers under the circumstances of lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic.

“As against additional requirement of Rs60,313 crores projected in petition of MSEDCL which was almost 13% increase in total ARR (annual revenue requirement), Commission has determined negative ARR i.e. minus Rs22,242 crores which ultimately resulted in reduction of tariff to the tune of 5% in residential category, 12% in commercial category, 10% in LT and EHV industries,” said the expert.

While MSEDCL officials are not happy with the order, they are satisfied that MERC has finally accepted their proposal for kVAh billing. Only HT consumers will be billed in this fashion while other consumers’ billing system will remain as it is.

DEHRADUN: With the 21-day lockdown announced by the central government on March 24 coinciding with the week-long Chaitra Navratra (March 25 to April 2), several residents say they are unable to purchase puja samagri (items needed for rituals), as these don’t qualify as essential items.

Shivani Kaushik, a resident of Lunia Mohalla , said, “My mother performs puja during the Navratra every year. But this time, due to the shops being closed, we could not get most of the material required for the puja.”

Shopkeepers selling puja samagri at Paltan Bazaar said they were staring at heavy losses as goods worth several lakhs, most of which were perishable, are just gathering dust.

Talking to TOI, Prashant Sundriyal , who owns a puja samagri store in Paltan Bazaar, said, “I understand the lockdown is in the interest of the country, but worship items should have been made part of essential commodities. Our phones haven’t stopped ringing since the lockdown was announced. Families ask for items to perform cremation rituals as well and we help them with whatever stock we have left. I had bought some supplies especially for Navratra worth Rs 1.5 lakh, which are just dumped inside my shop now.”

Aman, a trader at Hanuman Chowk, had the same concerns. “We are not allowed to open our shops and vehicular movement inside the market is completely banned, with the only exception being vehicles meant for loading goods. I had bought items exclusively for the Navratra but managed to sell only a few pieces before the lockdown was announced. Now, material worth several lakhs is dumped in my shop, which will be of no use for the next few months,” he said.

Many residents said that they were facing problems as the items needed for cremation have become scarce.

Rajeev Jain, a resident of Raipur Road, said, “I lost my father on Sunday and had gone to Hanuman Chowk to buy some of the items necessary for his last rites, only to find all the shops closed. Finally we managed to get a few items with the help of a priest, who somehow performed the rituals.”

Rohit, a priest at Lakhi Bagh cremation ground, said, “These days, I keep getting distress calls from families who fail to find puja samagri and request us to arrange for the items somehow. With short supplies, the costs of such items have also skyrocketed.”

On a trail of such groups, TOI on Tuesday moved on Nagpur-Bhandara road (NH6) only to find pathetic Madavi and Raut family walking with young kids and household goods towards Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh.

These eight family members including three youths, three women and two small kids, one 4-year-old girl and 6-year-old boy, had started from Besa and were heading towards their native place at Salebardi in Balaghat district.

At 1 pm, the family had reached HB Town. They were offered food by some social workers at Kharbi Chowk.

Durgesh Madavi (30) said, “Two weeks ago we were brought by our contractor for civil works in Besa. Owing to lockdown, we became jobless and planned to return. We were not forced to return and contractor also paid wages for work. We will do farming in our village.”

On delay about return, Shushil Raut (25) said, “We waited for the lockdown to get over till March 31, but as it was extended till April 14, there is no point in staying here.” All the men and women were determined to walk around 200km if they do not get any alternative transport to reach home.

Their contractor Dharmendra Turkar from Temnhi Tumsar said, “I pleaded with all the eight people to stay put. I was also ready to make arrangement for their food but they did not listen. My other group of labourers from Gondia is still in Besa.”

A kirana shop owner Surendra Dhawgale in Mahalgaon Kapsi confirmed the exodus of these labourers from Chhattisgarh and MP was going on since March 23 when the lockdown was announced.

“They are taking a short-cut to Kamptee and from there reaching the MP border,” he said. Some traffic policemen at the Kapsi post too said many took lift from the outer ring road and had already left.

They said three days ago one group had walked 275km from Akola to reach here and was headed to Raipur. Some also went on bicycles.

Whether the Rauts and Madavis reach Balaghat or are detained will be a different story but there were others who were picked up from Kamptee a day before and left at their rented place in Minimata Nagar slums.

Anil Uikey (18) and nine of his family members from Chhapra in Seoni had come to Nagpur a month ago for working as labourers. “Due to lockdown, on March 30 we decided to return and walked up to Kamptee but were stopped by police. Some Muslim community members offered food. There were over 150 people like us. By evening, the gathering turned into 1,500. However, all were sent packing by evening,” Uikey said.

Uikey said, “Ten of us were left in Minimata Nagar while eight others from Lakhnadon were dropped in Manewada. We are still wanting to go and waiting for right opportunity. We will do farming on half acre land at our native place.”

Then there were young labourers like Tanju Rishimunim (20) from Madhepura in Bihar and Ramsingh Tekam (24) from Pandharwani who vowed to go back walking if lockdown continued.

423,['1/04/2020'],Think twice before stepping out: 60 curfew violators land up in open jail,"Ludhiana: The police lodged 60 curfew violators in an open jail at Guru Nanak Stadium on Tuesday. From Wednesday, the violators will be booked under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, which will entail one-year imprisonment.

The police stepped up checks after a 42-year-old coronavirus-positive woman, a resident of Amarpura, Ludhiana, succumbed.

The cops not only increased their presence, but were also stricter with violators. Instead of punishing them with sit-ups, they either challaned them or lodged them in the open jail.

Till afternoon, as many as 60 violators were rounded up after they failed to give a valid reason to step out. They were boarded on buses and sent to the jail.

In the past two days, the city police were a little lenient and allowed residents in need to go out. People who wanted to buy medicines, vegetables and grocery were not stopped.

But when the first death of a Ludhianvi due to coronavirus was reported on Monday, the cops directed the residents to stay indoors else they will be put up in jails. The message was uploaded on Ludhiana Police social media handles too.

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “People were asked to stay indoors. Those in need can approach police on helpline numbers to get essential goods or order those online. But those who are roaming around without a reason will not be spared. Such violators are being put up in open jails.”

There are four open jails here. The ADCP-ranked officials are deputed as those jails’ superintendents.

Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Ashwani Kapur said, “I was on roads for four hours and found about 500 violators. Some of them had passes, but they were told that all passes had been canceled. A man carrying a tea kettle and six glasses had a pass to serve langar.”

“Those roaming around unnecessarily have been lodged in jail. From Wednesday, we will book curfew violators under Section 188 (disobedience to the order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and the Disaster Management Act, 2005, under which the accused would get one-year imprisonment.”

Nine vegetable

vendors arrested

Salem Tabri police on Tuesday arrested nine vendors, who had gone to the main vegetable market near Jalandhar Bypass for selling vegetables. The district administration had on Monday issued directions to shut down the vegetable market to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Those arrested are Kewal Singh, Iqbal Singh, Jatinder Singh, all residents of Moga, Ram Lal of Haryana, Mohammad Sarif of Sangrur, Sandeep Kumar of Bahadur Ke Road, Ludhiana, Darshan Singh of Dharamshala, and Gufan of Sagrur. A case has been registered against them under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the IPC.

Salem Tabri police station SHO inspector Kanwaljit Singh said, “Despite the curfew orders, these nine vendors were selling vegetables outside the main market.”

VADODARA: “If I would have not been in India, I would have never fully recovered.” This was Vadodara’s first Covid-19 positive patient’s reaction upon returning home victorious on Tuesday.

Amid thundering cheer, clapping and banging of thalis by his eager neighbours along with residents of Makarpura area, Chirag Pandit (49) acknowledges he was frightened at first. “When I was told that I was infected by the deadly virus, I was frightened,” said Pandit, the coronavirus survivor, who walked home after 14 days in the isolation ward of the state-run SSG Hospital, where he was admitted since March 17.

Pandit has his business interest in Spain and therefore was there between February 27 and March 7, and had landed at the Mumbai airport on March 8. His family is based in Spain. After staying in Mumbai for two days, Pandit had reached Vadodara on March 10.

“I had fever and headache. But the doctors and the staff at SSG Hospital kept motivating me to stay positive assuring me constantly that I will return home healthy,” said Pandit, who also got a call from Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani himself who assured Pandit of getting all required support from the state government.

Before he was discharged from the isolation ward, Vadodara collector Shalini Agrawal too assured Pandit of all support through a video call.

Pandit termed his experience at the hospital as the best medical treatment he could have thought of. “

Most of these are large chemical and pharmaceutical units , prone to accidents. Though private security personnel have been deployed, a feeling of inadequacy prevails which gets further worsened when the district authorities only issue one or two car passes even for Rs1,000 crore project, sources said.

Vilayat Industries Association president Mahesh Vashi urged authorities to issue passes on case-by-case basis to industries considering their criticality in national scheme of things. Most of the units in Bharuch are closed even those permitted either due to non-availability of raw material or manpower, he said.

Kamlesh Udani, executive director of J B Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, told TOI, “Many pharmaceuticals companies have been granted permission to operate as they manufacture important medicines, but lack of raw material and unavailability of manpower have made things difficult for them. There are hardly 20 per cent employees in the pharmaceutical companies. We have appealed to our workers that they should return to work as it is a service to society.” About 100 small, medium and large pharmaceutical companies are operational at Ankleshwar, Panoli, Jhagadia and Dahej.

427,['1/04/2020'],Corona outbreak: Should children go on playdates?,"The stay at home order is indeed tough for everyone, especially for parents who are struggling to keep their little ones busy all day long. And because of that many parents are still planning playdates with other kids to keep their little ones busy. But is it safe to allow your kids to go on playdates when it is advised to maintain social distancing?Well, the answer is no. Scheduling a playdate with other kids is not an ideal option to keep your kids busy at this time of crisis. Just because the number of kids getting infected with the virus is low, you should not take things lightly. At this time, children's interaction should be limited to siblings and only to the close members of the family. Inviting anyone at home or visiting someone else's home increases the risk of getting infected from the infectious virus. Children usually display mild or no symptoms of coronavirus , but they can spread the virus to others. This simply means that your child may appear healthy but can pass on the virus to an adult, who may experience serious symptoms of COVID19.Coronavirus is a highly contagious virus. Studies suggest that the virus can exist on some surfaces for days and can remain in the air for up to three hours. Another study indicates that virus can live on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days, and it lingers on wood and glass for four to five days.Looking at the complexity of the situation, it is best to limit your contact with others for a few days. It is essential to understand that restriction has been imposed to curb the growth of the virus and your safety lies in your hand.

. Excerpts:

Q: Do you think the onset of summer will slow the spread of novel coronavirus in India?

Q: India is testing very few people compared to South Korea and

. Does this help?

Q: India says ‘sporadic’ cases of Covid-infected not knowing how he/she got it but not enough to be described as community spread. Correct assessment?

Q: How long before India can think in terms of easing the lockdown?

Q: How do you look at the criticism WHO has been facing for allegedly giving a long rope to China?

A: I hope so. This is a new virus. It’s only 4 months’ old and we are learning as we go. And there has been transmission in countries like Singapore . We don’t think there will be an absolute reduction in transmission intensity. India’s heat is dry. It may be that transmission intensity will be less and interruption easier. But we can’t assume it will be easier for India. We have to make sure that alertness for Covid-19 is established across the country during this period of lockdown.A: WHO’s point is that this is a fight against a virus and it’s quite hard to fight an unseen enemy…if you don’t have tests to tell you who is infected. And so WHO does say that testing is a key part of the strategy to fight Covid-19. But if you got to ramp up testing, there are three important things. First is the test…for virus and not antibodies. Second is the protocol for how the tests are going to be used. And then you got to have people ready to administer the tests in ways that are safe for them and for people coming to be tested. The point is that you could very easily attract people with Covid to a test centre and they could infect the workers and each other. We are basically saying get the system right. And I think the strategy is correct. That the lockdown period is being used to put in place all that’s necessary, including building local capacity, to ensure that those with symptoms can get a test done. This is not a simple process given the size of India and complexities involved.A: Difficult to say that but as somebody who has done this sort of work earlier, the most important thing is to detect these outbreaks early…when you have chains of transmission you can identify. From what I’m hearing, there has been early work in India to identify these chains of transmission. India is on an important cusp of still being able to find chains of transmission before widespread community spread occurs. Prevention of the emergence of widespread community transmission, and suppression of outbreaks as they begin, through a high state of alertness is the way to go about it. India seems to have learnt from European countries and I’m pleased it’s giving top priority to itA: I saw the photographs (of people returning home). I don’t know but I’ll say the following. Locking down early when you have only a few cases and using it to become Covid-ready across the country is a very skilful strategy. If you can get it right, it will reduce the period of lockdown. If you lock down late and don’t have the capacity to interrupt transmission, then the lockdown will go on longer. I’m hopeful that this strategy will lead to the shortest possible lockdown. The protection of the vulnerable people is a very important part of the lockdown management and I am seeing signs that this thought is there in the minds of those concerned. The solidarity of Indian people that I know exists will hopefully help India demonstrate the ability to resist big outbreaks and damages that might have occurred if things had been done slowly.A: I am an independent person asked to act as an envoy.

SURAT: This is the right time when he actually could have earned maximum profit by disinfecting homes, offices and wherever that requires his services. But for Muzaffar Rangwala, 47, who is into pest control business for two decades now, lives and safety of people matter more than money.

And thus, Rangwala chose to sanitize all religious places of worship, police stations, government offices and housing colonies — all for free — almost his way of performing Zakat, a Muslim religious obligation!

For the last two days, he and his team of 15 workers have been scouting different parts of the city carrying their sprayer equipment, disinfectant material and hunting for places that need cleansing – be it of worship, police stations, government buildings or even private societies.

Till now, they have sanitized three masjids, three police stations and a police housing colony at Lal Darwaja and work is going on in around nearly 25 other masjids located in Rander and Adajan areas.

“While other pest control agencies are minting money with rising demand for sanitization due to the spread of COVID-19, I don’t want to earn money in the time of crisis. We are also flooded with sanitisation orders from the private parties, mostly residential societies and are offering free services at all the places,” said Rangwala, a resident of Begumpura area.

He also is aware of the risks he is undertaking everyday as the job of sanitizing involves going to masjids located in Rander town where two positive COVID-19 cases have been detected. On Monday, when the second positive case was detected from Rander town, his team was sanitizing the Kinara Masjid, which is located a few hundred metres away from the residence of the COVID-19 positive patient.

“There are more than 70 masjids located in the Rander town itself. Residents in the entire town are living under fear as two COVID-19 positive cases were detected. Even my team is afraid of walking down the lanes and locating the mosques, but we are firm in our decision. We will sanitize all the mosques and other places in the area, come what may,” he said, adding that people’s blessings will protect them.

Appreciating his social responsibility of providing free sanitisation service, the head of the insecticide cell of SMC , Jaysukh Vagadia told TOI, “We appreciate the free service of sanitization provided by Rangwala’s pest control agency. To make their work smoother, we have issued authorisation letter to help them sanitize mosques, temples, and government properties unhindered.”

NEW DELHI: From vaccines to ventilators, India and the US are ramping up cooperation as both countries tackle the coronavirus pandemic.Among the development that will determine the course of the cooperation is a study on the clinical trials of Remdisivir, the anti-viral drug by Gilead Sciences, which is currently undergoing tests and a study should be out by mid-April. The findings will determine whether the drug can be used on Covid-19 patients. Given an ongoing cooperation with Gilead in India, the government hopes for a deeper relationship.The second issue is the US FDA approval for use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for Covid patients. The US has asked India to relax the export ban on both and New Delhi might do it for the US.Besides, officials says both countries are looking for ways to work together for vaccine development. India’s strength lies in its long experience in dealing with infectious diseases.According to official sources, the US’ National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, headed by Anthony Fauci, is cooperating with Gurgaon-based Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, headed by Gagandeep Kang, on virus and vaccine research. The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and Indian Council of Medical research (ICMR) have already moved an existing cooperation programme into a higher gear.On diagnostic kits and ventilator machines, India is depending on US companies for bulk supplies which, Washington has said, would be available to friends. Abbott, GM and Sanofi Pasteur are all producing equipment that India wants to procure as soon as possible.Meanwhile, the MEA is pulling out all stops to procure protective personal equipment (PPE) and ventilators from around the world.According to a statement by the ministry of health and family welfare, MEA is buying medical equipment from a number of places. “A Singapore-based online platform has been identified which can supply 10 lakh PPE kits and an order has been placed through MEA to procure them.

“In order to serve a larger national priority during these challenging times, ITC’s state-of-the-art perfume manufacturing facility in Himachal Pradesh has commenced production of Savlon sanitisers to cater to the soaring demand due to the coronavirus pandemic,” the company has said.

Commissioned recently in November 2019, the factory at Manpura in Himachal Pradesh is a facility designed to produce premium fine fragrances.

According to industry experts, the sanitiser market in India used to be worth only Rs 114 crore. But in February 2020 itself, there was a sales surge of 50% compared to February 2019 and in March so far, the spike in demand is almost 100%.

“Amid the global health crisis and the unprecedented surge in demand for hand hygiene products like sanitisers, ITC, on a war-footing, repurposed this world-class perfume facility to help produce an additional 1,25,000 litres of Savlon hand sanitisers,” the company added.

It has pointed out that in line with the government order and the public interest, the FMCG-to-hotel-to-tobacco major has also reduced prices of Savlon sanitisers and is working overnight to reach the new stocks with the revised prices to the market.

Commenting on it, Sameer Satpathy, chief executive (personal care products), ITC, said, “Addressing a larger national requirement during the coronavirus pandemic, ITC has repurposed its recently commissioned perfume manufacturing facility in Manpura, Himachal Pradesh, to manufacture Savlon hand sanitisers.”

Hashtag NizamuddinMarkaz was the top trend in India on Tuesday attracting nearly 107k tweets.Several AAP leaders took to Twitter and asserted that the congregation was at fault as the lockdown in Delhi had begun before pan-India restrictions were announced. AAP MLA Atishi tweeted, ""The 'iztema' happened much before the dates mentioned in this statement, from 13-15th March. On 13th, Delhi Govt issued an order banning gathering more than 200 people.

439,['1/04/2020'],How Tablighi movement split into two groups two years ago,"MUMBAI: Tablighi Jamaat , the Islamic revivalist missionary movement, headquartered at Nizamuddin in Delhi, split into two factions two years ago following a dispute over the running of the organization. While the bigger faction is headquartered at Banglewali Masjid in Nizamuddin, the breakaway faction runs from a mosque in Nerul near Mumbai.

Founded by Maulana Mohammed Ilyas in 1926, the global Tablighi movement ran smoothly till Maulana Inamul Hasan was its Amir or head. Hasan, in his lifetime, set up a Shura or apex consultation body, for major decisions in the Jamaat. After Hasan’s death in 1995, his son Maulana Zubairul Hasan and another senior Tablighi member, Maulana Saad, co-led the Shura. After Maulana Zubairul Hasan died in March 2014, Maulana Saad became its sole head.

“After this, there were allegations of Maulana Saad taking decision arbitrarily which angered some senior members in the organization,” said a Mumbai-based cleric who has observed the Tablighi activities for years.

Two years ago, the differences led to a rift in the Tablighi movement dividing it into two factions. While Maulana Saad continued to head the main faction headquartered at Nizamuddin, the breakaway unit is being run by Maulana Ahmed Lad and Ibrahim Deola from a mosque at Nerul near Mumbai.

Different cities have zonal Markaz or centres which identify mosques to facilitate the stay of visiting Jamaats or groups. Normally a visiting group stays at a mosque for three days before they leave for the next destination or mosque. Mumbai has four centres located at four different mosques (Chuna Bhatti, Khar, Jogeshwari and Kurla Pipe Road). After clashes were reported at some mosques in Mumbai two years ago, the two factions began to take greater care in keeping their members away from each other to avoid clashes.

440,['1/04/2020'],"Some quarantined after Centre orders are non-Muslims, have no travel history","Nagpur: While rounding up and quarantining people as per orders of the home ministry — a fallout of the Tablighi Jamaat meet — the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has found that all are not Muslims. A few have not even toured New Delhi or any other place in the last one month.

The civic body, with the help of police, has quarantined 104 people in government rest houses in the last two days here. Results of swab samples taken on Wednesday are expected today.

On Wednesday, the Union government blamed travellers who had attended the Jamaat at a Delhi mosque in February-March for the sudden rise in those testing and dying of Covid-19.

The Centre had sent a list of names and mobile numbers to state governments which segregated it by districts and then sent it to special branches of the police. The police shared it with the civic bodies. The numbers were identified on the basis of their cell tower location in the are and the period when the Jamaat was held.

The NMC received a list of 68 persons on Tuesday, a copy of which is with TOI. The government note reads: “The need is to trace and quarantine all of them as they are suspected patients. They had come in contact of positive persons of New Delhi.”

The names and address, as registered while the SIMs were purchased, is also mentioned in the list.

As per the list with NMC, 13 were from rural parts of Nagpur district, two from Pune and one from Yavatmal. The remaining 52 are from city.

All 52 were traced. Four claimed they had never travelled either to New Delhi or any other place in the last month. Some of the remaining 48 said they had travelled with family members. The NMC quarantined all 54 (48 + 6 members) at the MLA Hostel on Wednesday.

On Wednesday morning, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe in a video release said, “54 who attended the Delhi congregation were traced and quarantined.” In the evening, Mundhe had to change his statement as some of them turned out to be non-Muslims.

A scrutiny of the list of 68 reveals that 37 are non-Muslim names. However, as directed by the Centre, the NMC has quarantined all of them.

TOI spoke to one of the quarantined non-Muslim who is a resident of Civil Lines, a tony locality of Nagpur. “I am a practising Supreme Court lawyer. The SIM card of mobile number mentioned in the list available with the NMC is in the name of my father. When officials came to my house I told them that I am Delhi resident and not my father. So they have quarantined me.”

This lawyer’s office is at the Sunder Nagar Market and residence at Lajpat Nagar in Delhi. “I use the Nizamuddin flyover at least twice a day. I suppose that’s how my number came on the list. I returned to Nagpur on March 18 by air. I had no symptoms in the past and now. Also, its more than 14 days since I returned from New Delhi,” he said.

On Wednesday evening, the NMC received another list of 207 persons from the Centre with directions to trace and quarantine all. Not all are Muslims. A 124 are city residents and the remaining from other parts of the district and state.

The NMC has traced, taken swab samples and quarantined around 50 taking the total to 104. “18 people are untraceable as the numbers are switched off. NMC and police teams are trying to track others,” an NMC official said.

Similarly, the Nagpur Rural Police is tracing people in their jurisdiction.

As reported by TOI on Thursday, Abdul Bari Patel, the secretary of the Tablighi Markas in Nagpur, only seven members from city attended the international conference in New Delhi. One of them had taken ill and was treated for urinary tract infection and pneumonia. “He was tested for coronavirus and the result was negative,” he said.

NOIDA: It was good fortune that helped the Noida administration avert a crisis on Tuesday, a situation where there would be no beds in its hospitals for Covid-19 to accommodate a new patient.

The city, which has emerged as UP’s hotspot with 41 cases so far, was lucky to record three positive cases on Tuesday after averaging seven a day since Saturday. Only seven free beds now remain available in its two isolation wards — five, effectively, as one of the units has to sanitise its beds for two days — and there won’t be any additional ones till at least Thursday morning when the new one at Sharda Hospital becomes functional.

Noida’s coronavirus infections have predominantly come from a single contact chain of Cease Fire employees — 29 of the 38 so far. It has spread to Ghaziabad, where one more Cease Fire employee tested positive on Tuesday, and as far as Bareilly, where five new cases on Tuesday were linked to the chain.

Preparations have begun on a war-footing to have a 100-bed Covid-19 unit ready on the Sharda campus but the oxygen pipeline there is still being installed. During the Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s visit on Monday, Sharda University, which runs the hospital, was asked to install a separate oxygen pipeline for the isolation ward. “We are trying our best to get the facility ready as soon as possible. Everything except the oxygen pipeline is in place. Once installed, we can take in new patients from Thursday morning,” a spokesperson for Sharda University told TOI.

Noida’s healthcare apparatus was overwhelmed by a sudden spike in novel coronavirus cases since March 24.

Asked how additional patients will be managed if there are over five patients on Wednesday, district magistrate Suhas LY, who has just taken charge, told TOI, “I’m sure we will be able to manage something.” He said the administration was trying to get the new 100-bed facility functional. “We have still not had any patient who would need an oxygen cylinder. In case we do, there are over 20 cylinders. The pipeline work is also being done at the new hospital on a war-footing and we are trying to get it ready at the earliest,” he added.

For Covid-19 patients, there are two hospitals in the district with 20 beds each — Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida and the child PGI (SSPHPGTI) in Sector 30 of Noida. As of now, after discharging five patients, GIMS has 18 occupied beds while child PGI has

15. However, GIMS will not be able to take in more patients for the next two days. That leaves five beds at PGI.

None of those who tested positive for Covid-19 in Noida on Tuesday was linked to Cease Fire. They included a woman and her son in Sector 37 — the son’s uncle had recently returned from Switzerland. The third case was an 81-year-old man in Sector 28 with no travel history.

The Cease Fire employee who tested positive in Ghaziabad is a resident of Duhai in Muradnagar. He is the third Cease Fire employee to test positive in the district.

446,['1/04/2020'],"Jump in corona cases due to lack of community support, says govt","NEW DELHI: The Centre said on Tuesday that the increase in the number of Covid-19 cases was mainly because of lack of support from the wider community in certain areas, coupled with delay in reporting of cases, even as it responded to the Nizamuddin situation by saying that this was not the time for finding fault and the country needed to work together to find a solution.

Around 227 new cases and three deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. One death each was reported from Gujarat , West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh , health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said. India has reported a total of over 1,250 confirmed cases and 32 deaths so far.

Sharing the case numbers, Agarwal reiterated that full implementation of the lockdown and social distancing measures were essential to break the chain of transmission, and urged people to follow the prescribed guidelines and protocols. “Even if one person fails to comply, we will be back to stage zero,” he said.

Responding to questions on models showing a range of cases, Agarwal said none of these took into account India’s decision to enter a 21-day lockdown. “When this was a surprise decision, how can models predict numbers,” he asked.

Elaborating on identification of hotspots, the ministry said that any place with even a single case was treated as a hotspot because it was dealing with an infectious disease. However, when any particular area witnessed a large number of cases, the government’s intervention and containment strategy was scaled up accordingly. Agarwal was responding to questions on how many hotspots were being monitored. He said that there might be a lag in reporting numbers but not by much. The ministry’s focus was on acting quickly to zero in on new cases and take up contact tracing, he added.

The government was using cluster-containment strategies and doing rigorous contact tracing in these hotspots to check the virus from spreading, he said. “The situation is very dynamic. A success story today can become a hotspot tomorrow. Since we are dealing with infectious disease management, a single case can develop into a hotspot,” Agarwal said.

The ministry maintained that prevention, containment and management of Covid-19 was being monitored at the highest level and various actions had been initiated in collaboration with states.

Meanwhile, a group of ministers headed by health minister Harsh Vardhan met on Tuesday and reviewed various issues related to implementation of the lockdown, the issue of migrant labourers, containment measures in emerging hotspots and ensuring adequacy of essential items such as personal protective equipment, masks, ventilators, etc.

Police personnel are playing a crucial role in enforcing the lockdown and compel citizens to remain at home.

City police have relieved the personnel who are undergoing chemotherapy including one traffic cop who was on duty despite suffering from blood cancer till earlier this week. Cops suffering from cancer have been also sent on leave by district police chief IG, range, KMM Prasanna in four districts of Wardha, Bhandara, Chandrapur and Nagpur rural.

District police have gone a step ahead to ensure all cops aged 55 years and above are sent on leave while ones aged 50 years and more were kept on reserve duty to save them from getting infected.

Dr Sandeep Shinde of police hospital at headquarters informed that a 24-hour helpline and his service were available for assistance related to Corona-like symptoms and related health issues. “We are going through the third phase of the pandemic cycle in which the community spread is the common feature. Hence every precaution is being taken to safeguard the sizeable police force,” he said.

“Cops, especially the pregnant ones, elderly and ailing ones, are susceptible to infection as they are exposed to the masses all the time,” he said.

Dr Shinde has also started visiting the nakabandis across the city to raise awareness among the cops deployed there. “I have told the personnel to avoid touching the barricades repeatedly and also the documents shown to them by the public. They should have meals before leaving home and clean themselves and clothes after returning,” said Shinde who was at Manewada junction on Tuesday to meet the police on duty.

“I have also told them to maintain social distancing and not to go close to the people for checking. They should also stop using sanitizers from unknown persons as it may trigger allergy,” he said.

City police chief BK Upadhyay too is learnt to have now allowed the in-charges of different units to send their personnel on medical leave unlike in the past when doctor’s certificate was a must.

Despite the health hazards and rising outside temperature, city police showed resilience throughout the day stepping up the checking and seizing activities. City police have taken actions against 3,286 persons on Tuesday which included penalizing 3,148 vehicle owners for violations. In all 11 cases, including one for spreading rumour, were registered against violators. City police also detained 123 people for loitering on the streets.

In the districts, police have so far taken action against 152 violators starting from March 24. Maximum action was taken by Chandrapur police (67) under SP Maheshwar Reddy.

Police personnel were left in a shock when a message had surfaced that state government had decided to cut salaries of employees to meet corona-related expenses. However, it was short-lived as it was clarified that police, healthcare, and other workers dealing with the crisis were exempted from the cut.

PUNE: The first critical novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infected patient in Pune has recovered and will go home in a week's time.

The 42-year-old woman from Sinhagad Road, with no history of foreign travel, was put off the ventilator after 11 days of aggressive treatment at a private hospital in Pune on Tuesday. Her throat swab sample has tested negative twice in 24 hours for the contagion.

""She is breathing on her own. She also had some soup in the morning. We will discharge her in a week. She is perhaps the first patient who was critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome and has recovered successfully. Her recovery has given us hope that seriously ill patients can come out of complications,"" Sanjay Lalwani, medical director of Bharati Hospital told TOI.

The woman was being treated at the hospital since March 16 and her condition worsened three days later. She was then intubated and put on ventilator support on March 20. The hospital sent her throat swab sample to rule out swine flu, but it tested positive for Covid-19 and negative for swine flu.

""We administered her aggressive treatment on ventilator support. We used all medication, including antiviral drugs, meant for the treatment of swine flu, malaria and HIV. Skilled intensivists and round-the-clock ICU nursing pulled her off the critical ARDS state which is a fatal complication of Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses,"" Lalwani said.

“Whenever I get time, I practise Yoga Nidra once or twice a week. It furthers overall well-being, relaxes the mind, reduces stress and anxiety,” the PM tweeted, suggesting that one can find many videos of ‘Yoga Nidra’ on the net.

US President Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump was the first among those to appreciate the video shared by Modi. In his latest “Mann Ki Baat” radio address, Modi had promised to share fitness videos, in response to a question how he was keeping fit during the 21-day lockdown. “This is wonderful. Thank you,” Ivanka Trump tweeted and followed it with #TogetherApart. Sharing YouTube yoga videos on Monday, Modi had said he was neither a fitness nor medical expert.

“Practising Yoga has been an integral part of my life. I am sure many of you also have other ways of remaining fit, which you also must share,” he had said.

“I got in touch with the woman’s brother and spoke to doctors.

But in an exemplary gesture, neighbours, friends and relatives of all three gave them a warm welcome for conquering a deadly foe, erasing the trauma of stigmatisation they had faced just a fortnight ago when they had tested positive for coronavirus In Ballygunge, residents of an upscale condominium stood on their balconies waving and cheering a 53-year-old businessman, who had contracted the virus from his UK-returned son, as he got off his car and walked into his apartment smiling and acknowledging the waves. In Habra, neighbours of the 23-year-old survivor came out on the road, briefly breaking lockdown protocol, and blew conch shells to welcome the woman who had fallen ill after returning from Scotland. The members of the residents’ association of the EM Bypass apartment complex where the city’s first Covid-19 patient, an 18-year-old Oxford University student, lives also welcomed the family home and took steps to ensure they are not victimised or harassed.As per protocol, all three will have to stay in home isolation for the next 14 days to avoid chances of recurrence of the disease.“I am happy to be back home. The doctors were very motivating and always asked me not to panic. Back home, I am touched by the reception,” the 23-year-old Habra resident said.Members of the residents’ association of the Ballygunge condominium had sent text messages to all flatowners to ensure the 53-year-old Covid-19 survivor wasn’t victimised or bothered.

The businessman, his son, wife and domestic help were all undergoing treatment at the ID hospital for the last two weeks and he was the first to recover and return home.“Since the time we learnt he has been cured and is returning home, we have been sending text messages to all residents to ensure that no one harasses him. I have been constantly trying to raise awareness in the forum that those who contract the disease are victims and not criminals. Our complex is like a big family and we want to keep it that way,” said the president of the resident’s association.Another member of the association added that since the businessman now needs to stay in home isolation for 14 days, if needed, the association would take the responsibility of fetching essentials and keeping these outside his door.The city’s first Covid-19 victim and his parents are also preparing to head back to their condominium off EM Bypass after the 18-year-old was released on Tuesday evening.

All of them are being shifted to a facility near the airport where a special isolation unit is being set up; the entire band of 40 will be tested on Tuesday itself and quarantined for the next two weeks.

The hectic activity in Kolkata coincided with a central input, which said 73 people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat meet in Delhi might have come to Bengal.

Eight of those traced are now in a mosque near New Market and all of them are Delhi residents. Mosque secretary Mohammad Nooruddin told TOI that the group reached the mosque on March 22, the day of the janata curfew, and were supposed to leave for Bangladesh three days later.

“But, then, the lockdown was declared and everyone was told to stay where they were. So they could not return. They have been staying in the mosque since then,” Nooruddin said.

“They are in good health. We are getting in touch with the state government right away to help isolate them till they can return home,” Nooruddin said on Tuesday morning. State health department officials said later on Tuesday that the process of shifting these eight people had already started.

“A lot of people have got in touch with us. We have already identified 40 people who are being shifted to the facility that has been earmarked for this purpose. Cops are coordinating the entire process. We will conduct the necessary tests on Tuesday and, if they they are found to be fit after the quarantine, we will help them reach home,” a Bengal Haj department spokesperson said.

“All those from Bengal who participated in this event (Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi) are being identified and will be immediately tested for Covid-19 and put in the mandatory 14-day quarantine,” state home secretary Alapan Bandyopadhyay confirmed on his Twitter handle.

Officials said the central inputs that came on Monday night had alerted the Bengal government about the possibility of several Thai, Indonesian and Malaysian nationals being part of the 73 who came to the state. The Bengal government then put together a core team, including a senior MP, to coordinate with the administration and sent out a message to all imams across the state to alert it immediately if they came across any such persons. “The response has been very good and we are still receiving information,” a senior officer said.

Maruti, however, begs to differ. “See, in smaller towns and villages people are not as exposed to the media and awareness campaigns as they are in cities. Our SP said we should come up with news ideas to create awareness about the deadly disease among the masses here. So I painted the horse with the images of coronavirus using water colours. Horses represent speed. I wanted to convey to people that the virus is spreading faster than the speed of the horse. I haven’t caused any harm to the horse since the paints I have used are washable,” he says, adding, “Some cops around here have also dressed up as Yamaraj, the god of death, to create awareness.

Option III:

NEW DELHI: Hit by the lockdown and faced with uncertainty, many people are looking to avail of the repayment relief that banks are offering. Although banks are yet to announce the details of the relief package and how it will work out, we do know that this is only a grace period and they are likely to charge interest for the unpaid amount.Missing two instalments could extend your loan by 6-10 months, or increase the EMI amount by 1.5%. The borrower may be given three options by the lender:One-time payment in June of the interest that accrues in April and MayAdd the interest to the outstanding loan and increase EMI for remaining monthsKeep the EMI unchanged but extend the loan tenure.The number of additional EMIs will depend on the age of the loan Let us assume a borrower took a home loan of Rs 50 lakh at 9% for 20 years. The EMI comes to Rs 44,986. If he wants to skip the next two EMIs (April and May), the table given here (see graphic) shows how the moratorium will impact his repayment schedule.Clearly, the longer the remaining tenure, the bigger is the impact. This is because the interest accounts for a larger portion of the EMI in the early years and progressively comes down. Even after the first year, the interest accounts for almost 80% of the EMI. But in the 19th year, the interest portion is less than 10% in the EMI.So, people with older loans taken 10-15 years ago will not feel the burden as much as someone with a new loan taken 2-3 years ago. Ironically, people with older loans may not really need the moratorium as much as those with younger loans.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74922808,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/missing-2-instalments-may-add-10-mths-to-loan/articleshow/74922212.cms

475,['1/04/2020'],450 delegates of Tablighi Jamaat from Tamil Nadu admitted in Delhi hospitals,"People being taken to an isolation facility after screening in Delhi

CHENNAI: Fifty people who attended a three-day Tablighi Jamaat conference at a mosque in Delhi tested positive for Covid-19 in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday triggering alarm across the country.

Tuesday saw the state’s Covid-19 count rise by 57 to 124 cases, the third highest after Maharashtra and Kerala, highlighting the threat of infection originating from the Tablighi Jamaat cluster.

The Centre and the governments of Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka are scrambling to prepare a national grid and map the footprints of at least 2,500 Tablighi Jamaat members who headed to their homes after two conferences, the last of which ended on March 23. Though most of them travelled to the southern states, these potential Covid-19 carriers have fanned out across the country, posing a nightmare for healthcare authorities. The Centre has asked all states and Union territories to trace and quarantine those who attended the Tablighi Jamaat conferences.

State health secretary Beela Rajesh said 300 of the 1,500 delegates from TN who went to the Delhi mosque were untraceable. She appealed to those ‘missing’ to come forward for screening. State chief secretary K Shanmugham said these people had switched off their phones and so the police were trying to trace their addresses. “We are doing all we can. About 400 people have remained in Delhi and the government there has screened and quarantined them,” he said. The Greater Chennai Corporation has sent 30 people, from various parts of the city, who took part in the conference, to hospitals for testing. District authorities all over the state too are identifying and screening those who went to the Delhi meet.

At least eight of those who went to Delhi have died of the infection — six from Telangana, and one each from Tamil Nadu and New Delhi.

Authorities believe they could have been infected by several missionaries from Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand, who transited through the TJ headquarters in west Nizamuddin and spread out across the country, including Tamil Nadu, on a religious mission in February and March.

The Telangana and AP governments have mobilized their health workers to track down 1,500 Muslims who participated in a threeday conference held earlier at the same Banglewali Masjid in west Nizamuddin from March 14. Sources in the Union government said these 1,500 delegates from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana took trains and flights back home. Mapping their journey and tracing those with whom they came in contact besides their families is a logistical nightmare.

At TJ’s Nizamuddin headquarters, teams of health staff and police set about fumigating the area. “All the 450 Tamil delegates are in hospitals in Delhi,” said the TJ HQ spokesman Thamin Ansari. There were 800 others from UP, Jharkhand, Haryana and Andaman & Nicobar Island. “While some are in hospitals, others have been housed in private apartments and schools,” said Ansari.

In Kashmir, 855 people (at least 167 attendees as well as people in contact with them) were being traced; only nine had been found.

Nearly 300 people from across Karnataka attended the congregation, state home minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Tuesday, creating a “dangerous situation” in the state. Only 26 of the delegates (all from Bidar) have been traced, which leaves the remaining attendees and a vast network of their contacts. A Tumakuru preacher who attended the meet is learned to have had direct contact with at least 82 people, including 45 family members. The 26 delegates who were traced all tested negative, state health minister B Sreeramulu tweeted.

In UP, police in 18 districts had tracked down 128 of the 157 people from the state who had attended the congregation. While 120 were found to be quarantined in Delhi, eight were traced to their native villages and cities and have been quarantined at home. A search is on for the remaining 29. The police also traced 95 others who had attended Jamaat event and were not on the list of 157 from UP shared by the Delhi police.

A total of 185 people from Maharashtra had attended the congregation, officials said. Maharashtra minority development minister Nawab Malik, however, said he had learned “from the media” that 109 people from his state had attended. “I have asked officials to find out how many actually attended it.

481,['1/04/2020'],"World economy will go into recession, says report","NEW DELHI: The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of global income in trillions of dollars and this will spell serious trouble for developing countries , with the likely exception of China and the possible exception of India, a top UN agency has said.“The economic fallout from the shock is ongoing and increasingly difficult to predict, but there are clear indications that things will get much worse for developing economies before they get better,” UNCTAD secretarygeneral Mukhisa Kituyi said.The report said in two months since the virus began spreading beyond China, developing countries have taken an enormous hit in terms of capital outflows , growing bond spreads, currency depreciations and lost export earnings, including from falling commodity prices and declining tourist revenues.“On most of these measures the impact has cut deeper than in 2008. With domestic economic activity now feeling effects of the crisis, UNCTAD is not optimistic about the kind of rapid rebound witnessed in many developing countries between 2009 and 2010,” the report said.Prices of commodities, on which many developing countries heavily depend for their foreign exchange, have also dropped precipitously since the crisis began. The overall price decline has been 37% this year, according to the report. In recent days, advanced economies and China have put together massive government packages which, according to the Group of 20 leading economies (G20), will extend a $5 trillion lifeline to their economies. This represents an unprecedented response to an unprecedented crisis, which will attenuate extent of the shock physically, economically and psychologically, it said.The full details of these stimulus packages are yet to be unpacked, but an initial assessment by UNCTAD estimates that they will translate to a $1 trillion to $2 trillion injection of demand into the major G20 economies and a two percentage point turnaround in global output.UNCTAD proposed a fourpronged strategy that could begin to translate expressions of international solidarity into concrete action. This should include a $1-trillion liquidity injection, a kind of helicopter money drop for those being left behind through reallocating existing special drawing rights at IMF and adding a new allocation that will need to go considerably beyond the 2009 allocation made in response to the global financial crisis.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74930431,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-351506,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/international-business/world-eco-will-go-into-recession-says-report/articleshow/74922249.cms

CHANDIGARH: The UT administration on Tuesday announced that all driving licences, registration and fitness certificates and other motor vehicle documents that expired from February 1 will now be valid till June 30.

UT adviser Manoj Parida said the decision was taken after the Centre's advisory due to countrywide lockdown. Accordingly, all these documents which could not be renewed due to the lockdown will be treated valid till June 30, he said.

In an advisory, the ministry of road transport and highways had asked all states and union territories to consider documents like driving licences, permits and registration papers as valid till June 30. A week into the lockdown, the decision was taken to facilitate people facing difficulties in renewing the validity of these motor vehicle documents due to closure of the state-run transport offices. The documents include permits, driving licence, registration or any other document issued under the Motor Vehicle Rules, according to the advisory.

The Centre had requested all states to implement the advisory in 'letter and spirit' so that people, transporters and organisations providing essential services do not get harassed.

The administration has also ordered to shut the Registration and Licensing Authority (RLA) office in Sector 17 till further orders. Earlier, the closure orders were till March 31. The RLA authorities have already suspended regular driving test at Children Traffic Park in Sector 23.

In 2019, 41,528 vehicleswere registered at the RLA. A senior RLA official said on an average they auction four series of vehicle registration numbers in a year, along with leftover number of previous years. In one series there are 10,000 numbers. So, on an average, around 40,000 to 45,000 vehicles are registered every year in Chandigarh, he said.

CHENNAI: Nearly 100 crew members, including 30 scientists , who have been on scientific missions on board ocean research vessels have decided to stay put till the 21-day lockdown in the country ends. They are on board four ships belonging to the Chennai-based National Institute of Ocean Technology ( NIOT ) which set sail more than three weeks ago to map the seabed, study samples and deploy tsunami warning systems on the east and west coasts.

NIOT director M A Atmanand said scientists on Sagar Nidhi , Sagar Manjusha, Sagar Anveshika and Sagar Tara have been collecting different kinds of data. ""Staying there is safer than coming to land. We have instructed all our four ships to return around April 14,"" he said. One of the ships has two scientists from the US, who would continue with their research as they cannot fly back to their country due to the suspension of flights.

Sagar Nidhi was expected arrive in the Goa coast on Tuesday, and the other three ships were to return on Thursday. Sagar Nidhi, carrying 25 scientists, had deployed the tsunami system in the Arabian Sea. D Rajasekhar, head, vessel management cell, NIOT, said. ""The other ships are stocked with supplies till mid-April. Even if they are to come to land, the crew members will have to go into quarantine for 15 days. So, it's better to be there,"" he said.

Onboard tools mapping seabed

S agar Manjusha and the recently commissioned Sagar Anveshika are carrying out scientific measurements and collecting data in the Bay of Bengal as part of various projects.

The onboard instruments have been mapping the seabed besides gathering and testing water samples.

Sagar Tara, another new ship, is carrying out bathymetric surveys (mapping underwater features) for setting up desalination plants in the Lakshadweep Islands.

“Recently, we supplied three of our ships with rations and water in the outer anchorage of ports in Chennai and Beypore in Kerala,” Rajasekhar said.

Public health minister Rajesh Tope was in conversation with Bhavika Jain and Sumitra DebRoy on Tuesday on Maharashtra's preparedness to tackle the coronavirus crisis. Excerpts:

As on Tuesday, the state has recorded 235 cases and 10 deaths, and the numbers seem to be growing every day. Has the government drawn up any projections?

We are expecting numbers to spike, it is bound to happen. We are working so that severity of cases can be minimised. There are 1,500 ventilators and nearly 7,800 beds in government hospitals kept aside for Covid-19 cases. Besides, the state can take over private hospitals and use their facilities, if such a situation arises.

There have been several cases now where patients don't seem to have a travel history or a contact. Are these instances of community transmission?

It's true that in some cases, we have not been able to reach the source of infection. But we can't say that community transmission has begun. I am sure these people came in contact with someone with a travel history which detailed contact tracing would have revealed.

Do you think we are going the last mile to trace contacts and quarantine them? Kerala has quarantined over a lakh while the state has only 20,000 under observation.

There is room for improvement. Now that we have locked down the state, our focus is on contact tracing. We have pooled in people from all health programmes to join hands with ASHA workers. We now plan to include even 4,000 volunteers who work towards malaria prevention.

Unlike states like Kerala that has tested over 7,500, Maharashtra has barely tested 6,300 people despite reporting the second highest number of cases in India.

Currently 21 laboratories, including 13 government and eight private, are testing 700-800 samples every day. The existing labs have not reached their optimum capacity, which is nearly 2,300 samples. Reason our numbers are less is that we are sticking to the Centre's testing protocol, where only people with travel history, primary contacts and those with symptoms are tested.

The state plans to scale up testing, but how will laboratories come up overnight and where will manpower come from?

We plan to start testing in all government medical colleges, for which the Indian Council of Medical Research's permission has been sought. As for manpower, we have got on board microbiologists who are being trained by the National Institute of Virology, Pune for 3-4 days. Aurangabad and Dhule, for instance, have already started labs. Nanded, Solapur and Gondia will soon follow.

Doctors and nurses in many government hospitals have spoken of shortage of protective gear like PPEs, masks and gloves. Does the state have enough?

We have adequate PPEs for those directly treating coronavirus patients. However, complaints of shortage are coming as doctors and nurses from other departments have started demanding PPEs. If that's the situation, we will never have enough. The medical fraternity should be assured that we are procuring more. We are also looking at airlifting them directly from a factory in China.

New York has extended the lockdown by a month, even the UK Prime Minister has hinted that it may be extended. Are there talks to extend the lockdown in the country?

So far there have been no talks about extending the lockdown. Even if a decision is taken, it will be from Delhi after considering the number of cases in the country on April 14. In case Prime Minister Modi takes a decision to extend the lockdown, we will have to follow his decision and may not be able to deviate from it.

What's your message to doctors?

It's important that non-Covid patients don't flood hospitals, especially when the flu season is around. If they don't have access to N95 masks, doctors can use three-ply masks which are recommended by the scientific community and continue to treat.
