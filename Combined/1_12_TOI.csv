0,['12/01/2020'],Why you must keep your mitochondria healthy,"You can buy all the creams, pills and medicines in the world but if your mitochondria (known as the powerhouses of the cell) is not functioning the right way, you will still age rapidly, your skin will look dull, you will put on weight, lose hair, feel tired and be prone to conditions like Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Autism, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue syndrome, dementia, diabetes, Huntington’s disease, migraine and a lot more.While medicines, creams, pills, and all external aids can be used as a crutch, if you are looking to truly prevent or repair your body – you need to start focusing on cell and cellular health. Take “lack of energy” as an example since it’s something we often complain about. We run behind coffee, tea, energy drinks, sugar, carbs to charge us up forgetting that our body is capable of generating its own energy. Every single cell is just like a battery and has the power to light up a bulb. This is enough energy to get us through a day – be it physical, mental, workouts, digestion, etc. What is the source of this energy? It’s the mitochondria!It is a component present in each of these trillion cells and that’s where this energy is generated. They are called the powerhouse of the cell as these tiny cellular factories create energy for the whole body. In each of these mitochondria, there are about 18,000- 20,000 assembly lines that take up nutrition and oxygen as raw materials and break it down to a molecule of energy called ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate). ATP is the energy currency and without it, we cannot survive. It’s what gives our body to perform all the tasks right from digestion to immune system function. Lesser the number of ATP molecules, weaker is the body; and a weak body is susceptible to all the viruses, bacteria and pathogens. Our immune system derives energy to function and stay strong through ATP as well.Unfortunately, most of us do not generate the energy our body is capable of producing due to our faulty lifestyle – unhealthy eating, no exercise, lack of sleep, unmanaged stress. Ever felt sleepy and lethargic after a junk meal? Now know it’s because your body has an excess of carbon dioxide in the system. Carbon dioxide makes us feel sleepy, tired and sluggish. This is fatigue caused by junk eating at a cellular level. To add to this, there is an increase in free radicals and that’s closely connected to inflammation – the root cause of most diseases right from diabetes, obesityto cancer.So, it’s literally up to us to control inflammation in our body by choosing the right foods so that the mitochondria don’t have to work too hard.- Fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes and whole grains – are all your cells need to function the right way.Do not deprive your cell and mitochondria of these essentials just because you want to go on a fad diet. It’s thatsimple and there are no short cuts to good health.- Omega 3 (flaxseeds or fish)- Dietary fibre in adequate amounts.- HIIT (high-intensity interval training), strength training- Say no to sugar, refined flour, and all the junk food.- More cruciferous vegetables (kale, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage)- Quality sleep because those tiny factories need rest-Bone broth- Making lifestyle changes and preventing collateral damage if you are on statins. If you are on a statin, also add a selenium and CoQ10 supplement to preserve mitochondrial health.Each of us is a composition of trillions of cells in our bodies. We were born from single-cell and now our health depends on the individual health of each and every cell- Excess exposure to sunlight and at the wrong time as it could damage cell DNA- Tobacco consumption and smoking- Motor skill dysfunction and autism could also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction.- Diabetes (both type 1 and type 2)",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73184397,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-627027/73184397.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/diet/why-you-must-keep-your-mitochondria-healthy/articleshow/73184397.cms
1,['12/01/2020'],Do you have an inner makeover urge?,"Do you have an inner makeover urge? January is the best time for it. At the turn of every year — and a decade this time around — we are overwhelmed by the desire to renovate our bodies, our faces, our mind, our ambitions – in short, our lives. You can join a transformation class or have a transformation teacher, but here are some ways you can transform your inner self without asking for help. The ultimate makeover is nothing but a change of mindset. Inculcate some microhabits.Get out of the mindset that you ‘have to get through’ the day. Tell yourself the coming hours are filled with open-ended potential for you to take action that will change your life forever.Getting rejected is no big deal: Every day, reach out to one or two people who you’d like to work with or want in your life, even if you are certain they would have no reason to respond. Take chances because without hope, there’s no glory.It could be a potential employer, a client, a book agent, a director or a producer etc. You might not hear back at first, but eventually, you will get a response from someone. And you have nothing to lose.If you want to change your life, you need to start considering the needs and wants of your future self over the ones you have right now. Prioritising how you feel and what you want in the moment is what lead you here. Start working on your future self.To make this makeover last long, we have to start from the core and work outwards. Spiritual coach and author of The Only Way Out is Within, Rohini Singh, uses her Zentangle workshops to bring change: “It is an easy-to-learn method of creating beautiful images from repetitive patterns. As an art form it’s fascinating, fun and relaxing. Zentangle increases focus and creativity and provides an increased sense of personal well being,” she says.The fun quotient: Taking on a fresh project or a new pet, a new sport or club or group, can be the most invigorating thing you can do for yourself. Joining a curling team might not make you look better on the outside, but the camaraderie will go a long way to making you glow. Says psychologist Dr Saloni Singh, “Being in a group, learning something, makes you grow inwards and takes you closer to your dreams.”How can you do it? Inner makeover has more impact when you join an activity and engage. Never stop exploring.Your intuition speaks to you every day. Every time you ask yourself a question, your intuition sends you an answer. Our inability to accept those answers make us hold ourselves back. Listen to yourself harder.Don’t ignore the warnings of the heart and the gut.Daydreaming... is the key to awakening and developing inner vision. It is a powerful tool that allows you to access your deepest state of consciousness, strengthen it and come through more clearly into your daily life.Find time to go off on a little adventure. Your eyes can be open or closed. Do something that makes you feel alive. As your daydreams become clearer, your psychic vision will improve too.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73184590,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-902975/73184590.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/de-stress/do-you-have-an-inner-makeover-urge/articleshow/73184571.cms
2,['12/01/2020'],Make these small changes to stay healthy,"When it comes to most aspects of our lives, we tend to overlook the smaller things and focus on the bigger ones instead. This attitude even carries over to our health. We have the tendency to ignore the tiny things that are affecting our health and only pay attention when something big comes up. But it doesn’t always work that way. The smaller things we’re ignoring could add up and be the cause of the big problem, which is something you would’ve been able to stop much earlier, had you paid attention. So, in an effort to be more cautious of the little things that are messing with your health, here are five things you should pay attention to.People who go to sleep late tend to be more stressed out than those who are early sleepers. Those of you who go to bed post-midnight are more susceptible to suffer from negative and stressful thoughts, which in turn, will delay you from sleeping even longer. And the stress, coupled with the lack of sleep, can mess with your body in the long run.For a lot of people, the commute to college or work can span over an hour or so. And unfortunately, such long commutes daily can adversely affect your health. You are more prone to fatigue and exhaustion, stress and other health issues. While there’s not much we can do about this one — unless a location change is somehow possible — it is important to take this aspect into account when you cannot pinpoint where all your stres tsems from...Possibly the worst thing we’re all doing to our body is constantly consuming processed foods, which causes weight gain, messes up your blood sugar and immune system, and can cause heart diseases. Basically, we cannot stress how bad processed foods are for your health, so try and avoid them as much as you can.Whether you’re extreme dieting or exercising like a maniac, in your urge to get fitter, you might actually be putting your body at risk. Quite often, when one gets caught up with fitness and dieting, they tend to push themselves too hard. And this not only results in stress, it canaffect your mood, cause fatigue and stop your body from functioning properly. So the next time you’re trying to get fit, don’t push your body too much because it will do more harm than good.

5,['12/01/2020'],Be a trail blazer,"In his recent article titled “The new workwear: has the suit finally died?” in The Guardian, journalist Richard Godwin laments the death of smart dressing. Now a freelancer, this former wearer of suits and hoarder of ties mentions how he finally took his suit out for a university reunion. He writes: “Everyone remarked on how they never wore suits and ties these days. Everyone spent the evening complimenting one another. And everyone, I sensed, enjoyed looking their unashamed best. What if you never had the chance to look your best again? What kind of future would that be?” Well, till the time the blazer is around, smart dressing is not likely to go away.Workplace dressing has witnessed a literal loosening up of ties for dress codes. Earlier in 2019, Goldman Sachs — known for spiffily dressed execs — announced a move to a flexible dress code. Even the most formal sectors like finance are taking a cue from the tech companies and following er…suit. Enter: blazers, sports coats or jackets that help you look proper without being ‘propah’. Prem Dewan, retail head of an Italian luxury menswear brand says that with performance and work efficiency placed at a higher pedestal, many companies leave room for comfortable dressing for men and women. “Most millennials have stopped wearing suits and are into comfortable yet well-co-ordinated ensembles. Blazers are now worn with denims. For a formal occasion, people wear blazers with a pocket square and a tie,” he adds.Just like the little black dress for women, the blazer is a wardrobe staple for men now. Menswear designer Kunal Anil Tanna says that over the years, blazers have transformed and been reimagined by designers. “What began as a less formal substitute to the suit has become a style statement and a wardrobe necessity,” he adds. Blazers now use various design elements like layered panels, collar styles, mock layered, bomber jacket styles, shackets, trench styles and in a variety of fabrics such as linen, cotton, jacquard, velvet and more. Tanna notes that depending on textures and patterns, there’s a blazer for almost every occasion.This year, if there’s one blazer style that you have to get, make sure it’s the double-breasted jacket, which has evolved over the last century. Compact, more snug-fitted and most importantly redirected as a single-breasted cut is the new look. Dewan says, “The new slim-cut sits close to the body without being overly restrictive on movement. And the mid-weight material makes it wearable all year round.”Menswear designer Sandeep Gonsalves has noticed men’s interest in personal style peaking. “The younger generation is more fashionable and on point with the ongoing trends and a blazer comes with an advantage of stylistic versatility,” he says.Gonsalves says that a blazer is definitely one piece of clothing that reflects his personal style. “It is essential for a blazer to be well-fitted for a clean look. If someone wants to upgrade their wardrobe, the best option would be to go for a bespoke blazer as it gives you the liberty to choose from the quality of fabric to the colour, cuts and garment details which will take your look a notch above than a regular off-the-rack blazer,” he adds.Smart casuals as a trend has picked up. Stylist Harsh Khullar says, “While most blazers can be styled casually, most men keep playing between the classic and the casual. Wear it with a traditional shirt-pants combo, or with a golf T-shirt with denim. A good investment will be a classic one or two-button navy blue or black blazer.” Time to blaze up 2020 style.-Opt for a solid colour blazer and team it with chinos, basic white shirt and sneakers for the day. For the night, change your footwear to a formal one like loafers or a lace-up, and add a pocket square. Or add a bow tie or a tie-One can never go wrong with a well-fitted black blazer-Understand its functionality. If you have a long commute, opt for a fabric that can endure wear and tear. If you leave your blazer at the office overnight, go for a lighter fabric that is breathable-Double-breasted style, emergence of prints, lighter hues and textures is trendy-Blazers in rich fabric like velvet, vibrant and pastel hues and textured fabrics are popular-Travel blazers are in.

6,['12/01/2020'],The rise of ‘Japandi’ style,"For quite sometime now, design sensibilities have had two guiding lights: one from Scandinavia and the other from Japan. Both are known for their minimalistic sensibilities. Now, the two have joined forces to start a design movement that’s taking over the world of interiors by storm. Known as ‘Japandi’, this look takes the modern flair of Scandinavian design and combines it with the timeless elegance of a Japanese aesthetic to create a style that brings together the best of both worlds.The idea is that people want to make everyday life simple and sustainable – from furniture to tableware to interiors, everything is about clean lines, neutral tones and natural textures. Clean and calm come together in Japandi. Both sensibilities value simplicity and functionality, a love of natural materials, and a deep respect for craftsmanship. Both appreciate things made with hand, made with care and made to last. Both are exercises in minimalism and emphasise on function-driven spaces defined by a handful of statement pieces. According to experts, Japandi is all set to become a design movement, a classic that will be in style for decades. What’s more? It’s an adaptable look that can be dressed up or down to suit your individuality.THE JAPANDI LOOKIt’s a union of East and West. The idea is based on the combined aesthetic of simplicity and imperfection. The Japanese side is in charge of odd shapes and patterns, while the Nordic draws inspiration from moderation. Together, they create a unique, balanced and calm look. The key is that the styling should be simple, pared back, using only a few carefully considered and thoughtfully selected pieces. Spaces should be de-cluttered and airy, allowing for a peaceful flow.SCENTS OF THE SEASONIt’s important to fill your home with the right smell of the season, too. A fragrant bowl of potpourri — in a wintry scent such as cinnamon, pine — can do the trick and will fill your home with seasonal cheer. Display the arrangement prominently on a casual winter table centrepiece.GO FOR CONTRASTNordic design loves light, natural hues, natural woods while Japanese style is known for richer tones. Most Japandi rooms start with a darker base, usually a saturated, neutral shade and is combined with dark wood and forest green planters. Big sofas, soft throws, clever storage and some personal touches – it’s the hygge life with places to snuggle.BRING IN SOFTNESSCreate a super-cosy feel in a family room by styling it with layers of soft furnishings like oversized cushions and furry throws. Invest in a cosy rug that adds colour and pattern. Lighting is another easy way to make living spaces feel inviting and intimate.ACCESSORISE SMARTLYSurround your home with aesthetic statement pieces to ensure the design feels intentional and warm. A sense of cosiness also comes from being surrounded by plenty of personal feel-good objects in the living room, family pictures, fun vases, plants and books. Open shelving helps you express your family’s personality, whether you’re colour-blocking your books, creating clusters of objects or having a gallery wall full of your favourite pictures and photographs.STAY TOASTYSheepskin and velvet is the epitome of cosy winter home decor. It instantly brings warmth to any room. Place a sheepskin rug or a chaise to provide a toasty spot to tuck chilly toes while reading or relaxing.COLOUR ME HAPPYThe colours of Japandi are soft tones of light greys, pale pinks, baby blues and pastel greens. You can beat the bluesby infusing your spaces with pops of cheery colour. A bright coffee cup, vase or a boldly patterned pillow will do the trick, and will ensure your neutral spaces don’t look stark and cold. The best bit is that bright elements can also last into the spring and summerDECLUTTERING IS MUSTThe implementation of this style means to be aware that every single piece of furniture, accessory and detail, no matter how small it is, has to have its place and function. The key look is to remove the extras making decluttering almost mandatory.Use ceramics to add curves: Balance out the stark Scandi lines of a coffee table or dining table by introducing handmade vases and vessels in earthy tones and glazes.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73169363,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-136479/73169363.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/home-garden/the-rise-of-japandi-style/articleshow/73169295.cms
7,['12/01/2020'],First aid tips for dogs,"Always have your vet’s number and emergency contact. Provide first aid immediately, and do this in consultation with your vet. Rush to the nearest emergency animal healthcare provider in case of injury.A: Yes. First aid is an emergency procedure to save the life of your pet, so anybody who observes the injury or trauma first can provide aid. You may request for basic first aid training from your vet, which will be quite useful at times of emergency. It should comprise a restraining equipment as your pet may bite you owing to its pain. Call your vet and explain the nature of injury or illness and ask for advice regarding first aid. Rush to your vet as quickly as possible, but don’t panic.A: This is the most commonly-encountered emergency condition in dogs. Many a time, pets may be left unattended, at homes or in farms, they may succumb to accidental consumption of harmful and toxic substances: rat poisons, toilet cleaners, fertilisers, batteries, harmful drugs. As a first measure, read the product label of the consumed poisonous substance, which provides the details of the antidote. Your presence of mind in letting your vet know about the ingested poison can save your pet’s life. If your pet vomits the substance, it is a good sign. S/he now needs supportive therapy. Your vet will do the needful. If the substance comes in contact with the eyes or skin of your dog, wash it with clean, plain water. Take your pet to the doctor immediately afterwards.A: It may happen after ingesting some poisonous substance. It’s important not to frighten your pet. S/he should be kept very calm. Hold a towel or blanket and wait for a minute. In case the seizure continues, wrap the pet with a towel or blanket; you can protect him/her with some cushions. Keep your pet away from sharp and harmful objects which may cause further injury.A: Take your pet to the doctor immediately. If the pet is bleeding, try to stop the flow of blood. Burn injuries can cause serious tissue damage. Cool down the burned area by gently pouring cold water mixed with some potassium permanganate (if available). Also, use ice pack as a cold compress to cool down the injured area. In such a situation, always consult your vet and rush to the clinic, as soon as possible.A: In certain conditions of illness, your pet may stop breathing or it may be very shallow and deep. In such situations, provide the type of external breathing known as ‘rescue breathing’. Perform this external breathing process by shutting the dog’s mouth with your hand and pumping air into the pet’s nostrils directly by your mouth until you see his chest expanded. Once the chest expands, continue ‘rescue breathing’ once in every 4-5 seconds.Dr Khaja Mohteshamuddin, veterinary surgeonwww.dogsandpupsmagazine.com; www.facebook.com/DogsandpupsmagAre you a proud petparent?

MUMBAI: A total of 110 Indian passengers, all Dawoodi Bohra pilgrims headed to holy shrines in Iraq, were stopped by immigration officials at the Mumbai international airport from boarding a 2.30am Iraqi Airways flight to Najaf on Saturday. Five of them had already cleared immigration checks and the others were on their way to the immigration counters after having got their boarding passes when the incident took place.Those who had cleared immigration were brought back from the boarding gates as airport officials asked the airline to stop issuing passes post-midnight, apparently after receiving instructions that travel to Iraq was ""unsafe"" for Indians.A January 8 circular from the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said it had suspended immigration clearance to passengers travelling to Iraq. ""Immigration clearance for Iraq to both ECR (immigration clearance required) and ECNR (immigration clearance not required) passport holders ( sic) immigrants is not to be given with immediate effect till further orders,"" the letter stated. Aviation regulator DGCA had also advised all Indian carriers to avoid flying over Iraq, Iran and the waters of Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman in view of heightened tensions in the Middle East.Additional commissioner of police, special branch II, Supriya Patil-Yadav, told TOI, ""An instruction from MHA said travelling to Iraq is unsafe. We had to stop the passengers from boarding the flight. With a fluid situation, safety of Indians is priority.""However, immigration officials at Ahmedabad airport had stopped passengers from travelling to Iraq on Thursday, a day after the MEA notice. Passengers there were informed on phone and spared the ordeal of reaching the airport, while those from Mumbai said they had to wait at the airport until 4am to get their already checked-in luggage back.Families of those who got immigration cancellation stamps said they were worried questions might be raised in future at the time of obtaining security clearances, especially for travel to many Western countries.An aviation industry source said immigration authorities have stopped all airlines going to Najaf and Karbala from taking Indian passengers.Iraqi Airways Flight IA 442, which the pilgrims were to take, flies from Mumbai to Najaf twice a week (Tuesday and Saturday) and from Ahmedabad on Thursday and Sunday. Iraqi Airways alone operates between Mumbai and Najaf; half a dozen flights of other carriers to Iraq from Mumbai via Dubai and Sharjah have stopped flying to Najaf and Baghdad.A senior official at Iraqi Airways said until 11.30pm on Friday, immigration officials kept saying they would clear passengers going to Iraq, so most passengers were issued boarding passes. ""They kept talking to higher officials in Mumbai and Delhi and one senior officer told us to take an undertaking from passengers that they were travelling at their own risk. We got passengers to sign this undertaking. But then suddenly we were told they would not be allowed to travel,"" said the airline official, requesting anonymity.Some pilgrims who were apprehensive over the past few days about whether they would get to go at all said they were told by the airline that if they failed to report to the airport in time, they would not get a refund either. ""My wife and I took a flight from Indore, where we live, to Mumbai to reach the airport in time, only to discover we were blocked,"" said Abdeali Rangwala.Abuzar Sakharwala, another passenger who, along with his wife, reached the airport at 10.30pm on Friday, said most passengers had checked in when they were informed of instructions from immigration officials not to proceed further.

18,['12/01/2020'],"Big, bold and beautiful: ‘Tis the season for oversized bags","The fashion world witnesses handbags shrinking and expanding with every passing season. And while we all saw the sudden reign of tiny bags last year – those impractical biscuit-sized hand accessories did us no good – and unless you have an entire team of people just to carry your stuff around, you need a bag that accommodate your belongings. If fashion shows and Instagram are anything to go by, big, slouchy, can-hold-everything-you-own kind of bags are now in vogue. Brands are coming up with stylish and chic versions of gigantic totes and sack-like shoulder bags that are now available in all kinds of quirky shapes and colours. So go on, bag one while you can!Oversized bags are all about practicality and comfort. To style them the right way, pair them with casual clothes and underplay the other accessories. Oversized bags are for relaxed, fun outings, so keep your outfit casual and comfortable. ""Avoid carrying oversized bags to formal events and opt for a slick, minimalistic approach for the rest of your look,"" explains Dhruv Adiya Dave, celebrity stylist, adding, ""Carry it with a T-shirt, jeans and simple heels. Let the bag grab all the attention."" ""For day events, opt for a boho look and carry a bag with heavy mirror work or embroidery,"" says Dhruv. ""Overised bags are in trend right now. I recommend pairing them up with your resort wear as they're ideal for vacations,"" adds Preetham Jukalker, designer and celebrity stylist.Stylists advice against carrying oversized totes to formal events. Office interviews are okay, but when it comes to parties, bigger is definitely not better. However, if you're someone who likes to carry your entire makeup kit, few changes of clothes and your hangover antidotes to parties, there are plenty of oversized slings and clutches to choose from. Dubbed as 'The Pouch' by a luxury fashion brand, oversized clutches are meant to be held in the crook of your arm, and can go well with dresses, jumpsuits, pant-suits and evening gowns. ""Oversized clutches and evening bags go best with a pair of formal pant-suits or with classic LBDs,"" says Saloni.For winters, designers recommend styling these bags with oversized trench coats or blazers. ""For an ideal winter look, wear a pair of high-waisted jeans, tan boots and an oversized coat. The oversized bag will add a chic touch to this outfit,"" says Saloni Sayal, founder of a luxury bag manufacturing company. Go for nude or basic colours and match the bag with your boots or your beanie for a put-together look. Since the bag will be the biggest accessory you'll be carrying, the colour you choose will define your outfit. For a bold outfit, go for a bright red or a pink tote bag, but keep the rest of your outfit neutral. And for a completely toned down outfit, just mix-and-match nude shades like camel, tan, off-white or even some pastels. If your coat or blazer is a bright pop of colour, it is best to keep the bag's colour basic and understated.Since oversized bags are multi-purpose and can be carried almost everywhere, you should look at it as an investment and buy one that suits your requirements the best. Go for a brand that you trust and make sure the material is sturdy and of good quality. ""No matter what your budget is, make sure your bag is versatile enough to be carried across seasons and trends. Opt for neutral colours like black, cream, nude or tan so that they can go with most outfits,"" suggests Dhruv. When a luxury fashion brand posted pictures of oversized bags on their Instagram, one follower commented, ""The fashion half of my brain is in love and the other half is like I'm gonna miss seven calls before I find my phone in there"". If you don’t want to spend the whole day trying to find your stuff in your sack, Preetham suggests investing in a bag that has multiple compartments and pockets so that you can keep your stuff organised. Lastly, the purpose of these gigantic bags is to be able to carry a lot of stuff around, which means your bag will end up being heavy. So, it's essential to buy one that has broad handles so that you don't end up with sore shoulders.A general tip to keep in mind while matching a bag with your outfit is to pay attention to the hardware. In a perfect choice of outfit, the hardware and the detailing on your bag should match the buckles of you shoe, your belt and the rest of the accessories like earrings and necklace. For example, don't carry a bag that has rose-gold handles with silver earrings, or a bag that has silver embroidery with golden belt buckles. The same metal can also have different shades, so, if you're going for all gold accessories, make sure you're not sporting dull gold with bright gold, for example. Keep the shades as similar as possible.Don’t fill your oversized bag up to the brim. If you're carrying the bag as a fashion statement more than you are for utility, make sure to keep it light and let it dangle by your side for an effortlessly stylish look.There are many luxury brands that are selling mini bags as charms. If you've jumped on the micro bags bandwagon, but don't find them practical enough to be carried on a regular basis, a great way to put them to use is to carry them as charms for your oversized bags.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73194743,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-352806/73194743.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/style-guide/big-bold-and-beautiful-tis-the-season-for-oversized-bags/articleshow/73194703.cms

Mamata Banerjee met PM Modi at Kolkata's Raj Bhawan on Saturday (ANI)

Kolkata: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee joined her party’s anti-citizenship law protests after meeting PM Narendra Modi at Raj Bhavan for about 20 minutes on Saturday afternoon, where she conveyed her “opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens”.Banerjee walked to the protest venue, less than 100 metres from Raj Bhavan, after “meeting the Prime Minister of the country as the chief minister of the state” as she sought to pull off a fine balancing act between her roles as one of the most strident opponents of the new citizenship law and the CM of a state.“I have expressed our continued opposition to CAA, NRC and urged the PM to do a rethink on the issue,” she said, adding, “But it is also my constitutional obligation to meet the country’s PM and President when they come to Kolkata. My colleague, minister Firhad Hakim, received the PM at the airport.”I have told the PM about the Rs 28,000 crore that the Centre owes the state plus the Rs 7,000 crore we have spent on post-(Cyclone) Bulbul rehabilitation,"" she said.Banerjee, aware of the ground reality where a misstep may have unintended consequences, has been insisting on ""sarba dharma samanway"" and using traditional prayer symbols like conch shells and kansar-ghanta (gong-and-bell) in her anti-CAA-NRC campaign to deflect ""BJP's unfounded criticism"" of her ""vote-bank politics"". She has also referred to Swami Vivekananda's vision of India and reached out to Ganga Sagar pilgrims and temple authorities to preempt the BJP's ""misappropriation of religion"".On Saturday, however, Banerjee also had to take guard against anti-CAA-NRC protesters' apprehensions of her going ""soft on the cause"". She went back to the Esplanade dharna site a second time in the evening and, after an intense face-off with non-Trinamool, anti-CAA-NRC protesters that lasted a few minutes, accused them of ""trying to fish in troubled waters"" and being ""BJP stooges"". ""I do not need any certificate about the sincerity of my cause from anyone,"" she said.""I have led the Singur stir and made the government give back land to farmers. I have championed the fight against custodial deaths,"" she said, invoking ""student power"" and asking the Trinamool Chhatra Parishad to reach out to colleges and involve students in the anti-CAA-NRC stir. ""I came to politics from the student movement. Let students take the lead. We will take the back seat,"" Banerjee said.Banerjee initially tried to reason with Jadavpur University students, who formed the bulk of the non-Trinamool protesters at Esplanade, that a showdown between anti-CAA-NRC forces would end up harming the larger cause. But, with the Trinamool ""CAA-CAA chhi-chhi (shame-shame)"" slogans being met with ""azaadi"" slogans, cops intervened to separate the Trinamool and non-Trinamool protesters' blocs. Banerjee finally called off the dharna around 9.40pm.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209256,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57844,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/mamata-calls-non-tmc-caa-protesters-bjp-stooges/articleshow/73209248.cms
20,['12/01/2020'],JNUSU OK with registration if hostel fee hike rolled back,"This story is from January 12, 2020

JNUSU President Aishe Ghosh along with other students during a press conference on Saturday

NEW DELHI: In a breakthrough that could expedite the process of registration for the winter semester, the JNU Students' Union said on Saturday that it was ready to allow registration but with riders, including a rollback of hiked hostel fees. It was earlier decided that UGC would pay the service and utility charges but the hostel fees remain a sticking point.

However, the lack of trust between the JNU administration and union persists and the latter made it clear that it won't allow a security audit of hostels to check for any unauthorised students, guests or other outsiders on the campus. The audit is to be carried out by the wardens on request of the SHO, Vasant Kunj.

The union sees this as a punitive action against the students and in violation of the spirit of the ministry of human resource development's advice to the VC to be lenient and accommodative.

Addressing a press conference called to give their account of what happened on January 5 on campus, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh - who was injured in the attack and has also been named by Delhi police as a suspect- said: ""Registration with the hiked fees will not happen. We appeal to students to pay the academic registration fee but they won't pay the hostel fees. We don't accept any fee that is hiked and demand that another Inter-Hall Admi- nistration (IHA) meeting be called.""

The union said it has informed the MHRD about this condition today and asked it to communicate to the VC.

The union had earlier decided on a boycott of registration after it called for a strike on campus from October 28, 2019. This was when, at an IHA meeting, the hostel manual was passed which led to a hike in fees with some new charges added.

""Unless a meeting of IHA is called again, we will not call off our boycott,"" said JNUSU general secretary Satish Chandra Yadav.

""We are ready to pay the registration fees of Rs 120 (for research scholars) and Rs 108 (for BA and MA) and are taking one step forward,"" he said. The security audit of hostels is, however, being resisted. The administration had, in order to sanitise the hostels of unauthorised students, guests or outsiders, written a letter to senior wardens, asking them to conduct a check and report if any such person was detected.

""Despite MHRD asking the administration to be lenient, 300 students have had their registration blocked based on an inquiry going on against them. We told MHRD that we want a dialogue but registration cannot be stopped because of an inquiry,"" said Yadav.

Opposing this exercise, Ghosh said: ""We have elected hostel presidents and committee members, and if there is an audit, they should be given information prior to it. How can the same wardens and teachers who beat up students conduct an audit?""

She requested the hostel presidents to conduct general body meetings to oppose the audit.

21,['12/01/2020'],Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee cautions against fiscal tightening,"This story is from January 12, 2020

MUMBAI: With less than a month for Union Budget 2020, Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee cautioned against fiscal tightening, stating that the fiscal deficit has already been breached by a huge margin.

""Budget deficit numbers are a little bit imaginary so in that sense I do not think it is a big deal to breach it, and I would not be supporting fiscal tightening right now,"" said Banerjee. He was speaking at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai to mark the 25th anniversary of Pratham, an NGO he had worked with. His statement was in response to a question on whether the government can breach the fiscal deficit to support social sectors like healthcare and education.

The recommendations from the 2019 Nobel Economics Prize laureate highlights the challenges before the government, which is under pressure from rating agencies to maintain fiscal discipline amidst a call from a section of economists and industry to stimulate demand.

When asked about reports that a Rs 3,000 crore cut in allotments to education was proposed, Banerjee said it was a drop in the ocean. ""The federal government provides very little of the funding in education, that is a state subject. We need to better utilise what we have since we already have one of the best-paid teachers. We need to work on getting them to perform better,"" he said. He feels while the focus on building infrastructure to bring back the economy on track is not likely to affect education in terms of funding, it would take off attention from the sector. ""The real constraint is not money but attention. When people are worried about the macroeconomy, the attention to education would be lower which isn't a good thing,"" said Banerjee said.

Banerjee then spoke to a full auditorium about his work with Pratham and the role of evidence in the future of primary education. He said that despite the criticism of the Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT), evidence gathered from these tests help develop the next set of questions.

Commenting on the disparity in the primary education systems, he lauded the progress made by public schools in New Delhi. He said education institutes need more autonomy while deciding the syllabus and curriculum.

MUMBAI/PALGHAR: At least six persons were killed in a huge explosion at a chemical factory at Boisar in Maharashtra's Palghar district on Saturday evening, police officials said. Boisar is over 100 km away from Mumbai.

The under-construction plant of Ank Pharma, where the explosion took place, is located in a Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) area at Kolwade village, officials said.

The blast, which took place during the testing of some chemicals around 7.20 pm, was so huge that it was heard within a 15-km radius, and window panes of some houses in the surrounding area shattered, officials said.

The under-construction plant building collapsed after the explosion.

The rescue operation was underway till late at night. 7 persons received injuries, while one is said to be missing.

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced assistance of Rs 5 lakh each for the kin of the deceased, a statement from his office said.

The chief minister was monitoring the relief and rescue operation himself, it added.

A National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team had been called for rescue operations, officials said.

23,['12/01/2020'],17 countries to attend Raisina Dialogue this week,"This story is from January 12, 2020

NEW DELHI: External affairs minister S Jaishankar will play host to 17 ministers from across the world-from Russia and Iran to Latvia- here at the Raisina Dialogue . He is expected to hold bilateral meetings with 12 of them and pull-asides with the others.

Among key leaders will be Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Iranian Javad Zarif besides from Europe, South Africa and Tanzania among other nations. This time no heads of state or government will be present after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison pulled out last week to deal with the wildfires emergency in his country.

Prime minister Narendra Modi will attend the inaugural session but is unlikely to speak.

Bangladesh deputy foreign minister Shahriar Alam cancelled his visit on Saturday, saying he had to accompany Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on her visit to UAE. However, his cancellation at virtually the last moment stoked speculation that it might have to do with Dhaka's ""unhappiness"" over CAA-NRC process. In a statement issued, the Bangladesh foreign office said Alam did not have any bilateral meeting scheduled, he was only coming for the Raisina Dialogue.

GUWAHATI: The Centre's decision to notify CAA on Friday night has added fuel to fire with anti-CAA protesters intensifying their movement against the Act with renewed vigour.

""The government seems to be in a hurry. The Supreme Court is hearing our petitions challenging the Act on January 22 but the government could not wait for that and notified the Act. We are not accepting it anyway,"" said Aasu chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya, who held the state government equally responsible.

He added, ""On Thursday, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma went to New Delhi to meet Union home minister Amit Shah and the very next day the notification was issued. This shows that whatever the Centre is doing is in consultation with the state government.""

On Saturday, members of Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) took out a protest march to gherao the state secretariat here but were arrested immediately as a preventive measure. They were, however, released later. Students of Cotton University also hit the streets to oppose the Act and burnt the effigies of the Prime Minister, home minister and Sonowal.

Defying a ban on government employees to express their opinion and criticisize the government in violation of service rules, the Assam College Teachers' Association staged a demonstration here. The All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) continued with its anti-CAA protest meetings at Sadia, Guwahati, Nagaon and Jorhat. Aasu president Dipanka Nath said people of the state have to remain united against the government's move to notify the CAA and continue with their ongoing protests till the Act is repealed. The general secretary of the students' body, Luringjyoti Gogoi, said the legal fight along with other organisations in Assam will continue.

The mass anti-CAA protests in Assam completed one month on Thursday and there are no signs of any let-up. The Aasu has vowed to carry on until the Act is scrapped. The state government's attempts to douse the anti-CAA flames by announcing welfare schemes for different sections of society and providing financial assistance to satras and literary bodies have yielded no result so far.

Aasu leaders have made it clear that study, work, play and protest will continue hand-in-hand. ""We will not rest until the Act is scrapped. Students will simultaneously carry on their studies, the movement against CAA, and also play sports now,"" said Nath. in reference to the 3rd edition of Khelo India Youth Games, which kicked off here on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Dismissing concerns of increasing politicisation of the military in the country, Army chief General M M Naravane on Saturday asserted the Indian armed forces swore allegiance to the Constitution and fought to preserve the core values of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity enshrined in its preamble.

""We are an Army of the people and for the people of India. If we stick to the core values enshrined in the preamble and the fundamental rights, then we will not go wrong in the discharge of our duties. We are deployed on the border to secure for our people these core values,"" said Gen Naravane.

Previous Army chief General Bipin Rawat , who is now the chief of defence staff, had received flak from several quarters, including veterans, for crossing the line by taking a public stand against the ongoing anti-CAA protests.

Moreover, many serving military officers as well as veterans feel there has been an increasing trend in recent years to needlessly politicise the armed forces, from political leaders taking credit for cross-border strikes to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath dubbing the Indian Army as ' Modiji ki Sena ' at a poll rally last year.

But Gen Naravane made it clear that the armed forces were, and would remain, apolitical and secular in their nature, ethos and outlook. ""We all swear an allegiance to the Constitution, be it an officer or a jawan. We have taken the oath,"" he said.

Sonia Gandhi with other senior leaders during the CWC meeting on Saturday (PTI)

NEW DELHI: Backing the hostility to Citizenship (Amendment) Act on the grounds of ""constitutional validity and political morality"", Congress on Saturday demanded that the Modi government immediately withdraw CAA and also stop the process of National Population Register.

Congress Working Committee reiterated the party's strong opposition to CAA-NRC-NPR while throwing its full-throated support behind the nationwide protests. It said CAA and NRC have created an environment of fear among religious and linguistic minorities. Chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, the CWC condemned the Centre for refusing to allay the fears of people and for unleashing the ""state power to silence the voices of dissent"".

""The CWC cautions the government that its pursuit of divisive agenda with the sole objective of polarisation may give short-term political dividends but will create deep fissures in the society undermining national unity and social stability. That presents a serious challenge to internal security and makes India vulnerable to hostile external forces,"" it said in a statement.

Sonia Gandhi said that CAA has the ""sinister purpose"" to ""divide the Indian people on religious lines"". She dubbed NPR as ""disguised NRC"", a result of government's rethink in view of the ""disastrous results of the Assam NRC"".

With the demand for stoppage of CAA and NPR triggering speculations about what Congress would do in the states under it, AICC said it will not give any directive to states as the subject falls under the jurisdiction of ""state legislatures"".

27,['12/01/2020'],JNU violence: Probe team identifies 37 in WhatsApp group,"NEW DELHI: The Special Investigating Team probe into the January 5 violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University has identified 37 of the 60 members of 'Unity Against Left', a WhatsApp group that allegedly mobilised the assailants into attacking students and teachers.Of the identified, 12 were determined not to be affiliated to any political group. The people that SIT has identified will be asked to record their statements on how and when the group was formed. Like them, the nine students who were named by SIT on Friday will also be summoned for questioning.Among those spotted in the WhatsApp group, 10 were discovered not to be students of JNU and efforts are being made to trace them. While police pinpointed Manish Jangid, secretary, JNU ABVP, as being a part of the group, the latter claimed that he was added to the group by someone else. He maintained that he realised this only after switching on his phone in the evening.Questioning of some people yielded the information that the invite to join the group was sent through SMS. However, some of those who joined left within a few hours when violence broke out. However, the cops are likely to go after them to ascertain their roles in the mob attack. When the cops contacted some of the numbers that did not have names associated with them, they were either switched off or unreachable, but the investigators are tryingto track them individually.Meanwhile, police have asked hostel wardens in JNU to direct the students injured in the January 5 clashes to record their statements. A temporary office of the SIT has been set up on the campus to facilitate this. Police sources said there was a list of 34 students who suffered injuries. They had been instructed to appear before the SIT. While some responded over phone, none has personally gone to police.The sources explained that the statement of these students would provide crucial information to the investigators since other than mobile phone videos, no other evidence has been recovered, with the security cameras having been non-operational at the time. The police team has already questioned the security guards who were on duty when the mob entered the university as well as the wardens of the hostels where violence took place.The sources also said that while mobile phone videos of the attack were available, police had not been able to get leads due to the dark lighting and the masks that the attackers wore.Senior SIT members agreed that the nine suspects named on Friday were only involved in skirmishes during the day, not in the evening attack. The probe on the clashes after dark, including at Sabarmati Hostel, is under way.The cops will send notices to the nine students named as involved in violence by Special Investigating Team at its press meet on Friday to help the investigators in identify the other people seen with them in CCTV and mobile phone footage that have been recovered.

Representative image

PATNA: The Centre has finally approved the site for developing another All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in the state at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH). The Centre’s nod to the proposal came after the state government informed it that DMCH is not a heritage site.

The Union ministry of health and family welfare sent its approval letter to the state government on January 10. In the letter, addressed to the state health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar, the Centre has asked the state to connect the selected site to NH-56, take steps for construction of a rail over bridge and arrange for 20mw of electricity which is required for the functioning of the institute.

In the letter, the state government has also been told to bear the cost of land filling on the site, make a bio-medical waste plant near the institute and ensure that proper sewage and effluent waste disposal facilities are available at the site.

The state government will also have to address the issues related to land besides dismantling the old building and removing other hindrances from the site. “A single-window system should be put in place for necessary clearances by various departments,” the letter read.

Sanjay said the state government would take steps to fulfil the necessary requirements for developing AIIMS unit at Darbhanga. Asked about the cost involved in construction of AIIMS, he said, “The tender for AIIMS-Jammu was recently floated. It entails an expenditure of Rs 1,200 crore.”

Another senior health department official said the state government would hand over 100 acres of land to the Centre within three to four months and another 100 acres in one year. “The project is expected to be approved by the Union cabinet within the next two months,” the official added.

The announcement regarding setting up of second AIIMS in Bihar was made by former Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in his 2015-16 Budget speech.

32,['12/01/2020'],Not just Kannada: Language tripping up cops in DK?,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Souces said that youths from Dakshina Kannada rarely opt for a career in the police

Mangaluru: ASI Kantappa K of Moodabidri police station could control an agitated mob in Bantwal a few years ago by just conversing in Beary. There was an instant connect and the locals stopped to listen. Currently, though, majority of the police personnel here are from outside the district and not fluent in any of the local languages: Tulu , Beary or Konkani .

Police sources said from constables to senior officers, most come from places here none of the local DK languages is spoken and the local recruitment has been declining over the years. Youths from DK rarely opt for a career in the police, they said. Very few in the force can speak the local language and this is a barrier between the force and the people.

Senior police officers who do speak Tulu say the difference is marked. When police personnel speak the local language, locals open up and volunteer information while they clam up on hearing Kannada.

“Speaking the local language connects two people immediately. Policing has suffered in Dakshina Kannada because those who come from outside the district show no interest in learning and conversing in the native language,” said a retired senior police officer.

Apart from the familiarity factor, there are unmistakable cultural nuances. A police officer who has been working in Mangaluru for 25 years says for instance, Tulu speakers address everyone, irrespective of their age, in the plural. “Even when Tulu speakers converse in Kannada, they use the plural for all. But Kannada speakers refer to everyone in singular. When a police officer does so, it is a put-off. The tradition of this land is that everyone respects everyone in a conversation,” he said.

The retired officer added, “I remember that local women would open up when they heard Tulu, Konkani or Beary. The moment one spoke in Kannada, they would draw up a wall. Though Kannada is the state language, the local women especially are not comfortable speaking it.”

Former city police commissioner M Chandra Sekhar had introduced Tulu and Beary classes for police personnel but they were discontinued after his tenure. Recently, commissioner PS Harsha’s tweet in Tulu received an overwhelming response, with many commending his outreach.

Grabs from the CCTV footage of the crime spot at Pavilion Plaza

Surat: A shop was ransacked in Dindoli by some goons after its owner registered a police complaint against them for demanding protection money from him here on Friday night. The goons, who were caught on CCTV camera ransacking the shop, have been booked at Dindoli police station.

Police arrested Jay Krishna alias Sanjay Oza, his aide Kundan Kamlesh and Kaher Singh on shopkeeper Gopal Yadav’s complaint on Saturday. The accused had escaped after ransacking Jay Gopal Matka Cha at Pavilion Plaza. They had damaged furniture and valuables worth Rs79,000 in the shop.

Yadav alleged in his complaint that Oza visited his shop often and also came on Friday at around 10.30pm and demanded protection money. “If you want to run the shop in Dindoli, you will have to give money,” Oza told Yadav, according to police complaint. Oza also told Yadav that whenever his men demanded, he will have to give them money.

Yadav refused to give money and Oza left issuing threats to him. Meanwhile, Yadav went to Dindoli police station to report about the threats he received from the accused. Yadav received a call from his employees at the shop that some anti-social elements have ransacked the shop.

“The accused have no criminal history. We had not received any complaint in the past against the accused saying that they demanded protection money from anyone in the area. Only investigation will make things clear whether the accused had demanded protection money or was there a financial dispute between him and the complainant,” said a police officer at Dindoli police station.

However, police are still investigating if Oza had a criminal past.

KOLKATA: The private bus that ran over a biker on Remount Road near Mominpore, following which a mob set three buses on fire and damaged two, has 366 cases pending against it. The bus, whic h usually plies on the 12C (Pailan-Howrah) and 12C/1A (Konchowki-Howrah) routes, has as many as 223 cases pending in court, more than two-third of them pending in Alipore court and the rest in Bankshall court. There are 14 compound cases and three sticker cases.“Most of the cases are that of dangerous driving, rash driving, stopping and picking passengers in the middle of the road and other rule violations. The bus mostly broke the traffic rules in the added areas, between Pailan and Remount Road,” said an officer from the fatal squad of the traffic department.“A preliminary investigation into the accident shows that the bus was speeding but the biker was also riding fast. We are, however, going to seek an explanation on why the bus owner had not paid any of the fines. The fact that so many cases have gone to court shows that these were repeat offences.”According to statistics, bus, one of the most popular modes of the public transport, has witnessed a sharp rise in accidents. Buses were involved in 97 fatal accidents in 2019, up from 85 in 2018. Such has been the rogue bus scare in the city that even in non-fatal accidents, buses overtook cars in 2019. Buses were involved in 497 accidents, almost more than one accident a day, as compared to 470 in 2018. Most of the victims were pedestrians: while in 2018, pedestrians ended up to be 50% of people killed in accidents, the percentage rose to 56% in 2019.Police said it planned to launch a special drive under which sergeants would be asked to feed bus registration numbers on their hand-held devices and check the number of cases pending against each driver. But there’s been apprehension about such a drive, given the experience in 2018, when bus owners petitioned the transport department and threatened to move court.“When we find that a bus has too many cases pending against it, we ask them to pay. But we have no mechanism to force them to do so. For the record, buses have the highest number of pending citation cases in the city than anyone else. We cannot allow buses to ply without paying the fines ever.

Kolkata’s minimum temperature on Saturday was 12.5°C

KOLKATA: The city got colder on Saturday with the mercury plunging more than three notches from Friday’s 15.7°C. With the northwesterly wind breezing in without interruption, the minimum temperature was pushed down to 12.5°C. At 22.3°C, the maximum temperature, too, was lower — three notches below normal. The Met office expects the mercury to dip further on Sunday.

“A strong northwesterly wind is blowing in, bringing the chill. It has already forced the mercury to recede. The city will feel the cold spell at least till Tuesday,” said G K Das, director ( weather ) at the Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata.

Because of the strong, cold and dry northwesterly wind, the Met office said the fog in the early morning will be comparatively less. While the minimum temperature is expected to be around 12°C in the next few days, the maximum temperature will also go down about a degree.

“By Wednesday, the northwesterly wind will stop coming in due to a massive western disturbance expected to develop near Jammu and Kashmir. Instead, the easterly wind will start coming in, lessening the intensity of the cold feeling ,” added Das.

A western disturbance is an extra-tropical storm originating from the Mediterranean region. While it can cause winter rain in the plains, weathermen said it was too early to predict its impact here. It has, however, ruled out rain at least in the next five days.

Deepika Padukone

KOLKATA: Director Suman Ghosh’s early morning outing at a Salt Lake theatre was primarily for cinematic reasons. But once he walked out of the hall, he had to field questions on whether his visit was planned to lend support to Deepika Padukone. There had been calls to boycott her “Chhapaak” after she visited Jawaharlal Nehru University to show solidarity with students protesting against a masked-mob attack on students.

“It’s laughable for people to ask for a boycott of a film simply because the lead actor has visited a campus to show solidarity. I am glad to have watched the film without paying heed to the boycott calls,” Ghosh told TOI.

Four-time National Award winner Supriyo Sen might not have made it to the theatre this Friday to watch a Bollywood film. But the backlash against Padukone forced his hand.

Sen, who himself boycotted the recently-held National Awards ceremony to protest against CAA-NRC, said, “I am against any power using extra-constitutional authority to gag someone. I understand most people in power indulge in this. But the current dispensation has been using fringe groups to accomplish this.”

According to art historian Rajasri Mukhopadhyay, her Friday “Chhapaak” outing was to lend support to a woman who swam against the tide in a male-dominated industry. “Even her husband, actor Ranveer Singh , hasn’t said a word on the JNU violence. A lot of the backlash that she is facing is because of her gender. Others who have essayed roles of powerful women in mainstream Bollywood cinema have not even verbally condemned the violence on students. Padukone has been different. Watching this film is my way of supporting women’s empowerment,” Mukhopadhyay said.

For singer Dibyendu Mukherjee and his wife, designer Chandrani Singh Flora, watching this movie was their way of showing solidarity.

“We think it is crucial to stand by a person who refuses to be bullied,” he said.

Meanwhile, an official at a south Kolkata theatre said there was an overwhelming response for the first day’s first show. “Padukone’s visit to JNU definitely contributed to this,” he said.

PATNA: State transport minister Sanjay Kumar Nirala on Saturday said the provisions of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019 will be enforced more strictly in the rural areas to bring down number of accidents.

Speaking at the launch of National Road Safety Week here, Nirala said there has been a 40-50% rise in two-wheeler riders wearing helmets after the strict enforcement of amended MV Act. “The number of road accidents and fatalities has come down significantly in Bihar after the implementation of amended MV Act,” Nirala said.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal also said road accident-related deaths in the state have come down after the implementation of amended MV Act.

State transport commissioner Seema Tripathi said 85% of road accidents occur due to over-speeding by motorists in the age group of 19 to 44 years.

Vyas Ji, vice-chairman of Bihar State Disaster Management Authority, said, “The 4 Es – education, enforcement, engineering and emergency care – are the solutions to road accidents in the state. We have already improved road engineering at various locations, especially on highways.”

BIJNOR: In a series of events that completely choked rail traffic in Bijnor region of western Uttar Pradesh for around six hours, a goods train was derailed near Nagina station in Bijnor on Saturday morning. No one was reportedly injured in the accident.

However, the relief train which was called in to rescue the derailed goods train also went off track choking both ‘up’ and ‘down’ rail traffic. Sources said that the rescue train, which got derailed, was called in from Moradabad. It was then brought back on to the track. The process took around 30 minutes.

According to officials, the goods train was empty and on its way from Jawalapur to Visaratganj. It derailed around 6:30am at Mugalwala village, four kilometres away from Nagina railway station.

Two wheels of the goods train’s last wagon went off the track. Strangely, the goods train kept on running on the track for at least five kilometres and the driver was unaware about the derailment. Sources said that the derailed goods train has caused damage to track at several places. The train was on ‘down’ route which remained choked for six hours while traffic on ‘up’ route was disrupted for nearly two hours.

Senior railway officials reached the spot and rescue operation to clear the tracks lasted for hours. Three passenger trains from Saharanpur to Moradabad and Saharanpur to Lucknow were directly affected.

Divisional railway manager, Moradabad, Tarun Prakash said, “A goods train got derailed here in Nagina. Three passenger trains were affected. The ‘up’ route remained disrupted for nearly two hours. It has caused damage to tracks as well which are being repaired. The cause of the derailment is yet to be ascertained.”

40,['12/01/2020'],Bourdain’s death made me scared that I may never shake the pain: Shaheen Bhatt,"You make an interesting point in the book about how we have fetishised

. This often puts pressure on people to appear happy all the time and not pay attention to their sadness. Is that why people delay seeking help?

The book includes many moving and terrifying pages from the diary you kept. Did writing help you through the dark days?

You’ve been very candid — your dad’s addiction to first alcohol and then work, your own troubled relationship with food and alcohol, your insecurities when Alia found fame. Now that the book is out, do you regret your honesty even a teeny tiny bit?

The account of the demons you fought is very hard to read. How hard was it to for you to write this, and what made you decide to put your pain to paper?

You have talked about how deeply affected you were by the deaths of Kate Spade and Anthony

. What was it that bothered you the most — the dissonance between their celebrity lives and their personal pain?

As a screenwriter, do you feel the way the Hindi movie industry portrays mental health needs to change?

You have written about how depression affected all your relationships. Has the book helped your sister Alia and your parents understand you better?

Screenwriter Shaheen Bhatt ’s debut book ‘I’ve Never Been (un)Happier’ is a candid account of her 20-year-long struggle with depression and life in a famous filmi family. She spoke to Shobita Dhar about how writing helped her survive the dark times.If we’re not happy all the time we’re programmed to automatically assume that there’s something wrong with us. No one wants to feel like they’re a broken thing that needs fixing, no one wants to feel like they’re weak so you delay getting help because even the idea of “getting help” has negative connotations. It suggests that you’re incapable. It suggests that you have somehow lost control. There’s also a general resistance built into us when it comes to talking about ‘negative’ or unpleasant feelings or things. As a result, we often don’t even know how to talk about anything remotely difficult.I’ve journalled since I was 12 years old, which is when depression first started for me. I had to do something with the overwhelming feelings I was experiencing, so I wrote about them. Writing has been one of the greatest tools for healing — it helped me process and expel every bad feeling I couldn’t make sense of. It helped me see patterns, it helped me understand myself better and it helped me get through it all.Launching a book involves a lot of press and talking about yourself especially if you’ve written about yourself, and talking about myself is something that I’m not used to doing. It feels self-indulgent and self-involved to me. For me, the only time I regretted it was when I had to discuss myself in interviews and I was worried that the larger message (about mental health) was getting lost. Otherwise — nope, no regrets. I’ve never really been afraid of sharing because my entire family is one that shares — we’re honest and we value vulnerability.It was definitely hard — I had to relive things I didn’t want to. I had to go back to dark places. It sent me back into a bit of a slump that I’ve only just about gotten out of. However, it was also incredibly rewarding. It taught me so much more about myself and it allowed me the chance for profound connection with a lotof people — in the end it’s been really good for me.What bothered me the most was that these two, seemingly successful, middle-aged people were unable to shake the pain so far into their life. It was the fear that twenty years from now, I might still feel like this. You hope that by a certain age you will get better at least partially. It’s scary to think that you might not. It’s scary to think that there’s potentially another 30 or 40 more years of this in my future.To start with perhaps we need to tell more stories about mental health. It’s important also that we tell these stories with sensitivity and portray mental illnesses as accurately as we can. Caricaturing mental illness is dangerous because it spreads the wrong information and colour general perception. Movies are one of the best tools we have to spread messages world over and it’s always great when you can use that to good effect.Through my book my family has better understood the intricacies of what my mind is like on a bad day. It’s hard to let someone in when you’re in the throes of something because your focus is on just getting through it. This has helped them understand what is happening behind closed doors when I sometimes isolate myself. Through this book I’ve been able to let them into that part of my life in a much bigger way and I’ve been able to explain things to them that were hard for me to explain at one point. They’ve always understood me but through this book they saw what I’d been hiding.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73207043,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-467127,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/all-that-matters/bourdains-death-made-me-scared-that-i-may-never-shake-the-pain-shaheen-bhatt/articleshow/73207038.cms

Dhodraj armed outpost held a workshop on ‘how to prepare incense stick’ for rural women recently

NAGPUR: Ninety one women from Dhodraj and its adjoining villages of Maoist-affected highly sensitive Bhamragarh tehsil of south Gadchiroli were inducted into the incense stick manufacturing project of the Nagpur-based bamboo board. The project is meant for empowering women with income-generating training and employment in manufacturing units.

In the first week of January, Dhodraj armed outpost had organized a training -cum-practice camp for the women to prepare incense stick that would help them earn Rs200-250 per day. The women, who were inducted into the programme, were imparted training in the ‘hand-rolling’ technique of preparing the incense sticks. The programme was inaugurated by the AOP in-charge sub-inspector Babasaheb Dudhal.

Bamboo board’s project manager Vinay Kumar, based in Mumbai, was present to interact with the local residents. Apart from the 91 women participants, 40 men too were present in the camp.

Project coordinators Neelkanth Yerewar and Naresh Kulsunge too were present at the camp to guide the women who were initiated into the income-generating project. After receiving the training, the women also practised the newly acquired skill for sometime. It’s learnt that the hand-rolled incense sticks are in more demand than machine-produced ones due to their superior quality.

42,['12/01/2020'],‘This December was wettest in recent times’,"This story is from January 12, 2020

PATNA: Acting director at Patna Meteorological Centre Anand Shankar talks to Faryal Rumi about the prevailing biting cold conditions across the state. Excerpts:

What has been the peculiar feature of winter season this year?

The onset of winter this time was marked by rainfall and it dissipated the suspended particulate matters (SPM) in the atmosphere. Since the SPM was less in the atmosphere as compared to winter season in the previous years, it led to fog formation in early morning hours though it dissipated quickly. Thus, the peculiar feature of this winter season was formation of dense to very dense fog, which dissipated 3-4 hours of its formation. Also, we witnessed more rain in state, including Patna, in December when compared to previous years.

Day temperature plunged more this winter as compared to night temperature. Why so?

Various climatic factors were responsible for lower day temperature, especially frequent western disturbance which led to cloudy weather and showers. This December was one of the rainiest in the state in recent times. Patna witnessed 31.4mm rainfall in December against the average 6.6mm rain it received last year. Earlier in 1998 and 1986, Patna had witnessed 41.2mm and 110.4mm of rainfall, respectively, in December. The cloud cover obstructed solar rays, which led to plunge in day temperature.

IMD had initially predicted that this winter is going to be warmer. Has it been so?

It has been a mild winter for the state this time. The IMD had clearly mentioned that maximum temperature will be slightly below normal. December was still warmer than the corresponding average in terms of minimum temperature. Nevertheless, maximum temperature remained below normal.

What about frequency of western disturbances this winter?

The frequency of western disturbances was more than previous year this time. Last western disturbance that affected Bihar was on January 8 and 9 and the next is expected between January 15 and January 16. Bihar witnessed western disturbance in every 4-6 days this winter. Most western disturbances had minimal impact on the state because of their amplitude and low intensity by the time they reached Bihar.

What was the frequency of cold wave and cold day conditions this winter?

Patna witnessed four cold days and three severe cold days in December. No cold wave condition was reported in Patna last month. The scenario in the entire state was more or less same if we talk about the number of cold days.

Now that another western disturbance is approaching, how will be the weather over the next few days?

According to the IMD predictions, the upcoming western disturbance will not affect the state. Minimum temperature across the state will remain below normal and in the range 7-12 degrees C till January 16. Thereafter, the minimum temperature will rise to 11 to 14 degrees C. The day temperature will be slightly higher and the maximum temperature will also increase from January 16 onwards till January 23.

What has caused more discomfort to people this winter – low temperature or windy conditions?

Mean maximum temperature was less than the climatic average by 3 degrees C on most days causing discomfort to people. The other reason for the discomfort was wettest December in recent times. Patna witnessed the minimum of 4.8 degrees C on December 28. It was the second lowest temperature since 1969 in the month of December. In 2012, 4.4 degrees C was recorded on December 30, 2012.

Will winter depart early this time?

It is too early to comment on this.

Can we brace for a hot summer this time?

A bulletin will be released about the onset of summer probably in the last week of February.

towards green revolution

Surat: Transplantation has saved about 8 ,000 trees in the city in the past five years. They now stand as evidence of a successful campaign of many individuals and organizations at Joggers’ Park and canal corridor in Athwa zone. Prayas and Nature Club, non-government organizations , that work for plant and animal welfare have been trying to check the city’s depleting green cover. Ideally, the city should have one tree for 15 individuals , 17 lakh trees in 326 sq km area where 50 lakh people live. But it has only 3.26 lakh trees officially and unofficially about 6 lakh as no tree census has been conducted in the city in the past 15 years.

Surat Municipal Corporation claims to have planted 10 lakh trees in last three years, but with a survival rate of just 50 per cent not much would have been added to the count, sources said.

Darshan Desai, a volunteer of Prayas, told TOI, “We managed to successfully transplant about 8,000 trees of 18 species in different parts of Surat in the past five years. We were able to save mature trees that had been uprooted for widening of roads and clearing of space etc.”

Karmveer Bhatt, MSc ecology, a transplant expert, said, “If tree transplantation is done as per proper procedures, success can be guaranteed. For transplantation, you need to cut the root manually in three metre radius in the shape of a horseshoe. Once the roots are cut, medicine has to be put to prevent fungus growth on them and the channel refilled with soil. Leave it for 18 months. When stem and branches have sprouts, pull off the rootball with force and replant it at a new spot. The whole process takes about 42 months.”

Puneet Nayyar, deputy conservator of forests, Surat said, “The process of transplantation must be replicated everywhere as it will help ensure green cover in the city. We have done it successfully on Olpad-Sayan Road.”

The uprooted trees were transplanted mainly at Olpad Road, Hazira, Joggers’ Park and canal corridor at Athwa zone. Estonia trees and Gulmohar trees have been mainly transplanted here. Transplantation of peepal tree and banyan tree are comparatively easier, sources added.

Governor Phagu Chauhan with the gold medallists at the foundation day function of Patna University on Saturday

PATNA: Girls bagged 31 of the 41 gold medals at a function organized to mark the 103rd Foundation Day of Patna University (PU) at Wheeler Senate House on Saturday. Governor-cum-chancellor Phagu Chauhan awarded the medals to the toppers, who had secured top positions in different undergraduate exams last year.

The maximum number of toppers (15) were from Patna Women’s College. The ‘college with potential for excellence’ having grade ‘A’ from National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) has already been declared an autonomous institution by the University Grants Commission (UGC). Nine toppers were from Magadh Mahila College, another NAAC-accredited college. While the number of toppers from Patna College was five, four toppers were from Patna Science College and B N College each.

Girls outsmarted boys in subjects like physics, mathematics, statistics, computer applications and biotechnology. A PU official said, “Earlier, girls were quite reluctant in pursuing these relatively tough subjects.”

Giving away the gold medals and certificates, the governor spoke highly of the girls performing better in academics and said their performance was indicative of the growing women empowerment. “The girls will definitely take India to greater heights,” Chauhan added.

The governor observed that education was not necessary only for jobs but for making students more sensible and bringing social harmony. “Bringing people from the disadvantaged groups, weaker and marginalized sections of the society to the national forefront should be the primary objective of higher education,” he said.

He also appreciated the fact that PU has been trying to digitalize everything and implement various skill development schemes for the benefit of its students. “The university, which has set up several landmarks in the field of education in its 102-year-long history, has been preparing youths to face the challenges of the 21st century boldly,” he said.

Earlier, PU vice-chancellor (VC) Rash Bihari Prasad Singh pointed out that all the institutions except B N College and Vanijya Mahavidyalaya have been accredited by the NAAC. “Efforts are being made to get all these institutions re-accredited with better grade as early as possible,” the VC said.

He announced that all the toppers of postgraduate examinations would be awarded gold medals made of pure gold from the next convocation. He said, “A number of alumni and philanthropists have come forward to donate money for the medals in their name.”

The gold medallists of conventional courses include Komal Kumari (Hindi), Tushar Kumar (English), Somesh Kashyap (Sanskrit), Kahkashan Jabeen (Urdu) Nidhi Nandan (Maithili), Ayushi Raj (philosophy), Kajari (music), Jyoti Sinha (history), Sonam Singh (sociology), Aditi Pandey (political science), Anupama Kumari (economics), Akanksha Bharti (psychology), Kaushal Kumar (geography), Raushan Kumar (ancient Indian history and archaeology), Aparna Bharti (home science), Prabhakar Kumar (mathematics), Rishabh (statistics), Vandana Kumari (physics), Priyanshu Kumar (chemistry), Qrooz Zohra (botany), Shafia Ambareen (zoology), Prasoon Kumar Lucky (geology), Kusum Kumari (mathematics), Babita Anand (statistics) and Priyanka Chaudhary (commerce).

Toppers of vocational courses are Sristy Priya (advertising & sales management), Manisha Priya (biotechnology), Kumari Anu (computer applications-science), Amisha (computer applications-arts), Payal Sharma (business administration), Pragyan Agrawal (communicative English), Kumari Rakhi (environmental science), Ankit (functional English), Shaeel Ashraf (industrial microbiology), Katyani Mishra (mass communication), Sana Siddiquee (social work), Anu Priya (education), Akash Bhardwaj (library and information science), Ankita Shree (law) and Pratibha Kumari (applied arts).

While PU pro-VC Dolly Sinha welcomed the guests, NSS programme coordinator Atul Aditya Pandey conducted the programme. PU registrar Manoj Kumar Mishra proposed the vote of thanks.

PATNA: The state government seems to be in no hurry to initiate action against 71 government employees, including 25 former DMs, for their lapses leading to alleged sexual abuse of inmates in the shelter homes in the state earlier.

The CBI, which probed the Muzaffarpur shelter home sexual abuse case, has recommended departmental proceedings against the erring officials and also sent their list to the state government. The maximum five DMs against whom action was recommended had served in East Champaran district .

Additional chief secretary (home) Amir Subhani said on Saturday that the government would initiate disciplinary action against the officials against whom the CBI would seek prosecution sanction. At present, the general administration department (GAD), which has been furnished the list, is busy in examining the magnitude of the irregularities, he said.

Subhani, who is holding additional charge of GAD, however, said the government is serious and the guilty won’t be spared. Chief secretary Deepak Kumar had forwarded the list of the government employees who were found to be lax in adhering to the guidelines to run the shelter homes in the state. Sources said few top officials whose names figured in the list were on central deputation.

In all, the CBI had investigated 17 cases related to irregularities in the state-run facility in Patna, Bhagalpur , Motihari , Munger, Kaimur, Madhepura, Madhubani, Muzaffarpur (second case) and Araria. In its affidavit to the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the probe, the CBI has given details of the action initiated against the culprits.

The sexual abuse of inmates came to the fore during social audit of the shelter homes by TISS, Mumbai. However, the social welfare department swung into action in May 2018 and lodged an FIR against the office-bearers of an NGO, Seva Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti, in Muzaffarpur. The alleged kingpin of the scandal, Brajesh Thakur, was arrested along with other accused.

PATNA: After four days of kidnapping for ransom of Rs10 lakh, Patna police with the help of its Munger counterparts rescued betel leaf trader Deepak Kumar (24) and arrested three kidnappers from Chorgaon village under Asarganj police station area in the wee hours of Saturday.

The police laid a trap and sent his family members to the kidnappers’ desired location in the name of handing them over the ransom money. Deepak lives with his family at New Karbighaiya under Jakkanpur police station area in state capital and owns a betel leaf shop near Patna Junction. He was kidnapped from Mithapur bus stand in a SUV on January 7 morning.

Those arrested were identified as Sonu Kumar, Raja Kumar and Ashish Kumar. Sonu and Raja belong to Sangrampur village under Tarapur police station area in Munger district while Ashish is a native of Rampur in Banka district. Sonu was the mastermind of Deepak’s kidnapping.

Police said the kidnappers were to kill Deepak for non-payment of ransom money or on slightest possibility of being caught.

The victim told TOI that he was kept inside a room with no window. “Sonu had threatened to chop me off into pieces and bury somewhere in the jungle after pouring salt so that none could ever trace me,” he said.

Deepak said Sonu had befriended him two months back at his shop. “After several days, he offered me a job at Bihta and said I can also run my shop. I was required to work for four hours on Rs22,000 monthly remuneration,” he said.

Deepak said one day Sonu took him to a person whom he identified as his manager to win confidence. “On January 7, Sonu asked me accompany him to Fatuha in a SUV. Before getting inside the vehicle, he offered me an aerated drink which was spiked. I woke up disoriented inside a dark room with no window,” he said.

Jakkanpur police station SHO Mukesh Kumar Verma said kidnappers had used Deepak’s cellphone to make the ransom call to his family members due to which police initially had not been able to trace his location. “Deepak’s family members were directed not to leave the spot fixed for ransom delivery while police kept surveillance on them from Friday night. Once kidnappers got assured that there was no policeman, they returned and changed the time for ransom delivery to Saturday morning,” he said.

Verma said then police raided a house at Chorgaon and recovered Deepak. “Sonu told police that he was prepared to kill Deepak. Police suspect he is involved in several criminal cases about which details are being gathered,” he added.

There were about 400 road accident victims who reached the hospital very late and doctors declared them brought dead, said AIIMS-P head of the trauma and emergency department, Dr Anil Kumar while coordinating the weeklong road safety programme organized near Patna Junction on Saturday.

He said neglecting the traffic rules, rash driving and poor vision appeared to be the main causes of accidents.

From Saturday, AIIMS-P banned entry of two-wheelers driven by those without helmets. “Out of the 1,300 cases of road accident which came for treatment from August 6, 2018 to December 31 at the trauma centre, 80% were the bike riders in the age group of 15 to 45 years. They included both driving themselves or hit by other bikes, he said. While 25 such victims lost their hands or legs after amputation, about 30 succumbed to their injuries, mostly on head, as they were without helmets, he said.

Earlier, inaugurating the road safety programme, AIIMS-P director Dr P K Singh said the training of pre-hospital care of the road accident victims may largely help save many lives. In most of the cases, the victims remained unattended for hours leading to other serious complications. He also stressed the need for strictly following the traffic rules.

Over 450 persons, including roadside vendors, auto and bust drivers were examined at the health check-up camps held by 12 doctors and paramedical staff.

Besides the eye and general health check ups, the AIIMS-P is to hold of blood donation camp at IIT-Patna at Bihta and pre-hospital care training programme at Kankarbagh tempo stand, Mithapur bus stand and near the general post office.

51,['12/01/2020'],Bihar: Cracks in Mahagathbandhan over Tejashwi Prasad Yadav’s leadership issue,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Tejashwi Prasad Yadav

PATNA: The Mahagathbandhan of RJD, Congress, RLSP, HAM(S) and VIP in the state seems to be cracking over the leadership issue ahead of the Bihar assembly elections due this year. While RJD insists that party chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will be the CM face of the Mahagathbandhan, the other partners rejected it saying the issue will be decided later.

RJD state president Jagdanand Singh said there will be no discussion on CM candidate as Tejashwi is the leader of the largest party in the state and others have to accept him or they were free to go. While talking to a section of media on Friday, he even said the coordination committee of Mahagathbandhan will be headed by Lalu.

But Congress legislator party leader Sadanand Singh said the decision on CM face and the number of seats the alliance partners will contest has to be taken by the party high command. “Congress is a national party and such decisions are taken by our high command. RJD cannot decide for us,” said Sadanand.

Congress MLC Prem Chandra Mishra cautioned RJD against issuing such statements, which can create rift among them. Since Tejashwi and Rahul Gandhi enjoy a cordial relation, political observers feel the former will not have much problem from Congress’s side.

When contacted, Jagdanand told TOI on Saturday, “What they say is their issue. Tejashwi is leading the RJD and he will lead the Mahagatbandhan as well in the upcoming elections.”

RJD state spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan also said Tejashwi has proved his mettle as the leader of opposition. “It was under the guidance of Lalu ji that Mahagathbandhan won Jharkhand elections. We need his guidance in Bihar and our other partners know it well that no other leader is more tactful than him,” he said.

RJD MLA Vijay Prakash went a step further to announce on Saturday that his party would contest at least 150 seats.

But, besides Congress, the other three Mahagathbandhan partners are also not ready to accept RJD’s lead role ahead of the assembly elections. RLSP national spokesperson Fazal Imam Mallick said on Saturday that party chief Upendra Kushwaha was the most suitable candidate for the CM’s post. “Just like Jagdanand thinks that Tejashwi is suitable for the CM post, I also want my party president to be the CM candidate. After all, Upendra Kushwaha has all the qualities of becoming a CM and he is a seasoned politician,” Mallick told TOI.

Even HAM(S) chief Jitan Ram Manjhi and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) chief Mukesh Sahni refused to accept RJD’s “sermons” and demanded the formation of a coordination committee to take decisions on such matters.

“My opinion will not matter in the alliance. We have to take everyone together and respect everyone’s decision. We know that RJD is the biggest of all the parties among us, but they can take decision only for themselves. Our final decision will be based on the formation of a coordination committee, which will have representation from all parties,” Manjhi told TOI on Saturday, adding that Jagdanand is making unnecessary statements, leading to confusion among the allies.

Sahni said among the five alliance partners, four were together. “If RJD has decided about the CM, then what about deputy CM and state assembly Speaker’s posts? All such decisions, including seat-sharing and choice of seats will be decided by a coordination committee,” Sahni said.

PATNA: With political heat soaring in the state in view of assembly elections later this year, all eyes are on how the political parties preparing for ‘dahi-chura’ feasts on the occasion of Makar Sankranti .

Two NDA partners – JD(U) and BJP – have already begun preparations for the feast.s The Mahagatbandhan partners, however, are still undecided on a joint feast. LJP will not hold any feast this Makar Sankranti because of demise of party leader Ram Chandra Paswan in July last year.

Like the previous years, JD(U)’s feast will be organised by the party’s state president Vashishath Narayan Singh at his Hardinge Road residence on January 15. Singh said CM Nitish Kumar and his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi would attend the get-together. Asked if he has invited any leader from the opposition, Singh said, “As of now, I have not invited anyone. The process of sending invitation will start on Sunday.”

Preparations are also in full swing at BJP MLC Rajnish Kumar’s bungalow for another get-together of NDA on Wednesday. Rajnish said, “The deputy CM has assured his presence. I will also urge the CM to attend the feast.”

However, no celebration will be held at former CM Rabri Devi’s 10, Circular Road residence this year as well. A party source said the celebrations will not be held due to Rabri’s poor health and her elder son Tej Pratap’s marital dispute.

State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha said he will host ‘dahi-chura’ feast for the party workers at Sadaquat Ashram.

PATNA: East Central Railway (ECR) general manager (GM) Lalit Chandra Trivedi made an annual inspection of several stations falling under the Grand Chord (GC) section of the Mughalsarai division on Friday. He was accompanied by senior officials of the ECR and the Mughalsarai division.

Surat: In this cold weather , students participating in the three-day youth festival of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) are compelled by circumstances to take bath in bathrooms made from cloth in an open area on the campus. Due to non availability of enough bathrooms in a university accredited by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) with A grade, participating students are forced to take bath in the tents. Two such tents made of white cloth and iron rods exist on the university campus for the duration of the festival from Friday to Sunday. One temporary bathroom was made near the boys’ hostels and another near the department of commerce.

The university has been organizing the youth festival for over two decades now, in which about 1,500 students of colleges affiliated to it from across south Gujarat have been taking part. The students are provided accommodation in the academic blocks and hostels. The university arranges mattresses on rent for them and they use the toilet blocks of the academic building and hostel. However, these students are provided hot water for bath by the university.

“In academic blocks, there are no bathrooms. Hence, we have made temporary structures for them to take bath. These bathrooms have been built only for boys,” said Rajendra Patel, in-charge registrar of VNSGU.

Majority of boys are accommodated in classrooms that become bedroom for them during night. A few boys are also accommodated in the boys hostel. Girls are given accommodation in the girls hostel which has bathrooms and toilets in the hostel building itself.

“Every year, VNSGU organizes youth festival but without proper infrastructure. Earlier, the university officials had built a toilet with cloth near the cricket ground for the participants,” syndicate member Bhavesh Rabari said.

VNSGU vice-chancellor Shivendra Gupta was not available for his comments.

55,['12/01/2020'],Maharashtra: Met department forecasts mild winter till January 23,"Minimum temperature recorded at different places around this period (January 10-11) in 2019 and this year

PUNE: Winter is expected to be mild till January 23, especially in parts of Madhya Maharashtra .A fresh extended range outlook of India Meteorological Department (IMD) said while minimum temperatures are likely to remain below normal during a few days over major parts of the country, some parts of Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, east Assam, Madhya Maharashtra, and coastal and south interior Karnataka would record normal to above-normal minimum temperatures on some days during the week till January 16.Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather, IMD Pune, told TOI that Pune district and the city might record higher than normal minimum temperature till January 16 and thereafter, till January 23, though warmer than normal temperatures might shift partially to northern parts of Maharashtra after January 16.Minimum temperatures in parts of this region, including Pune, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara, have begun an upward climb. The trend is likely to continue till January 16, after which only north Madhya Maharashtra may be affected with high night temperatures.The period from January 17 to 23 in general is likely to be warmer than the current week, the outlook said. Night temperatures are likely to be above normal over north Madhya Maharashtra, among some other regions in the country.Kashyapi said, “A typical phenomenon of this winter is the absence of penetration of chill in Maharashtra’s ineriors, including Pune. But at the same time, maximum temperatures have continued to remain lower than normal for the season not only for Maharashtra but many parts of the country. A similar trend might be visible during the next two weeks barring parts of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, among some others, where maximum temperatures will be high,” he said.He said satellite images and other wind analysis with IMD show that an anticyclone had been persisting over Maharashtra from time to time since mid-November 2019, blocking the cold, northerly winds from entering the central and southern parts of the state. Except in the beginning of this year, when Pune’s minimum temperature had plunged to 10.8°C (near normal for this time of the year), the city’s night temperature has been on the higher side because of the inability of northerly winds to penetrate into major parts of the state.“In addition, easterly/south-easterly winds are bringing in slight moisture, while southwesterly winds from the Arabian Sea are also pumping in moisture, causing clouding in early morning and night time. Cloud cover in the night is one of the chief reasons for high night temperatures. Pune and adjacent locations may, thus, record haze and shallow fog during early mornings for the next couple of days because of the moisture in the air,” he said.Forecasters predict an interaction between southwesterlies/westerlies and south-easterly/easterly winds over north Maharashtra around January 14. It can cause an increase in moisture content in the air, resulting in partial to general clouding to continue in late night and morning hours in Pune.“An approaching western disturbance may also lead to the formation of an upper cyclonic circulation over northwest India around January 13, which might further increase the inflow of moisture-laden wind from the Arabian Sea into north Konkan and partially to north-central Maharashtra,” said Kashyapi.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209630,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-340584,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/met-dept-forecasts-mild-winter-till-january-23/articleshow/73208607.cms

AHMEDABAD: Two men allegedly abused policemen and assaulted a traffic cop on Friday night, when police stopped their pick up van, as the driver was talking on the phone while driving, in the Sola area of the city.

A division traffic police Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) jawan, Dilip Gagji, in his FIR at Sola police station said that he and two other cops were deployed at Bhadaj Circle for traffic regulation. They saw a pickup van carrying iron bars and its driver was talking on the phone.

Gagji blew the whistle for them to stop, but the did not and drove away towards Science City Road. The cops somehow managed to get the vehicle to stop and asked the driver — later identified as Jivan Thakor, 27, resident of Gandhinagar — why he was talking on the phone while driving.

To this, the person sitting beside the driver — later identified as Ram Parmar, 23, also a Gandhinagar resident — allegedly began abusing the cops. Parmar asked the cops if they had any evidence to prove that Thakor was talking on the phone.

After this, the three cops and the two men got into heated arguments. Parmar then allegedly assaulted one of the cops, identified as Rakesh Kalu. Parmar and Thakor threatened to leave their vehicle in the middle of the road.

The three cops then called PSI G S Patel of A division traffic police, who arrived there and informed Sola police about the incident. Gagji later filed a complaint against Thakor and Parmar for causing hurt to deter public servant from his duty, along with charges of criminal intimidation and abetment. Sola police filed a complaint for causing hurt even though the cops were not injured.

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: The state cabinet on Saturday approved the general administration department’s proposal to set up Bihar Administrative Tribunal (BAT) on the pattern of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) to listen to the grievances of state government employees pertaining to their service conditions.

Briefing media after the meeting, cabinet secretariat department additional chief secretary Amir Subhani said the final notification in this regard would be issued by the Centre. “The state government will recommend to the Centre for issuing the notification in this regard soon,” Subhani said.

BAT would ease the burden of cases pending for disposal in the high court. Earlier, the government employees had no option than to move the high court to get their grievances redressed. The employees can move the BAT instead of going to the high court for seeking any reprieve, he clarified.

In another decision, the cabinet sanctioned Rs61.57 crore to the civil aviation authority to set up new structure and develop other related infrastructure in the wake of Patna airport renovation. Subhani said that several old structures have to be demolished in the vicinity of the airport due to its expansion plan and new structure and infrastructure are to be developed at new places. Renovation work is to be done on 8.65 acres of land under the airport expansion plan, he added.

The environment, forest and climate change department’s proposal for the appointment of 902 forest guards was also cleared at the meeting. The cabinet cleared the Science and Technology department’s proposal to name Engineering College, Araria after noted Hindi author Phanishwar Nath Renu. CM Nitish Kumar had announced it during his ‘Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Yatra’ recently.

The cabinet also gave its nod to the environment, forest and climate change department’s proposal to sanction Rs140 crore for plantation, maintenance of saplings, soil water conservation and wild life protection under 27 forest divisions in the state during 2019-20 fiscal.

Eight non-gazetted posts will be created to assist the judicial officer at the newly created sub-divisional court in Supaul district. It will cost additional Rs39.88 lakh to the state exchequer per annum. The meeting also approved the creation of 666 non-gazetted posts to assist the judicial officers posted at the 74 special courts set up across the state to deal with the cases lodged under Bihar Excise and Prohibition Act 2016. It will add additional burden of Rs28.74 crore to the state exchequer per annum.

The cabinet gave administrative sanction to budgetary allocation of Rs107 crore for the Balwa Ghat barrage-cum-irrigation project on Dhons river under Madhubani district. In addition, the cabinet also approved the termination of services of Dr Md. Rizwan Alam, medical officer of Barari referral hospital in Katihar district and Dr Dhananjay Kumar, medical officer of additional primary health centre at Machharhatta in Purnia district, for remaining absent from duty without authorized leave.

Altogether 18 proposals were approved at the cabinet meeting today.

59,['12/01/2020'],LJP MP Pashupati Kumar Paras justifies demand for 42 seats to contest Bihar assembly polls,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Pashupati Kumar Paras (ANI photo)

PATNA: Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) MP Pashupati Kumar Paras has demanded 42 out of 243 seats for his party to contest the state assembly elections, triggering a fresh controversy on the seat-sharing issue among the NDA allies in Bihar.

A few days ago, JD(U)’s senior functionary and political strategist Prashant Kishor had asserted that the seat-sharing talks between BJP and JD(U) for the assembly polls should be in 1:1.4 or 1:1.3 ratio. Kishor had also said there was no question of BJP and JD(U) contesting equal number of seats in the assembly election and the Lok Sabha polls formula could not be justified now.

Rejecting Kishor’s assertions, Paras said LJP must be allotted at least 42 seats on the plea that his party had contested from similar number of constituencies in 2015 as an NDA ally. “Moreover, the LJP got six Lok Sabha and one Rajya Sabha seats as part of seat sharing with BJP and JD(U) during the 2019 Lok Sabha election. Even that formula is considered, LJP should get at least 42 assembly seats as one Lok Sabha constituency in Bihar comprises six assembly segments,” Paras told TOI on Saturday.

He said, in 2015 elections, JD(U), RJD and Congress — the then three allies of the Mahagathbandhan — shared 100:100:43 seats. JD(U) and RJD contested 100 seats and the rest 43 were left for Congress. Now, the NDA has three allies. “If BJP and JD(U) agree with the Mahagathbandhan’s 2015 formula, LJP should be given 43 assembly seats to contest,” Paras, who remained the LJP’s state president for around 12 years, said.

Rejecting Kishor’s argument, Paras said he was in regular touch with the then LJP chief and his brother Ram Vilas Paswan when the seat-sharing talks among the top NDA leaders for 2019 Lok Sabha polls were going on in Delhi. “Then it was almost decided, though not in writing, that the seat sharing during the next assembly polls in Bihar will be done on the same formula. I am telling it as an MP and a senior LJP leader,” the Hajipur MP said.

In private talks, some senior JD(U) leaders rejected Paras’s demand saying JD(U) must get a lion’s share because the assembly polls would be contested on the face of their party chief Nitish Kumar. They also argued that JD(U) had always been contesting more seats than the BJP in Bihar assembly polls ever since the two parties became ally.

“In February 2005 assembly polls, JD(U) contested 128 seats and BJP 103. Similarly, JD(U) contested 139 and 141 seats in November 2005 and 2010 elections, respectively, and BJP 102 seats in both the elections,” a senior JD(U) leader told TOI.

Meanwhile, JD(U) national secretary general K C Tyagi said leaders of NDA allies should avoid issuing statement to media on the seat-sharing issue. “The seat-sharing formula will be finalized amicably by top leaders of JD(U), BJP and LJP,” Tyagi told TOI over phone.

BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand also said it is not an appropriate time to make statement on seat sharing. “It is too early. Every decision related to 2020 Bihar assembly election has to be taken by the top leadership of NDA partners,” Anand told TOI.

I would also like to thank the support staff that raises these kids,” he said.

Talking about the adoption process, the Castills told reporters that they had been trying for the past couple of years for the adoption. “I have always loved India for the people, culture, beauty and diversity. That is the reason my husband and I applied for adoption in India. This way, we can be part of this cultural experience. Kishan is the perfect completion to our family,” said Kristen.

John added that the child is a ‘gift from the above’ and he was meant to be with them. The adoption agency officials said that they conduct regular follow-ups with adopted parents and kids to ensure well-being of the child.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Water supply in the city will be normalized by Sunday evening, as Kerala water authority (KWA) completed the third-phase of renovation works of treatment plants at Aruvikkara on Saturday.

The works of 86mld water treatment plant was completed and water resources minister K Krishnankutty, in a Facebook post, said that it was completed ahead of schedule.

The shutdown was announced for six hours from 2pm to 8pm on Saturday. But the work was completed by 5pm and pumping was restarted by 5.45pm.

Work to replace old pump sets was taken up in the third phase. “Three pumps at the water treatment plant were disconnected in the third phase. The work could be completed before scheduled time and pumping was restarted,” said A Noushad, executive engineer, Aruvikkara.

“After the shutdown it takes around 24 hours for normalization of water supply. Supply will stabilize in areas such as in Kazhakkootam and Vellayambalam by Sunday evening,” said Santhosh Kumar R V, executive engineer, KWA.

The renovation work taken up in KWA’s water treatment plants will help increase supply by additional 10 million litres of water per day. The first and second phases were completed on December 13, 2019 and January 4, 2020 respectively.

In the movie Tall Tales, Vica Kerekes took on the challenging role of a woman left behind by her husband, who ... Read More

PUNE: Vica Kerekes is a truly European actress. Her parents are ethnically Hungarian but she is a Slovak national, having been born in erstwhile Slovakia, and she works in both Slovakia and Hungary .

In Atilla Szasz’s mystery/thriller movie Tall Tales — Apro Mesek in Hungarian — she took on a challenging role, playing the wife left behind while her husband is on the battlefield, set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, while being the other half of a passionate affair with a con man on the run. The screenplay of the film is by the prolific screenwriter Norbert Kobli.

Kerekes was in the city on Saturday for an interaction with the press on account of the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF). She was here to represent the film, which is part of the World Competition section and has two scheduled screenings, on January 10 and on Sunday, at the Inox Bund Garden.

She spoke as part of an interaction with the festival’s creative director Samar Nakhate at the National Film Archives of India (NFAI).

Despite the obvious challenges to the role, Kerekes, who had trained mainly in theatre at one of Hungary’s most famous acting institutes, said that she took on the role at the first available opportunity.

“I have heard of this director for a long time and I had the wish of working with him. So when he put out the call for this film, I jumped on board. This was a difficult role. The story is complicated, with the war being viewed from the eyes of a woman. And there is the obvious tension of the husband being at war, while my character is back home, trying to survive with my child,” Kerekes said, while speaking about the film.

Like other modern European cinema, this film does not shy away from the bold and shocking, which also took a physical and emotional toll on Kerekes, as she testified.

“The character is a woman, who comes with her views as well as her sexuality that she is not afraid to express. And there is a lot of emotional and physical violence meted out against her. During the shooting, I was required to be slapped a number of times till the shot was correct. That took a physical toll as well as emotional, with the humiliation that comes with every slap,” she remarked.

PUNE: The crime branch on Saturday arrested 11 men and booked four accomplices for posing as mathadi workers and demanding Rs 3.5 lakh from a Mumbai businessman.

The FIR stated that in the past two months, the suspects issued threats to the company’s officials, claiming that they would shut down construction work at the site unless they were paid a “mathadi” fee of Rs3.50 lakh. When they company’s officials pointed out that none of the 15 men had ever worked at their site, the suspects claimed that they were the only mathadi workers for the area and further pressed their extortion demand.

Police said mathadi workers cannot compel anyone to pay them if they don’t work at a site. They are on the hunt for the suspects on the run.

At present, Udham Singh is in Azamgarh jail while Yogesh Bhadaura (in white clothes) is in Sidharthanagar jail

MEERUT: Fear of a gang war between dreaded jailed gangsters Yogesh Bhadaura and Udham Singh looms large as Bhadaura’s sharpshooter 28-year-old Akshay Malik’s body was found on Saturday morning in the forested area of a Meerut village. Malik’s body has two bullet wounds.

This comes six years after another sharpshooter Nitin Kumar alias Ganja with allegiance to Udham Singh gang was shot dead inside court premises in Meerut, and Malik was named one of the accused.

Ganja had testified against Bhadaura in the court. In all, 11 persons were arrested for the murder.

In the ongoing rivalry between the two gangs close to a dozen men have been killed and 40 gang-members of both groups are currently lodged in jail.

At present, Udham Singh is in Azamgarh jail while Bhadaura is in Sidharthnagar jail.

SSP Meerut Ajay Sahani said, “Malik was one of the accused in the murder of Nitin Kumar and had arrived in Meerut court on Friday for a hearing. He was accompanied by three other associates. On Saturday morning, his body with two bullet wounds – one in head and another one in chest – was found in Kankerkhera area. As of now the needle of suspicion is towards Udham Singh. One cannot rule out the possibility of gang war now. But, we are keeping a strict vigil over the development.”

Notably, on December 18 last year, Meerut’s field unit of Special Task Force (STF) had arrested four criminals, including two sharpshooters of Udham Singh gang – Ranjit Singh, a resident of Hapur, and Ashwani Singh from Meerut.

Circle officer STF Brijesh Singh said, “We seized two pistols from Ranjit and Ashwani [both shooters of Udham Singh gang] and later more pistols were seized from a supplier for which cash was provided allegedly by Udham Singh men to cause substantial harm to Yogesh Bhadaura and his gang. From Ranjit we also recovered a letter written by Singh for Amit Bhura [another criminal] in which Udham Singh had sought alliance with Bhura to settle scores with Bhadaura. The Saturday’s killing can be linked to the development.”

According to police sources, the rivalry between Bhadaura and Udham dates back to 2009 when the two competed with each other to grab sugar mill contracts.

D Puniamma (left) and D Seliamma at the arts festival organized by Literacy Mission

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: D Puniamma, a native of Odisha, was all set to croon a Malayalam folk song while her sister D Seliamma was seen tensed and less confident about her skill to sing a Malayalam song. But both of them went on to sing the famous Malayalam song, “Ninne kaanaan enne kaalum…” and won the hearts of audience.

Puniamma and Seliamma were among the 23 women migrant labourers, who are participating in the state-level arts festival for continuing education organized by the State Literacy Mission Authority. The women, working at a firm at Kinfra, are learning Malayalam under the Changathi scheme of Literacy Mission.

“They had no base in dance forms of Kerala and we started by teaching them basic steps. They are hardworking and grasped the steps and music quickly. They are familiar with Malayalam as they are learning the language under Changathi scheme,” said Deepthi R Nair, who taught the women dance and songs.

The Bharatanatyam performance at the arts festival was special for 48-year-old Ambika Kumari P, a prerak of Literacy Mission at Perukavu centre in Vilavoorkal panchayat, as she had last performed the dance form more than three decades ago. She was accompanied by her daughter Adarsha A C. “I am excited to watch my mother perform at the arts festival,” said Adarsha.

One of the seniormost contestants in the festival is 75-year-old Naniamma from Meppadi in Wayanad. She along with classmates from Class VII equivalency programme took part in folk song competition. The folk song of Thachanadan Moopan tribe was taught to the team by Naniamma.

The festival also witnessed the participation of a few students from the transgender community. “Fearing humiliation and discrimination, I never participated in youth festivals and used to watch the programme in hiding. We do not have much platforms to showcase our talents. This arts festival is an opportunity for us and we have registered our names for all possible competitions. Though I had left school more than a decade ago, now I feel like a teenager and want to enjoy this freedom,” said Sreekutty, a transwoman who has appeared for class XII equivalency examination. Sreekutty participated in oppana, short story writing and essay writing competitions.

Miga U K (26), a transwoman who pursues class XII equivalency course, had won ‘Kalaprathibha’ title while studying in Class VIII and IX. “Then my identity was a boy and I used to conceal my desire to participate in events which I am now able to participate as a transwoman,” said Miga, who works as a makeup artist.

The festival will conclude on Sunday. On the second day, Thiruvananthapuram district was leading with 97 points followed by Thrissur at 58. Malappuram was at the third position with 55 points.

ALLAHABAD: Police in the neighbouring district of Pratapgarh on Saturday heaved a sigh of relief after the high school girl, who was allegedly kidnapped by car-borne miscreants near Dahilamau road under Kotwali police station on Friday evening, returned home safely.

SP Pratapgarh Abhishek Singh told TOI that the family members of the girl on Friday complained the police that their daughter, a high school student at a Dahiliamau-based inter college, was allegedly kidnapped by car-borne miscreants when she was returning to home from school.

“Acting upon the complaint, we had deputed three police teams and carried out checking on border areas so that the car carrying the girl could not be successful to cross the borders,” he added.

The police teams continued checking for around six hours and came to know that the girl had returned to her home safely at midnight.

When police quizzed the girl, she said that she was picked up by an acquainted youth who was in touch with her since long. The police, however, said they have been probing the case.

As we march forward into a world where payments and financial transactions are increasingly digital, criminals are finding new modi operandi to steal from unassuming citizens.

This is borne out by the rising cyber crime graph in the city, while Saturday saw three cases of cyber theft being registered in the city. Police officials said e-wallet frauds are becoming more common.

A senior cyber cell official said those using e-wallets for online payments should be careful not to click on every link they receive.

“The e-wallet companies will never send such links or ask anybody to update their KYC using them. Cyber cheats are sending out link which, the moment you click on them, transfer crucial data from your phone to them. They then siphon off money from bank accounts linked to e- wallets,” said a cyber cell official.

INDORE: Police cracked the Rs 1 crore theft at Pushkar hotel in Sarafa that took place four days ago and arrested the accused in this connection from Kakinada of Andhra Pradesh on Saturday.

The accused stayed at hotel Pushkar for 20 days by submitting fake identity cards and mobile number and while staying there got a duplicate key made. He kept waiting for a high profile victim.

Sarafa trader Surendra Pal, 39, resident of Punjab had registered a complaint that he had come to Indore to deliver order of gold and silver to the trader on January 3 with his nephew Janpreet and stayed at room number 302 of Pushkar hotel, when the incident took place.

Complainant said that he had kept jewellery in three boxes and packed it in a black bag. He said that he went to dinner on January 4 with his nephew and locked the door. When he checked his items in the morning next day, he found that they were missing following which he informed hotel administration and approached police.

Investigations were initiated in the case and it was found that the man who was staying in room number 305 of the hotel had left without checking out the same night around 10:00 pm. When his room was sifted, the packet in which complainant had kept gold was found and some keys were also recovered.

Acting on this information, officials started interrogating nearby people and checked the CCTV footage to ascertain identity of the accused. It was found that the same man had used his ATM card at a bank at Rajwada. His bank was contacted and police got his address. A team left for Kakinada but it was found that the man had been living at the said address on rent.

But when his pictures were circulated nearby, his real identity was found out to be Ramesh Babu.

After trying to look for the accused, officials found his two-wheeler parked in one of the buildings nearby based on which they raided his flat and arrested him.

Officials prepared papers of transit remand and brought him to city.

CHENNAI: Startled at six ‘original’ identity cards submitted by a PIL petitioner to prove that he is a ‘genuine’ journalist , the Madras high court has directed the Press Council of India (PCI) and the government to reveal the actual number of accredited journalists and the total number of registered newspapers/magazines in the state.

Impleading Madras Union of Journalists (MUJ), Madras Reporters Guild and the Chennai Press Club in the plea, the court directed the office-bearers of the unions to explain the eligibility of its members, last date of membership enrolment, election conducted last, details of present office-bearers and the media organisation they belong to.

“It is evident from media reports that many are claiming themselves as journalists and are committing crimes, including blackmailing business people and government officials. There should be a parameter such as minimum circulation for magazines or newspapers to claim themselves as press people. The credentials of such parties have to be verified in detail before issuing the identity cards,” said a division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran and P Velmurugan.

People with criminal background claim to be press reporters and indulge in criminal activities using it as a shield similar to criminals who purchase law degrees and use it as a shield for their criminal activities. Since the image of the media of late is damaged because of such activities, the system has to be cleaned so that the interest of genuine journalists is protected, the bench said.

The court made the observation while hearing the PIL moved by S Sekaran. Claiming to be a freelance journalist, he wanted the court to initiate action against retired IPS officer Pon Manickavel for allegedly providing false information to the court while he was a court-appointed special officer of idol wing CID. When counsel for Manickavel questioned the petitioner’s credentials as journalist, Sekaran produced six identity cards issued by the state government. Appalled over existence of six identity cards for a single ‘reporter’, the bench suo motu impleaded the PCI and the state government and directed them to file the report.

Local residents say there are not many takers for waterfront properties

KOCHI: The realty sector has taken a further beating with the pulling down of four apartment complexes at Maradu , which was once a destination for real-estate developers. As the images of demolished buildings came out, they squeezed the confidence of prospective home buyers and investors.

Local residents say there are not many takers for waterfront properties. “I have been trying to sell a waterfront property of more than one acre. But there are no takers,” said Rajan M, a real-estate dealer. He said the real estate has not been doing well for the last couple of years. With the tightening of the laws related to reclamation of waterbodies and wetlands, investors have become more watchful. “The demolition at Maradu will further alienate buyers,” he added.

Builders are cautious about launching new projects in the region. Even projects that have been completed are finding it difficult to get buyers. “A wrong message has been sent out. Even if a builder has all documents and approvals, investors are reluctant to take it. Businesses have been hurt. Kochi and its suburbs are losing out,” said a Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) member.

The general slowdown of economy has also contributed to the lack of interest in luxury projects. While home buyers are interested in projects which costs between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 70 lakh, the demand for projects above Rs 1 crore is much less.

Kerala Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s youth forum convener Rajesh Nair said, “Central and state governments should come up with measures to revive a sinking economy. Kerala is not doing enough to attract investors. Realtors are moving to other metropolitan cities in the country and exploring possibilities in foreign countries. The messages that are being sent out from the state do not inspire confidence.”

Sunila Goplan, a resident of Netoor, said the region witnessed a boom in real estate during the times when many automobile manufacturers opened showrooms along NH- 66. The coming of luxury hotels and multi-speciality hospitals also contributed to the boom. “This region was once a sleepy hamlet. A sudden spurt in economic activity resulted in increased land price. As Maradu panchayat grew into a municipality, the number of high rises and commercial centres increased,” he said.

Malappuram: In a major blow to MLA P V Anwar, who raised allegations against Malappuram district collector Jafar Malik over the rehabilitation of flood affected tribal families in Nilambur, the tribal and dalit organizations in Nilambur have extended support to the district collector for his steps to rehabilitate flood affected tribal families.

Expressing solidarity with the revenue authorities, a collective of tribal and dalit organizations will meet the district collector in the coming days.

Anwar, who alleged lapses on the part of the district collector in the rehabilitation of flood affected families in Kavalappara landslide area, blocked the ongoing construction works of 34 houses in Edakkara grama pancahayat, which were allotted to flood affected families in Chalakkal tribal colony.

The MLA alleged that the revenue authorities decided to rehabilitate families in Chalakkal colony without any discussion with the tribal families at Kavalappara. Malik had ruled out the allegations saying that houses in Edakkara panchayat were allotted to families in Chalakkal colony after families in Kavalappra rejected the offer. He also alleged a hidden motive behind Anwar’s move.

Chithra, state vice-president of Adivasi Aikya Vedi, said that revenue authorities initiated steps to allot houses in Edakkara to the families at Chalakkal colony, after families at Kavalappara informed the collector that they want land and houses only inside Pothukal panchayat. “We don’t know the politics behind the allegations. But we know that revenue authorities are trying hard to rehabilitate all flood affected tribal families in the region, when political parties are turning blind eye to our long pending demands,” she said. “The families of Chalakkal colony are the victims of landslide that occurred two years ago and they are staying in unsafe buildings since then. It is a right decision that was taken by the collector to move the families of the colony to new houses. He should proceed with the ongoing rehabilitation process without paying heed to the baseless allegations,” Chithra said.

Anil Kumar of Dalit-Adivasi Koottayma of Nilambur said that tribals or dalit families in the region are not interested in political games. But they have decided to support the revenue authority’s move to rehabilitate families at Chalakal colony. “We will meet the district collector to express our gratitude for standing with tribal families,” he said.

KOLLAM: An assistant sub-inspector (ASI) of police attached to the Ezhukone police station in the district was found hanging in the station on Saturday morning.

The deceased has been identified as D Stalin (46), Parisseri, Koduvila, Kundara. On Friday night he was the General Diary in charge at the station.

Noticing that he was not picking up the telephone, his colleagues who were on duty started looking for him and found him hanging on the veranda of the generator room. Though he was rushed to the nearby hospital he was already dead. Later, autopsy examination was conducted at the Parippally Govt Medical College Hospital and the body was handed over to the relatives.

He was staying at the Kundara police quarters. He will be buried at the St Francis Church cemetery at Koduvila on Sunday. He is survived by wife Cincy Stalin, children Aneena and Immanuel.

GD in charge ASI Beena said the death was believed to have happened in between 2.30am and 5.30am on Saturday. His colleagues at the Ezhukone police station said that they had no idea that Stalin was going through any kind of mental stress. “He was actively involved in his duty and was friendly with the colleagues. We had no knowledge that he was going through mental agony or stress,” said Beena. His colleagues also ruled out the scope of work-related stress prompting him to end his life.

However, some of the police officers here suspect that he may have been financially stressed following the purchase of a house at Keralapuram availing a bank loan. Stalin was working at Ezhukone since 2017.

After the postmortem his body was brought to the police station to facilitate his colleagues and public to pay their last respects.

Indore: Sanwer Nagar Parishad, which is located between Indore city and Ujjain, is likely to be converted into first 'Smart Parishad' of the state.

A development proposal of Rs100 crore has been sent by health minister Tulsiram Silawat, who is also MLA from Sanwer, to district administration in this regard.

The investment prioritization proposal, which has been named Sanwer City Development Plan, is based on demand and supply gap analysis for each sector of physical and social infrastructure.

“To make Sanwer ‘smart’, development in areas like water supply, sewerage and sanitation, storm water drainage, roads, traffic and transportation, street lights, social-economic sectors, urban renewal and slum improvement have been included in the proposal. The entire project is estimated to cost around Rs100 crore,” SDM Ravish Shrivastava told TOI.

The first phase of Narmada-Gambhir river link project, which was launched to supply water to 43 villages of Sanwer for drinking and irrigation purpose on Friday, is a part of administration’s ‘smart solution’ to reduce Sanwer’s dependency on groundwater sources. In coming days, this water supply would be extended to 182 villages.

Recently, urban administration minister Jaivardhan Singh had instructed officials to launch a survey to extend Indore metro rail service, which is under construction, to Ujjain via Sanwer, a step that will further benefit Sanwer in terms of public transport.

“We have received a proposal from the minister for developing Sanwer Nagar Parishad on the lines of Smart City. We are examining the proposal and looking at ways to use available resources, CSR funds and sections from the funds allotted by MLAs and MP for the purpose,” district collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav said.

He said that proposal was at initial level at present and further course of action would be taken based on feasibility of the plan.

Ahmedabad: Multiple teams of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) in Gujarat have carried out searches in Surat, Vapi, and Ahmedabad in connection with the alleged evasion of customs duty. Investigations had suggested the evasion of Rs 80 crore on goods worth Rs 1,300 crore by copper wire manufacturers based in Nashik and Pune. It is alleged that the manufacturers fraudulently availed of concessional rate of duty on wires of under 8mm.

“Working on specific intelligence, the DRI teams carried out searches and found that three proprietorship firms located in Nashik and Pune fraudulently availed of benefit of customs notification 25/99,” said an official. “Under the notification, they were importing Electrolytic Tough Pitch (ETP) copper wire rods of 8mm under the concessional rate of duty.”

None of the factory premises had any facility to manufacture lead wires for electronic parts (LWEP) which is required under law. DRI officials said that the proprietors and top officials confessed that they had never manufactured LWEP and the imported ETP rods were sold in the open market. The agency has identified a few persons based in Mumbai and Pune as the ‘masterminds’ of the evasion.

“About 544 metric tons (MT) of copper wires and ETP copper rods worth Rs 25.3 crore were seized at JNCH port under the provisions of the Customs Act as these consignments were imported under the concessional rate of duty,” the official said. “The firms have so far imported 27,700MT of ETP rods and copper wires worth Rs 1,300 crore.”

BENGALURU: The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Bengaluru arrested three interstate drug peddlers and seized more than a kg of charas and half a kg of methamphetamine earlier this week.

Muhammed Mushin, Asif Puthan and Mohammad Azarudeen, all aged under 30 and residents of Kasaragod in Kerala, had come to Bengaluru to supply drugs to their customers.

Based on a tip-off, NCB sleuths raided a serviced apartment in Sanjaynagar on Tuesday and arrested the three men who were in possession of the drugs. Officials said the banned substances were reportedly procured from Goa. The trio had arrived in Bengaluru on January 4.

An official said the accused were active in south India and were supplying drugs using their car. They were produced before

narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances trial sessions judge GM Shenappa who granted NCB six-day custody.

Sources in the police department said preliminary investigation showed the men would often travel to Bengaluru to supply drugs. They could not, however, confirm if they had any information on other dealers they may have employed.

One source said the going price for a kg of charas was about Rs 4 lakh and that dealers could make much more if they sold it in smaller quantities and not as wholesale. The seized quantity of methamphetamine, the source said, could be valued at around Rs 4 lakh, going up to Rs 5 lakh.

Pointing out that both charas and methamphetamine are used as party and recreational drugs, officials said the latter is a very powerful stimulant, even in small doses.

For the next 30 days, this song will resonate with the people of Delhi,” he said.

AAP has formed 20 “flash mob” teams to perform on this song across the city, and several more will be added in the coming days.

91,['12/01/2020'],Don’t heed social media posts on thefts: Mangaluru top cop,"This story is from January 12, 2020

MANGALURU: City police chief P S Harsha said that some people are trying to spread rumours on social media that burglaries are happening due to an organised gang operating in the city. He asked the public not to give heed to such rumours, and at the same time stay safe.

This warning comes after a series of social media forwards which claimed that a gang which poses as sales representatives, try to visit houses as well as apartments and later flee with whatever they get from the target’s house. The message further said that all these miscreants dress well and visit homes, which doesn’t raise suspicion among residents as well as security staff at apartments.

However, a social media message which went viral recently, pointed out that an unidentified person, who approached the security staff at an apartment and said that he wants to meet a particular person residing there, which is situated on VT Road.

The security let him in without further questions. After opening the door, the accused had claimed that he is a sales representative from a well known pharmaceutical company to the apartment owner.

He also said that his company is organising a Satyanarayana puja and wants a donation for the same.

After giving money to the accused, the house owner noticed that his cellphone was missing, and taken away by the visitor. “The accused wasn’t a stranger to the complainant, but an acquaintance,” Harsha clarified.

‘Burglary carried out by acquaintance’

Harsha further clarified that a burglary at an apartment situated on VT Road, Mangaluru, which was widely circulated on social media, was carried out by an acquaintance of the complainant.

“The accused had visited the complainant’s house several times, and on one occasion he had stolen the victim’s cellphone. The same was recovered and handed over to the complainant. Even the photos circulated along with the message were fake. The entire message is fake and misleading,” said Harsha.

A similar incident took place at the city’s oldest college. A lecturer told STOI that the suspected thief’s image was captured on CCTV cameras.

He entered the college premises and broke into the staff room. However, the thief left empty-handed as there was no cash or any valuables at the office. Harsha said that this case is genuine, and it is committed by a petty thief. “We have credible information about the thief, and he will be arrested soon,” he said.

Rumours of well-dressed thieves doing the rounds

Apart from it, social media messages are doing the rounds that thieves are moving around Mangaluru city. They look smart and well educated.

They are also smart with professional skills in planning and execution of stealing valuables like cash, gold, two-wheelers and credit and debit cards from offices, said sources.

Residents are advised not to believe in messages on social media. It is better to cross check with the police, in case such messages are seen on social media. Victims are advised to report any robbery or theft to police, after which an investigation will be carried out, said P S Harsha, city police commissioner.

Malappuram: The family of a 39-year-old man, who died at the Government Medical College, Manjeri, on Friday, have raised allegations of medical negligence.

A complaint filed with the police said that Palathingal Prakashan, who was admitted to the hospital with ear pain at 11am on Friday, died around 7pm after he was administered an injection for pain relief. According to Palathingal Balan, a relative of the deceased, Prakashan was administered a test dose of the injection at 3pm. “He was administered the main dose of injection around 7pm following which he suffered severe back pain, and death occurred within minutes,” he said.

Relatives have alleged in the complaint that the hospital lacked facility to address an emergency and the person died due to lapses from the part of hospital staff. They protested in front of the hospital on Friday night. Local residents too had joined them. Following this, hospital authorities held a discussion with the relatives. But the relatives approached police demanding a detailed probe.

Meanwhile, Manjeri police have registered a case based on the complaint. Police said the cause of the death can be ascertained only after receiving postmortem report.

The body was handed over to relatives on Saturday after completing postmortem examination at the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

DEHRADUN: Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) has decided to exempt wives and mothers of Army personnel from paying house tax. The DMC took the decision during its board meeting along with some other major decisions. Earlier, only those properties were exempted from house tax payments which were registered in the name of Army personnel but from now onwards, the exemption will also apply to the properties that are registered in the name of wife or mother of an Army personnel.

The municipal corporation has also decided to give ownership rights to 129 slum settlements in Dehradun. The residents of these slums had been demanding ownership rights for a while and most of the residents were not willing to pay the house tax without it. The DMC has decided to award ownership rights to nearly 2 lakh slum residents, who live in these colonies, since they were registered in DMC records. Notably, the DMC hasn’t recognised any slum in Dehradun since 2007.

The DMC also released an additional budget for all ward councillors for the ongoing fiscal year. Councillors of the old wards will be given an extra Rs 10 lakh while 32 councillors of the newly-added wards will be given an additional Rs 15 lakh.

Notably, the councillors were issued with Rs 20 lakh each for the current fiscal year.

During the meet, Amita Singh, ward councilor of Vijay Park, expresseed concern over the high amount of money demanded by eunuch community from locals on auspicious days. Singh proposed that a price slab for their demand should be framed. The city’s civic body agreed to this proposal and formed a committee to fix the slab.

Representative image

INDORE: The ongoing physical verification work under garbage-free star rating protocol of Swachh Survekshan 2020 seems to have forced Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) to halt its demolition drive till the survey gets over.

A team from the Centre’s is conducting field assessment work in city to verify claims of IMC for the star rating protocol.

Civic body official said that this survey will continue for about a week or so, and there would not be any major demolition action till the survey gets over.

“Since most of IMC officials and staff are engaged in maintaining cleanliness and sanitation standards in their respective zones for the ongoing survey for seven-star garbage-free rating, so carrying a demolition action is not possible until it’s very necessary. Obtaining maximum marks under this survey is our priority now,” IMC’s building permission cell in-charge OP Goyal said.

He said that all staff and officials including those of building permission cell and removal wing have been instructed to focus on ensuring that all measures and arrangements are in place till completion of the survey.

“This star rating survey holds a big share of total marks under Swachh Survekshan 2020, and this instruction has been issued in view of the same,” he added.

The corporation has already issued notices to dozens of illegal constructions in areas like Khajrana, Gandhi Nagar, 60ft Road etc. and an action against them is pending, claimed sources.

A 15-member team including 14 assessors are out on fields visiting random locations to verify prescribed standards of the survey which hold 1000 marks out of 6000 marks under Swacch Survekshan 2020.

Corporation officials are on their toes to ensure presence of all prescribed standards in their respective zones and areas

Mullappally Ramachandran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Lashing out at chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran said that the CM’s “stand as a protector of minority communities was a sham” and called him “a man with Sangh Parivar mind”.

Replying to the statement from CPM state secretariat that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sangh Parivar were the beneficiaries of Ramachandran’s anti-chief minister stand, Ramachandran said that the chief minister’s mindset was very evident from his present and past actions.

“His claims that he is the protector of minority communities, let him come to northern Kerala. A large number of people whose lives have been taken by his partymen are from minority communities. He is a man with Sangh Parivar mind and whatever his actions are, he is doing it to please Modi and Amit Shah,” Ramachandran said.

He said that the chief minister slapped UAPA charges on his own partymen in Kozhikode , while also gunning down seven Maoists.

The KPCC president said that he does not intend to use his party post for praising the chief minister. “After Vijayan took over as chief minister, as many as 30 political murders took place and most of the victims are Congress activists. CPM has spent as much as Rs 1.16 crore for paying the advocates to save the culprits of these murders like that of Kripesh and Sarath Lal. If I joined hands with CPM, I don’t think their souls will forgive me,” he said.

Ramachandran said that everyone knows that there is no legal or constitutional validity for the resolution passed by the state assembly against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), but Congress supported it in the assembly only because it gives a message. “It is Congress that is leading the protests against CAA across the country. Even in the state, the chief minister slapped charges on 58 people, including Congress leaders like T Siddique, who were protesting against CAA,” he said.

In a statement on Friday, CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan had said that no Keralite would believe Ramachandran’s words that the chief minister is taking an extreme Hindutva stand. The statement also said that it is when the chief minister is leading a nation-wide protest against CAA that the KPCC chief is attacking the chief minister.

He further said that the Sultan had taken a proactive role in maintaining peace and cordial atmosphere in the Arab world and he also maintained a very close relation with his people.

He also ensured that expats, including Keralites, in Oman were given enough facilities and security. Through his demise, the world lost a kind ruler, the chief minister said in his statement. The Arab world’s longest ruling monarch died at the age of 79 on Friday.

Indore: Indore Development Authority (IDA) will cancel allotment of plot of iron traders, who have not shifted to New Lohamandi despite being given land in the area. It has started a survey to make a list of traders, who have not shifted to new place.

“We have launched a survey of iron traders, who have been allotted plots in New Lohamandi but not shifted in the area. Based on the survey report, notice will be issued to errant traders. Subsequently, their allotment will be cancelled,” the authority CEO Vivek Shrotriya told TOI.

In 2006, IDA had allotted 323 plots in New Lohamandi to iron traders associated with Indore Loha Vyapari Association (ILVA) and operating from Hathipala and nearby areas. The move was aimed at easing traffic in the areas. But, after several efforts, only 50 traders moved to the new place. The remaining shop owners are still operating from Hathipala, South Hathipala, Daulatganj, Jawahar Marg and nearby areas.

The shops operating from Hathipala and nearby areas cause huge inconvenience to locals. They are also posing hurdles in implementation of systematic development plan of the city. The administration has also written to ILVA president Amir Engineerwala asking him to have discussion with the iron traders and encourage them to shift.

Though many traders are yet to shift to the new market, ILVA has demanded district administration to accommodate some more iron traders at New Lohamandi and give them more space to transport goods.

Chennai metro trains

CHENNAI: Even as construction is set to commence on a part of the ambitious 118.9km phase-2 metro rail in June 2020, Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has begun scouting for a general consultant with the required expertise and oversee the construction of another portion of the corridors.

CMRL has called for expression of interest from firms to work as a general consultant for corridor-4 of phase-2. The corridor will be from Lighthouse to Poonamallee bypass covering 26.1km. Officials said tenders for construction of the corridor are likely to be floated in two months. “CMRL will require more than 30,000 people to execute such a massive project. A general consultant will bring in the experts required from across the world during various stages of construction, since CMRL being a government agency won’t be able to do it on its own,” an official said. This comes after China-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank agreed to fund the construction of a part of corridor-4 between Meenakshi College and Poonamallee bypass. Officials said construction of the rest of the corridor from Lighthouse to Meenakshi College will be funded by Asian Development Bank .

While construction will begin initially on the 52km line between Madhavaram and Sholinganallur and from Madhavaram to CMBT, which are part of corridors 3 and 5, in June 2020, construction for corridor-4 is likely to begin a few months later. If work progresses without delays, officials said the phase may be ready for operations by 2026.

The corridor, which cuts across the heart of the city, links many core localities like Mylapore, Nandanam, T Nagar, Kodambakkam and Vadapalani with suburban areas like Porur, Kattupakkam, Kumanan Chavadi, Karayanchavadi and Poonamallee, which have relatively poor public transport connectivity. The corridor is also called ‘orbital corridor’ as it links the rest of the corridors in phase-1 and 2.

“Our detailed design consultant is on the job. Soil test has been done. Construction tenders are likely to be floated in two or three months,” an official said on the work on the line between Meenakshi College and Poonamallee bypass.

General consultants will assist in reviewing the detailed designs submitted by contractors, monitoring construction through all stages – from foundation laying to installation of signalling and electrical systems as well as suppliers and manufacturers, quality control and safety, contract management for the project, planning operation and maintenance and training personnel.

ALLAHABAD: At a time when the government is drawing flak for muffling voices of protesters over the new citizenship law, more than 2,000 members of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) organised a ‘ Tiranga Yatra’ to muster support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Allahabad on Saturday.

The event was attended by BJP MPs, MLAs, office-bearers and members of BJP’s youth wing. The march started from the KP College Ground at MG Road, halted for a few minutes at Subhas Crossing in Civil Lines, moved towards Vivekanand Crossing at GT road and then returned to the starting point.

The march was organised despite section 144 being imposed across the state following the violent anti-CAA protests reported in December 2019. SSP (Allahabad) Satyarth Aniruddh Pankaj said, “The march was peacefully and no untoward incident was reported. The parties had sought prior permission for organising the march. There were ample policemen deployed along the route of the yatra for security.”

A kilometre-long tricolour carried by party members was the highlight of the march. While most of the participants chose to walk, a number of leaders rode in vehicles.

Chanting slogans like ‘Bharat maata ki jai’ and ‘Vande Matram’, participants were seen holding placards in their hands in support of CAA.

Provincial Armed Constabulary and police personnel walked along with the leaders during the yatra.

“The yatra was a grand success and the sheer number of people who gathered speaks volumes about the support that CAA enjoys among the masses,” said Vinay Kumar Mishra of BJP’s Yuva Morcha.

NEW DELHI: The average travel time between Noida and south Delhi has more than doubled after the closure of Road No 13A, which links Kalindi Kunj and Noida, due to anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters occupying it. Consequently, traffic cops estimate that Mathura Road and Ring Road are currently bearing vehicular volume almost four times their capacity.Traffic police said that vehicles from south Delhi destined for Noida are being diverted to Mathura Road to reach Ashram and then to DND Flyway . Police are forced to manually control the traffic signals to prevent a standstill on the road. Even those taking the Barapullah elevated road are finding that this is no easy way out.The stretch also gets choked at peak hours, and insiders say that a 50% increase in the number of vehicles plying between Delhi and Noida is creating big jams there.For the past few days, a drive on the Barapullah road to reach Noida from Lajpat Nagar has been taking 2 hours and 20 minutes, while the same past Ashram takes about two hours. As for the third route, the Noida Link Road, a commuter claimed that the time to reach Noida from Okhla is now an hour and a half compared with 45 minutes earlier.Apart from cars, more than 5,000 trucks that normally used the Kalindi Kunj road to reach the Okha Industrial Area are now being diverted through Ashram. This leads to a mess since Ashram Chowk is already constricted due to the construction of an underpass there.As an alternative passage, the police cleared the Kalindi Kunj-Mithapur Road for traffic, but the road was found to be heavily damaged due to lack of maintenance.Social activist and Sarita Vihar resident Ashok Bidhuri, who has called for a sit-in on Mathura Road on Sunday to press for the shifting of the anti-CAA protest someplace else, said that in order to avoid the snarls, most residents of south-east Delhi are opting to travel to Badarpur and then accessing Mathura Road. He said, “These days you either drive 7-8 km extra to reach your destination or idle on the road for two hours. The increased volume is taking a toll of the road infrastructure too.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209687,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-550399,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/travel-time-up-by-2-hours-as-protest-forces-road-closure/articleshow/73209218.cms

The conclave on Saturday was attended by students from over 90 institutes across the country.

CM Rawat further held forth on management lessons students could learn from personalities like Hanuman and Swami Vivekanand. “Lord Hanuman never relaxed before completing his work. Likewise, Swami Vivekanand also gave us the mantra of ‘rise, awake and do not stop till the time you achieve your goal.’ This dedication towards one’s work is the foremost quality in management,” the chief minister said. He added that “India is a young nation and in the coming years,our country will be the guiding force of the world.”

DEHRADUn: Local residents, who were on an indefinite hunger strike demanding that the Shishambara waste plant be moved to a different location, broke their fast on Saturday after Uttarakhand Congress president Pritam Singh appealed them to do so.

Rajesh Sharma, Rita Sharma and Neelam Thapa broke their fast by drinking juice. Rajesh Sharma had been fasting for the past 14 days. Singh assured the protesters that the Congress party will join them in demanding that the plant, a health hazard to residents nearby, be moved elsewhere.

106,['12/01/2020'],300 Indians stranded at Al Maktoum Airport near Dubai,"This story is from January 12, 2020

HYDERABAD: About 300 Indian passengers, many of them from Hyderabad, were stranded for over 12 hours without food or water at the Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) on Saturday after their flight to Dubai was diverted due to heavy rainfall. Terminal 1 at the Dubai International Airport (DBX) was, reportedly, flooded.

Many passengers travelling onwards to the United States missed their connections from Dubai and as flights out of the airport were cancelled. They were rebooked on flights for January 14 or later.

Helpless passengers reached out to their families back home complaining about chaos at Al Maktoum – 37 km southwest of Dubai – and lack of support from airline operators. Till late evening, many were not even given accommodation.

Speaking to STOI from Al Maktoum, Prashanth Shanmugam who boarded a Hyderabad-Dubai Emirates flight, EK 525, at 4.30am said: “There is no Emirates official in this airport. No one here knows how to get us to Dubai. Most of our connecting flights to Seattle/San Francisco/Boston are rescheduled for January 14 and 15.”

Emirates, meanwhile, issued an advisory for its passengers which read: “Heavy rainfall has caused disruptions to several flights departing from or arriving at Dubai. Customers are requested to check their flight status on https://emirates.com/flightstatus for the latest information.” It also assured alternate arrangements for passengers who missed their connections.

Shanmugam was originally scheduled to take a 9.55 am (local time) flight to Seattle from Dubai on January 11. “Yet, I have not got any hotel confirmation from the airlines for the delay nor advise to proceed further to reach Dubai airport ,” he said confirming that most flyers stranded are Indian, travelling to different parts of the world through Emirates.

“My wife is travelling to San Francisco. Stranded for a long time at DWC Airport. She is now standing in some line to collect hotel vouchers. Not sure when she will get that, and how she will manage afterwards. Her connecting flight is now booked on January 14,” said Subrahmanyam who reached out to STOI through social media. His wife was on the same flight and missed her connection.

A message he received from her read: “Around 300 passengers are waiting clueless about what to do. Most of us missed flights. They are asking us to buy Dubai visa…but then we do not know where to buy…I have few dollars with which I can buy but still there is no proper process.”

Another harried passenger, Nitin Agarwal, that STOI interacted with was stuck at the Rasal Khaimah airport, over 100 km from Dubai, for 12 hours. His Fly Dubai flight was redirected, due to the same reason. “Reached Dubai but stuck here,” he later told STOI.

The march was in support of two workers who are on hunger strike

DEHRADUN: Upset at the state government for not paying any heed to the hunger strike by two of their colleagues who have been protesting for the past two days, several anganwadi workers conducted a candlelight march from Parade Ground to Kanak Chowk on Saturday. They assembled at Clock Tower and then returned to Parade Ground.

“For us, this government is dead and we are paying our homage by conducting candlelight march. They are not paying attention to these two women who are on a hunger strike since Saturday risking their lives. It seems that the government wants them to die,” said Rekha Negi, president, Anganwadi Karyakarta Union.

Various other unions of the state have also extended their support to Savita Sharma and Shashi Thapa, the two anganwadi workers who are on hunger strike.

The anganwadi workers are demanding at least Rs 600 daily wage and job regularisatiofrom the state government. In support of their demands, thousands of anganwadi workers from across the state have congregated in Dehradun since the past week and threatened to take their protest further if the state government did not meet their demands.

The anganwadi workers also alleged that they are being put under pressure to resume work else they would be “sacked from their jobs”, which they say, is “violation of human rights”.

“Threatening to remove us from jobs is a clear violation of our human rights. Neither they want us to take decent salary home, nor they want us to raise voice against their atrocities. We are being treated like bonded labourers by the department,” Negi added.

“They are putting pressure on us because all the frontline workers across the state have boycotted work, which means health work such as immunisation and household surveys are on hold for an indefinite period. On Saturday, too, no one from the government bothered to listen to us,” Negi alleged.

110,['12/01/2020'],Maharashtra to recruit teachers soon to fill up vacancies in varsities,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Representative image

PUNE: The state government will soon publish advertisements and recruit full-time teachers to fill vacancies in state universities, assured minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant here on Saturday.

Samant, who was on his first visit to Savitribai Phule Pune University , said the government would constitute a committee to review the recruitment of teachers in colleges affiliated to various universities.

State universities had not recruited full-time teachers for a several years, mainly owing to problems related to the preparation of the roster, which decides how many posts are reserved under which category.

“SPPU has grown manifold in terms of the number of students and infrastructure. But many teachers have retired and the university has had to appoint temporary teachers to ensure smooth functioning,” Samant said.

Samant said the process to fill these vacancies on a full-time basis would start soon. “There are 111 vacant posts in SPPU. Within a month, advertisements for recruitment would be out, following which the process would be completed in a few months,” he said.

Samant interacted with the state’s general administration department resolve the problems with the roster. A government resolution (GR) would soon be issued, clarifying the recruitment process, he said.

Samant further said he would meet Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, over the recruitment of non-teaching staff as well.

The minister further said the government would issue a government resolution on the development of SPPU sub-centres in Nashik and Ahmednagar. “Of the 7 lakh or so students under SPPU, around 2 lakh would benefit from the sub-centres. Hence, the sub-centres’ development had been a major demand among students,” Samant said.

“The main problem was that the land acquired in Nashik had a highway passing through it. So we decided to build the sub-centre on both sides of the highway, with the academic-administrative building on one side and the residential part on the other. A GR would be issued in 15 days or so and we would be hold the bhoomi poojan in two to three months,” he said.

An independent university for the Konkan region was also under consideration, Samant said, adding that a committee has already been constituted in this regard. “This university will focus on courses related to the Konkan area. We have roped in experts for the committee and hope that courses that have a local impact, such as marine, fisheries, tourism, skill development, among others, will be run there,” he said.

Gaping potholes on Rajpur Road near the secretariat building

DEHRADUN: Termed by many as the lifeline of Doon , Rajpur road is the town’s premier road which houses various government offices, shopping complexes, hotels, restaurants and other major buildings. Besides being the major road in Dehradun, it is also the approach road to Mussoorie and bears the maximum brunt of vehicular pressure, including that of tourist vehicles going towards and coming back from Mussoorie.

However, in spite of it being perhaps the most significant road in the state capital, the state of its maintenance leaves many question marks. A TOI spot survey of the almost 9-km long road that extends from Clock Tower to Rajpur village found potholes and uneven patches at many points — at places like Astley Hall, Behl Chowk, Dilaram Bazaar, NIEPVD and Jakhan, to name a few.

Speaking to TOI, residents and establishment owners also lamented the fact that the Public Works Department (PWD) responsible for maintenance of the road has not been doing its job properly. “One can see that small and big potholes are there throughout the road . The biggest issue is that in the name of maintenance, the department is adding layers on Rajpur road. This has increased the height of the road which has led to frequent water stagnation and has eroded the quality of the road,” said Manjeet Singh, an optical shop owner.

In a similar vein, Renee Das, a resident said, “The quality of maintenance work is abysmal to say the least. After just a few spells of rain, the top surface of the road near my house has washed away. If this is how they are maintaining a premier road like Rajpur Road, then one cannot imagine how other roads are being maintained.”

PWD officials when contacted, refused to acknowledge that they were at fault. “Our department is consistently doing the repairing of the potholes and we have covered almost all of them. The condition of the road is up to the standard,” claimed Jagmohan Chauhan, executive engineer of PWD.

Unfortunately, the ground situation seems to suggest otherwise. Perhaps it is time for the department to get a reality check done.

HYDERABAD: Peeved over his wife refusing to give him money to buy alcohol, a watchman allegedly throttled his five-year-old daughter to death at Balaji Nagar in LB Nagar on Saturday morning. He was subsequently arrested.

On Friday night, Durga Rao, a watchman, picked up a quarrel with his wife Ganga Bhavani, a domestic help, after she refused to give him money to buy alcohol, LB Nagar police said. They had two daughters.

Around 5am on Saturday, Bhavani woke up and hours later got her daughters ready for school. Around 7am, Bhavani woke up Durga Rao and told him to drop their two daughters —Sindhu,7, and Yamini, 5 — at their school. Later, she left the residence to attend work in nearby houses.

When she returned home around 9.45am, Bhavani found that her younger daughter was sleeping, while the elder one had gone to school. As Yamini was not responding, Bhavani with the help of her brother, who resides nearby, took her to a private hospital where she was declared brought dead. After doctors found injuries on the victim’s neck, the family alerted police and Bhavani lodged a complaint against her husband.

During investigation, police came to know that Durga Rao had throttled Yamini to death as Bhavani refused to give him money. In the past too, he threatened Bhavani to kill her and their children if she did not give him money to buy liquor, police said.

NEW DELHI: High ammonia levels due to “industrial waste” being discharged in Yamuna has again started affecting water supply in the city, with several water treatment plants working at lower capacities straining the supply network. Senior Delhi Jal Board (DJB) officials have attributed the crisis to effluents coming from Haryana ’s Panipat drain.

“Currently two treatment plants at Chandrawal and Wazirabad are operating at half of their capacity. Overall water production is down by almost 100 million gallons per day,” a DJB official told TOI. With the city going into election mode, the matter may snowball into a political crisis if the situation continues to remain like this and ammonia levels keep rising.

Dinesh Mohaniya, vice-chairperson of DJB, said an increase in ammonia levels have been witnessed in Yamuna water coming from Haryana, but the impact on water supply is not massive as the demand of water is currently low, which can be attributed to the cold weather. “We are able to manage it. We face this problem every year in winter season. When the river is receiving good sunlight, ammonia gets evaporated. Since there is no decrease in contaminants from Haryana side, this problem surfaces in winter months,” Mohaniya said.

As per the last tests available, the raw water ammonia readings were hovering between 1.8 and 2 ppm while DJB has the capacity to treat ammonia levels up to 0.9 ppm, the official added. “DJB has a capacity to treat up to 0.9ppm of ammonia levels in raw water but neutralisation of ammonia with chlorine gas on regular basis at such high levels leads to creation of toxic chlorine based by-products and therefore should be avoided for human consumption. The limit set by Bureau of India Standards is 0.5ppm,”official said.

Hyderabad: City doctors performed a modified Capanna’s technique (a procedure to reconstruct bone) on a 24-year-old woman who had suffered a femur fracture in a bomb blast in Yemen in 2014. It is touted to be the first such case in the two states. The woman is now able to walk with a stick.

Suaad Ahmed Hamed had suffered a left femur fracture with around 15 cm bone loss and was operated twice in Yemen in 2015 as she had implant failure and was unable to walk since then. After the botched surgery , she came to the city in October 2019 and had been undergoing treatment at a private hospital at Gachibowli.

“Usually, such type of bone loss is seen only in major road accidents or bomb blasts. There are various methods to treat such conditions, but they need prolonged treatment and multi-stage procedures. We decided to perform the modified Capanna’s technique because it is a definitive single-stage reconstruction using a combination of free vascularised fibular graft with allograft,” said Dr AV Gurava Reddy, MD and chief joint replacement surgeon , Sunshine Group of Hospitals. She underwent surgery in November. After physiotherapy and follow-up treatment, she was discharged recently.

Allograft (femur bone) was brought from a bone bank in Bengaluru and vascularised fibula was taken from the patient with support of plastic surgeons Dr Ravichander Rao and Dr Venkatesh.

Kannur: Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan alleged that the present campaign in Kerala in the name of opposing Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is part of an agenda to “create fear among people”.

Inaugurating the 35th annual meeting of Bharatiya Vichara Kendram here on Saturday, he said that the leaders from Mahathma Gandhi to Prakash Karat had demanded such a legislation.

“In 1964, CPM leader Bhupesh Gupta said the minorities in Pakistan were being tortured and they should be given asylum here and he even demanded this in Lok Sabha. Then home minister Gulzarilal Nanda had even favourably responded and this has been documented,” he claimed.

“It is the same rule that home minister Amit Shah has implemented now,” claimed the Union minister, who added that the National Registry of Citizens was announced by Rajiv Gandhi, while the National Population Registry was announced by Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. “But, the real picture is not reaching the people of Kerala,” he said.

Fiercely attacking the developments at the inaugural venue of Indian History Congress, he said that some of the speakers at the function raised some subjects that were not related to history. And when governor Arif Mohammed Khan replied to this, they “reacted like street goons”.

Meanwhile, Kendram director P Parameshwaran, who lit the lamp, felt discomfort and collapsed at the venue, following which he was rushed to a hospital. His health condition has improved now, said BJP leadership.

GUWAHATI: In an attempt to pacify anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters, the Centre is likely to put in place some ""not-so-soft"" rules for non-Muslim illegal Bangladeshi migrants to obtain citizenship under CAA in Assam. It may also back every recommendation by a special panel for providing constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to Assamese language and culture.

A source privy to home minister Amit Shah's meeting with CM Sarbananda Sonowal and finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday said, ""The discussion was on two issues... implementation of Clause 6 of Assam Accord and inclusion of some additional points exclusively of execution in the state in the rules of the Act that are being formed."" ""The home minister is likely to accept the recommendations on implementation of Clause 6 (of the Assam Accord). The committee will submit a report on January 15 and the members will meet Shah in New Delhi tomorrow (Sunday),"" the source said.

""We will ensure Assam's interests are not hampered in any way. I have informed PM Modi and the home minister about the ongoing agitation and the aspirations, fears and feelings of the protesters,"" Sonowal had told TOI on January 1. Sonowal had then hinted that he would want some strict measures in place. He had said, ""The number of people who will be eligible to apply will not impact the demography of the state and each applicant will be examined for eligibility.""

He had also asserted that Assam will forever remain safe and secure and his government will implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord as soon as it gets recommendations of the high-powered committee. The Clause 6 of the Accord signed in 1985 between the Centre, Assam and the leaders of the six-year long anti-foreigners' protestsays ""Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people."" This clause has not been implemented in 34 years.

Aasu's Samujjal Bhattacharya said, ""The constitutional safeguard provided by Clause 6 is due to people of Assam because we have taken the burden of illegal Bangladeshi national who have entered between 1965 and 1971, and so we need constitutional safeguard to our language and culture. But, this cannot be the bargaining point."" The committee is also mandated to determine the appropriate level of reservation of seats in the assembly and local bodies for the Assamese people.

A defunct timer near Ravindra Bharathi in the city

HYDERABAD: Timers at traffic signals that help motorists save fuel by switching off their engines while waiting will soon be phased out due to technical glitches.

These timers, that were introduced as part of Hyderabad Traffic Integrated Management System (HTRIMS) in 2014, eased traffic on busy stretches as commuters could calculate the time they had to wait at a signal.

A few commuters with whom STOI interacted said these timers made their travel safe. “Without the timers it is difficult to predict how long we have to wait at a signal, especially during peak hours. At many signals, we see how most people are unable to decide if they must stop or proceed when the light changes,” said M Ravikanth, a software professional.

Another commuter Sudha Rani said, “I have seen a lot of motorists speed through a signal as soon as it turns amber. Timers can be helpful in such situations as motorists will be able to see the amount of time left before the lights change colour.”

The countdown timers which were installed at almost all major junctions have slowly stopped working since December 2017 due to technical glitches and the authorities are unable to repair them. “These timers were working fine till December 2017, but eventually they stopped working as the maintenance staff have not been able to repair them regularly,” said a source.

When contacted, additional commissioner of police (traffic) Anil Kumar said, “We are in the process of going for new tenders for proper maintenance of the existing timers and installing new ones wherever necessary.”

Currently, contractors hired by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), who work directly under GHMC, are maintaining these timers in the city. “Since BEL’s contract is going to end in February, we will float tenders for new agencies after Sankranti. We will select the new agency only after they show us their technology,” said K Raju, deputy executive engineer of the electrical of quality control department, GHMC.

CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation will hold a polio vaccination drive on January 19 for inoculating children up to the age of five, said an official release on Saturday.

The population of children aged five and below in the city is estimated to be around 7.03 lakh. According to official data, in the campaigns held on January 28 and March 11, 2018, and March 10, 2019, the number of children vaccinated were 7.49 lakh, 7.5 lakh and 7.55 lakh respectively. This was 105%-106% of the population of children in the city, indicating that a huge number of migrant labourers also participated in the initiative.

On January 19 (Sunday), the corporation will conduct the drive across 1,645 camps, the release said. These will come up at community halls, government hospitals, schools, private hospitals, railway stations, bus terminuses and other public places. The drive will commence at 7am and will be open till 5pm. Around 7,000 members, including government officials as well as voluntary staff, have been deputed for the same. “People should visit camps which are near their homes,” the release said. Children, who would be administered the vaccine, will be marked with ink on the little finger of the left hand.

Kozhikode: Desha Raksha Sammelanam, a meeting organized by Wisdom Islamic Organisation, has suggested that an all-party delegation of MPs should visit Uttar Pradesh where alleged incidents of police brutality were being reported following protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

A resolution adopted at the meeting held here on Saturday said the delegation should assess the ground realities in the state.

The internet ban prevailing in many parts of the country is the latest example of the Union government’s “attitude of escapism” and the ban has pushed the country back in many respects, the resolution said.

Plurality is the strength of the country, but the Centre was trying to eradicate the unique feature of India. CAA was not merely an issue concerning the Muslims but a challenge to the democratic values of the country, it further said.

IUML national vice-president M P Abdusamad Samadani inaugurated the conference.

Piles of segregated waste on SPPU’s main ground

PUNE: Waste and discarded items lying on the main ground of the Savitribai Phule Pune University are an eyesore for visitors for sure, but they “added” over Rs1 lakh to the varsity’s coffers.

Last month, the Savitribai Phule Pune University ( SPPU ) had undertaken a cleanliness drive. The waste collected from the buildings on the campus was segregated and auctioned.

“We had roped in our faculty and students to undertake the cleanliness drive to combat mosquito breeding on the campus. Around 100 truckloads of waste was collected and segregated. To ensure proper waste management, an online auction was conducted. At present, vendors are taking away their items from the campus,” said Prafulla Pawar, registrar, SPPU.

Eight metric tonnes of electronic discard and five tonnes of electrical waste were purchased by vendors for around Rs35,000 and Rs73,000 respectively. The heap of discard, however, is yet to be cleared.

When asked about the delay in vendors taking away the scrap, Deepak Tupekar, the executive engineer at estate department, said, “Each scarp item is weighed and inspected to make sure the vendors take away only their items. Moreover, it also takes time for the vendors to submit their security deposit in each category.”

Pune: A minor scuffle broke out between a small group of students and police on the Savitribai Phule Pune University campus on Saturday morning.

The protesters, around 40 in number, were registered with SPPU’s ‘earn and learn’ scheme and had gathered at 11am to demand free sweaters, an increased stipend and to be allowed to work on Sundays and other public holidays.

Police arrived at the spot and tried to forcibly move the protesters to a nearby van, when a scuffle ensued. The police didn’t press any charges. No one was seriously injured in the melee. “One student suffered scratches. We were allowed to go a short distance from the parked van,” said Tushar J, a student and a beneficiary of the scheme.

The incident prompted state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant — on a visit to SPPU — to intervene and agree to some demands. “We agreed to the demand for free sweaters, disbursal of stipends by the 10th of the month and appointing a student representative to the scheme’s committee. Other demands would be discussed at a special committee meeting on Monday,” Samant said.

SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar too met the protesters and promised to look into their demands.

Illustration used for representational purpose.

HYDERABAD: Nearly 10 days after Rs 80 lakh worth cigarettes were stolen from a Chandanagar godown here, Cyberabad police on Saturday arrested four persons, who belong to Nanded district of Maharashtra.

Cyberabad police said the main accused, Sanjay Pundalik Dhumale, was a cloth merchant and hatched the plan to commit the burglary so that he can pay his vehicle loan payment. He took the help of six associates in executing the plan. While three were arrested along with him, three others are at large. The stolen consignment of 59 cigarette cartons was recovered and the vehicle used for committing the offence was seized.

Sanjay bought a mini Ashok Leyland recently. Owing to meagre income, he was defaulting on loan payments. To overcome this, he along with his associates came up with the theft plan.

A week before committing the burglary, the accused visited Hyderabad to target a factory or a company. They found a DCM parked in Padmaja Colony and labourers unloading cigarette cartons. On January 2, the six accused broke the godown grill lock with a crowbar and disconnected the CCTV cameras. They went to the fourth floor and took away 59 cigarette cartons in a vehicle and sped away.

The accused were identified as Sanjay, Namdev Sambaji Munde, Rathod Rajebhau Babu and Gopal Purshotham Daliya, all residents of Nanded. Three others — Kashinath Kadam, Raju Enjwade and Digamber Dhumale - are still at large.

Chennai: The Madras high court has made it clear that completion of probation for professors appointed to state universities is not automatic, and that in the event of non-confirmation of their service after the expiry of probation period, such candidates cannot claim regularisation as a right.

Justice V Anand Venkatesh made the observation while concurring with the submissions of advocate P Sanjai Gandhi, who represented Tamil Nadu Open University and dismissing pleas moved by professors E Ravi and S Prabakaran.

According to the petitioners, they were originally working as lecturers in Annamalai University. In 2014, Tamil Nadu Open University called for applications for the posts of professor and associate professors. The petitioners applied for the posts and got selected. On November 28, 2015, they were appointed to their respective posts with two-year probation with a lien for the same period in Annamalai University. However, even after the expiry of the probation period they were not absorbed permanently for the posts. The lien provided for them in Annamalai University also expired. Therefore, they made a representation to the open university to regularise their service. To their shock, the open university refused to absorb them permanently and passed an order dated February 1, 2018. Aggrieved, they moved the present plea challenging their removal. TNN

Pushpa Amarnath

MANGALURU: The KPCC Women’s Cell has conducted a fact finding visit to collect information on the December 19 police firing in the city, and decided to submit a report to President Ram Nath Kovind .

Karnataka Pradesh Mahila Congress president Pushpa Amarnath , who visited the houses of police firing victims, said on Saturday that a report on the police firing will be sent to the President of India within a day or two.

The KPCC women’s wing also demanded a judicial probe into the police firing that killed two in Mangaluru. She also lashed out at BJP MLAs and MP Nalin Kumar Kateel who failed to visit the kin of those died in the police firing on December 19.

“Why have the people’s representatives of this district, including the MP, not visited the houses of those died in police firing. Though the BJP has made ‘sab ka sath, sab ka vikas’ their slogan, in Mangaluru they have not made any efforts to help the kin of those who died in police firing. Moreover, the BJP government has registered an FIR against the dead too. Hence, a judicial probe is needed to know whether the FIR was based on facts or not,” she said.

On the Citizens (Amendment) Act, Pushpa said the BJP is trying to trigger “internal terrorism” by introducing a new law and thereby disturb peace in the country. “The home minister of the nation and the state should resign for all the unrest related to CAA and NRC protests,” she said.

Referring to the series of videos released by former Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy alleging police brutality in Mangaluru, Pushpa said, “It is evident that the Mangaluru city police had instructions to create unrest in the city. It is a hidden agenda of the BJP.”

Further, extending her support to actress Deepika Padukone, who visited the JNU campus recently, Pushpa made an appeal to people to watch her film ‘Chapaak’ that narrates the story of an acid attack victim.

So rasikas were tuned to attentiveness, like tanpuras before a big concert, at the very start of the Day 10 finale, on Friday.Abhogi Kanhada can carry the ardour of an orator declaiming on love in front of a crowd that joins in with refrains of approval. But the composition chosen by Vidushi Mudgal gathered that cascading force into a contemplation on mortality.“In my first khayal presentation, both the vilambit and madhya laya compositions were by my guru Pandit Ramashreya Jha ‘Ramrang’,” Vidushi Mudgal told TOI. “The lyrics of the vilambit composition were: ‘Kaahe gumaan kare ri gori maan le meri kahi/Naahin raahe roop rang tero Ramrang kaahe bhonhein taan rahi’. The lyrics warn that time is fleeting and youth and beauty, like time, are transient. Therefore, arrogance and overconfidence are to be set aside and shunned.”The memento mori, delivered with the cheer of Abhogi Kanhada, applied art to a question we ought to ask ourselves in everyday life: what makes us strut around with such pretenses of being powerful?Adi Sankara’s “Bhaja Govindam”, anticipates the human tendency to buff Facebook images to bluff about age and possessions: “Maa kuru dhana jana yauvana garvam/harati nimeshhaat kaalah sarvam.” The summary is, “Do not be proud of wealth, connections, or youth. Time destroys them all.” M S Subbulakshmi’s rendition of “Bhaja Govindam” has eluded “time’s winged chariot”, to use Andrew Marvell’s thought. Vidushi Mudgal’s performance on Friday showed why art has that power.“The madhya laya lyrics were: ‘Soorjhat naahi mann, laage kaahu se ri, lakh jatan mann soorjhaun/Urjhe jaat jyon jyon soorjhaun Ramrang, kaise karoon kaise soorjhaun’,” Vidushi Mudgal told TOI. “The lyrics speak of the heart being entangled. Every effort to disentangle leads to a bigger tangle.”",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-110164,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/memento-mori-with-smile-of-abhogi-kanhada/articleshow/73208748.cms

Police officers with the recovered mobiles on Saturday

CHENNAI: The city police have unearthed a racket in which thieves snatch mobile phones in Chennai and sell them off at nearly one-tenth the price in places like Bihar and Jharkhand through dealers in Kerala.

Police have recovered at least 160 stolen mobiles using the IMEI numbers from those who bought them and returned them to the original owners. Deputy commissioner of police Deshmukh Shekhar Sanjay said many mobile phones were reported stolen in the past six months in the Mylapore area, and investigators found many of them were being used by people in states like Bihar. Police personnel then called the owners who had bought the phones at dirt cheap rates and instructed them to return them at the earliest.

Soon, most of the phones were sent by courier along with acknowledgement card to the police stations. “We got a good response from the second-hand buyers who returned the phones before we could act against them,” said an officer.

Earlier, a special team of personnel from all stations in Mylapore police district, with a technical background, was assigned to compile all cases of mobile phones that were stolen or robbed in the past six months and track them with the help of the IMEI numbers. Each team member was asked to get in touch with the service providers concerned and check if the stolen phones were activated with the help of other service providers.

Police are trying to narrow down on the agents who operate in Chennai and send the phones to Kerala and from there to other parts of the country. Until now, mobile service providers rarely answered queries raised by police from other states. “Now, we have got a system to link all service providers,” said the officer.

The mobile phones that were stolen or snatched in the city find their way into the second hand phone market. “We traced quite a number of snatched mobiles that will be handed over to the owners after being produced in the court,” said Deshmukh Shekhar Sanjay.

Former CM Devendra Fadnavis

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: From being a forced backbencher to his love for music, fear for maths and an accidental entry into politics, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis took a trip down memory lane on Saturday during an open interview conducted by actor Rahul Solapurkar after inaugurating the Moraya youth festival at Chinchwad.

“Mee punha yein (I shall return),” he assured Solapurkar amid much laughter when the interview had to be cut short as Fadnavis had to take a flight to Aurangabad.

“I had to be a backbencher, not because I was weak in studies, but because three to four of us were taller,” he said.

“I was weak in mathematics. Twenty students in our class had scored zero out of 50. So, we were made to sit in front in the class. But I studied hard and secured distinction in mathematics in the Standard X board examination,” Fadnavis recalled.

On his accidental entry in politics, he said, “I wanted to be an advocate and had taken admission for a five-year course after Standard XII. I had also joined ABVP. Sunil Ambekar, the sanghatan mantri of ABVP then, told me to join BJP. I told him that I wanted to pursue a career in law, but I was told that we have to follow the orders and contest the municipal corporation election immediately.”

Fadnavis revealed that he was not even 21 at that time of the civic elections then and was thus, ineligible to contest. “Luckily, the elections were postponed by six months and by that time I had become eligible to contest. I was elected a corporator during the final year of the college,” he said.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday wished success and offered all support to the protest undertaken by the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) against fee hike and the anti-constitutional legislations such as Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The CM conveyed this to Aishe Ghosh , president of JNU students’ union, who visited him at Kerala House, New Delhi.

Vijayan asked Ghosh about her injuries suffered in the attack by masked goons and about other students who had suffered injuries. “The entire country is with you in your fight for justice,” the CM told Ghosh. “Everyone knows about your fight and what costs you to stand by your causes,” he said, congratulating the students for the relentless struggle they have undertaken for several weeks.

Ghosh, who conveyed thanks to the overwhelming support the students of JNU were receiving from Kerala, said the political stand taken by the Pinarayi Vijayan government has inspired the students of JNU. “Kerala has been leading the protest against CAA. JNU students’ union takes inspiration from the struggle Kerala has been leading. Comrade Pinarayi asked us to go ahead. The fight to save secular ethos and democratic values of the country should go on,” Ghosh told reporters after the meeting.

The CM gifted a copy of ‘Halla Bol: The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi’ by Sudhavna Deshpande to Ghosh. Kerala’s representative in Delhi, A Sampath, SFI national president Mayukh Biswas and JNU students Nikhil Varghese and Nitheesh Narayanan were also present in the meeting.

BENGALURU: Renowned Kannada scholar and researcher M Chidananda Murthy passed away at a private hospital here on Saturday morning due to age-related complications. He was 88.

Known as ChiMu in literary circles, he has authored more than 25 books in Kannada aside from his research work. Known for his specialisation in the history of Kannada language, ChiMu contributed significantly in securing classical language status for Kannada.

As a historian, he contributed in conserving monuments of the erstwhile Vijayanagara empire in Hampi. He was born in 1931 in Channagiri taluk, currently in Davanagere taluk. He had served at Yuvaraja College of University of Mysore and later as a Kannada reader in Bangalore University before taking voluntary retirement.

His student, colleague, friend and long-time associate Prof Basavaraja Kalgudi, former director, Centre of Kannada Studies, Bangalore University recalls his efforts in the building of Kannada University in Hampi.

ChiMu had marched from Bengaluru to Hampi in 1985 demanding the establishment of a Kannada university in Hampi. “ChiMu had demanded that the university be built for Kannada where the language had flourished during the Vijayanagar empire. He was a pioneer behind the establishment of Kannada University. But he always stayed away from power,” Kalgudi said.

It is said that Chimu had written to the state government not to consider him for the post of vice-chancellor if at all the university was formed.

Chimu plunged into activism from 1988 and was associated with Kannada Shakti Kendra. “For him, Kannada was not just a language, but a community, a culture. His PhD thesis in 1974, under the guidance of Kannada scholar Thee Nam Shri, ‘Kannada Shasanagala Samskruthika Adhyayana’ looked into the socio-cultural history of Kannadigas. That was a path breaking study in Kannada’s history,” said Kalgudi.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa visited his house in Hampi Nagar in Bengaluru to pay respects. “As a chief minister in 2008, I had offered him an MLC post. However, he refused and said he was too old for it. Murthy always urged and egged me to strengthen the party. He never sought any posts,” he said.

A prominent epigraphist who worked immensely in Veerashaiva literature, ChiMu was a vocal Hindutva supporter.

Speaking to TOI, Prof Purushothama Bilimale, chair, Kannada Peeta in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), recalled that the researcher in ChiMu was alive even at the age of 85. “Three years ago, when he visited Delhi, he was keen on finding a Shiva temple in ‘Chaval Mandi’ area. According to him, that was the area where Shivappa Nayaka of the Keladi dynasty had established a ‘Shiva Linga’ in Delhi in the 17th century, when it was ruled by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan,” he said

“...That was based on his close reading of the scriptures. After our strenuous search, we found a Shiva temple, and the priest there confirmed that the deity was established by a South Indian ruler. ChiMu wrote about this after he returned to Bengaluru. The researcher in him was always alive,” Bilimale added.

“With the demise of Chidananda Murthy, we have lost a great researcher and scholar,” novelist SL Bhyrappa said, adding that he was a wholehearted votary of Kannada and an ardent patriot.

“His views on any subject would be based on in-depth study. His research on Tipu Sultan is unrivalled. He would never mince words when it came to expressing facts,” Bhyrappa said.

The last rites will be performed with state honours on Sunday.

Secunderabad: An exhibition-cum-sale of cloth bags and eco-friendly bags which began on Saturday received a lukewarm response from the shopkeepers of Secunderabad Cantonment.

The two-day exhibition has been organised by the SCB administration and MEPMA Cantonment wing to educate the shopkeepers regarding the implementation of orders issued by Ministry of Defence (MoD) in the wake of the ban on single-use plastic.

By the end of the first day, over 20 shopkeepers had visited the exhibition. The MEPMA women groups who had prepared paper and cloth bags made a sales pitch and discussed the prices for selling them. They even gave an assurance to accept bulk indents (orders) from the shopkeepers.

Training was given to 500 MEPMA women on stitching of cloth bags and preparation of paper bags in different sizes. For this, 10 sewing machines were also arranged for the women’s group and a center was opened on the premises of the SCB office.

“The shopkeepers have to utilise this opportunity to implement MoD orders strictly,” SCB chief executive officer, SVR Chandra Sekhar said, making a plea.

The SCB authorities warned shopkeepers that raids will be conducted on the commercial properties in a couple of days. Penalties will be imposed in case the authorities identify material pertaining to single-use plastic, according to SCB senior officer, Parusuram.

The exhibition will be continued on Sunday too.

139,['12/01/2020'],"Draft map of 98 wards up for show, public to submit opinion by Jan 17","This story is from January 12, 2020

Visakhapatnam: A day after the state government fixed the number of wards of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) at 98, the civic body has brought out a draft pertaining to the reorganisation process and geographical precincts of the wards on Saturday. While the first ward (ward 1) starts in Bheemili Zone, the 98th ward covers Adavivaram and other colonies in and around Simhachalam in Zone-VI.

Ward 11, comprising of Raveendra Nagar, Vivekananda Colony others, is the smallest ward with a population of 17,178. With 23,127, Ward 28 has the highest population. The number of wards have been fixed based on the 2011 census and the recently revised guidelines of the municipal administration and urban development department.

GVMC commissioner G Srijana said the ward-wise reservations can only be determined after getting the electoral rolls and conducting a survey among voters belonging to the SC, ST, BC and women categories in each ward. “The survey is likely to be completed by January 16 and reservations will be notified by January 21,” said the commissioner.

The GVMC put up the draft of the redrawn boundaries in each ward office on Saturday evening and will receive suggestions and complaints from the public till January 17.

The areas of the erstwhile Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation along with the Gajuwaka Municipality and 32 villages were merged to form the GVMC in 2005. Anakapalli and Bheemili municipalities were merged in the GVMC in 2013. Later, in 2017, the state government increased the number of wards to 81. But even after that, the uncertainty over the number of wards continued as the people’s representatives in the city demanded that the wards be further increased to 100. Finally, the state government on Friday fixed the number of wards at 98 as per the altered guidelines.

The tenure of the elected members of the GVMC expired on February 25, 2012. Vizag district collector was appointed as the GVMC special officer with effect from February 26, 2012 for only six months to discharge the functions of the corporation and standing committees. However, since then, the tenure of the special officer has been renewed every six months.

140,['12/01/2020'],Kaerala: NCRB statistics reveal errors in recording accident data,"Representative image

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Being a land that sets new records every year in terms of alcohol consumption, it was a surprise how the number of road accidents involving drunk driving remained low in the state. Though the state recorded around 40,000 cases of road accidents on an average in recent years, the number of accidents involving drunk driving has remained around 200 every year.But, it has been revealed now that the tipplers of the state do not deserve the credit for the low accident rate. The police have revealed that till a year ago, they were not correctly recording the causes of the accidents. They often failed to record drunk driving as a cause.The data on accidents released by the national crime records bureau (NCRB) show that there were as many as 1,251 cases of road accidents involving driving under the influence of alcohol in 2018. It shows 600% increase in one year as only 197 cases were reported in 2017.The statistics also show that as many as 1,310 persons were left injured and 112 killed in the accidents involving drunk driving in 2018. The corresponding figures for the year 2017 are 263 and 40.According to police, the sharp increase in recording number of cases involving drunk driving was because the police started recording even the minute details of the accidents correctly.Admitting the lapse, which made way for a misconception among people that accidents caused by drunk drivers were less in the state, superintendent of police (traffic, south zone) K L Johnkutty said that the figures before 2018 were not presenting actual scenario when it came to accidents caused by drunk driving.“From 2018 onwards the NCRB introduced a new system, RAPID, for inputting the crime data and it had columns pertaining to even minute details of cases that had to be filled without any fail,” said the superintendent. However, sources in the department said that there was another reason for lapses in recording drunk driving cases promptly. According to an officer, who requested anonymity, the police often deliberately skipped mentioning the involvement of drunk driving in order to help accident victims.“In accident cases, the victims are entitled for compensation and often the onus of paying the compensation would fall on the firm under which the vehicle of the offender is insured. If the driver was drunk, the insurance company can save itself from the liability. Then, the offender will have to pay the compensation from his or her own pocket. Often, the court fixes huge amounts as compensation, especially in cases involving deaths. If the offender is not rich enough to pay that amount, the victim will be left in the lurch,” the officer said.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73211369,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-149028,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/ncrb-statistics-reveal-errors-in-recording-accident-data/articleshow/73208755.cms

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Health minister K K Shailaja has issued orders to remove 430 missing doctors from the health department. They have been removed since they failed to report back to duty despite giving notices twice by the department.

The minister said two notices were served to these doctors in the last one year to rejoin duty. They were on unauthorised absence . Earlier, 36 doctors were removed from medical education department for unauthorised absence. Among the 430 doctors, 53 doctors had completed probation and 377 doctors were on probation. The minister has asked the health services director to immediately report the vacancies to the state public service commission and take steps for filling up the vacancies. The minister said all these posts were remaining vacant all these years and it had affected the functioning of hospitals. Hence, the government had decided to give them a chance to return to duty by slapping notices on them. However, they failed to report back to duty.

It has been found that these doctors had gone on leave in the name of pursuing higher studies. But, they never returned to the service and joined private sector. This was why the health minister decided to act tough against these doctors by removing them from government service.

A total of 21 elephants died in Uttarakhand last year, according to state forest department data accessed by T... Read More

DEHRADUN: A total of 21 elephants died in Uttarakhand last year, according to state forest department data accessed by TOI. Forest officials claim that this is the lowest death count reported in the state in last four years. Also, they add that not a single case of death due to poaching (or poisoning) was reported in 2019 in the state.

Among the 21 reported deaths, eight pachyderms died of natural causes, four died in road accidents, two were run over by trains, three succumbed to electrocution, three lost their lives in in-fighting, and one died of an unknown cause. The dead included 17 male and four female elephants.

Speaking to TOI about the reduction in the number of jumbo deaths, a senior official said that the state needs to ramp-up the pace of constructing safe passages for elephants for reducing the death count further.

Uttarakhand recorded 38 elephant deaths each in 2018 and 2017. The jumbo death counts in the state in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were — 7, 27, 29, 19, and 29 respectively. Ever since the formation of the state in 2000, Uttarakhand has lost 420 elephants. Among these deaths, 161 died of natural causes, 70 died in infighting, 68 died in accidents, 55 died of unknown causes, 39 succumbed to electrocution, 16 were crushed to death by train, nine lost their lives due to poaching, one died of poisoning, and another one was killed after being declared a problem animal.

“The need of hour is to make sure that the integrity of corridors is maintained in Uttarakhand. Several linear developments have been planned in the identified 10 prime jumbo corridors in the state. There are also plans to widen some roads apart from these corridors which are used by elephants for movement. Thus, it is important that appropriate mitigation methods are followed whenever such activities are undertaken. This will ensure safety of our tuskers,” said Bivasah Pandav, a senior scientist of Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun , who works exclusively in jumbo ranges of India.

As per the latest forest department estimate, Uttarakhand is home to around 1500-1800 elephants. On being asked about the measures to check human-elephant conflict and save jumbos from poachers, Pandav said, “Human-elephant conflict incidents due to rapid urbanisation are bound to increase. Therefore, the state should ensure controlled urbanisation around elephant-rich ranges. The state should also focus on enhancing forest quality so that elephants don’t stray into areas with human population in search of food.”

The cyclist fell through the missing railings.

BHOPAL: A 12-year-old boy, out cycling with friends, was killed in a freak accident when his tyres hit a bump on the road and he was hurled into Upper Lake near Bhadbhada on Friday morning. A friend tried to drag him ashore with the help of a muffler, but couldn’t.

There is no railing on the culvert where the incident took place, making it prone to such accidents. Jolted by the child’s death, the administration has promised to put up railings.

The victim, Varun Gour, studied in Class VI at a private school in Barkhedi. His father, Rajendra Gour, told police that for the past 10-12 days, Varun was waking up early to go cycling with his friends. On Friday, he left home on his bicycle around 6.30am. Investigation officer Ramesh Khatri said that the accident happened around 8.45am, when Varun was returning home with a friend, a 13-year-old.

Varun was apparently hurrying to reach home. When he reached a culvert between Goragaon and Suraj Nagar, his bicycle hit a sharp bump where the road meets the culvert. He lost control and plunged into Upper Lake along with his cycle.

Khatri said Varun’s friend tried his best to rescue him. He unwrapped his muffler and threw one end to Varun to pull him out of the water, but he couldn’t handle the weight and was dragged towards the edge of the culvert. On the verge of falling into the lake, he let go of the muffler. Around the same time, local resident Arvind Maran happened to pass by. He stopped on hearing the 13-year-old cry for help and ran towards the boy. He jumped into the lake, brought Varun ashore and took him to a nearby hospital but Varun had died.

Ratibad SHO, sub-inspector J P Tripathi, said no such accident had been reported at the spot earlier. “Now, police will arrange for protection on both sides of the culvert until the railing is repaired,” he said.

The main office building of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board

SECUNDERABAD: Though the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has received pleas from major political parties including Telangana Rashtra Samithi ( TRS ), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) and Congress to conduct Secunderabad Cantonment Board ( SCB ) elections on party symbols , no decision has been taken yet.

Meanwhile, the political parties are expediting possibilities to choose suitable candidates in a quest to win all eight civilian wards in the polls, deeming them of high importance.

For instance, candidates with TRS support had won six out of eight wards in the Cantonment Board polls in 2015. The party has set its- eye on winning all the eight wards this time. It had won the Cantonment assembly seat in 2018 elections. Though, two senior ministers, namely T Padma Rao and Talasani Srinivas Yadav used to take responsibility of selecting the candidates in the Cantonment, the final decision is made by TRS party’s high command. They will take the opinion of Cantonment MLA G Sayanna too.

Regarding Congress, the selection of the candidates was usually decided by the TPCC chief. This time, senior Congress leader A Revanth Reddy won the Malkajgiri Lok Sabha seat in 2019 and is likely take active part in selecting the candidates in the Cantonment Board polls. The Cantonment assembly constituency comes under his Parliament constituency.

The BJP is also keen to win the majority of the wards in these polls. Senior leader N Ramchandra Rao is expediting the candidates to maximise the winning possibilities. “BJP has many aspirants in every civilian ward and we have to choose the correct person. The party will take into consideration various aspects like people’s support, services rendered to the party and loyalty to the party,” sources in BJP told TOI.

Considering the fact that the number of aspirants in every political party has crossed 10 and there is a threat of rebels, the process of selecting the candidates may become a tough task for parties.

The hectic schedule of selection of candidates by political parties will begin after MoD issues the election notification.

150,['12/01/2020'],IT City project back in focus after capital buzz,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority ( VMRDA ) has started to work on its proposed Information Technology City ( IT City ) project in Madhurawada with renewed vigour.

The urban development authority had recently initiated discussions with various private players to take the project forward.

In response to the earlier ‘expression of interest’, released in 2018 for the project, several tech giants of the country had shown interest. The project got several unique propositions with regard to all or various components of the 22-acre IT city project.

The VMRDA, however, has so far treaded cautiously as the project involves 22 acres of prime land in Madhurawada and a requires a substantial investment.

Moreover, their proposal of 100% rental guarantee was rejected by the erstwhile government twice. Now at a time when the government is hinting at shifting the executive capital to Visakhapatnam, the VMRDA has turned its focus to the project again.

The IT project is expected to propel growth on the northeast side of the city — where the seat of power is likely to be located.

As per the concept master plan, a total of 22 lakh square feet built-up area will be created in this project, including an iconic IT tower and IT space, commercial and social space (malls, star hotels, theatres and club houses) and residential space (apartment complexes and premium villas).

As per the preliminary plan, the project will be developed in a public-private partnership model with appropriate sharing mechanisms. Andhra Pradesh Urban Infrastructure Asset Management Ltd (APUIAML), a joint venture between AP state government and Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), is acting as the asset manager.

The project components are planned to be implemented over a period of three to five years based on market demand. All the components are expected to be started together with a prime focus on the development of IT space and the simultaneous creation of commercial, social and residential spaces.

Speaking to TOI, VMRDA chairman Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao said the VMRDA is keen on taking the project forward.

“We have already discussed the project with the state government. Metropolitan commissioner P Koteswara Rao and other VMRDA officials are in discussions with various private players over the project,” said Srinivasa Rao.

Even though the project has not made any progress over the last one year, the VMRDA has already got environmental clearance and almost completed building the roads to the project site. The layout plan has also got online approval.

151,['12/01/2020'],JNUSU names ‘January 5 assaulters’,"JNUSU released several grabs and gave its version of the chronology of the events on January 5.

NEW DELHI: Recounting her ordeal on the night of Sunday, January 5, JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh remembered how she was beaten with iron rods by 20 men, who left a deep gash on her head. At a press conference called to rebut the Delhi Police’s identification of nine JNU students as those involving in violence, Ghosh accused the cops of being hand-in-glove with ABVP, the RSS-affiliated student organisation.“Masked men repeated hammered my head with iron rods. There are videos of this. But even then, I didn’t name ABVP or any organisation as the assailants, only demanded justice,” said an emotional Ghosh. “When there are screenshots of WhatsApp groups where ABVP members are openly happy about my injuries, how I can roam freely on the campus?”She accused the university administration and police of colluding in the violence.“They say it was a scuffle between students and teachers, that it was a fight between Right and Left. But it is a fight between right and wrong,” Ghosh continued.Giving a chronology of events, and alleging that police at Friday’s press meet showed pictures that were circulated by ABVP, the students’ union listed the names of 29 students it suspected of involvement in the Sabarmati Hostel mayhem and of some JNU teachers for “attacking students.”There were accusation that several teachers had incited the attackers and even beaten up some students. JNUSU named Ashwini Mohapatra, dean, School of International Studies, and Mazhar Asif, associate dean, School of Languages, as guilty of this. The teachers vociferously refuted these charges and called them baseless. Asif categorically told TOI, “I was not involved in any violence.”Ghosh also alleged that on January 5, she saw Periyar Hostel warden Tapan Bihari handing lathis to masked men who were emerging from his house. “How can the administration call for a security audit of hostels where even wardens are involved in violence?” she asked. While Bihari was not available for a comment, posters have cropped up calling him the ‘traitor of JNU.’Responding to the naming of 29 students, Durgesh Kumar, president, JNU ABVP unit, retorted, “The matter is under investigation by police right now, and these allegations are baseless.”Satish Chandra Yadav, JNUSU general secretary, however, claimed a nexus between police and ABVP. “Police conducted a press conference hurriedly and named leftist organisations, but not once did they take ABVP’s name. They have based their findings on pictures that have gone viral, but what is the authenticity of these images. And why have pictures with ABVP activists not been considered?” he asked.In response, a police officer asserted, “The investigation is based on evidence so far, there is no bias. This is the first of many press briefings in the case. The investigation has only started and efforts are being made to identify other suspects.”Contrary to police’s explanation on Friday, JNUSU claimed that violence on January 4 was triggered by ABVP activists attacking anti-fee hike protesters at the School of Biotechnology. It said ABVP activists, including Sarvendra Kumar, were seen attacking a student affiliated to leftist student organisation, AISA. The video of that incident was shared by the government’s Press Information Bureau twitter handle alleging that the attacker was a leftist activist. This tweet was also retweeted by vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar.On January 5, JNUSU alleged, violence began in the morning when students were beaten near the administrative block despite the presence of police in plainclothes. There was no response when police were informed. Ghosh claimed, “Later, at 4pm, when a police van arrived at Periyar Hostel, the cops only watched the ABVP activists indulging in stone pelting.”Ghosh informed that a demonstration was planned at Police Headquarters at ITO on Monday against the “shoddy investigation” and the “police’s Islamophobia unleashed on Jamia students”.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209585,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-550107,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/jnusu-names-january-5-assaulters/articleshow/73209254.cms

DEHRADUN: Cracking down on erring business firms, state Goods and Service Tax (GST) department has cancelled registration numbers of over 12,000 firms, which did not file their GST returns in 2019.

The state GST department came across the defaulters while scrutinising the GST return status of all the registered firms. ""The registration numbers of these firms were cancelled according to the law. Such firms should apply for fresh registration number,"" said sales tax commissioner Saujanya. The state has over 1.20 lakh registered firms.

“Filing of the GST returns is a mandatory requirement. Weeding out defaulters was necessary to ensure that they do not misuse their GST registration numbers. There have been cases where firms have used the GST registration number of other companies for their works.” said another official of state GST department, who did not want to be named.

Meanwhile, the cancellation of the GST registration has upset the firm owners in the state. A city-based contractor told TOI, “My firm didn’t carry out any business operation in 2019 because of the economic downturn. Nonetheless, my registration number has been cancelled.”

Visakhapatnam: The YSRC leadership in Visakhapatnam has urged Union home minister, Amit Shah , in a letter to take action against Rajya Sabha MP Sujana Choudhary for his alleged, ‘un-constitutional,’ and ‘unlawful’ utterances against the country.

In the letter dated January 11, YSRC leader and Anakapalli MLA, Gudivada Amarnath criticised the former Union minister for allegedly stating that, “ India is not a fit place to live and it is better for the citizens to shift to other countries as refugees, instead of witnessing the crimes occurring in India.”

Urging the Union home minister, Amarnath stated that, “His statements are contrary to the conduct of a responsible lawmaker.” He added, “Such statements cause irreparable damage to the reputation of India.” The YSRC leader further alleged, in his letter, that the Rajya Sabha MP “ was involved in large scams and money laundering cases.”

Amarnath added that action taken against the MP would be in the best interests of the country and its reputation.

The 19-storey waterfront apartment turned into a pile of rubble within a span of nine seconds on Saturday

KOCHI: Everything went as planned in Maradu as Holy Faith H2O and the twin towers of Alfa Serene were razed to dust within seconds on Saturday in two separate sequences. There was a slight delay in the morning after which the demolition process went off smoothly.Maradu flats demolition live updatesExactly a minute after the third siren was blown by authorities signalling the beginning of demolition, a rapid sequential blast started at the lower-right end of Holy Faith H2O building in Kundannoor.A moment of silence succeeded the three-second blast sequence, following which the building’s right portion crumbled inward and the process spread to the remaining portions in a wave motion. In another four seconds the entire building collapsed ‘just like a waterfall’. As promised by the demolition team, it crumbled inwardly with a roar creating a thick dust cloud, amid the loud cheer from thousands who gathered in nearby areas to get a glimpse of the event.The 19-storey waterfront apartment turned into a pile of rubble within a span of nine seconds on Saturday as authorities started executing the Supreme Court order, a day before the deadline expired. The building was brought down safely at 11.18am through a near-perfect controlled implosion carried out by Edifice Engineering with the assistance of South Africa’s leading demolition firm Jet Demolition. The apex court had ordered the demolition of four apartment complexes which had violated coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms in May 2019.All officials, including district collector S Suhas, deputy collector Snehil Kumar Singh, top cops, Maradu municipality and PESO officials said the implosion went well as planned with minimal physical damage to the immediate surroundings, including the Thevara-Kundannoor Bridge. Neighbours also said that the only problem they encountered was heavy dust.Edifice Engineering’s MD Utkarsh Mehta said the demolition was completed without problems. “The bridge and nearby houses are intact. Dust was a problem, but it settled down within 15 minutes,” he said.Joe Brinkmann, leader of Jet Demolition team that carried out the blast, said that the debris was well-contained within the boundary walls with no major pieces falling into the waterbody or the bridge. “No houses were damaged. The only problem was a delay of 15 minutes for the implosion to begin due to the aerial surveillance by a helicopter,” he said. Meanwhile, top police sources said that the Navy helicopter did not inform them about the sortie in advance and it caused a confusion resulting in the delay.A few minutes after the first building was pulled down, the twin towers of Alfa Serene were brought down in a controlled manner without much damage to nearby structures. Pollution control board officials said that a small portion of debris from tower two of Alfa Serene fell into the backwaters and it would be retrieved by the demolition agency.The first siren was sounded at 11.42am and tower two was demolished within eight seconds. Within seconds, the first tower too was pulled down and all it took was another eight seconds. The delay in pulling down Holy Faith H2O building, delayed the demolition of Alfa Serene towers. The first time slots were 11am for Holy Faith and 11.05am for Alfa Serene.Debris from tower one fell at the designated spot. Meanwhile, debris from the second tower was seen slanting towards the backwaters. The metal sheets placed at the top of the compound walls were found tattered due to demolition impact.“We will retrieve the debris from the water soon. Some people entered the exclusion zone causing disturbance. We asked them to leave the place. We could demolish Alfa Serene without much damage to neighbouring houses,” said a source. The impact of explosion damaged window panels at a nearby mosque and some houses.An official of the technical committee said that demolition of Alfa Serene towers went as planned. “The implosion in Alfa Serene was designed in such a way that the top floor of the second tower would fall into the waterbody in order to save the houses behind it. The pull was towards the backwater side,” said the official.Collector S Suhas said the demolition of the two buildings in Maradu went well because of the cooperation of people in the area and the officers who coordinated the job.“I expect the same cooperation from the public on Sunday when two other buildings will be demolished. A team of government officials will coordinate the process to ensure that the demolition of the buildings go as planned,” he said on Saturday. Meanwhile, Indian Oil Corporation has started the pressure test of its oil pipeline that passes just 7m away from the compound wall of Holy Faith H2O. The test will be completed on Sunday and only after that pumping will be resumed.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73210502,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-468840,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/7-9-no-seconds-guessing/articleshow/73208759.cms

PITHORAGARH: The Rung community of Dharchula observed its local language “Runglwo” day on Saturday. To mark the day, the members of the community came to Dharchula from Darma, Chaudas and Byas valleys and also from Nepal.

Rung community has a population of around 10,000 and Runglwo, their language, has different dialects in each valley. The community celebrates its language day on the birth anniversary of late Nandan Singh Lala, a member of the community from Nepal, who donated Rs 1 lakh in 1985 to develop the script of the language.

On Saturday, children of the community staged several cultural performances in Runglwo language . DK Fakaliyal, president of Rang Kalyan Sanstha, appealed to members of the community to talk with their wards in Runglwo so that the next generation is also well-versed with the language.

“The Rungs were traditionally involved in Indo-Tibet border trade but after the Sino-Indian War in 1962, their business suffered a setback and many members of the community had to leave their native villages and move to urban areas in search of jobs. The offsprings of those who migrated got disconnected from Runglwo language. Today, we are making efforts to preserve our language among the Rung community members in India and Nepal,” Jag Mohan Garvyal, patron of Rang Kalyan Sanstha, told TOI.

Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his 59th edition of the Mann Ki Baat radio show, shared how the people of Rung community protect their local language. “Recently I read a story about Uttarakhand's Dharchula. This story tells us how some people are coming forward to promote their language. Dharchula got my attention because I used to stay there... The people of Rung community have resolved to protect their language,” the PM had said.

Enthused by PM's appreciation, the community has also decided to hold Runglwo literature festival this year.

NAINITAL: A 50-year-old man was found dead in Nainital’s Egg Market area early on Saturday. The death was attributed by police to extreme cold weather .

Police told TOI that they were informed by locals early in the morning about the body which was found at an abandoned building where they also discovered liquor bottles.

According to Ashok Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Mallital, the deceased man, identified as Durga Singh, used to work at a restaurant and is a resident of Nainital. “We have informed his family. His body will be handed over to the family soon after postmortem,” Kumar added.

Police also said that prima facie, the man appears to have died of severe cold. “Though the postmortem report is still awaited, it looks as though the man died of cold because he was found at an abandoned building. He may have consumed liquor too. There were neither any injury marks on him nor any signs of scuffle,” the SHO said.

Temperatures in Nainital as well as several other towns in the hills have been below zero degrees of late during night time. The recent snowfall in the lake town has further plummeted the temperature leading to daily life being hit.

Parents at fault for stressing on academics alone: Expert

PANAJI: Possibly for the first time, a government endeavour is enabling teachers and students stay one step ahead of mental illness. Under the central government initiative, people attached to the general health system are being trained to identify persons in need of psychiatric help.Starting this year, teachers too will be trained to detect children with behavioural problems. Students will also be taught life skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, decision making, interpersonal skills, empathy, etc.The activity manual for teachers on health promotion using life skills is part of the programme designed for Classes VIII, IX and X.The state government has been focusing on mental health through various district mental health programmes. Dr Rupesh Patkar, a psychiatrist who recently joined the North Goa mental health programme, said the initiative is an extension of existing clinical facilities. The staff working under this programme visit four primary health centres and two community health centres in North Goa, twice a month.“With the level of stress in our lives on the rise, it is necessary to detect the signs before a person on the brink of depression or suffering from any other kind of emotional disturbance spirals further into darkness,” said Patkar.Training of students started a year ago, he said. This includes teaching them stress management.Adolescents, he said, may fall prey to peer pressure and pick up addictions because they do not know to say no to their friends. “Students under this programme are taught how to handle peer pressure and their emotions,” he added.Referring to some cases of children who resorted to self-harm, he said that it is essential children are taught skills such as decision making, accepting failure, and more importantly, learning to be assertive and not making wrong lifestyle choices.“The focus of the present-day education system is on academics while other aspects of personality development of children are ignored,” he said. But some fault also lies with parents. They lay stress on academics and leave little scope for other activities.“Some parents give everything to their children…in some cases, even before a wish is expressed. In the process, a child grows up with a sense of entitlement, not a positive aspect of the child’s personality,” he said.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73210010,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-381619,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/war-against-mental-illness-gets-boost-as-teachers-to-be-trained-to-help-kids-fight-it/articleshow/73208774.cms

Vijayawada: Twelve years after they were allegedly gangraped by a detachment of AP special police in the hamlet of Vakapalli under Paderu mandal of Visakhapatnam district, nine of the 11 tribal women are still awaiting justice.

Sunkara Rajendra Prasad, the special public prosecutor (SPP) litigating the case, accused the AP police of trying to subvert the case by stonewalling the investigation process. The case is being heard by judge OV Nageswara Rao in a special court in Visakhapatnam.

“The next date for hearing in this case is Jan 21. I have been trying to get the muster rolls of the 13 accused policemen and the case diaries of the Paderu police station for the past several months with no success. Those documents will prove that the 13 accused were in Vakapalli on August 20, 2007 when the crime too place. AP police is clearly trying to subvert the cause of justice by failing to submit the muster rolls and case diaries. They are trying to protect the men in their ranks,” Prasad said on Saturday.

Meanwhile, two of the 11 victims have died in the past 12 years. “In the past one year, the police department has done everything in its power to stymie the litigation,” allaged Prasad, the Vijayawada-based lawyer who the victims sought as SPP. “The forensics lab in Telangana first claimed that all Vakapalli investigation evidence was destroyed. Then the lab claimed to have miraculously found the destroyed evidence. Lab officials have been stonewalling our efforts to get the forensic evidence, without the chain of custody being compromised, to be presented in court.”

The court had ordered the 13 accused men to undergo a potency test in Nov 2018. The report was submitted to the court in December that year. “But though the court took the depositions of the nine survivors, none of the 13 accused policemen have been examined so far. All the victims deposed calmly in court and made it clear that all they wanted was justice,” he said.

Moreover, all the 13 accused policemen have been going about their official duties. “None of them were suspended. In fact, I am told that some of them have even been promoted even as the case is being heard. The case will be resolved quickly if the AP police cooperates with the court, but such cooperation has not been forthcoming,” Prasad added.

KOCHI: The sense of anxiety that tormented residents from the exclusion zone at Maradu before their evacuation on Saturday morning, turned into a sense of relief and calm when the three illegally-constructed towers at Maradu turned into rubble by 11.45am.

Most residents, who were a worried lot, chose to stay outside the exclusion zone instead of going to safer centres arranged at Thevara and Panangad. Maradu municipality had arranged three bus pick-up points to drop them at Sacred Heart College in Thevara and Fisheries College in Panangad. But, only 20 persons turned up at Thevara while nobody went to the safe centre at Panangad, said sources.

“People from far and wide came to Maradu to see the demolition. So, there is nothing wrong in those who used to live right next to these buildings wanting to see the demolition,” said collector S Suhas when asked about the evacuation process. He added that there was no restriction outside the 200m exclusion zone.

Early Saturday, things were not hunky dory. Many residents were panicky and some even tried to argue with cops deployed in the area. “We didn’t know what would happen to our homes. They hadn’t given us proper awareness on how to proceed with the evacuation. A leaflet was distributed on the process and that was not enough,” said Riyas Kadavil, whose home is located in the exclusion zone. He alleged that not enough geo-textile was provided for everyone in the locality to cover their homes.

Riyas, who returned home, admitted that he was a happy man at the end of the day. “Now that it is finally over, we are relieved. There is dust everywhere as there was not enough covering, but dust is still manageable. We are thankful nothing happened to our homes.”

KOCHI: Apart from the anticipated traffic congestion due to the closure of the national highways in and around Maradu for over 30 minutes, traffic in the city was largely unaffected.

However, a long line of vehicles formed on NH 66 during the window for the demolitions.

“The major roads were closed only for 10 to 15 minutes. There was some obvious issues due to traffic controls. However, we were able to get traffic back on track within around 30 minutes,” said an officer with Panangad police.

Pocket roads near the exclusion zone around the buildings which were demolished however had to be blocked for a longer period due to imposition of section 144.

“There was more or less no issue with traffic. There were onlookers on the roadsides. But police were able to clear the traffic quite promptly,” said a commuter.

TimesVIew One of the markers of a developed city is how convenient it makes life for pedestrians. At a time when vehicular pollution is turning cities into gas chambers, it pays to encourage people to walk. In a picturesque city like Bhopal, walking should be a delight. Be it a morning walk or a run to the grocery store, Bhopalis shouldn't have to take the risk of dodging traffic. But that’s sadly the case today as encroachers muscle into pavements. High time we freed our footpaths.

BHOPAL: Nearly half of all the pedestrian walkways in the state capital are under encroachment, according to an expert assessment. Simply put, each day over 1.5 lakh people using public transport and others moving on the streets struggle to walk the streets in the state capital.“Rules of Indian Road Congress and its guidelines are not being followed in Bhopal . Walkway indicates whether a person can comfortably walk at a place. They are encroached,” said National Centre for Human Settlements and Environment (NCHSE) director general, Pradip Nandi.Point in case is Lily Talkies and the pedestrian walkway along the Lower Lake up to Ibrahimpura. Tehbazari licence-holders for stalls on footpaths (having spaces of 8x8 feet) are spreading their wings to encroach entire road stretch in various parts of the state capital.Spaces of 8x8 feet is on paper. The encroachment is much further. Quality of a pavement or space along a road is also impacted, said Shalini Gupta, a homemaker. “Each day crossing the street with my child is a challenge. These shops with woolen items have even made going to the Neelam park an unsafe proposition,” she added.As per MoUD guidelines, the Public Transport Mode Share for a city like Bhopal needs to be almost 40% of the motorized trips and should have almost 40 buses per lakh population, translating to approx.BMC anti encroachment officer, Kamal Solanki said, “We will review the situation. The market is for a limited time at Lilly talkies.”Experts cited the need for safety of pedestrians. Officially there are 17 shops (8 x 8 feet) along Lily Talkies walkway. The have been converted into dozen plus shops and with the main road encroached and their extension leaves little room for pedestrians.The poor quality of pedestrian infrastructure or nonexistence of the same sends a message that pedestrians are not welcome in the urban environment, despite having guidelines for designing the pedestrian friendly facilities, said Rahul Singh an urban planner. Walkability can be linked to the quality of built environment, the urban form and connectivity, safety and desirability to walk and accessibility of infrastructure, he said.On paper, BMC builds and maintains most of the roads, bridges and subways. The stretch is around 1,400 km. While BMC spends about Rs 70 lakh on roads and pavements every year.In 2015, BMC proposed half subway on 9 locations in Bhopal. The cost of which has been estimated to be Rs 72 crore. However, the scheme has yet to take off.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73208783,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108412,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/bhopal-turns-walkers-nightmare-as-squatters-gobble-up-50-footpaths/articleshow/73208787.cms

Vehicles came to a standstill on Saturday in Mussoorie where roads have been slippery due to snow

DEHRADUN: At least 45 link roads were still closed on Saturday following heavy snow cover in parts of the hill state. Traffic movement on the state highways was restored on Saturday, though. Official said they are now confident of getting the traffic movement started on most of these routes by Sunday evening.

Staff of the disaster emergency operation centre said that no one was stranded in the hills. According to them, tourists staying in hotels and rest houses were advised not to leave till the roads were cleared for traffic.

Director of Met Centre, Bikram Singh, had predicted more rain and snow in the state from January 13 onwards.

Owing to thick blanket of snow, the traffic movement to Dhanaulti has been stopped. On the Kempty fall route, people had to push their vehicles as the layer of snow made the road difficult for driving.

In Pithoragarh, six roads were still blocked for the third consecutive day on Saturday. Munsyari tehsil has been worst hit.

Thal-Munsyari road has remained blocked for the past six days, though Jauljabi-Munsyari road was opened by PWD. Villagers of Nachani, Hokra, Girigoan and other places were unable to reach Munsyari tehsil headquarters for their daily work, according to a local resident of Munsyari.

“Local link roads connected to Munsyari are still under snow, so these villagers could not reach here. Electricity supply was restored in Munsyari town on Saturday evening for some time, but adjoining villages have been powerless and in the dark for the past three days,” the resident added.

People viewing paintings at Raja Ravi Verma Art Gallery

NAGPUR: Come January 31, the paintings of local artists in Raja Ravi Verma Art Gallery will be shifted to South Central Zone Cultural Centre (SCZCC) as the centre is unable to pay the monthly rent of the gallery to the state public works department (PWD).

The SCZCC will conserve the pristine look of all paintings by creating a painting library on its premises and put them on exhibition where people can purchase them also.

The decision to this effect was taken by the SCZCC to save the paintings from further deterioration as the entire art gallery is poorly maintained as several paintings are found covered in a thick blanket of dust. Rain water further added to the poor upkeep of these paintings as many of them were found submerged under keen-deep water. The gallery has been lying shut for the last few years.

The rent of the gallery has gone up to Rs74,000 per month from Rs7,500 per month since 1991 with an increment of 10% in rent every year. The SCZCC had demanded the art gallery from the then PWD minister Vijaysingh Mohite Patil free of cost in 1991. But Patil had insisted that it would be made available to the SCZCC at a monthly rent of Rs7,500, according to sources.

“We have decided to vacate the gallery to give the paintings a better space on our own premises. This will not only improve the number of visitors but also the sale of the paintings which will add to the centre’s revenue,” said SCZCC director Deepak Khirwadkar.

He further said the SCZCC will not only put about 800 paintings in the ongoing Orange City craft mela for sale, but also put them on exhibition inside the centre. “We will create a painting library to keep all these paintings safe,” he said.

Experts form Government Chitrakala Mahavidyalaya have also selected a few paintings which will become a part of the SCZCC painting library.

Khirwadkar said people cannot only enjoy these paintings put on display at the craft mela, but also purchase them. “We will be making an exclusively library and conserving the beauty and valour of these paintings,” Khirwadkar said.

NEW DELHI: Railways may have a separate examination for the Indian Railway Management Services ( IRMS ) rather than clubbing it with civil services examination, a move aimed at revamping the railway bureaucracy and ending the turf war, which starts right from the recruitment process as officers come from different services.

However, the recruitment process would be conducted by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). Sources said the new recruitment plan would be based on the requirements of the national transporter in line with the model followed by other state-run companies. The recruitments for PSUs are not conducted by the UPSC. This would also be similar to the Indian Forest Service, which recruits officers through the UPSC, but as a single dedicated cadre.

""The ministry will consult the department of personnel and training (DoPT) and UPSC and finalise the proposal, which will be taken to the alternative mechanism appointed by the Cabinet for approval,"" said an official adding that candidates from different streams such as science, engineering, humanities and management would be allowed to take the exam.

Currently, officers are recruited for 19 services through the stringent civil services examination by the UPSC. In the case of railways, recruitment under the Central Services Group-A is done through the civil services exam. The three services are Indian Railway Accounts Service (IRAS), Indian Railway Personnel Service (IRPF) and Indian Railway Traffic Service (IRTS). The rest five are done through the Engineering Services Examination conducted by the UPSC.

Representative image

KERI: Days after four tigers were found killed in Golauli in Sattari, a tiger preyed on a cow in Derode village in the forests of Sattari late on Friday night.

Forest officials were on alert after the four tiger deaths. Officials believed four dead tigers were part of a group of five who roamed the forests of Golauli. Forest department personnel were on the lookout for the fifth adult male tiger. However, its exact location was not known.

But late on Friday evening, a tiger attacked and killed a pregnant cow in Derode, and dragged its body away. The cow’s owner, Ladko Jadhav, found its half-eaten carcass and informed forest officials.

The principal chief conservator of forests Subhash Chandra immediately visited Derode and spoke to Jadhav, assuring him that compensation would be paid as early as possible.

“Tigers are found in this area, they attack and kill cattle,” Jadhav told forest officials. “We respect their presence. I have lost my cow and I’m hopeful that the government will provide me appropriate compensation.”

TOI contacted the range forest officer of Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary. “Our officials have done a panchanama,” he said. “They have confirmed that the cow was killed by the tiger. The department will take appropriate steps to pay compensation to the affected family at the earliest.”

The deputy conservator of forests, North Goa territory division, Kuldeep Sharma, also visited the spot and issued directives to monitor the movement of the tiger.

The four tiger deaths in Sattari’s forest reported between January 5 and 8 are believed to be due to poisoning. The two of the suspects taken into custody owned cattle which had been killed as prey by the tigers. The accused have confessed to burying the tigers but not to poisoning them.

Wildlifers had said that delayed compensation to the villagers by forest department for the killed cattle had led to them poisoning the tiger as a ‘revenge killing’.

BHOPAL: When you are serving the armed forces, you are serving the country and are an Indian first; everything else comes later, said Air Commodore Nitin Sathe. The Indian Air Force pilot who has 30 years of distinguished service, was speaking on the topic ‘Reaching for the skies against all odds’ at the ongoing Bhopal Literature and Art Festival on Saturday at Bharat Bhawan.

Recounting his experiences in the IAF, Sathe said rebuilding Car Nicobar , the northernmost of the Nicobar islands after the 2004 tsunami, was an uphill task. “It was one of the few most heart-rending experiences of my life. I reached Andaman three days after the tsunami hit. There was water and dead-bodies everywhere. Trees were floating on the water and the smell was unbearable. The entire island had faced severe destruction and everything from roads to electricity lines and runways had to be rebuilt from a scratch.”

“The saddest thing was people searching for their loved ones. A mother who was holding her baby saw him getting flung out of her arms, washed away with the mighty waves. People were trying to lift boulders with bare hands to find their family members. They didn’t even know whether they were dead or alive,” said Sathe. Sathe also spoke about the thrill of flying an aircraft for the first time and the ups and downs of his life after joining the Air Force. He also recounted the journey of his batch mate Flying Officer MP Anil Kumar, a MiG-21 pilot who became a quadriplegic due to an accident at the age of 24, which he has penned in his book ‘Born to Fly’.

Hyderabad: It’s raining realtors in the municipal elections. At the last count, more than 300 real estate developers, builders and real estate brokers have entered the fray in seven municipal corporations and 22 municipalities in Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri districts. Party lineage did not matter as TRS, Congress and BJP fielded them from various wards.

According to a poll analyst, realtors are testing their political fortunes, especially in the surrounding municipalities and municipal corporations. “It appears the political bug has bitten the realty representatives in this election,” he sad.

Consider this. TRS nominee for mayor post from Peezadiguda J Venkat Reddy is a builder. Having been a former president of Hyderabad Builders’ Association, Venkat took the political plunge now. Of the 252 nominations received in Peerzadiguda, 20 have real estate background such as Anantha Reddy, Kurra Shiva Kumar, Bandi Satish Goud, Harishankar Reddy and K Pochaiah.

Twenty-five realtors are contesting from Nizampet municipal corporation, 35 from Boduppal municipal corporation and 20 from Badangpet corporation. That more realtors have filed nominations from the surrounding urban local bodies of Hyderabad can be gauged by the fact areas such as Boduppal, Peerzadiguda, Nizampet, Manikonda, Shamshabad, Bandangpet and Narsingi have been hotspots of realty sector.

Analysts also point to the fact that political parties know for sure that builders and realtors are a safe bet as far as spending in the elections is concerned. “Though the state election commission has put several conditions to monitor election expenditure, every contestant is likely to spend nearly Rs 1 crore on campaigning, poll paraphernalia and distribution of cash and liquor,” a former returning officer of GHMC said. Both Rangareddy and Medchal-Malkajgiri districts received the highest number of nominations — 2,300 and 1,900 respectively — in Telangana.

BHUBANESWAR: The city’s Anshuman Kamila, 26, who is a manager at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), has topped the Indian Economic Service ( IES )-2019, the results of which were declared by the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) on Friday

Anshuman is the only son of Santosh Kumar Kamila, former chief postmaster general of Odisha , and Mitali Chinara, a noted singer and head of the analytical and applied economics department at Utkal University.

Anshuman was the state topper in the Class XII science examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) in 2011. He joined the RBI in July last year after completing his BA in economics from St Stephen’s College in Delhi, MA in the same subject from the Delhi School of Economics and an MPhil from the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

Anshuman told TOI that he had cleared the coveted examination in his third attempt. “I could not do well in my first attempt and failed to score well in the main examination of the IES. Though I cleared the examination in the second attempt, I could not make it to the merit list by one mark. I feel happy at having topped this time,” he said.

Anshuman added that the interviewers had asked him about the RBI and monetary policy. “I will work to help the country realise its economic potential in a sustainable way,” he said

The youngster added that more and more Odia youths should aspire to crack the IES with a good rank. “Aspirants should religiously follow the new economics syllabus in the state’s universities. They need to study for a few hours every day so that they can cover the whole syllabus without having any problems,” he said.

“The credit for this victory goes to my son, his teachers and well-wishers. He is a very sincere, committed and ethical person. He is not a child now, so he will take his own decisions and do something good for the society,” Anshuman’s mother Mitali said.

Chief minister Naveen Patnaik congratulated Anshuman on Twitter. “The people of Odisha are proud of you. I wish him all the best for his bright future,” he said in his tweet.

Vijayawada: Nellore police arrested two persons in two separate incidents on charges of transporting ganja to Sri Lanka via Tamil Nadu on Saturday. The cops also seized two cars and 430 kgs of ganja worth Rs 80 lakh.

In the first incident, the central crime station received a tip-off about the transport of ganja and alerted Sullurpet police to check vehicles.

When a car ignored the cops’ signal to stop at the Sri City junction checkpoint and sped away on the Srikalahasti route, they chased the car and intercepted it with the help of Tada police. Nearly 180 kgs of ganja was found in the car, which was being driven by one R Veeranam, who was taken into custody.

After interrogation, Veeranam told them that another car was heading to Tiruchi in Tamil Nadu with 250 kgs of ganja. The cops alerted Kavali police, who intercepted the car and recovered the contraband. Car driver Tanneeru Srinivas was also arrested.

The accused confessed that the weed had been procured from Badrachalam in Telangana and was being transported to Tiruchi in Tamil Nadu, from where it was supposed to be transported to Sri Lanka.

Two separate cases have been registered under relevant sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances ( NDPS ) Act and further investigation is underway, said Nellore superintendent of police (SP) Bhaskar Bhushan.

PANAJI: Criminals seem to be having a field day in Goa, as police have no authority to maintain surveillance over dangerous offenders and history-sheeters. With the high court giving the police an earful for keeping tabs on criminals sans jurisdiction, Goa police brass have sought government intervention to adopt the Bombay police manual , which will empower them to legally keep an eye on known criminals in the state.

The police recently found themselves on the backfoot before the court, when two alleged criminals challenged the authority of the police to open their history sheets.

As the state does not have its own police manual, it had decided to adopt the manual of the neighbouring state. The Goa draft police manual was ready in November 2018, but it has not received government approval as yet.

The manual is aimed at regulating the functioning of the department, including investigation, punishment and appeal matters.

In the high court, public prosecutor S R Rivankar had said that the matter of adoption of the provisions of the Bombay Police Manual was under the consideration of the government.

A convicted criminal had approached the high court to challenge the decision of the Goa police to reopen his history sheet and put him under surveillance, along with their photograph, fingerprints and other personal information.

At the hearing, the HC held that there was no law in existence in the Goa, covering this area of police authority.

“No document has been shown to us (high court) that the Bombay Police Manual has been adopted in the state of Goa. It is held that as of today, the police officers are opening history sheets and placing people under surveillance, without there being any authority whatsoever,” the HC observed.

The HC said they had to accede to the request of the petitioner for grant of protection and therefore, directed that surveillance on the petitioner shall cease forthwith.

The Goa police manual has, among others, rules pertaining to the internal functioning of police, maintaining of discipline within the force, filing of FIR and appeals, and investigation, besides various drills and procedures to be followed. As there was no police manual for the state, Goa police prepared the draft manual.

Trichy: Five more TNSTC low-floor (red) buses have been added to city routes as there has been an overwhelming patronage for it from passengers. TNSTC said that the red buses are comfortable and will help it shore up their revenue amidst tough competition from private city buses.

Around 200 city buses with TNSTC Dheeran Nagar and Rockfort depots serve the city, but most of them are either modified mofussil or decade-old two-seater buses. TNSTC Trichy introduced a low-floor bus connecting KK Nagar with Srirangam via Central bus stand in December 2018.

Ever since its inception, the red bus, owing to its comfortable bucket type seats and ample space for standing, was a top pick among passengers. As there was a demand to increase the strength of red buses, TNSTC has introduced five more low-floor vehicles on city routes. “Three of the new red city buses are assigned to Dheeran Nagar depot and two buses to Rockfort depot. We expect more such new models to join our fleet shortly,” a TNSTC official said.

The LED display showing destinations and stops and the low-floor in the red buses help senior citizens to board the appropriate buses at ease. As a safety feature, these buses have automatic door locks to prevent travelling on footboards.

“More such swanky red city buses should be introduced in Trichy city connecting Trichy international airport and NIT Trichy. Such addition will strengthen TNSTC and prevent them from losing revenue to private buses,” H Ubaidullah, member, Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours said.

Unlike other major cities including Chennai, Madurai and Coimbatore, as Trichy city has the maximum number of private city buses on par with state-run fleets, TNSTC sources acknowledged the need to increase the strength of low-floor buses here.

According to the FIR Kamaria too hurled castiest abuses, threatening the people not to attempt to enter the premises if they didn’t want to be beaten up.

While the body lay on the roadside, a few of the mourners informed the police about the incident.

While the caretaker fled till the cops could arrive at the scene, the police stayed put on the premises to ensure the cremation was done peacefully and also asked Vaghela to file an FIR.

In his FIR, Vaghela also alleged that the two main accused, Raja Bharda and Laxman Bharda, has encroached upon land beside the Ramapir temple in the village, which was earlier used by the Dalit community people. The Dalit leaders also submitted a memorandum to the Mangrol Mamlatdar in this regard claiming that not allowing them to perform last rites in a public crematorium is extreme atrocity.

Investigation into the case has been entrusted to DySP SC/ST cell Junagadh H S Ratnu, who couldn’t be reached for his comments.

Ashok Kumar Bhattacharya

BHOPAL: On the second day of the Bhopal literature fest, noted archaeologist and museologist Ashok Kumar Bhattacharya dwelt at length on the political and economic disruptions that have taken place in the country over the years. He took the audience on a literary tour since Independence.

Dealing with the chain of events from the country’s Partition to the Emergency in 1975, Bhattacharya said the country went through a tumultuous phase during this period. Referring to his book ‘The Rise of Goliath’, Bhattacharya threw light on 12 such disruptions that changed social and political dynamics of India. He said, “We cannot look at disruptions as separate incidents but if we pay attention to the events in totality, we will get a comprehensive picture of the country’s political economic situation.”

Some of the ‘disruptions’ that he talked about were the oil shock of the 1970s, the proclamation of Emergency in 1975 and the demonetisation of high-value currency notes in November 2016. He also stressed on the role of a powerful team of advisors in the decision-making while comparing interesting analogies in policy making in the country from Jawaharlal Nehru to Narendra Modi ’s rule. He urged the audience to read the book and analyse some of the future perspectives he has penned about the political and economic disruptions that could hit India in the next few years.

Representative image

UTTARKASHI: One of the seven students, who were left stranded in snow in the forests of Radi Top region in Uttarkashi district for several hours, died on way to hospital on Friday night.

The deceased student has been identified as 18-year-old Anuj Semwal. He was a resident of Dhauntari village in Uttarkashi district.

The students – all studying at government-run Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Barkot - had left for their homes in Uttarkashi district on Friday afternoon. All of them decided to travel by foot as they failed to find any vehicle due to thick blanket of snow on Radi Top region of Yamunotri highway, which connects Barkot to Uttarkashi district headquarters.

But, in the evening, the students couldn’t find their way out in the heavy snow cover. The roads were blocked and they decided to cover a distance of 15km from Barkot town to Radi Top, reportedly on foot.

After being stuck in Radi Top region, Semwal fell sick. Seeing his deteriorating health, one of the students used his mobile to seek urgent assistance from his relatives. Soon after getting information, teams from State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and local police started a search operation at night. They found the students in the forest and sent them to Barkot health centre for treatment. However, Semwal succumbed owing to severe cold. The other rescued students were sent back to ITI after medical treatment.

Inspector Digpal Kohli, in-charge Barkot police station, said on Saturday, “One of the students was severely affected by snow and frost. His condition deteriorated and he succumbed on the way to hospital. We have sent back the remaining six students to ITI.”

Principal of ITI Barkot, Niranjan Kukshal said, “Despite our appeal to not travel in heavy snow, all seven students took leave and left for their homes, which later turned fatal for one of them. All the staff and students are in a state of shock after hearing the news.”

Representative image

CUTTACK: A 15-year-old dispute over a child’s paternity will finally see a resolution, with the Orissa high court on Friday allowing DNA testing of the son of a couple — now in the middle of a divorce — after a family court had in 2014 rejected the husband’s plea for such a procedure.

Although the DNA test was ordered only after the mother agreed to have the procedure done upon her 14-year-old child, the high court has taken note of the fact that the husband’s plea might be an attempt to tarnish her image, and has incorporated safeguards against this in its order.

The couple in question married on May 11, 2005, and the woman gave birth to a child six months later, on November 27, 2005, according to medical records. The husband approached the family court in Cuttack in 2006, seeking declaration of the union as void on the grounds that his wife was pregnant at the time of marriage by a person other than him. The case dragged on for years, and, on October 15, 2014, the family court dismissed his plea for a DNA test on the child.

The high court on Friday overturned the family court’s order and said, “This court is of the view that the only way to prove such disputes is to have the DNA test.”

“Looking at the nature of the dispute and the required proof, this court observes that such presumption can only be based on strong, clear and cogent, satisfactory and conclusive evidence. Thus there is no other way to go,” a single-judge bench of justice Biswanath Rath said, adding that the test was to be done at the central or state Forensic Science Laboratory on January 22.

“The wife will accompany the son to the laboratory at 11 am on the date fixed, in a vehicle arranged at the cost of the husband. The petitioner (the husband) shall also be present to have his blood sample drawn by the competent authority along with the blood of the child and the wife. The entire expense of the procedure shall be borne by the husband. Blood samples shall be drawn in presence of all three involved. The report shall be submitted to the family court within 10 days thereafter,” justice Rath said in the order.

The court, however, added, “Keeping in view that there is a possibility that this is an attempt to tarnish the prestige of the wife as well as the child by the husband, he is directed to deposit a sum of Rs 2,00,000 in the family court before the date fixed for drawing blood sample.”

It further said, “In the event the husband succeeds, the entire amount with interest accrued thereon will be refunded to him. In the event the wife succeeds, the entire sum with interest accrued will be distributed equally between her and the son.”

182,['12/01/2020'],Disabled want their ID cards accepted as ID proof for voting,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Trichy: Persons with disabilities ( PwD ) in the city have appealed to the State Election Commission (SEC) to include differently-abled identification (ID) cards provided to them by the state government as one of the ID proofs to vote in the civic body elections.

The inclusion of such ID cards as one of the valid ID proofs will be a moral boost for them and will pave way for the public to treat them as equals.

M Kamaraj, a PwD hailing from Anna Nagar in his petition to the SEC has urged the authority to include differently-abled ID cards as one of the ID proofs.

Since the SEC already accepts 11 types of ID cards including passport, health insurance and bank passbooks, the inclusion of their ID cards will be a recognition for them.

“At least in the ensuing civil body polls for urban local bodies, the state election commission should consider accepting the differently-abled ID cards as one of the proofs. If done, Tamil Nadu will be a model state in fanning behavioural change among the public by ensuring equal treatment for PwDs,” Kamaraj told TOI.

In the recently concluded rural civic body polls, many PwD candidates have won panchayat presidents and ward member posts across the state, so the petitioner said that inclusion of differently-abled ID cards will enable the participation of more PwDs in the democratic process.

“The differently-abled ID card is provided by the state government through the district differently-abled welfare department. It is unfair if the state government itself ignores the ID card provided by it,” said, P Maarikannan, secretary, Trichy district differently-abled welfare association.

The PwDs said they are planning to meet elected representatives to materialise their demand.

DEHRADUN: After the name of a BJP legislator’s son cropped up in the SC/ST scholarship scam, the state’s saffron camp was shaken, since this is the first time that a sitting legislator’s family has been embroiled in a scam.

According to the state police, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) has registered ten FIRs against 16 colleges in Dehradun and 40 colleges in the Haridwar district. In Dehradun, the SIT is scrutinizing the SC/ST scholarship records of the institutes belonging to the BJP legislator’s family.

The petitioner of SC/ST scholarship in the high court, social activist Ravinder Jugran, alleged that the scam is worth over Rs 500 crore and the network of institutes spread to seven other states including Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and UP.

“The high court is monitoring the case and progress of the SIT’s probe. I am sure many big guns are involved in the scam because it was a nexus of institutes-officials-banks under the patronage of the political class.”

The SIT’s investigation has revealed that the SC/ST scholarship irregularities in the institute belonging to the BJP legislator had taken place in 2011-12. Speaking with TOI, SIT chief TC Manjunath said, “We have records of the institute receiving SC/ST scholarships and an investigation is underway. I cannot reveal anything more.”

BJP state president Ajay Bhatt said: “The case is being investigated by the SIT, which has been given free hand to probe the allegations. The matter is sub judice and I won't comment further.”

“The party line is very clear in this case. Anyone whose name figures in the SC/ST scholarship scam will have to face music, irrespective of their background or ideology,” Bhatt added.

184,['12/01/2020'],Vizag witnessed only 4 sunstroke deaths in 2018,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Vijayawada continues to remain on top for a third straight year in terms of most number of sunstroke deaths, compared to 53 other cities in India, as per the 2018 Accident Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI) data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) recently.

Vijayawada also climbed three spots to stand third, behind Varanasi and Ludhiana, in terms of overall accidental deaths caused by forces of nature.

In 2016, the city was not even in top 10 in the overall category, though it topped the sunstroke deaths chart. But in 2018, while the rest of the country saw a 21% decline in sunstroke deaths, Vijayawada was the only city that saw a 25% increase compared to 2017. The city also saw a whopping 254% increase compared to 2016 and 77% increase compared to 2015 data.

Around 75% of these sunstroke victims happen to be male and mostly kids aged below 18. Nevertheless, this is the third consecutive when heat/sunstroke accounted for 100% of deaths in the ‘forces of nature’ category. In 2015, around 88% people who died due to forces of nature did so die to sunstroke.

It is not surprising that heat-related deaths have been showing an increasing trend since 2016 as, corroborating the ADSI data, the city’s daytime temperatures too have soared in the last three years. The highest temperature Vijayawada recorded in 2018 was 48.5 degrees Celsius, which was just 1.5 degrees shy of the official red alert mark. Chopping of trees as part of highway expansion and other road expansion projects have played a significant role in the rise in daytime temperatures.

Interestingly, Visakhapatnam, which is known for its humidity during the summer, recorded only four deaths due to forces of nature in 2018. On a positive note, AP saw 210 accidental deaths due to forces of nature which is a 39% decrease compared to 2017, which comes as a surprise as two major cyclones, Phethai and Titli, made landfall in the state’s north coastal region during the year.

Trichy: Trichy Corporation will be setting up temporary bus shelters on Williams road and Mannarpuram to cater tothe Pongal festival rush as the existing Central bus stand is reeling under severe space crunch. Since 2013, to cater to the festive rush during Deepavali and Pongal, the corporation has been establishing temporary bus stops by spending Rs 3-Rs 4 lakh on each every time.

Although the temporary bus shelters eases passenger rush, it also dilutes the demand to establish an integrated bus terminus for the city, allege residents.

“Integrated bus terminus is a permanent solution, we do not need temporary remedies. Residents are clueless about how long the civic body will evade their responsibility in finding a site for the integrated bus terminus. We have lost 20 years already,” said Vignesh Subramani, a Trichy based advocate.

Even though thousands of passengers, heading towards Thanjavur and Madurai, visit the temporary bus shelters, basic amenities have always been inadequate. Due to inadequate urinals, the vicinity around the temporary bus stops often ends up a sanitary mess besides causing inconvenience as boarding buses to all parts of the state at a common spot is ruled out. The integrated bus terminus could also have reduced travel time for commuters.

Though the authorities are aware that the existing Central bus stand is incapable of handling the rush, the hesitation to identify the location for the integrated bus terminus, for which Panchapur is a frontrunner, is flayed by the locals. The civic body sources maintained that the site for the integrated bus terminus will soon be identified.

KOCHI: Each of the three buildings in Maradu created large plumes of dust as it fell. Much to the horror of curious onlookers, the dust rose voluminously and dissipated in all directions for nearly 15 minutes. While the area around the buildings sported a white sheen, the dust cleared around an hour after the blasts.Unofficial figures put the dust generated at more than 400 microns per cubic metre while the air pollution at the sites were much higher. The noise of the blasts at Alfa Serene was recorded at around 114 decibels (dB) while that at Holy Faith H2O was much less.The entire road and pathways around the areas were covered with a film of white cement. “The fine dust particles could be seen spreading out. In and around the buildings, the dust blooms settled very quickly. It needs to be washed away quickly. A rain shower would be a miracle,” said state pollution control board chairman Ajit Haridas.The PCB chief who was monitoring the situation said the analysis would be ready in a couple of days. “It was more like a dust-fall level, more than the fine particulate matter and definitely more than PM 2.5 level,” he said.Researchers from the school of environmental sciences of MG University said air pollution levels at ground zero could not be recorded but outside the 200m exclusion zone they came in at 100-165 microns per cubic metre. “At ground zero, it would have been several times higher,” said Prof CT Aravindakumar.However, what played truant was the wind direction. “The wind was not moving in any particular direction and hence the dust got scattered,” he added.PCB officials said that emissions were observed as expected. A study will be conducted to assess the approximate quantum of dust emanated from the demolitions and will be submitted within a week. Some debris from one of the towers of Alfa Serene’s fell into the backwaters but inspection did not reveal much.Officials have begun monitoring the air quality ahead of the demolition of Jains Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram.

Trichy: The security hold area (SHA) at the international airport here has been expanded to ease the congestion felt during peak hours. The area which had a capacity to accommodate only 450 passengers has 120 more seats now which were installed at a cost of Rs 37 lakh.

Airport authorities said passengers can experience a hassle-free journey without any rush from now on. Airport Authority of India’s officiating regional executive director, southern region, V B Chandrakumar inaugurated the expanded facility here on Saturday. The area originally had a seating capacity of only 250, but it was expanded with 200 additional seats by the then airport director B C H Negi a few years ago. The rising international passenger traffic has necessitated further expansion, a senior AAI official said.

“Though 120 more seats have been arranged on the newly expanded security hold area, there is still enough space to accommodate 80 more passengers. That space will also be utilized effectively”, he added. Frequent flyers expressed happiness at the expansion of SHA which would help accommodate more passengers. “Existing SHA has been promptly connected with an aerobridge. As there is no separate exit for the expanded area, passengers have to walk along the existing area to take the aerobridge. If a separate exit is established near the new SHA, passengers can easily come out and take the aerobridge”, D Edward, a frequent flyer, opined.

JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar

NEW DELHI: On Saturday, six days after mob violence wracked the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar met at least a dozen people, purportedly students. While he is yet to reach out to the students and teachers who were targeted by the masked attackers and even injured, some have questioned the VC’s intentions in meeting the unidentified group on Saturday. Different student organisations active in the campus claimed not to have any intimation of a meeting of this sort or had information about those who had met Kumar.

In the photographs of the meeting, tweeted by a news agency and retweeted by the VC, the faces of the participants are not clear. However, Kumar said he told them, “The terror created by some of the activist students was such that many of our students had to leave the hostels. We have enhanced security on the campus to ensure innocent students are not hurt.”

While saying JNUSU had no knowledge of the “students and the organisations they belong to, shown sitting at a long table with the VC, union vice-president Saket Moon added, “None of them were JNUSU members, hostel presidents or elected student representatives.” Usually a circular is issued followed by mail to students whenever there is a meeting with the VC scheduled. “No student received such a circular. I only learnt of this meeting from the media people when I was at AIIMS,” claimed JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh.

Sunny Mehta, in-charge of JNU NSUI unit, alleged, “While we cannot identify the students, we feel some are from ABVP or those associated with a particular ideology.” The RSS-affiliated student organisation, however, refuted this, with ABVP JNU president Durgesh Kumar saying, “Neither was ABVP invited nor did its activists participate in the meeting.”

Ghosh later criticised Kumar for not meeting the injured students. “The VC says that his home is open and anyone can come and meet him. Should I go to him injured like this?” the JNUSU president asked, adding, “We have requested the Union HRD ministry to sack him as he has no moral ground to continue as head of the university.”

Despite repeated attempts, none in the JNU administration, among them the VC, registrar or the pro-VC, responded to TOI’s calls and text messages asking them the identity of the meeting participants.

A leopard

DEHRADUN: A 40-year-old labourer Sukhram Singh was mauled to death by a leopard in BHEL area of Haridwar on Friday night. The man was killed when he had gone to work at BHEL factory.

When Singh, a resident of Hetampur village of SIDCUL industrial area, didn’t return from work, his kin reported the matter to the nearest police station.

However, the forest officials haven’t confirmed that the death was an outcome of leopard attack. They maintain that the cause of death will be ascertained only after the postmortem report comes in.

Officials added that in two separate instances in the past, two people from the area had gone missing. In both the cases, slum-dwellers of the area had claimed that the victims were killed by leopard. However, it was later found out that they had left home due to personal issues.

“Yes the body of Singh was consumed by a leopard but we cannot make out if he was attacked by a leopard or the big cat just found his body. The killing can be confirmed as a human-animal conflict death only after autopsy report comes in,” Akash Verma, divisional forest officer of Haridwar, told TOI.

Meanwhile, locals are expressing concern regarding leopard attack threat. They say that a leopard has been spotted in the area by commuters and its movements have also been caught by CCTV cameras. The residents of the area have expressed their displeasure as the wild cat hasn’t been trapped or tranquilised by the forest department.

“The killing took place in BHEL area, which has grass and trees in an unkempt manner. This makes the landscape a suitable habitat for leopards. So, the possibility of a leopard attack cannot be completely denied. Despite repeated requests to BHEL to clear the area, their officials do not take any action,” said Verma. The official also pointed out that waste generated from BHEL area is dumped close to the park which attracts animals. “Such points are easy food areas for animals. Immediate steps should be taken to fix this issue as well,” he added.

Addressing the 21st convocation of Srimad Andavan Arts and Science College, Thiruvanaikoil on Saturday, he said institutions must lay greater emphasis on skill development and establish industry linkages. This would give students first-hand experience of working in an enterprise and at the same time cultivate the spirit of entrepreneurship.

He appealed to students to protect nature and preserve culture for a better future. “When I crossed the river Cauvery, I noticed water flowing on the river. I got down from the vehicle breaching the protocol and went to the bridge side and saw the water and I felt very happy. Because water is our life, rivers are life. Unfortunately, because of neglect all rivers are drying and dying,” the VP said adding that the time has come to rejuvenate and connect all rivers. For the past few decades, people have been seeing the adverse impact of global warming and climate change. People have tinkered with nature for too long and now they are experiencing the impact of nature’s fury. Despite being a perennial river once upon a time, Cauvery is not flowing, he said. “Water problem will be a severe problem for the whole world. So, we have to find ways how to use, reduce and reuse water. Rainwater harvesting system should be part of our education system”, he stressed.

Nashik: The Congress, Shiv Sena and BJP units of Nandurbar district, in North Maharashtra, are engaged in hectic parleys to gain control of the local zilla parishad (ZP).

In the recently concluded ZP polls, the Nandurbar voters have given a hung verdict. None of the parties has been able to get to the magic figure of 29 in the 56-member House.

Congress and BJP won 23 seats each. Both these parties need the support of Shiv Sena — which won seven seats — to come to power in the ZP. NCP with three seats fared poorly in the polls.

Sena insiders said the senior functionaries of local BJP unit recently held an informal discussion with their Sena counterparts.

“We have told BJP functionaries that Sena is keen on the ZP president post. If that is not possible, then BJP should give us the post of ZP vice-president along with the posts of chairmen of three important committees,” said Sena sources. They added that the BJP workers have promised to revert after discussing the matter with their high command.

According to senior Sena functionary of Nandubar, Chandrakant Raghuvanshi, the local party unit had two rounds of meetings with party MP and strategist Sanjay Raut in Mumbai since Friday.

“We have made our stand clear — that in the ZP polls, both Congress and BJP were our main opponents. Both these parties should not take our support for granted. Sena must get some important posts in the ZP,” added Raghuvanshi, a former MLC.

According to Nandurbar Sena workers, Raut has told them that he would discuss the issue with Uddhav Thackeray and the state Congress leadership before taking a final stand.

The election for the new Nandurbar ZP president and vice-president posts is likely to take place on January 17, before which, Sena has to take a stand.

The Nandubar Congress workers said state tribal welfare minister and local MLA K C Padavi is in touch with party and Sena top brass on the issue. “We are optimistic that Sena will extend support to Congress,” said a local Congress functionary.

Meanwhile, on Saturday, Congress completed the group registration process of its 23 newly elected ZP members at the district collectorate, which is a mandatory process for all parties after the results.

Komal Sharma has been recognised by a fellow student as a participant in the violence

NEW DELHI: India Today investigation’s second part pinned the identity of the girl in the viral post of the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University students and teachers on January 5 . A grab of the post was reported in TOI on January 6 showing a masked man with a sledgehammer and a girl in a checked shirt with a stick in hand, her face covered with a blue scarf and standing with a section of the mob.

While she had been recognised by fellow students earlier, Akshat Awasthi, who was caught on camera confessing to mobilising the mob during the attack at the varsity, revealed Komal Sharma as a fellow participant in the violence.

Identifying her, Awasthi said, “Komal Sharma was there in the mess. In Sabarmati (hostel) when the crowd approached… Komal was secretly trying to enter the mess. When I entered, she was scared. She thought even I was from the Left. I told her...I am from your side,” Awasthi tells the reporters, detailing how the two escaped as a couple, as has been reported.

An audio clip reportedly of Komal saying her photo has gone viral was also identified by a senior, Anuja Thakur who told India Today, “Not only a junior in college, she was also a junior in school.” Thakur had made the audio clip public. Komal Sharma is a student of Delhi University’s Daulat Ram college.

India Today retrieved her Facebook page name ‘Komal Sharma ABVP’. All her social media accounts have been deactivated. The media report said Thakur also revealed that Komal had sent her senior the masked face photo.

Countering ABVP’s disowning of Awasthi, the reporters sourced videos of an ABVP march to the Union HRD ministry on November 21, 2019, that Awasthi was part of. The video was pulled out from JNU student and ABVP office-bearer Mahesh Jangid’s Facebook account, who was in studio and reluctantly confirmed Awasthi’s presence. In another shot, Awasthi is shown in the frontline of an ABVP rally, surrounded by ABVP flags.

Awasthi also confirmed Delhi Police’s presence on campus earlier and said police told them ‘thokk do’, or ‘beat them up’. The report re-run the video of Delhi Police idling while a group of unruly men walk out with lathis in hand yelling Bharat Mata ki Jai after the mayhem on campus.

THANJAVUR: Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu hailed Thyagaraja as a music stalwart who made immense contributions to the cultural heritage of the country. “His contributions cannot be quantified or estimated. It is infinite in its resonance,” he said.

Naidu was inaugurating the 173rd Thyagaraja Aradhana Festival in Thiruvaiyaru in Thanjavur here on Saturday. “His compositions, which have been cherished over centuries, will continue to be treasured by the young and the old. In the turbulent times that we live in, it is comforting to pause and reflect on our unique cultural heritage. There is no doubt that ‘art unites hearts’,” he said. Thyagaraja not only embodied ethical and philosophical truths in his songs, but put them into practice in his daily life. His compositions were truly treasures for the world of music and will live in our hearts forever, he said. “After all these years, as we congregate at this holy place today to pay our respects to Saint Thyagaraja every successive year, we should mention the yeomen services rendered by Moopanar’s family and the past and present office-bearers of the Sabha to the memory of Thyagaraja and Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha,” he said.

“Our schools and educational institutions must strive to sensitize children to the diverse elements of our culture. From reading Jataka tales to experiencing the architectural marvels of ancient India, they must be encouraged to explore various fascinating facets of our culture and learn lessons from them. The future generations must never forget their roots. But they also must not be confined by it,” he said.

“I am hopeful that it will succeed in taking the treasures of India classical music to future generations,” said

Third railway line near Habeebganj Railway station.

BHOPAL: The third railway line work between Bhopal station and Habibganj station is likely to be delayed by another 4-5 months due to delay in opening of the Subhash Nagar RoB. Railway officials said that work on the third line will not start until they close the Subhash Nagar level crossing, which can only be done once traffic starts at the RoB.

Railway is constructing the third line between Bina and Itarsi. The work between Bina and Bhopal has been completed while work in other parts is in full swing. However, the delay in Subhash Nagar RoB opening has put the third line work on hold, railway officials said.

Railway officials claimed that the total width of one side of the bridge is the same as the width of the existing level crossing and it it should be made functional at the earliest. According to official deadline, the work of Subhash RoB should have been completed by February 2019.

The 40 crore (Rs 28 crore by PWD while rest 12 crore by Railways) worth Subhash Nagar RoB has been delayed by almost one-and-half year. State PWD and Indian Railways are constructing the RoB. A senior railway official told TOI that due to safety concern they can’t close the Subhash Nagar railway crossing, as aresult the third line work is suffering. “It is a heavy traffic level crossing. We can only start working on the third railway line once the level crossing is closed. If we close it now, the traffic will suffer. The only way is to divert traffic from the level crossing to Subhash Nagar RoB. One side of the bridge has been completed where traffic could be started without any issue,” said the official.

When contacted, Bhopal DRM Uday Borwanker said, “We have been closing level crossings at several places. It will take another 4-5 months to complete the other side work. If traffic is not allowed to start on the one side of the Subhash Nagar RoB which has already been completed then we have to keep the level crossing open. If we continue with the Subhash Nagar level crossing it is not possible to start the third line work.”

When contacted, PWD engineer-in-chief RK Mehra said that our department has completed its work. “We have completed our work. It is the railways which has to complete its work. Whenever they complete their work, we will start traffic on the bridge.”

Mehra categorically stated that it is not possible to start the traffic on one side of the bridge. “Railways want to start the traffic on one side of the bridge as they want to close the level crossing. This is not possible. Traffic is allowed only when both sides are completed. There are safety issues related with this,” said Mehra.

A huge pink coloured octopus welcomed the guests at the entrance gate of the faculty premises which was filled with whales, fishes and figures of the aquatic life prepared from card boards as the fair was held this time with ‘Marine’ as theme.

But the fair this time was held under close watch of the university administration. Three syndicate members were asked to keep an eye on the artefacts and activities of students to ensure that the campus does not witness any fresh controversy.

Students, however, displayed their creative best not only through the art works that they have been preparing since last one and a half month but also with the plays ‘Anarkali ka kya?’ and ‘Time bomb’ that were specially prepared for the fair.

From mobile installations, puppet shows, creative crafts, handicrafts, decorations, toys, enamel arts, ceramic crafts, textile, handmade jewellery in metal, ceramics, calendars, portfolios, sculptures and much more, it was a visual treat for the art enthusiasts.

The fair is a legacy that started in 1961 by late professor Shankho Chowdhary and professor K G Subhramanyan. The last fine arts fair took place in 2011.

Representative image

SALEM: The ruling AIADMK won three district panchayat chairman posts while its allay PMK and the opposition party DMK shared one each post in Salem region as indirect elections to choose them and panchayat union chairman were held on Saturday.

The Salem region comprises Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Erode and Salem districts.

The state had in December last year held polls to elect district panchayat ward councillors, panchayat union ward councillors, village panchayat chairmen and village panchayat ward councillors. On Saturday, it was their turn to choose district panchayat chairman and panchayat union chairman.

In Salem, PMK candidate Revathi and the DMK’s Nallammal contested the district panchayat chairman post. “While Revathi secured 22 votes, her opponent got only four votes,” district collector S A Raman said.

While thanking everyone, who worked for her success, Revathi said she would work to provide basic amenities such as drinking water and roads in all panchayats.

Meanwhile, indirect elections to fill panchayat union chairman posts were suspended in two unions - Kolathur in Salem district and Paramathi in Namakkal district - due to lack of quorum.

Similarly, the indirect election to select the panchayat union chairman was also suspended in Tharamangalam union in Salem district, citing law and order issue. “Annamuthu, of Tharamangalam, lodged a police complaint stating ward 1 councillor Janaki was abducted and chances of political parties creating law and order issues were high, if indirect elections were held in her absence. So, we suspended the indirect election,” the collector said. He said the election would be conducted once the situation returned to normal.

In Namakkal, AIADMK’s R Saratha was elected unanimously as the district panchayat chairman (reserved for SC), while the ruling party candidates K Navamani and Yasotha Mathivanan won the posts in Erode and Dharmapuri districts, respectively.

In Krishnagiri district, DMK’s Manimekalai Nagaraj won the district panchayat chairman post.

208,['12/01/2020'],Provocative speech: ‘Nellai’ Kannan comes out on bail,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Salem: Writer and orator ‘Nellai’ Kannan came out of the Salem Central Prison on bail on Saturday morning after the Tirunelveli principal sessions court on Friday accepted his plea for the same in a hate speech case. He was released through the back door of the jail to avoid any possible attack by BJP supporters.

Kannan was arrested on January 2 for delivering the provocative speech at a public meeting that was organized by the Social Democratic Party of India to condemn the Citizenship Amendment Act in Tirunelveli on December 29.

A police source said the writer was booked by the Melapalayam police based on a complaint lodged by a BJP functionary. “They arrested him at a guest house in Perambalur and lodged him in the Salem Central Prison in judicial custody.”

Meanwhile, Kannan moved the Tirunelveli judicial magistrate court for bail. On Friday evening, principal sessions judge A Nazir Ahamed granted him bail by asking him to put his signature at the Melapalayam police station twice a day at 10am and 5pm.

The bail order was served on the prison authorities on Saturday around 3.30am. Subsequently, Kannan was released from the prison.

While TMMK and SDPI party functionaries were waiting in front of the prison to welcome Kannan, much to their disappointment, jail authorities let him out through the back door from where his son Suresh picked him up in a car.

‘Nellai’ Kannan’s advocate Jahir Hussain said the prison officials had sent his client out through the back door intentionally. “There were no BJP people outside the prison.”

High-intensity blast injured four others too

VADODARA: Six workers were killed and four others critically injured in a blast which took place in a gas bottling plant at Padra in Vadodara district , about 30km from the city, at around 10.30am on Saturday.

The high-intensity explosion occurred in Aims Industries Private Limited which bottles oxygen for hospital and industrial use and other gases. Police sources and eyewitnesses said a few cylinders that contained hydrogen and oxygen gas blasted killing the six people, who were near them, on the spot. Their bodies were completely disfigured.

Four injured persons were rushed to Community Health Centre at Vadu and later referred to BAPS Swaminarayan Hospital at Atladra.

Vadu police have registered a case against five accused involved in the management of the company. Those booked were owner Siddharth Patel, his son and director Shwetanshu Patel, director Satyakumar Nair, plant manager Akash Agrawal and plant operator-cum-supervisor Raju Rathwa.

They have been booked for not providing enough safety equipment to the workers at the plant premises and also not putting up enough sign boards and signages regarding safety measures that need to be followed while refilling oxygen and hydrogen bottles.

The complaint filed by Vadu police inspector S D Dhobi also states that there was nobody at the plant to provide proper guidance to the workers involved in refilling of the bottles. The accused have been booked for negligence and culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

The deceased were identified as Ashok Padhiyar, a native of Bharuch; Gulabsinh Rathod, from Padra; Mafat Parmar, of Savli; Fatehsinh Padhiyar, a native of Padra; Sanjay Vaghri, a native of Padra; and Vagha Bharwad, a native of Ankleshwar town near Bharuch.

Police officials said that it is suspected that blast took place due to high-pressure created while refilling cylinders with gases. “The exact reason can be ascertained only after the injured persons give their statements,” the police official said.

Due to absence of a senior manager or the owner of the company, cops initially faced difficulties in identifying the deceased and the injured.

Fire engines and safety officers of a glass manufacturing company also took part in the rescue operation.

This is besides the 1,512 acre land earmarked exclusively for Japanese companies since September 2018. These estates are not only for Japanese investors to set up their plants but also to develop residential areas, hospitals, schools, amusement facilities and so on,” said Yuichi Bamba , director general, JETRO, Ahmedabad.JETRO has been instrumental in promoting Gujarat as an investment destination for Japanese companies. Thanks to its efforts, more than 50 Japanese companies have already invested in Gujarat. “The potential Japanese investors from other states in India who seek an opportunity for a second round of investments will now be looking towards Gujarat. These also include auto component manufacturers which are vendors to automobile giants,” Bamba said.“With two of the auto majors, Suzuki and Honda, already creating their base in Gujarat, some ancillary manufacturers have started their ventures here too,” Bamba further added.A survey conducted by METI (ministry of economy, trade and industry) of the government of Japan in the financial year 2018, found around 60% of Japanese companies operational in India are thinking of setting up a new factory near Ahmedabad.“Japanese companies are looking to invest in an array of industrial sectors such as auto component manufacturing, engineering, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textile and paper and packaging industry,” said M K Das, principal secretary – industries, government of Gujarat.According to JETRO, the Japanese Industrial Park in Mandal-Becharaji region is expected to emerge as India's largest automobile hub. “Out of nine Japanese firms who have invested, six companies including Mitsubishi Aluminium (IMAX) and TS Tech, have already started their operations here,” said a JETRO spokesperson. “An additional 100 acre in the second phase is available for upcoming Japanese investors,” he added..",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73208940,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157987,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/japanese-cos-in-india-eyeing-gujarat-for-next-expansion/articleshow/73208940.cms
211,['12/01/2020'],Railways yet to pay Rs 880 crore to Madhya Pradesh power discoms,"Representative image

BHOPAL: The Indian Railways has not paid a whopping sum of Rs 880 crore, which is due year-on- year since 2015-16, to state power discoms. This amount is related to cross-subsidy and additional surcharge that is levied on consumers.Replying to a question by BJP MLA Ajay Bishnoi during the recent House session, energy minister Priyavrat Singh said, “The demand letters of Rs121.41 crore, Rs330.31 crore and Rs152.98 crore for 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 (till August) had been issued, but we are still waiting for the amount. Overall Rs 882.03 crore is outstanding with railways since January 2016 when permission for open access was given to railways”.It may be noted that there are provisions in the electricity Act that if any industrial consumer is procuring power from open access, then the consumer is liable to pay a cross-subsidy, as determined by the regulatory commission of the respective state in which the consumer is present, to the discoms. “The concept of cross-subsidy is very simple. In normal tariff determination, the domestic and agricultural consumers are provided tariff at low rates, and the industrial consumers get power at higher rates. For example, if the power procurement rate is Rs 5 per unit, then the discoms can sell it to domestic and agricultural users at rates which are 20% lower than the procurement rate which comes around to Rs 4 per unit, and the same is recovered from the industrial consumers by selling power at 20% higher rates. Thus the effective rate of power sales comes to Rs 5/unit,” former additional CE of the MP Power Generating Company Rajendra Agarwal explained.“Besides these there is an additional surcharge, which is recovered from open access consumers. Power discoms have industrial consumers and on the basis of existing consumers, discoms go into long term power purchase agreements. But if the same consumers opt for open access, then discoms lose consumers, but the PPAs which are long term are legally bound, hence discoms have to pay the fixed charges against the PPAs even if it does not buy power because its industrial consumers have shifted to open access. Thus to recover this loss there is a provision of additional surcharge, which open access consumers have to pay to the discoms. This Rs 880 crore is related to both cross-subsidy and additional surcharge,” Agarwal said.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73212128,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-193932,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/rlys-yet-to-pay-rs-880-crore-dues-to-state-discoms/articleshow/73208904.cms

PANAJI: The Carnival and Shigmo parades will revert to their traditional routes from this year. Since 2018, both parades were held on Dr Jack de Sequeira Road, along the Miramar-Dona Paula stretch, upon the directives of former Panaji MLA and chief minister Manohar Parrikar , owing to traffic issues.

Panaji MLA Atanasio Monserrate told TOI that both parades will be held on the traditional routes from this year. He said the decision was taken as revelers had to stand under the blazing sun sans any shelter and also the lack of festive mood on the new routes.

“The reverberation of percussion instruments is more impactful on the traditional routes rather than the new ones,” he said.

While the traditional route for the Carnival’s float parade was from the Old Secretariat to Campal via DB Marg, the Shigmo procession used to commence at Caculo island and culminate at Azad Maidan. Both routes see a significant traffic flow.

Monserrate also hit out at the traffic police for opposing the shift in routes. He said there were some police officers who have been sitting in their offices for years and doing nothing. “It is the responsibility of the police to manage traffic efficiently during the parades, as was done in the past. ,” he said.

CCP mayor Uday Madkaikar said the decisiuon was taken during a meeting on Friday. “We will write to the traffic police and the district collector about the decision to hold the parades on the traditional routes,” said Madkaikar.

“The traditional routes were changed in view of the construction of the third Mandovi bridge, he explained. ” The Carnival parade will be held on February 22, and the Shigmo parade in March.

Ram Madhav at the national-level conference in MSU on Saturday

Vadodara: A majority of political leaders in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) detained following the abrogation of Article 370 have been set free now and the remaining will ‘hopefully’ be released in the coming days, said BJP general secretary Ram Madhav here on Saturday.

The senior BJP leader was in the city to attend Yugantaar, a national level youth convention organized by M S University’s Institute of Leadership and Governance.

“There were two major restrictions in J&K. One was the internet services that is about to be restored. The other was leaders under detention. Regarding that government will be releasing the rest of 20-25 leaders in phases,” said Madhav, adding that J&K is like any other part of the country now.

The region has been under a lockdown since early August 2019, when the union home ministry informed the Parliament that J&K would lose its special status and be split into two union territories - J&K and Ladakh. The bifurcation came into effect on October 31.

Talking about the current situation in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the BJP leaders said that the violence in JNU campus was started by the leftist elements.

“For decades JNU has been ravaged by this leftist elements and the students there have been exploited by them. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) has clearly said that the people who did violence in JNU have nothing to do with the organisation,” he said.

Regarding the citizenship law, Madhav said that the government has issued a gazette notification regarding the citizenship law and further steps will be taken accordingly.

“The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is now a part of the constitution and if some chief ministers are saying that they would not implement the law in their states are disobeying the constitution. The people there should vote them out in the next election,” he said.

Panaji: Waste management minister Michael Lobo on Saturday said the bioremediation exercise at Sonsoddo garbage dump site has resumed following Margao Municipal Council’s (MMC) letter identifying land for storage of the residual waste.

The remediation work had earlier begun on December 15 last year, but was halted the next day due to non-availability of land to dump the inert matter generated.

Lobo also said that Fomento Green has agreed to exit from the Sonsoddo solid waste management plant, and further discussions will be held with the company on the issue. “The chief minister was busy, and that is the reason we could not hold a meeting,” he said, adding that if Fomento Green exits, then Goa Waste Management Corporation (GWMC) is ready to take over the plant.

Speaking on the bioremediation process, Lobo said. “Work has begun after we received MMC’s letter on Friday. It was earlier stopped because MMC had not given us an official letter to dump the inert generated from remediation,” he said.

The minister said the inert which is generated on a daily basis would be dumped at the two properties identified by MMC, and it will be covered by red mud. “MMC has alloted land to store the refuse derived fuel (RDF) which will be sent to cement factories at Karnataka for incineration. The entire remediation process will take one and half years to complete,” he said.

Allaying fears over the byproducts from bioremediation, Lobo said, “It is like compost and does not contain any hazardous material. People can use it in their fields and gardens,” Lobo said.

GWMC will install a small plant of 25 tonne per day (TPD) to treat wet waste, he said.

VIJAYAWADA: Prakasam district police on Saturday busted an illegal granite transport racket and arrested 16 persons. The racket involved evasion of about Rs 86 crore tax to the government by transporting granite worth of Rs 900 crore over two and a half years by creating 278 fake companies.

Cops registered a case based on a complaint by assistant commissioner of commercial tax VP Srinivas. During investigation, cops found the racketeers had created 278 fake companies to evade goods and services tax (GST) and mining cess to the state government.

According to Prakasam district superintendent of police Siddharth Kaushal, one Jampani Venkata Subbarao alias Subbu was the mastermind behind the racket. He along with Amaraneni Venkateswarlu, Yalaka Ravi and Shaik Raffi collected Aadhaar cards, identity proofs, address proofs and PAN cards of innocent persons to float companies.

They had floated 278 fake companies using these documents with 17 email addresses and 26 mobile numbers. The modus operandi of the gang is to acquire GST numbers using the fake companies to generate e-way bills.

The gang sold these 278 companies to 19 different groups for Rs 35,000 a company. These groups headed by Pathan Arifulla, Dariya Vali, Shaik Shabbir, Shaik Pathan Jani, Peddishetti Ravi Kumar, Kallepalli Shiva, Gurramkonda Bhargav, Challagonda Karthik and Gurramkonda Bhargav generated e-way bills.

These groups also comprises granite markers from various states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal. They used to pilot the trucks loaded with granite stones till Andhra Pradesh border by colluding with local politicians and officials.

The racket used one of the provisions in GST that one can pay GST two months after generating e-way bill. With fake companies they created, these groups generated 18,239 e-way bills to transport nearly Rs 900 crore worth granite. They used to wind up operations of a company after two months generating many bills.

The issue came to light after notices sent by GST officials returned. During field verification officials found the companies do not exist at registered addresses and credentials given to register the companies were fake.

Cops arrested 16 persons involved in the racket and identified 103 others connected with the network. Addanki inspector T Ashok Vardan led the investigation under supervision of Chirala DSP Y Jaya Rama Subba Reddy.

Panaji: In a bid to avoid man-animal conflict in future, chief minister Pramod Sawant has cleared a file to empower the chief conservator of forests (CCF) to release compensation of up to Rs 1 lakh to families whose animals have been killed by wild animals.

Sawant’s move comes days after it was suspected that the recent tiger killings were due to the deaths of domestic animals. “I have cleared the file which will empower the CCF to release compensation of up to Rs 1 lakh to those families whose animals are killed by wild animals,” said Sawant.

The CM said that he has asked the forest department to conduct an inquiry into the tiger deaths and submit a report to him. “Those responsible for the incident will not be spared,” he said.

This week, forest officials discovered four decomposed bodies of tigers in the Mhadei forest. Combing operations were launched after the carcass of a four-year old male tiger was spotted on January 5 in Golauli, Sattari.

Forest officials then found bodies of three more tigers .

Representative image

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad city police have registered three cases against unidentified suspects who were using Facebook profiles to upload child pornography content on social media.

This is the first time in the state that offences are being registered for uploading of child pornography content based on the data shared by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) with the state police headquarters.

Following technical analysis of the uploaded content, their sources of origination were found to be within the limits of different police stations in the city. Accordingly, offences have been registered in the respective police stations.

Highly-placed authorities said the registering of offences is a result of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between NCRB of India and the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), USA. As per the pact signed in the first quarter of 2019, the United States will help India in receiving Tipline reports on online child pornography and child sexual exploitation content from the NCMEC.

A cybercrime official said that after a citizen anonymously alerts the law enforcement agencies about such content using a helpline number or website, the tip automatically gets converted into a report for action and it is called ‘Tipline report’. There is a unique identity number generated for each of the Tipline reports and its status can be checked by punching the said number.

The agreement enables law enforcement agencies to remove child pornography and child sexual abuse-related material from the cyberspace, and initiate action against those uploading such content.

The Tipline reports generated in the first half of 2019 were brought to the notice of the NCRB by the the NCMEC. Following the standard operating procedure, the NCRB sent the communication to Maharashtra special inspector general of police (cybercrime) Brijesh Singh, who, in turn, sent the details along with the CD containing the objectionable content for registration of offences against the suspects to the Aurangabad police.

Accordingly, offences have been registered with the police stations of Cidco, Satara and Cantonment, under relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act. In addition, sections of the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act have also been slapped on the suspect profile users.

224,['12/01/2020'],Ruling party ward councillors ransack Uthankarai panchayat union office,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Krishnagiri/Erode: Tension gripped the Uthankarai panchayat union office after the ruling party members ransacked it following an attack on the vehicle that they were travelling in, injuring a ward councillor. District collector S Prabhakar subsequently suspended the indirect election to the Uthankarai union panchayat chairman post, citing law and order issue.

The incident took place when AIADMK ward councillors were heading to Uthankarai panchayat union office in a van. “Some unidentified people pelted stones at the van, injuring AIADMK ward councillor Suganthi Theerthavari,” ADSP Sakthivel said. She was rushed to a nearby government hospital.

Irked, AIADMK councillors entered the Uthankarai panchayat union office and damaged the voting chits and furniture in the election hall. Meanwhile, DMK ward councillors attempted to lay siege to the union office to condemn the atrocities committed by the AIADMK.

Following this, traffic on the stretch was affected for nearly three hours. Shop vendors also downed their shutters, fearing violence. More than 200 police personnel were deployed at the spot to bring the situation under control.

Former DMK MP Sugavanam and other party functionaries, however, pacified their ward councillors. DMK panchayat union chairman candidate Usharani Kumaresan said the AIADMK councillors had ransacked the office to stop the election, fearing defeat. “We will win the election democratically,” she said.

“We have suspended the indirect election without mentioning the date (to conduct the poll again),” assistant election returning officer K Subramanian said.

Similarly, tension prevailed at Paruvachi panchayat in Erode district after a few people climbed atop a mobile phone tower, saying the district administration and officials were supporting the ruling party to get the vice-chairman post in Paruvachi panchayat.

According to a source, ward 6 councillor M Subramaniam and ward 2 councillor S Aiyyan, who contested the panchayat vice-chairman post, drew a draw after they got five votes each. Finally, officials elected Subramaniam through lot system. Upset, Ayyan and his supporters climbed atop the mobile phone tower, where they stayed put for more than an hour. Though they were later pacified, Ayyan said, he, along with his supporters, would resign from their posts. “We will send the resignation letters to the district administration shortly,” he said.

BHOPAL: All efforts by the Barkatullah University administration to make the campus a no-smoking zone have fallen flat. The university had even announced monetary punishment against offenders, but nothing seems to deter the inmates. Let alone students, even employees do not seem to be taking the order seriously.

In December 2019, Barkatullah University had impose monetary fine of Rs 300 if any person is found smoking on the campus, becoming the first university in the state to take steps to curb smoking. According to the order, if any person is found smoking on the BU premises, he will be fined Rs 300. A seven-member committee was also formed to oversee the implementation of the order. The central and many state governments have already banned smoking at public places.

When TOI team visited the campus to check the ground reality on the campus, BU employees were seen puffing at the very entrance of the administrative building. “People are smoking as the ban has not been implemented properly and just monetary fine is not enough. The need is to create awareness among people,” said Ansh Yadav, a student.

The students alleged that cigarette is easily available near the gate of BU. “When one can easily get the cigarette on the gate, it is impossible to implement the ban. Monetary fine is perfect, but the need is to ensure that cigarette is not available in the open,” said Nishant Verma.

Another student Priti Singh said that the intention of the university is good, but employees and students are not ready to accept it. “It is really shameful that people smoke on the academic campus. BU did the right thing by imposing the ban, but such steps are useless if employees are not ready to accept it,” said a student Anita Yadav.

According to section 6 of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA), sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products is illegal within a 100-yard radius of educational institutions.

When contacted, registrar B Bharti said that he will not spare employees flouting the norm. “I have got the information that some employees are not following the orders. I will not let this happen on the BU campus. Strict action will be taken if people fail to follow the orders,” said Bharti.

Coimbatore: Schoolteachers said they were worried about the question paper pattern for the Class X board exams which they said hadn’t stuck to the model question paper given by the state when it was introduced for the first time in the recently-concluded half-yearly common exams.

Teachers said in mathematics and social science papers, compulsory questions that were mentioned in the model paper were not asked. Similarly, in social science paper, questions that should have been asked for 15 marks were also omitted, they said.

Class X mathematics paper usually has compulsory questions that carry 2 and 5 marks, but they were absent in the half-yearly question paper, said T Arulanandam, a state general body member of Tamil Nadu High and Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers’ Association. “Similarly, the caption and match questions, which together constitute a total of 15 marks, were absent in the social science paper. This had upset the students.”

Similarly, in the Class XII mathematics paper, questions from two units - probability distributions and discrete mathematics - were not asked, he said. “These variations in the papers had caused apprehension among the students and if this gets repeated in the board exams, they would find it difficult,” he said.

Another section of teachers, meanwhile, said officials with the directorate of government examinations had told them that the question paper for the upcoming Class X board exams would be the same as that of the half-yearly exam.

Arulanandam said if mathematics and social papers would be the same as that of the half-yearly exam, students would find it hard. He said the resource persons, who set question papers, should regularly consult teachers and get their feedback. “Teachers and students should also be informed of the weightage that each unit in a subject is given in exams.”

Panaji: By March 31, 2020, 100% households in Goa will be provided water supply pipeline connectivity, chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Saturday. He also said that while Goa has already been declared open defecation free by providing community toilets, the work of providing individual toilets to households will begin soon.

“We have all seen scenes in other states where women walk several kilometers to get water. They place one pot over the other and balancing it atop their head, they walk back home. In Goa, however, we have ensured that women do not go through such hardships. In 87% households, water pipeline connectivity has been provided, and we will provide 100% connectivity by March 31. We will see to it that women do not even have to walk to wells to fetch water,” Sawant said.

After skipping multiple deadlines to rid the state of open defecation, Goa was declared as open defecation free (ODF) on October 31, 2019, through the installation of a mere 538 community toilets. Intially, a requirement of around 70,000 toilets was identified to declare Goa ODF. But the number came down to 16,170 toilets due to lack of adequate land with some applicants.

The directorate of panchayats, through the Goa Solid Waste Management Corporation (GWMC), has now received applications under a state scheme for construction of individual toilets for households which have no toilets, work for which is being taken up.

HYDERABAD: For our man with Hyderabad roots the sky’s the limit. Or, literally, space which extends even beyond the sky.

Raja Jon Vurputoor Chari, an Indian-American with family ties in Hyderabad, is among 11 NASA graduates who have completed initial astronaut candidate training and been shortlisted for mission assignment.

To become an astronaut was 42-year-old Raja Chari’s childhood dream. As an 11-year-old fifth grader in the US, he made a poster of an astronaut for his school assignment and placed his own photograph as the face in the astronaut’s helmet.

Chari’s middle class family migrated from Telangana’s backward Mahbubnagar district to Hyderabad in the 1950s. His father, Srinivas Chari, who studied engineering at Osmania University, flew to Wisconsin in the US in the 1970s for further studies. He met wife Peggy Egbert, an American nurse at University of Wisconsin, there. They married in 1976 and took up a job with John Deere where he worked for 32 years. Chari Sr died in April 2010.

Born and brought up in the US, Raja did not forget his Indian roots. As a pilot in the US Air Force, he flew an F 15 E to Bengaluru for an air show in 2005. During that time he travelled to Hyderabad and met grandmother Ambuja Devi. In interviews to newspapers in the US, he said his regular travels to Hyderabad were a kind of a pilgrimage.

Constant with his dream of becoming an astronaut, Raja pursued a degree in engineering sciences from the US Air Force Academy in 1999. He went on to get a master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with further studies at the US Naval Test Pilot School and US Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

A colonel in the US Air Force, he was selected from among 18,000 applicants in 2017 when NASA announced its Artemis programme for training of future astronauts. The programme aims to put one man and a woman on the moon by 2024. It also aims to send man to Mars. Astronauts selected could also do research at International Space Station.

At a function at Johnson Space Station in Houston on January 10, Raja was among select candidates to receive the ‘silver pin’ after basic astronauts’ training. Selected ones will get further training for the big mission. Raja is married to Holly Schaffter Chari with whom he has three children.

Our man could well be on and over the moon.

Pramod Yeole

AURANGABAD: Pramod Yeole, the vice-chancellor of the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University ( Bamu ), on Saturday, stressed on the need to upgrade the quality of pharmacy education in the country.

In a top honour, Yeole has been appointed the chairman of the All-India Board of Pharmaceutical Education (AIBPE). The university received an official communication declaring the appointment on Saturday. Yeole, a 38-year veteran in teaching, research and administration, is believed to be the first from Maharashtra to chair the key body.

“The field of pharmacy education has tremendous scope. The quality of education offered needs upgrades. Also, there is a need to check the mushrooming of institutions that claim to offer courses in pharmacy to retain the quality of education,” he said.

The AIBPE — a 15-member body that includes representatives from academia and industry — runs under the aegis of the All-India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). It is one of the most vital bodies in pharma education and training. Yeole will head the board for a term of three years.

Yeole said the board has been shouldered with important responsibilities, such as design of the curriculum, policy framing for new and existing institutions and importing international linkages.

Yeole, who holds a PhD in pharmaceutical sciences, previously served as the pro-vice chancellor of the Rashtrasant Tukadoji Maharaj Nagpur University before joining Bamu in July last year. He also served as professor and principal at the Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research at Wardha for 15 years.

Yeole received the Prof GP Srivastava Memorial Award in December last year, during the 71st annual convention of the Indian Pharmaceutical Congress. The award was instituted by the Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India, which is celebrating 53 years of existence.

Labelling the state government’s three-capital concept as a ridiculous attempt which no one in the whole world would attempt, the TDP chief said such an attempt can only be made by a mad Tughluq . “I question the chief minister, who gave him the right to relocate the capital of the state unilaterally? Jagan is not capable of building anything, he is only capable of demolishing and destroying what is in place,” Naidu fumed.

235,['12/01/2020'],Flower prices soar as demand outstrips supply,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Coimbatore: The price of jasmine and Arabian jasmine has soared this festive season as their supply has taken a dip compared to the high demand for them. A source said production of the flowers was hit by frost and snow and as such their arrival to the market has plunged to new lows. “This has shot up their prices,” the source said.

On Saturday, jasmine was sold at Rs 3,000 a kg and Arabian jasmine was priced at Rs 2,000 at the city flower market.

Merchants said they used to get on an average 100kg jasmine and 250kg Arabian jasmine daily. “But for the past one week, we have been getting only around 15kg to 20kg jasmine and 30kg Arabian jasmine. The shortage in supply has resulted in price rise,” said A Azar, a trader from the flower market.

Pointing out that most of the flowers to the city were coming from Sathyamangalam and Karamadai, the merchants said they would also buy flowers from Dindigul whenever the demand was high.

K Manikandan, another merchant from flower market, said, “Till February, when the snow and frost would last, this would be the situation. We can expect it to get better after that.” He, however, said the situation was worse last year. “Last Pongal, the rate of jasmine had touched RRs 7,000 a kg. This year too, the price is expected to go up as Pongal nears,” he said.

Coimbatore: Municipal administration minister SP Velumani on Sunday vowed to quit his post if minority people were to face problems over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Addressing a function that was organized to distribute Pongal gifts hampers to minority people at Karumbukadai, a Muslim dominated area, he said, “Muslims and other minority community people should understand that they won't face any problems due to CAA. If a Muslim is affected by it or NRC, I am ready to quit my post. I don't need the post and power. We will be with the minority people always.”

Pointing out that the Muslims had participated in the freedom struggle, Velumani said chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had made the ruling party's stand on the CAA clear on the floor of the House.

""The minorities are misguided by a section of politicians. The interests of minorities will be protected by the Tamil Nadu government and they should not fall prey to the politically motivated rumours. We are living like brothers and sisters. I have been doing various developmental work in the Muslim populated areas like Karumbukadai. I will be with you always,"" Velumani said.

The minister also said the DMK was trying to create issues in the name of religion. “Minority people should not fall in the DMK's trap.”

Congress made a human chain at the Gurukul crossroads over the water woes issue and supply of turbid water

Vadodara: Some pockets of southern and eastern parts of the city have again started facing minor water shortage since the past couple of days. While there was no fault in the water supply network of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), it came to light that the shortfall in supply was due to regular maintenance at the Nimeta filtration facility which had not been communicated properly.

Sources in the civic body said that suddenly a few water supply tankers supplying water in the eastern and southern parts of the city started getting lesser quantity of water. Many officials pressed the panic button as complaints of insufficient water started to flood the offices.

A VMC official said that water supply pipelines were also checked by staffers to ensure that there were no leakages.

After concerted efforts, they came to understand that the shortfall was due to maintenance work undertaken at one of the water treatment plants at Nimeta filtration facility that draws water from the Ajwa reservoir.

Interestingly, officials looking into water supply at the ward and zone-level came to know about the maintenance only after complaints of water supply surfaced.

Sources said that there was no prior announcement regarding the maintenance and citizens as well as officials were caught off guard. Sources said that the supply would regularize in the coming days.

Congress, meanwhile, made a human chain at the Gurukul Crossroads near Soma Talav over water woes and supply of turbid water.

The party demanded that the water charges of the eastern and southern parts of the city should be waived off in wake of the situation that had prevailed in 2019. Earlier too, the party has made similar demands in the general board of the civic body.

Coimbatore: The AIADMK bagged the district panchayat chairman and vice-chairman posts and all the 12 panchayat union chairman posts in the district on Saturday. The elections took place in a peaceful manner.

The state had in December last year held polls to elect district panchayat ward councillors, panchayat union ward councillors, village panchayat chairmen and village panchayat ward councillors. On Saturday, it was their turn to choose the district panchayat chairman and vice-chairman, panchayat union chairman and vice-chairman, and village panchayat vice-presidents.

The district has 17 posts of district panchayat councillors. While the AIADMK won 10 posts, the BJP won two and the DMK, five. Since the AIADMK and its alliance had a majority, no one from other political parties filed nomination for the post of district panchayat chairman. So, A Santhimathi was elected unopposed.

The election to the post of district panchayat vice-chairman was held at the district collectorate. The ruling party’s Amul Kandasamy won the election. The AIADMK grabbed all the 12 posts of panchayat union chairmen in the district. While the party won unopposed in Karamadai, Annur, Periyanaickenpalayam, Thondamuthur, Madukkarai, Pollachi (North) and Kinathukedavu, they won the remaining posts through indirect election.

While six panchayat union chairman posts were reserved for the women in the district, in an interesting turn of events, nine of the 12 posts were won by women.

The AIADMK also won six panchayat union vice-chairman posts, while the DMK managed only three posts - in Annur, Madukkarai and Pollachi (south). Independent candidates won in Annaimalai, Sulur and Sulthanpet, unopposed.

Hundreds of participants marched from Arts Faculty to the University Plaza on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ABVP ) organised a students’ march at North Campus of Delhi University denouncing the “Left violence” and supporting Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ).

Starting from Arts Faculty around 1.30pm, hundreds of participants marched from Arts Faculty to the University Plaza, calling their opposition “gaddar” and shouting slogans like “Tera mera rishta kya? Jai Shree Ram Jai Shree Ram” and “Gaddaron ki ek dawai, joota, chappal aur sutai.”

Most people don’t understand what exactly CAA is and that there is no need to protest against it, a few of them told TOI. “There are so many people who don’t even know what exactly the Act is but just because everyone is out on the streets, they want to join the gang. When you ask them about the Act, they will not be able to answer one question straight. The one who does not belong here deserves no place in our country and there is no problem at all with CAA,” said Anu Garg, a DU student.

There were many others like her who alleged that the rally had been organised to spread a message that the protests had been a “Left” propaganda in the name of CAA and should stop immediately. “For the ones who refuse to understand that CAA is for the benefit of all, we know the ways to explain it to them,” said a participant amid slogans of “Long Live ABVP! Long Live CAA!”.

The march was led by a group of almost 100 women, who held banners reading “We are standing for CAA” and “First they will attack the party activists wearing masks, then they will break their own heads and then they will shout ABVP ABVP. #AapChronologySamajhiye.”

Kuldeep Singh, another student, said, “People have no clue about CAA yet they are trying to create a rift and discord in the city. We have to raise our voice today to tell everyone that there is a huge section of people who stand with CAA too.”

Representative image

PANAJI: The use of an elephant for a same-sex wedding procession in Goa has evoked strong reactions from equal rights and animal rights activists, who have lodged a complaint with the state chief wildlife warden to take immediate action in the matter.

Held at a seaside resort, the wedding ‘baaraat’ (procession) featured the couple, both men, seated upon the adorned elephant, making a grand entry into the venue.

“As a community which has suffered discrimination and suppression, we ought to be more sensitive. To use wild animals for entertainment, ceremonies or joyrides sends a very wrong message,” said Harish Iyer, an equal rights activist from the LGBTQ community.

He said it also set a wrong precedent for others. “I would’ve been equally upset if a heterosexual couple had used it for their wedding,” he said.

The high-profile wedding was attended by actor Katrina Kaif, sources said.

Hiring and renting out of elephants for commercial activities is prohibited, as these animals are a schedule-1 protected species under the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002.

In a letter addressed to the Goa forest department’s chief wildlife warden, Santosh Kumar, president of people for animals (PFA), Goa, Norma Alvares called for an investigation into the travel permit for the elephant and its use for the procession. “Our very brief inquiries with the resort staff have revealed that the elephant was arranged for by a wedding planner. She was transported to the highway in a vehicle, and then marched on foot to the wedding venue, uphill to Dona Paula, on a tarred road,” she wrote.

Alvares said the elephant was from a spice farm in Goa and demanded that the forest department take action against the “errant parties” for allowing the animal to be used for the procession.

“This instance confirms that elephants are continuously being used for performances in Goa, and we are now left with no other recourse than to approach the high court-seeking appropriate orders for the protection and welfare of these elephants,” she said in her complaint.

Santosh Kumar told TOI the matter has been referred to the North Goa deputy conservator of forests (DCF).

“If it is a case of cruelty against animals, then the department of veterinary services and animal husbandry will take action. If the elephant is illegally brought and used, then we will take action. We have to inquire and investigate the matter,” Kumar said.

There are 10 captive elephants in Goa’s spice farms, one of which was recently ‘borrowed’ by an Ayyappa temple to carry out a religious ceremony, wherein the elephant was worshipped, DCF Kuldeep Sharma said. The temple was granted the permit on the condition that the jumbo would not be used for entertainment or commercial activities.

“In the case of this wedding, no permission request has come to us,” Sharma said. “We would need to check if the elephant is one of the 10 from the spice farms in Goa. If it is, then they would have had to take permission for the transportation of the elephant from one place to another,” he said.

The resort’s sales manager said they have a strict no pets/animals policy and had no say in the matter, since the procession took place outside the main venue.

“The procession started outside the hotel and culminated in the parking lot. We didn’t know about the elephant until we saw it in the hotel’s parking lot, ” the resort manager told TOI.

“It is completely outrageous and illegal.... The couple has made a mistake without even thinking about it,” said a representative of the Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations.

To display captive elephants at wedding processions is retrogressive and illegal, he said.

COIMBATORE: A 31-year-old woman , who had lost a bag containing gold jewellery worth Rs 2.43 lakh on Friday night, heaved a sigh of relief after learning that an auto driver, who had found it , had handed it over to police.

Police commissioner Sumit Sharan on Saturday felicitated K Gopu of Maruthukutty Street at KK Pudur in Saibaba Colony for helping to return the 39 sovereigns to its owner K Gayathri of Trichy Road.

Gayathri, who works for the Oriental Insurance Company, was on the way to her home along with her mother from a jewellery shop at Gandhipuram around 9.40pm, when she lost the gold she had just bought. The jewellery, kept in a bag on her scooter, fell off mid-ride. After reaching home, she realized that the bag was missing and launched a frantic search. She went back through the same route, scanning the road for the bag.

Luckily, Gopu, who was heading towards Lakshmi Mills on his auto, found the bag near the Red Cross building junction. “I opened the bag to find gold jewellery and purchase invoice. It had the phone number of the buyer,” Gopu told TOI. “I first informed police about the bag. Then I called Gayathri and told her to collect it from the police station.”

Gayathri’s parents Kesavan and Devika collected the bag from the police commissionerate on Saturday. “My daughter had bought the jewellery using her savings and was depressed after losing it. We thank Gopu for finding it and returning it to us,” said Kesavan.

Gopu is working as driver for the managing director of Rajanarayan Textiles Ltd at Race Course. He has attached his autorickshaw with Ola Cabs and operates it from 5pm to 12am every day.

Hyderabad: Doctors at Apollo Hospitals had a rare case on their hand when a 67-year-old patient with liver cirrhosis and liver cancer was admitted. It was revealed that the patient also had a severe coronary disease with arteries to the heart clogged with critical blocks.

Experts who were part of the case said that the patient’s heart disease was significant enough to preclude a liver transplant procedure. The two procedures, spanning 14 hours, were performed by doctors in one setting. During the evaluation for the liver transplant, it was found that stenting was not an option for the patient as following the procedure, the liver transplant could not be carried out for another 8 to 12 weeks. During the time, the patient’s cancer would have spread.

“Almost 90% of his heart was at risk, it seemed impossible to do a liver transplant on him given the state of the heart,” said Dr Manoj Agarwala, senior consultant cardiologist, Apollo Hospitals who was part of the multidisciplinary team from Apollo hospitals that carried out the surgeries. “Since the tumour was spreading fast, we had no option but to perform both liver transplant and coronary artery bypass one after another in one sitting. If his heart condition was not assessed properly, we could have lost the patient,” he added.

The patient Siva Prasad Rao’s 33-year-old daughter had come forward to donate a part of her liver for the procedure. “When I heard of all the complications I was suffering from, I just gave up hope. But it was my daughter who went about doing everything from getting herself prepared for the donation to preparing me,” Rao said.

Ahmedabad: Gujarat may be a dry state, but the government figures reveal that deaths due to ‘driving under influence of alcohol’ got increased 12 times – from 10 in 2017 to 122 in 2018 – in Gujarat.

The figures in the latest ‘Accidental Deaths & Suicides in India 2018’ report by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) also mentioned that the registered cases of drunken driving rose six times – from 51 in 2017 to 300 in 2018. Number of those injured in the cases rose four times from 67 to 296, mentioned the report. India is observing Road Safety Week from January 11 to 17 this year.

Majority of these cases were registered outside of four cities – as Ahmedabad recorded two and Surat one of the deaths due to drunken driving in 2018.

The report attributed 1195 deaths in 2018 to ‘Dangerous or careless driving, overtaking, etc.’ in 2620 reported cases. The figures were 1082 and 2469 in 2017 respectively, recording rise of 10.4% in deaths. Among the cities, Ahmedabad recorded 78 deaths due to dangerous driving followed by Surat (44) and Vadodara (2).

The figures show that Gujarat lost 22 lives daily in road accidents. Ahmedabad and Surat recorded rise in overall RTAs whereas Vadodara and Rajkot reported dip.

Amit Khatri, a city-based road safety expert, said that increase in fatalities in lower number of incidents could be attributed to more than one deaths in incidents. “We need to focus more on public transport vehicles to reduce these fatalities,” he said. “Analysis of the fatal accidents is also required for better road safety – out of 8,040 incidents, 5,972 are attributed to over-speeding.”

23.6% fatal accidents where the driver allegedly at fault lost life. In absolute numbers, it was 1,899

54% rise in fatalities of bicycle riders — from 70 in 2017 to 108 in 2018. Pedestrians were also at higher peril with 57 more deaths — from 610 to 667 — in 2018

6,540 deaths recorded in four summer months (March-June), or 1,635 monthly average, the highest among four seasons

3pm to 9pm the deadliest time for Gujarat as 34.7% of the accidents were recorded during this period across state

179 deaths were attributed to weather condition, whereas 79 were fatal accidents where the riders died after hitting an animal

66 lost their lives apparently due to physical fatigue while driving. In 149 cases, mechanical fault was found to be the cause of accident

247,['12/01/2020'],Plans afoot to convert 27 constituent colleges into govt-run institutions,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Coimbatore: After converting 14 constituent colleges of state universities into government colleges, the directorate of collegiate education is getting ready to implement the second phase that will cover the remaining 27 colleges.

The 14 colleges were converted into government colleges this academic year as per the policy announcement of the state government. The plan was to convert the remaining colleges in a phased manner.

Now, the directorate has sought details of the 27 colleges from university registrars and regional directors of collegiate education. It has sought details such as the budget statement of the current year, courses offered, workload (hours) of the departments and the details of regular and temporary teaching and non-teaching staff.

The state government will decide to convert the colleges based on the financial position, director of collegiate education C Jothi Venkateswaran told TOI.

Of the remaining university constituent colleges, three each are under Bharathiar University and Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, six each under Periyar University and Madurai Kamaraj University, two each under University of Madras and Alagappa University, and four under Bharatidasan University, among others.

According to academicians, the conversion will help rural students as the college fee would become very nominal.

Some government college teachers said that principals have not been appointed for many colleges that were converted into government colleges. “There is also no clarity on whether teachers will be transferred from government colleges to the newly converted colleges. Just because the fee structure is as per a government college, it doesn’t become one. Principals and teachers should be appointed soon,” said a teacher.

A man makes manjha in the city ahead of Makar Sankranti

JAIPUR: Crackdown on Chinese manjha by the police has been going on as Makar Sankranti is coming closer.

Chinese manjha during the kite festival has been a cause of death for many people making it necessary for the administration to avoid its usage in the city.

In December 2019, a four-year-old boy lost his life due to Chinese manjha. He was seated in the front of a bike being driven by his father when the manjha cuts his neck. He was rushed to SMS Hospital but succumbed to injuries in less than an hour. There have been numerous such incidences occurred due to the Chinese manjha. Since then, police said they have been raising awareness among the traders and people against the usage of this manjha.

Jitendra Singh, SHO at Manak Chowk police station said that they have called up all the kite traders’ unions of the city and made them submit an affidavit that they won’t sell Chinese manjha.

“Traders have agreed to hang banners in the market and on shops against the usage of the Chinese manjha. We are going to different schools spreading awareness among them to not to use Chinese manjha and asking their parents not to buy it as well. Around 2 lakh pamphlets have already been distributed among the public and a video to avoid Chinese manjha is being shared on the social media,” said Jitendra.

He told TOI that around 10 days back they have arrested a person selling Chinese manjha in the city and have registered a FIR against him.

Chinese manjha is not manufactured in the city but is being imported from states like Punjab and New Delhi. It is made of plastic and fibre and it smells like plastic burn if put on fire.

To make it more deadly, manjha is being coated with crushed glass or powdered metal that can conduct electricity.

Due to their long stay and ability to cut other kite strings easily it has been preferred by the people. There are people who are trying to sell it illegally in the market.

In the prominent kite markets in Handipura and Haldiyon ka Rasta in Jaipur banners can be seen hanging everywhere by the trader unions that Chinese manjha is not being sold in the market.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: With the non-performing assets ( NPAs ) and write-offs reaching an all-time high, bankers have sought government intervention and necessary action to recover the outstanding dues from the borrowers.

As per the data obtained from the official websites of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) as well from the answers to the questions raised in the Lok Sabha, a total of Rs 6,94,037 crore have been written off between 2001 and 2019, of which Rs 5,48,734 have been written off in five years between 2014 and 2019.

Citing these figures, prominent banking activists have demanded that defaulting return of loans should be treated as an offence under the IPC & defaulters should be disqualified from contesting elections.

Joint secretary of the All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA), Devidas Tuljapurkar, told TOI, “The data is appalling. It is the big corporates who are looting the banks of crores of rupees.”

“The most pertinent question is where has all this money gone? Who is accountable for this loot? In the efforts taken for recovering the overdues, it is the bankers who have to sacrifice. A lot is being spoken about the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Act. In the first 23 cases referred for resolution under the Act, bankers were required to sacrifice 51% of the principal amount on the loans. In the cases of liquidation, bankers were required to give up as high as 95%.”

Tuljapurkar, who is also the general secretary of Maharashtra State Bank employees Federation and former director of Bank of Maharashtra , has been on the forefront for raising voice against the write-offs given to the corporate houses. He said, “Strong recovery laws should be formed. If the government fails to overcome this crisis, it is plunging the Indian banking & economy into a deep crisis.”

Terming the write-offs to be inexplicable, he said that in order to compensate for the losses, the government was required to infuse capital by making provisions from the budget, which again came from the taxes collected from the common man.

Tuljapurkar further said that due to this practice, banks were levying charges on customers for various services to compensate for the losses due to the menace created by the corporator houses of taking hefty loans but defaulting the payment of the dues.

Members of the bank union unanimously said banks have reduced interest on savings bank deposits to reduce the losses, for which it was again the common man bearing the brunt. Successive governments have been speaking against defaulters but have failed to take any stringent action.

G Vinod Kumar (centre) Vinod had joined TRS but later switched to BSP

HYDERABAD: Former minister and ex-president of Hyderabad Cricket Association G Vinod on Saturday rejoined Congress after hobnobbing with other parties in the last four years. Vinod had quit Congress in 2016 and joined TRS . Later, he jumped into BSP and unsuccessfully contested the Bellampally assembly seat on a BSP ticket in December 2018 polls.

Speaking to STOI, Vinod said he had decided to come back to his parent party with the intention of taking forward the legacy of his late father G Venkatswamy and work for uplift of the poor and down-trodden. “My younger brother G Vivek is in BJP, but I came back into Congress. I always believed and followed the secular principles, which is the benchmark of Congress party,” he said.

Vinod is working in Bellampally and Chennur assembly constituencies in erstwhile Adilabad district and aspires to contest from one of the twoe seats. “It is for the AICC high command to decide the seat from where I should contest,” he said.

Vinod has served as a minister in 2004 and 2009. Both Vinod and Vivek are the sons of Congress veteran Venkatswamy, who was a member of the Congress Working Committee, a minister in Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and PV Narasimha Rao’s cabinets and also served as the state Congress president.

Meanwhile, TPCC president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said: “Vinod rejoining Congress exposes the fact that TRS and BJP have lost trust of people in Telangana.” Vinod joined the party in the presence of AICC general secretary in charge of Telangana RC Khuntia in Delhi. Vinod has also served for three terms as president of HCA and three terms as vice-president.

VIJAYAWADA: At a meeting with Jana Sena cadre at the party state office in Mangalagiri on Saturday, party chief Pawan Kalyan said youth and senior leaders in the Jana Sena would be given priority in elections to local bodies.

Kalyan announced that youth who had served the party over the years would be fielded as candidates and 50 per cent of seats would be given to them.

Kalyan called on party leaders to take on caste and factional battles in the local body elections. “We need to work hard to achieve long-term goals. It is the responsibility of the district leadership to identify the youth who served the party with selflessness,” Kalyan said.

On the three capital cities proposal, Kalyan said, “I had apprehensions in 2015 when the previous Telugu Desam Party-led government had undertaken a process of large-scale land acquisition. I had asked then what the fate of farmers in the region would be if the next government did not continue with plans for the capital city as it may take at least two-and-a-half decades to build the capital.

The three-time MLA’s bodyguard constable Dnyaneshwar Nikas and driver Panjab Guddhe were also injured but are ... Read More

AURANGABAD/NAGPUR: Sanjay Raimulkar, Shiv Sena MLA from Mehkar in Buldhana, who was injured in an accident on Friday night, is now stable and will be discharged in a couple of days, hospital authorities in Aurangabad said.

The three-time MLA’s bodyguard constable Dnyaneshwar Nikas and driver Panjab Guddhe were also injured but are out of danger.

The MLA from Mehkar in Buldhana district was on his way from Janephal to Mehkar after attending a programme on Friday evening. At around 9pm, when they were on the Shegaon-Pandharpur Palkhi Marg, a light pick-up van coming from the opposite direction rammed into his SUV. The collision caused both vehicles to turn turtle.

All three injured were initially taken to a multi-speciality hospital in Mehkar for treatment but later referred to the Mahatma Gandhi Mission (MGM) medical college and hospital in Aurangabad.

Pravin Suryawanshi, the medical college deputy dean, said the MLA had sustained rib injuries, but his condition is stable now. “No surgical procedure is required for his treatment. Raimulkar will be discharged in a day or two. Two others admitted with him are also being treated for their rib injuries. All are doing okay,” Suryawanshi said.

Raimulkar, 55, was elected for the third consecutive time from Mehkar constituency in the assembly elections last year. The legislator’s family and relatives arrived in Aurangabad and are at the hospital with him. Several Sena workers had also gathered to check on him at the hospital in Aurangabad.

The police said that Raimulkar was heading to Mehkar after attending a programme at Dattapur. The driver of the pick-up van, Ganesh Raut, has been arrested.

Assistant police inspector Dilip Masram from Janephal police station said Raut drove the car at top speed on the cemented road. “Raut was under the impression that there would not be much traffic on the road. He was taken into custody shortly after the accident,” said Masram.

Raimulkar was helped by a poultry-farm owner, identified as Shivaji Chavan, near whose residence the accident took place. He rushed out of the farm to offer help to Raimulkar and the two others who were trapped in the heavily damaged vehicle. Chavan later stopped a passing car on the road, before seeking help for Raimulkar and two others.

JAIPUR: The 32-year-old Korean national who was arrested by the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), was sent to jail by a court dealing with economic offences on Saturday after he was produced in the court. He was arrested by the DRI with an illegal possession of 4.5kg gold on Friday.

The accused, identified as Lee Tai Jun, has not been cooperating with the officials of the DRI and communicating with him has been a major problem for the officials.

“The primary investigation suggested that the gold was brought from Bangkok to Ahmedabad in an international flight by another passenger. Knowing that the same aircraft would be used as domestic flight to Jaipur from Ahmedabad, the accused Lee was made to travel in this flight and he took the possession of gold in the aircraft,” said a senior officer of DRI, Jaipur.

Officials further stated that the modus operandi where gold was concealed in the aircraft itself, is been unearthed for the first time by the airport authorities.

Coimbatore: The forest department is planning to form human-elephant conflict resolution committees with villagers as members, additional principal chief conservator of forests Debasis Jana said here on Friday.

“We believe that the committee will help to resolve the conflict,” he said while speaking at an interactive session with NGOs, forest department officials and media held here.

As many as 12 people were killed by wild elephants in the Coimbatore forest division since April 2019, Jana said. “Thirty-two people had lost their lives in wild elephant attacks between 2017 and 2019.”

Two people were killed by elephants in the Nilgrirs forest division since April 2019. “Five were killed in the Gudalur forest division during 2017-18 and 10 during 2018 -19. But only three deaths were reported since April 2019,” the official said.

The department is taking steps to ensure availability of fodder and water inside the reserve forest for wild animals, Jana said. “Such efforts will check entry of wild elephant into human habitations,” he said. “The department has only 65% of the sanctioned field staff. They are working round-the-clock to prevent man-animal conflict.”

The department is also creating awareness on man-animal conflict, the official said. “We have advised people staying in forest fringes not to venture out at night to attend nature’s call. We are working to reduce the response time to reach human-elephant conflict areas.”

AURANGABAD: Theatre personality and former head of the department of Dramatics at the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University (Bamu), Shashikant Barhanpurkar passed away after a brief illness on Saturday morning. He was 65.

Bamu VC Pramod Yeole and others paid tributes to the late artist for his contribution in the field of drama and academia.

“Barhanpurkar was one of the stalwarts who have been credited for taking the department of dramatics at the university to new heights. During his tenure at the university for nearly three-and-a-half decades, he brought many laurels for the department and shaped lives of many students,” he said.

Bamu has organised a condolence meet to pay tributes tohim at 3pm on Sunday. Barhanpurkar, who hailed from Barhanpur village in Beed district , completed his graduation from Ambejogai.

Rescued birds being treated

JAIPUR: Animal rights activists are busy rescuing birds which got injured due to deadly kite strings in the city ahead of Makar Sankranti . The activists have launched a campaign ‘ Save the Birds ’ by highlighting the adverse effects of flying kites with manjha strings. Dr Vikas Sharma, a government veterinarian, says the number of injured birds — pigeons, peacocks and mynahs — being brought to the hospital at Panch Batti has increased manifold in the last two days.

“The injury marks on birds are so grave that it is easy to make out that they were hit by the banned glass-coated strings. By the time, most of the injured birds are brought to the hospital, they either lose excessive blood or die of exhaustion,” said Sharma.

He treated 11 birds on Saturday. Most of the injured birds have come the Walled City area. The government veterinary doctors have appealed to citizens to avoid flying kites during morning and before the sunrise as this is the time birds leave their nest and heads back respectively. Sahil Singhal of People for Animal has urged the civil society members to be prepared to volunteer saving injured birds. “The handful of helpline numbers fall short of the number of demand. As the city area is increasing, the number of calls is coming on the limited helpline numbers from far-off areas. I request volunteers to share their numbers location wise and ferry the injured bird at the makeshift hospitals,” said Singhal.

RAKSHA, an NGO working for birds has formed a makeshift hospital at the Ramniwas Garden equipped with modern medical equipment like portable ICU, Oxygen masks and operation theatres.

“I urge civil society members to bring the injured bird at our makeshift hospital. They can call on our helpline number 24/7 till January 16,” said Rohit Gangwal of RAKSHA. The body is also providing training to volunteers on how to lift the injured birds and handle it properly. Gangwal raised alarm that this is peak season for migratory birds who look for winter destination here. If the use of Chinses manjha continues, the casualty of birds will also increase including the exotic species.

Hyderabad: AIMIM president and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi said they would organise a human chain in the city on January 30, the day Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by Nathuram Godse. “On January 30, we will form a human chain from Mohammadi Lines to Bapu Ghat at 11am,” Owaisi said while addressing the Tiranga rally at Shastripuram on Friday. He urged people to turn out in large numbers to support their cause.

Owaisi said the Tiranga rally was a message to Prime Minster Narendra Modi. “We want to send a strong message to the Prime Minster of India through this rally. People of Hyderabad and Telangana have rejected CAA,” he said, drawing loud cheers from the crowds.

“Are you against CAA? Are you against NRC? Are you against NPR? Do you want India to remain secular? Do you want to preserve the Constitution of India drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar?” Owaisi kept hollering to the delight of the crowd. And the crowds kept waving flags and replying a loud “yes”.

Owaisi urged the crowds to not produce any documents to the authorities to prove their identity. “If someone asks you for an Aadhaar card, will you show it,” he sought to know from the crowd, who said they won’t. Showering praises on women, the AIMIM chief said: “So many sisters have come here. This is women empowerment.” He also thanked the police and GHMC officials for the arrangements at the venue. He later interacted with the participants at the rally.

Leaders said a flag-hoisting programme would be held at Charminar on January 25 midnight to herald the Republic Day.

268,['12/01/2020'],Bihar cabinet okays SC-mandated witness protection scheme,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Bihar is all set to get its own witness protection programme as mandated by the Supreme Court in 2018.

The state cabinet on Saturday approved the home department’s proposal to ensure fool-proof security to witnesses appearing in trial courts to record their statement, especially in criminal cases.

The state cabinet chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar approved the ‘Bihar Gawah Suraksha Yojna’, which assumes significance in the wake of killing of about half a dozen witnesses and murderous attack on a number of others across the state over the past several years.

In 2019 alone, at least six incidents of witnesses being killed were reported from Vaishali, Sitamarhi, Siwan, Purnia and Begusarai districts.

“The Bihar witness protection scheme will help quick disposal of the criminal cases in courts due to timely appearance of witnesses and also without any fear from the accused,” cabinet secretariat additional chief secretary Amir Subhani said.

“There will be a district-level committee to assess the security threat to a witness. In addition, there will be a separate fund to deal with the issues pertaining to witnesses’ security,” Subhani added.

Under the scheme, the government will ensure installation of CCTVs, security alarm door bells at the houses of the witnesses to recommendation of names of police officers to be contacted in cases of emergency among other measures. There will also be a provision for giving a particular ‘code’ to witnesses in order to protect their identity.

The government will devise a mechanism so that the accused and the witnesses don’t come across each other during trial in respective courts. Telephone or mobile numbers of witnesses could also be changed to avoid threat calls. “There will be police escort for the witnesses to bring them to trial court from their homes and vice versa,” Shubahni revealed.

He said the main objective behind such a scheme is to make witnesses feel protected. There have been instances where witnesses turned hostile in court during trial and the accused got acquitted for lack of evidence.

Records available at the police headquarters revealed that altogether six witnesses were killed in the state in 2019. While Shyam Babu, who was a witness in former RJD MP Md. Shahabauddin’s nephew Yusuf’s murder case, was gunned down in Siwan on May 15, two witnesses—Chanchal Singh and Raushan Singh were killed at Madhurapur under Bidupur police station in Vaishali district on August 1 last year.

In addition, Md Shamim, who was a witness in a murder case, was murdered at Dhewla village in Purnia district on August 27, 2019. While Sunal Singh along with his wife Kanchan Devi and minor daughter Sonam were killed in Begusarai on October 28, two others—Ejas Khan and Salman Khan, were gunned down while going to the sub-divisional court in Sitamarhi on August 27 last year.

Kamal Kishore Mishra, who was a witness in BJP state vice-president Visheshwar Ojha's murder case, was shot dead by criminals at Sonbarsa in Bhojpur on September 28, 2018. Ojha was killed in February 2016 while returning to Patna from Bhojpur after attending a meeting.

AMRAVATI: Justice Pradeep Nandrajog, chief justice of Bombay High Court on Saturday expressed concern over the falling graph of dispute resolution through mediation and urged the gathering of judges at the regional conference on mediation to ""evolve something"" that would take the movement forward.

He was delivering the inaugural address at the one-day conference on Capacity Building and Evaluation of Mediation Activities at a hotel on Saturday.

Justice SC Dharmadhikari, Justice RK Deshpande, Justice ZA Haq and Justice SB Shukre were on the dais. “The GDP of dispute resolution through mediation is decreasing. This graph needs to be taken up,” said the chief justice.“If you look at claims and counter claims being made at the mediation table, you will find scope for giving something to both parties,” he said.

Urging judges to sport smiles on their faces while mediating, justice Nandrajog said, “A grim face sends a chill down the parties’ spine.”

Stating that courts, statutory tribunals, private tribunals (arbitrators), conciliation and mediation form the five horses that pull the chariot of justice, the chief justice said that mediation was one of the five horses that pulls the chariot of dispute resolution. “But it’s not pulling it well. The graph is going down. The space is shrinking. Through this conference, we need to reflect and find solutions to problems,” he said.

Stating that in the post-World War II period, the traditional panchayat system catered to dispute resolution, the chief justice said that due to disintegration of communities, we lost it all.

Stating that mediation is a recognized science now, Nandrajog said that a mediator should be like a lady of the house who handles every situation with empathy. “Empathize and sympathize with the cause, not with the parties,” he said.

“The mediator makes the parties enter a state of heteronomy in order to come up with a solution where both parties gain something,” he said.

“Since the judicial process is expensive, time-consuming and court adjudicatory process complex, the role of the judges should be to navigate the society through channels of the law,” said the chief justice.

Pointing out the paradox in the mediation theory that stunts growth of the mediation process, the chief justice said redefining the law of self-determination and documenting the experience of meditation is the only way forward.

Earlier, justice Shrikant Kulkarni delivered the welcome remarks on the occasion.

The conference, attended by around 550 judges and trained lawyers from 11 districts of Vidarbha along with HC justice PN Deshmukh, was jointly organized by the Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority, Maharashtra Legal Services Control Committee of Mumbai High Court and Amravati District Legal Services Authority.

Over the past two years, the AMC has been able to complete only one of the six major projects

AURANGABAD: Despite the release of funds, the city’s solid waste management mechanism has been very slow.

The steering committee, headed by divisional commissioner, has been missing and resetting deadlines for completion of projects for the past two years. In the recently held chief minister’s meeting, the committee sought another 90 days to complete the projects.

During Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s visit, projects being undertaken with government funds were discussed. In a meeting held at the divisional commissionerate on January 9, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey presented the report on the solid waste management project.

The state government has approved Rs 148 crore for solid waste management in Aurangabad. Units with the capacity to process 150 tonne of waste per day at Chikalthana, Padegaon and Harsul; a biogas plant with a capacity to process 30 tonne of green waste per day at Kanchanwadi; weighbridges at all sites; bio-mining of Naregaon legacy dump site; and sanitary landfill for inert waste at Padegaon are included in the Rs 148-crore project.

Over the past two years, the AMC has been able to complete only one of the six major projects. As the head of the steering committee formed to monitor the implementation of solid waste management project in Aurangabad, divisional commissioner Sunil Kendrekar said that all projects will be completed within the next 90 days. Pandey said that out of 400 tonne of waste generated daily, 150 tonne is being processed at Chikalthana and Padegaon. The units at Harsul and Kanchanwadi will be functional soon, he added.

Interestingly, this is not the first time a deadline has been given by him. On March 1, 2019, Kendrekar had told the High Court that he will see to it that the all four waste processing sites in the city become operational within the next six months. The AMC had previously missed the deadlines set by Maharashtra chief secretary.

NEW DELHI: The Congress Working Committee on Saturday accused the BJP government of unleashing the “entire might of brute state power” to suppress the voice of youth and students , in a strong rebuke to police action on university protests over issues ranging from fee hike to CAA-NRC.

At the same time, Congress rejected Delhi Police’s investigations on the armed attack on JNU students and faculty, saying police was a “guilty party” in the violence and could not be trusted to do a fair probe.

“The vice-chancellor of JNU and Delhi Police commissioner should be sacked. The attack should be investigated by an independent judicial inquiry about the role of the Union home minister in latently instigating this violence. The buck actually stops at the door of home minister Amit Shah,” AICC leaders Anand Sharma and Randeep Surjewala said after the CWC meeting.

The youth-civil society protests and police crackdown on universities and states dominated the two-hour deliberations of the apex Congress body that met under the leadership of party chief Sonia Gandhi at the AICC headquarters and was attended by former PM Manmohan Singh and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, among others. Rahul Gandhi was absent from the meeting as he was said to be “travelling”.

Throwing its weight behind the protesting youth, CWC passed a resolution saying “the Prime Minister and BJP government have betrayed the trust of the youth”.

CWC noted that spontaneous protests have erupted across campuses over “a concerted attack on the Constitution, rampant unemployment, commercialisation of education, unprecedented fee hikes and autocratic refusal to listen to voice and concerns of students”. It said every institution from Delhi University, JNU, Jamia Millia Islamia to Benares Hindu University, Allahabad University, AMU and others have witnessed protests.

It said instead of listening to the students, BJP government has unleashed “police lathi-charge, teargas shells, forcible arrests, FIRs and planned attacks on the protesting youth”.

NASHIK: The special squad of the city police raided an illegal refill centre at Adgaon on Friday and arrested six besides seizing four vehicles and 40 gas cylinders.

Three suspects escaped from the scene during the raid and a hunt has been launched for them, said police on Saturday.

Acting on a tip-off, the special squad, along with crime branch unit 2, raided the place and found people filling domestic gas into vehicles with the help of a motor.

Senior police officers said two cars and the same number of autorickshaws, which were waiting to fill gas, were confiscated.

Police estimated the value of the seized items — four vehicles, 40 gas cylinders and cash — at Rs 6.51 lakh.

The accused have been booked under sections of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Regulation of Supply and Distribution) Order 2000, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Regulation of Use in Motor Vehicles) Order 2001 and sections of the Essential Commodities Act.

Police have conducted raids on a large number of such illegal gas centres across the city over the past couple of months.

Police have appealed to citizens to contact the police control room at 0253- 2305233 and 2305234 and inform about any illegal activity in their area. The name of the informer will not be disclosed to anyone.

A large number of illegal activities could be occurring in different parts of the city, but citizens may not be informing police out of fear, following which police have decided to not disclose the names of informers.

Police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil has said that strict action will be taken against the in-charge of any police station under whose jurisdiction illegal activities are found to be flourishing.

“The action against a police station will be taken on the basis of calls the police control gets from people and not action is taken,” the police chief has said.

Author Arundhati Roy at Jamia Millia Islamia against CAA and NRC on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: From serving tea in cups labelled as ‘secular chai’ to painting the walls of the university with images of Shaheed Bhagat Singh , the protest at the Jamia University saw a plethora of activities on Sunday.

As the protest entered its 28th day, women and children were seen at the forefront. As many of them engaged in a range of activities on the “protest street,” the students and locals with reflector jackets could be seen diverting the traffic to ensure that the commuters did not face any inconvenience.

Author and activist Arundhati Roy reached the protest site on Saturday to express solidarity with the students. She later donated a few books to the open library, which was put up on the pavement by protesting students.

Mohammad Ali Jauhar Marg, which leads to the university, has been partially shut ever since the protest began. The carriageway outside the Holy Family hospital has been closed while the opposite carriageway is used for to and fro traffic with a rope being used as a divider.

While addressing the protesters, Arundhati Roy said: “A day will come when the government will be in detention centres and we will be azad.” Slogans of inquilab zindabad, JNU zindabad and Jamia zindabad followed.

Six students in front of the stage were on a hunger strike. They were sitting quietly with a board nearby reading: “Day 11, Satyagrah.”

Rehana, a student who is a part of the hunger strike, said: “We want the ‘black law’ to be rolled back. The movement is not about Hindus or Muslims, but to save the Constitution.”

Munawwar Majrooh, who was also a part of the hunger strike, said: “We are following the non-violent path of Mahatma Gandhi. We want the government to take back their decisions on CAA, NPR and NRC.”

Samiti members told the collector that even those who were not in the country at the time of rally have been named in the FIRs. Speaking to TOI, Samiti members accused the Parbhani police of excesses.

Taking cognizance of the representation, the collector has asked superintendent of police Krishnakant Upadhyay “for the action being initiated post December 20 incident, against those participated in the agitation, no action should be initiated against anyone sans proof”.

On December 20, Parbhani residents on had taken out a mega agitation against the CAA as well as the National Register of Citizenship (NRC). The rally reached Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Statue in the town. The police had refused to officially grant permission for the rally.

As per the FIR, the protest march reached the Shivaji statue via Chhatrapati Shivaji Park , Gandhi Park and Visawa corner. A group from among the protesters then headed towards the railway station road and blocked it while shouting slogans. Some of them turned violent and abusive, the FIR stated. It was after the police used force, the suspects started pelting stones at the cops, houses and vehicles there, it added.

In contrast, the local residents claimed that the majority of the protesters had returned home by that time. Only a group of about 100 people had blocked the railway station road and had refused to move.

To prevent them from blocking the road, police batoned them, following which the suspects ran for a few metres before they started pelting stones, giving a violent turn to the agitation that had already ended.

Parbhani police registered five offences for rioting, arson and unlawful assembly against 10,000 to 12,000 unidentified people along with about 50 identified people were booked in each of the two offences.

So far, the Parbhani police have arrested about 60 suspects. Some of the suspects have been released on conditional bail. The police started facing the heat after residents from different walks of life started raising question over police’s intention of booking thousands of people in the cases.

LUCKNOW: The curse of driving in circles in search of a parking spot is over. A smart phone application, launched on Saturday, will now guide you to the nearest parking lot managed by either Lucknow Municipal Corporation (LMC) or Lucknow Development Authority (LDA).Farid Zaidi, the general manager of Smart City project under which the mobile app functions, said Lucknow was the third city in India after Bengaluru and Pune to offer the facility to vehicle owners.According to Zaidi, the ‘Lucknow 311 Smart City’ app has been made available on both Android and iOS platforms since September last year. Managed by the Smart City command and control centre, it was meant to provide all civic amenities in one application. “So far, it offered only cleanliness and sanitation services. Now, the app will provide real-time information about parking lots,” he said. Explaining how the GPS-enabled app option would work, Zaidi said as soon as a person hit a dedicated tab, information about the nearest parking lot would appear on the phone screen. “It will also say if there’s space available at this lot.”For instance, if a motorist near Sikandar Bagh intersection uses the parking option, the app will automatically guide him/her to Shahjanaf Road. If the parking lot there is full, the app will show the status of the second nearest parking lot and so on.",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209701,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-88002,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/now-find-a-parking-slot-through-smart-city-app/articleshow/73209293.cms

Hyderabad: Justice T Vinod Kumar of the Telangana high court had directed DGP M Mahender Reddy to get the Tiranga Rally , held on Friday to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, videographed.

The rally was organised by AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi under the United Muslims Action Committee banner and it was accorded police permission with certain conditions. It was allowed to be held from Eidgah Mir Alam to Shastripuram.

Petitioner B Nanda Raj had expressed apprehensions that such meetings and rallies may turn violent and hence should not be permitted. However, after learning that permission has been granted for the meeting, the judge added an additional condition that police should videograph the rally and punish those who disrupt law and order.

Reasonable restrictions have already been put in place by the police. The person who applied and obtained permission for the rally should be held responsible if any untoward incidents take place and he should be prosecuted for the same, the judge said.

Hyderabad: Some TRS minority wing leaders on Friday came up with a strange suggestion on NPR and NRC. They said DNA of those people whose citizenship is questionable or shrouded in mystery should be tested. DNA can also be done on those who fail to provide relevant documents, they suggested.

Former Setwin chairman and TRS leader Ali Baqri said laws enacted by the Parliament cannot be questioned. “If someone has a problem with them, his or her DNA should be tested. By DNA test, it can be known if he or she is an Indian, a Chinese or belongs to some other country,” he said.

Slogans against chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao at Tiranga rally did not go down well with TRS leaders, who said it looked like MIM was inching towards Congress. “When CAA was being enacted, why did everyone, including (MIM chief Asaduddin) Owaisi keep quiet. Only after it was passed in the Parliament, they started raising their voice. How will they explain this? How can they blame KCR as TRS has already voted against CAA,” Baqri said.

A TRS Muslim leader on condition of anonymity said unlike the CM of a neighbouring state, KCR did not lie and kept telling that NPR is a process wherein states have no role at all. “AP CM said he will not allow NPR, but he supported CAA in the Parliament,” he said.

282,['12/01/2020'],Nagpur: Vertical parking on Nag river can ease WHC Road traffic: VNIT,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Around 600 cars and 2,500 two-wheelers are parked on roads connecting WHC Road during peak hours

NAGPUR: The Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) has suggested the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) to develop satellite parking space at some distance to ease traffic congestion on the stretch of West High Court (WHC) Road from Shankar Nagar Garden to Law College Square.

The institute has identified a part of Nag River and canal near Shankar Nagar Square and Times Square, respectively, for developing the parking space. The suggestion came after VNIT conducted a study on parking problems on the WHC Road stretch. “Norms don’t allow NMC to cover the river or any nullah, so we have suggested vertical parking can be developed without covering the river or nullah with concrete slabs,” head of the department (civil engineering) Dr V Landge told TOI.

The study was conducted after NMC chief engineer Ulhas Debadwar asked the institute to develop the WHC Road stretch which is one of city’s buzzing commercial districts.

Confirming this, Debadwar told TOI that with the Metro station coming up at Shankar Nagar, pedestrian movement is set to increase on the stretch. “So, we are also planning to widen the existing footpath to four metres,” he said adding that VNIT will make a presentation soon.

Guided by Landge, VNIT students Yashwant Manchewar and Vedant Uplenchwar calculated that in Shankar Nagar there are 10 shops per 100 metres. Visitors to the commercial establishments park their vehicles along the road, thus causing traffic problems.

Adding to the traffic woes are coaching institutes that have cropped up near Times Square. Many private vehicles and vans engaged for ferrying students are parked on the stretch, thus leaving little space for moving traffic. The problem is severe during the evening peak hours (5pm-9pm).

The VNIT study found glaring parking indiscipline. Four-wheelers were found occupying areas marked for two-wheelers while two-wheelers were parked in no parking zones and footpaths.

TOI has highlighted the issue on several occasions, prompting the Nagpur traffic police to implement parking restrictions on the stretch. The system didn’t yield desired results due to poor enforcement, said sources.

The VNIT also surveyed three other major streets connecting WHC Road. Around 600 cars and 2,500 two-wheelers are parked on roads including road connecting Shivaji Nagar to Khare Town, Gokulpeth Market-Ganesh Sagar Road and Ram Nagar-Laxmi Bhuvan Road during peak hours.

“From the parking demand survey, we calculated the space required for alternative parking area. We propose to provide approximately 7,500 square metres for the purpose,” said Landge.

Parking facilities will be provided at some distance, about 1-2 km away, from the commercial centre. “So, we have to provide connectivity between the parking space and people’s destination,” said Landge. One of the options is providing e-rickshaw facility. It battery operated three-wheeler can accommodate 4-6 people at once. The fare will be included in the cost of parking ticket, the study suggests.

The students have also prepared pedestrian-friendly footpath design. Due to hot weather in Nagpur and fewer trees on the stretch “we have suggested the NMC to develop cooling pockets including seating places at every 200 metres,” said Landge.

To a query, Landge said the NMC will require around Rs6 crore to execute the project and for creating dedicated lane for e-rickshaws. For developing vertical parking facility, the NMC can execute the project through build operate transfer (BoT) or public private partnership model, he said.

283,['12/01/2020'],‘Goa requires rehab centre for divyang’,"This story is from January 12, 2020

MARGAO: Leader of opposition Digambar Kamat on Sunday stressed the need for setting up a rehabilitation centre for specially-abled people (divyang) to enable them to lead secure and independent lives, even as he vowed to raise the issue in the House.

Speaking at an event organised by Lokvishwas Pratisthan, where special-needs children presented ‘Geet Ramayan’ at Margao , Kamat appreciated the efforts put in by the organisers to tutor the children, which he said was a feat in itself.

However, he said, while there exists several schools for divyang children, there’s acute need for adequate rehabilitation facilities for adults with special-needs.

“The government needs to be sensitive to the problems of the divyang. I am of the belief that a government which isn’t sensitive can’t do anything. The issue won’t be resolved by opening schools for the specially-abled,” Kamat said.

“If a therapist needs to be appointed in such a school, the requirement is that the student strength should be at least 50 . With lack of such facilities, students’ development is hampered. The need, therefore, is to strengthen existing schools by providing them with more facilities, appointing therapists, and more trained teachers,” Kamat said.

Kamat referred to a rehabilitation centre for divyang in Rajasthan that was recently featured on a television show, and urged the director of art and culture to visit the centre so the government could set up a similar complex in Goa.

“All should come together, with a view to protect specially-abled people from any atrocities,”Kamat added.

Madurai: The Kappalur toll plaza has become notorious for the hostile behaviour of its employees who frequently pick up quarrels with users and even beat them up occasionally. With the plaza witnessing law and order issues, local people have demanded that the district police verify the background of workers employed there and ensure that they wear identity cards.

At least three Ayyappa devotees from Chennai who were travelling on a van suffered injuries on Thursday when a group of toll plaza employees attacked them. Sakthi Sai, Kumaraguru and Madhesh suffered injuries and were treated in a hospital. Based on a complaint from S Baskar, 40, from Broadway in Chennai, a case was registered with the Thirumangalam Town police station.

Four people identified as N Pankaj, 20, from Bihar, S Tejbir Singh, 20, and K Rohit, 22, from Uttar Pradesh and V Vignesh, 26, from Maninagaram in Madurai city were arrested. Police sources said that the accused attacked them using a flag pole and helmet. According to the police, the van carrying 20 devotees wrongly entered FASTag lane. After being told by the toll gate employees that they would be charged twice, the van driver reversed the vehicle. An altercation ensued when the employees gently knocked on the vehicles asking them to make it fast. A quarrel erupted when the occupants of the van questioned it and in no time the employees gathered and started assaulting the devotees.

However, Shankar Raj, toll officer at the toll gate, said they acted only in self-defence as the Ayyappa devotees provoked them by attacking one of the employees. The devotees suffered injuries when they fell down accidentally during the altercation, he said. P K Vembuvendan, coordinator of the committee against Kappalur toll plaza, said that motorists being abused by the toll plaza staff is a regular affair irrespective of whether they are locals or outsiders. This is evident from the peace committee meetings periodically conducted by revenue officials to ensure law and order.

The plaza has been set up at Kappalur, which is within a 5km radius of Thirumangalam municipality, in violation of rules. “People from other states are being employed to threaten users. Police should intervene by checking the criminal antecedents of workers and ensure they wear ID cards. They go into hiding after every assault and the administration washes its hands off saying they were not employees,” Vembuvendan said.

NHAI project director, Madurai, V Saravanan said the issue was the result of the user entering FASTag despite being stopped by employees. A counter-complaint against the occupants of the van has been lodged with the police. “Users always have the mindset that they are being cheated. Things go out of control when the employees are being attacked. They had to retaliate in self-defence,” he told TOI.

AJMER: Chaos ensued at the inauguration of students’ union office of Samrat Prithviraj Chouhan Government College in Ajmer on Saturday, with students shouting slogans. The chief guest of the programme was state BJP president Satish Poonia , and when other BJP leaders like Ajmer MP Bhagirath Choudhary, Vasudev Devnani and Anita Bhadel too came on stage, it upset some of the students.

Congress leaders were allegedly blocked from entering the programme and there was ruckus for some time.

Meanwhile, Poonia said that those shouting slogans against India will not be tolerated. He condemned politics in campuses.

In Government College students’ union, the president is from ABVP and on other posts, students from NSUI had won. Thus, some students were upset and shouted slogans as only BJP state president was invited yet other BJP leaders came to participate as well. Vice-president, general secretary of NSUI protested at the event and said that only BJP state president was invited on stage but other BJP leaders also walked inside.

Later, Poonia requested the audiences to maintain calm, following which the programme was resumed.

NAGPUR: School education minister Varsha Gaikwad , the first woman to hold this charge after almost three decades in Maharashtra, said she considers teachers as equal partners and has already started the process to resolve issues related to salary and non-salary grants. Gaikwad has also decided to review the performance of former CM Devendra Fadnavis’ pet project ‘Pragat Shaikshanik Maharashtra’ (PSM) from which ""good"" things will be taken forward.

Speaking exclusively to TOI over various issues, Gaikwad said her priority is to raise the quality of education by not ""dictating"" policy to teachers but by taking them along in every decision. “I promise teachers that we both will be equal partners in our mission to increase the quality of education in the state. The government will take care of their problems and we expect them to also shoulder responsibility of fulfilling their duty as well,” said Gaikwad.

Under the last government, friction with teachers and school management had increased as many felt that too many changes were being implemented too soon. Lathi charge on protesting teachers at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan in August last year was seen as the final straw after which the gulf between the education department and schools never got bridged. Hence, it’s no surprise that Gaikwad is going all out to reach out to teachers.

Former CM Devendra Fadnavis’ pet project PSM too goes under the scanner but Gaikwad said not too much should be read into the move. “We are not those who will oppose just for the sake of opposing. PSM will be reviewed to see how it is performing and whether it has been able to achieve the desired results. The good things will be appreciated and taken forward while whatever improvements are needed will be made,” said Gaikwad.

PSM was started in 2016 and aims to bring the performance of state students in Language and math, in the top three of the country. For this, annually three exams are conducted for high school students which judge how much they have understood the subject at hand. But poor implementation of the tests at school level raises many doubts about the results.

For aided schools, the biggest issue is about meagre non-salary grants disbursed which is insufficient to pay for civic and utility bills and building maintenance. The current payout is 4% of schools salary grants. Zafar Khan, president of School Headmasters’ Charitable Association, said, “That 4%, is calculated on 5th pay commission levels, whereas now we are at 7th pay level. The NSG is grossly insufficient to meet requirements of schools.” For this, Gaikwad has already started the process with a crucial meeting slotted for Monday. “I am meeting with the finance department and we will discuss this issue specifically. I have been told that the NSG amount is insufficient and it is being given after a lot of delay. For arrears of salary grants, I have already announced the decision to release the amount. We are definitely going to try our best for resolving issues related to schools and teachers,” said Gaikwad.

Francis D’Britto delivers a speech at the inaugural event of the 93rd All-India Marathi Literary Meet

AURANGABAD: Francis D’Britto , the chairman of the 93rd All-India Marathi Literary Meet that is being held in Osmanabad, had to leave the event midway due to poor health and return to Mumbai on Saturday.

Once he reached Mumbai on Saturday morning, he was admitted to a private hospital, where he is currently undergoing necessary treatment.

Speaking to TOI over the phone from Mumbai, D’Britto said his mobility had been affected due to severe pain in the lower back. “The pain started developing post-Christmas and kept aggravating till January 5. Doctors treating me were apprehensive about my visit to Osmanabad. However, I decided to go for the sake of the 10,000-plus people attending the event,” he said.

While speculations were rife that D’Britto may not be able to attend the literary meet, he did not let his poor health get the better of him and made it to the inaugural event on Friday evening on a wheel-chair. The priest-author skipped many formal events organised during the first half of the inaugural day.

“As I was determined to attend the event, doctors treating me strictly advised me to go by train and avoid road journey. I am glad that I could make it to the inauguration of the literary meet. I will return to Osmanabad once I recover fully,” said D’Britto.

Meanwhile, the three-day literary event kickstarted on Friday amid heavy police bandobast. A section of right-wing groups were against the decision of the organisers to let D’Britto chair the event.

In his address, D’Britto touched upon the current controversy surrounding the violence that broke out in the JNU campus among other issues.

“We cannot remain mute spectators if students are injured in violence. Which culture defends such acts of violence against youth?” he asked. In his speech, which he delivered sitting on a wheel-chair, D’Britto also referred to the killings of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare and Gauri Lankesh . “Is this the culture of our country — to silence the voices of sane people?” he asked.

D’Britto, who hails from Vasai , is known for his work ‘Subodh Bible’ among the 19 other books that he has written. He is believed to be the second person (the first being British-born 17th-century missionary priest, Father Thomas Stevens) to have translated the Bible into Marathi.

A certain section among the organisers and the literary community claimed to have received threats from ring-wing groups when D’Britto was announced as the chairman of the literary meet. The event will conclude on Sunday.

NAGPUR: In yet another incident of attack on police officials, two cops were thrashed by a group of revellers who also pelted stones on them on Friday night at Gondwana Chowk. This is the fourth incident of attack on cops in just more than a month.

Sadar police have arrested Rohit Uyke, Vijay Tekam, Pranay alias Golu Uyke, Hritik Tekam and Sanjay alias Ajay Uyke while another accused, Himanshu Sidam, is still absconding. The accused have been booked for assault, rioting and deterring a public servant from discharging his duty.

According to police, constables Sagar Thate and Vinod Samjore, who are currently attached with Shanti Nagar police station, were on their way to Sadar police station to take information about an offence.

As per cops, the duo was on a bike at Mecosabagh flyover when two of the accused, under the influence of alcohol, started abusing the cops. When the policemen tried to stop them, the accused called their friends who joined them at the spot. The accused not only thrashed the cops but also pelted stones on them before fleeing the spot. The cops managed to nab one of the accused named Rohit.

Sadar police learnt about the incident and rushed to the spot. Cops rounded up Rohit who coughed up the names of others involved in the attack. Cops later nabbed the other accused in the case.

Earlier, on December 5 last year, a senior police inspector along with a traffic staff was manhandled and abused by a contractor over parking his SUV on a footpath at Jadhav Chowk.

On December 17 last year, a cop was manhandled after he asked a group of people to turn off music system near Wanjari Bhavan Gram Panchayat. On December 27 too, a father-son duo abused and manhandled cops on Canal Road after the son was caught drunk driving.

MADURAI: Makkal Needhi Maiyam (MNM) president Kamal Haasan has started preparing for the next assembly elections while making his intention clear to have a shot at power in the state. On Saturday, the actor-turned-politican urged entrepreneurs to donate generously to his political party.

Speaking at Yescon 2020, organised by the Young Entrepreneurs School in Madurai , he said medium and small scale industries could provide numerous job opportunities and develop the nation. While criticising Tamil Nadu ’s high ranking high in the development index, he said, “they may believe it but not us,” adding, “IAS officers who should monitor the development of the state are monitoring the growth of liqour shops while education has been privatised,” he said.

He said that we should not be complacent to the problems around us, and that it was the anger of one man which had led to the formation of MNM. “It is a bit too late but I am not going to give up,” he said. Mentioning the skill development school that he had established in Paramakudi in Ramanathapuram, he urged entrepreneurs to come forward and start similar centres in all the districts. “This is not a political agenda, but a Tamilian agenda,” he said. “If we celebrate mediocrity we will accept rubbish. The switch is in our hands and it is for us to use it judiciously,” he said.

Kamal Haasan said that everyone thought of politics and learnt it. “We ignored the plight of the jews in Germany, and ignoring is more dangerous than ignorance,” he said.

The entrepreneurs were urged to raise their voice against GST which was unequal, unplanned and uneven as the film fraternity had taken it lightly and are now paying the price, he said.

Madurai: Four college students from Sivakasi designed robots that won a sports event for robots at the annual IIT Bombay Techfest held between Januray 3 and January 5.

“We designed and built robots on our own to take part in the RoboVR sports events. It is a tournament for robots in sports and is just like human sports events. The robots actually compete with one another and the winner is the one who wins the final competition. Last year, too, I participated but could not win, this time the team was able to do it,” said Jefin Marshall M, one among the team of winners from Mepco Schlenk Engineering College, Sivakasi.

RoboVR Championship called ‘Olympics of Robots’, is an event held as part of IIT Bombay’s Techfest, where participants build robots programmed with artificial intelligence and machine learning to make them play over 30 sports that humans play, including archery, basketball, football, hockey, golf, cricket, boxing and much more.

Playing under their team name ‘Tobor’, which is robot spelt backwards, Jefin, and his teammates, Ram Aditya, Sornaraja and Karthikeyan M secured first place with their robots in swimming and swimming underwater events.

For the events, the model robot had to actually swim through a maze of water, while being remotely controlled. The team also won second place in sumo wrestling and tug of war.

The students said that robot designing and programming contests are bringing excitement to engineering students.

291,['12/01/2020'],Udaipur: Give credit of Beti Bachao slogan to cop: Centre to Rajasthan,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Chetna Bhati

UDAIPUR: The Union ministry of women and child development has instructed the state government to give ‘creativity credit’ to a lady police officer for coining the phrase ‘ Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao’ (BBBP) which is a flagship programme of the Narendra Modi government.

The scheme was launched by the Centre in 2015 to save and educate the girl child.

BBBP programme deputy director Ashok Kumar Jaiswal in a letter on January 3 asked the department of women and child development of Rajasthan government to issue a certificate of creativity/originality for the slogan to Chetna Bhati, a DSP rank officer, who hails from Jaisalmer district and is presently posted in Udaipur .

Bhati had in June 2016 claimed that the slogan was coined by her in 1999 for a poetry series. The officer, who was concerned with the dwindling number of girls and selective abortions in India, had written poems on girl child issue and had even got printed some posters on the same. In 2012 she revealed the slogan to the state government when she was posted in Nagaur district and had sent an email to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot requesting him to publicise the posters. The mail was sent from the official email id of the police department.

“I never received a reply for the same and the phrase was forgotten then, though I continued to write poems during my free time and recited on several occasions at schools and colleges to sensitise people on gender issues,” Bhati said.

In 2015, when PM Modi launched the national campaign in selected 100 districts covering all states and UTs, the slogan gained immense popularity as it was catchy and attractive. Bhati wrote to the PM ‘seeking recognition for her creativity’ after her RTI applications to the PM office on ‘how they got hold of the phrase’ did not yield desired results.

Since then, she had been writing to various ministries including the HRD, women and child development and health department. Finally her efforts gained results.

“I do not crave for fame or money but I just want to be acknowledged for my idea which has become so popular. Even if the state government awards me a certificate, I would still request the Centre to give me credit since the phrase has travelled from Rajasthan to every nook and cranny of the country,” claims Bhati who holds double postgraduation degrees in history and English Literature.

Kites in various colors, designs and manjha are selling like hot cakes ahead of Sankranti

JAIPUR: From kids accompanying their parents to groups of youngsters, residents made a beeline to the city markets to purchase kites and manjha ahead of Makar Sankranti . Though the prices of kites and manjha have witnessed an increase of almost 30 to 40 per cent compared to previous years, it has not dampened the spirit of the customers.

With just three days left for Makar Sankranti, when kite enthusiasts across the city indulge in the rooftop sport of flying kites, a gigantic rush was seen in the markets. Despite the prices of kites being 30 per cent higher than that in previous years, the markets saw a boom in the sale.

“The sale picked up on Saturday. In coming days, we will have to open the market till late in the evening. Saturday saw a good footfall of customers,” said Mehmood Qureshi, a wholesale dealer at Haldiyon Ka Raasta near Johari Bazaar.

People prefer kites made by the famous kite-makers of Bareilly and Rampur, while many were also purchasing the plastic kites with caricatures and characters of famous cartoon series. “Kites from Bareilly are better, as they have a proper cutting and a calculated use of bamboo stick on the paper, which makes the kite air-friendly,” said Anirudh Singh, a kite lover, who was seen choosing his bunch of kites at the Chandpole Bazaar.

Traders said that the supply of kites has been hampered due to fog and mist in Uttar Pradesh and some parts of Bharatpur. “Due to short supply, there has been an increase in the prices. However, the kite lovers are not bothered by it. We have regular customers for years,” said Kishan Agarwal, a wholesale kite dealer at Chandpole Bazaar.

For many, Makar Sankranti is a festival of re-union with family and friends. “I have purchased 100 kites and two charkhees having 6,000 metres of manjha each. My brother and his family come to our house at Hanuman ji ka Raasta. Since I am the eldest in the family, I need to purchase kites for everyone,” said Sanjay Singh, a spices trader near Choti Chaupar.

People holding bundles of kites were seen everywhere at Handipura, Tripolia Bazaar, Mansarovar and other localities. On Sunday, a jam-packed situation is expected in the markets. “We are expecting a good rush as people come to shop for the festival,” said a trader.

Hyderabad: Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy on Friday said chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao should break his prolonged silence on Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“Congress has been demanding a special session of the state Assembly to pass a resolution rejecting CAA and NRC. When chief ministers of several states could announce that they will not implement CAA, NRC and NPR, why has KCR not clarified his stand till now.

The TPCC chief also demanded that MIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi explain to the public as to why KCR is silent on CAA and NRC or exert pressure on KCR to come clean on the issue. TNN

Commuters were caught in a traffic jam outside the venue on Sunday

PANAJI: Parking provisions made by organisers of Lokotsav, on the DB Ground at Campal, are clearly inadequate. Traffic police could be seen, Sunday evening, clamping cars parked on the road outside Kala Academy.

While Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) had granted an in-principle approval for the festival, it is yet to grant it full-fledged permission. “In their parking plan, the organisers have shown 200 car parking spaces for visitors, but their own vehicles and stalls are blocking these spaces. The CCP commissioner has been personally monitoring the situation, along with traffic police, after residents threatened to stop the event,” said Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar, adding that vehicles parked in unauthorised spaces will be towed away.

Madkaikar said the toilet facilities provided by organisers are also inadequate. “Open-defecation is taking place. Our team is keeping a watch between 6am and 10pm,” he said.

Another issue the civic body is dealing with quite strictly is that of single-use plastic. “We’ve instructed organisers to avoid using plastic spoons, cups, plates, including plastic-coated paper plates as these are banned in Panaji. We told them to use steel plates instead,” he said. “We will send our team on Monday to inspect the food stalls.”

Nagpur/Aurangabad: Sanjay Raimulkar, Shiv Sena MLA from Mehkar in Buldhana district, was injured after his car collided head-on with a light pickup van at Naigaon Dattapur on Janephal-Mehkar road on Friday night.

The three-time MLA’s bodyguard, constable Dnyaneshwar Nikas and driver Panjab Guddhe were also injured. The three are now stable, and would be discharged in a couple of days from the hospital in Aurangabad where they were shifted for treatment.

Pravin Suryawanshi, deputy dean at MGM medical college and hospital, said that Raimulkar had sustained rib injuries. “No surgical procedure was required for his treatment. Two others admitted with him are also being treated for their rib injuries. All are doing okay,” he said.

The police said that Raimulkar was heading to Mehkar after attending a programme at Dattapur. The driver of the pickup van, Ganesh Raut — who has been arrested — is learnt to have rammed into Raimulkar’s car on its way to Janephal.

Assistant police inspector Dilip Masram from Janephal police station said that the pickup van’s driver Raut was likely to be under the influence of alcohol. “Raut was driving at top speed. He was speeding under the impression that there would not be much traffic. We took Raut into custody shortly after the incident,” said the senior officer.

Tirunelveli: Meticulous monitoring of footage recorded in as many as 460 CCTV cameras helped the Tirunelveli city police trace the whereabouts and nab four serial burglars in Tirupur, about 350km from here. Police, which began to search for the unidentified gang from December 20, 2019 said their 16-day effort was worth it as they recovered 52 sovereigns gold jewellery and Rs 8 lakh in cash from them. A total of 50 cases are pending against the four.

The accused V Ramajeyam, 32, H Yasar Arafat, 26, and K Mohammed Rafiq, 25, of Tirupur and G Gurusakthi, 31, of Tiruvallur district, were arrested a few days ago, brought to Tirunelveli and remanded in judicial custody.

“They have been running a jewellery outlet in Tirupur for about a year to sell their loot from locked houses across the state,” deputy commissioner of police for Tirunelveli city, A Saravanan said. The search began when they broke into a locked house at V M Chatram in Tirunelveli. They had decamped with a total of 77 sovereigns of gold jewellery.

Police said that there was difficulty in cracking the case instantly as there were no CCTV cameras in the house. Police also found it difficult to get fingerprints or other clues left behind by the accused, due to which they could not make a comparison with the data of similar offenders. Then police began monitoring the CCTV footage in that locality on the day the incident took place.

Realising that one of the cars had a fake registration number, they monitored the directions in which the car went. This led them to the highway, where the police started tracking them on the CCTV footages at the toll plazas as well as commercial establishments enroute. The tracking became difficult as the vehicle could not be followed beyond 100km from Tirunelveli.

“The accused changed the number plate of the vehicle once again,” the DC said and added that after a close monitoring they saw a similar car like the one they were tracking but with a different registration number at the next told plaza. “Our team saw a car with the same model and colour but this was not enough. It was a three-inch sticker that helped us ascertain that it was the same car,” he added.

The accused changed the number plate again. The car was traced all the way to Tirupur. It was only 350km away they came to know that it was a gang of four and they had a first glimpse of the accused when they stepped out at a hotel. With help from the Tirupur police the Tirunelveli police identified them and picked them.

Saravanan said that of the 460 CCTV cameras in Tirunelveli, on the highway and connecting roads and Tirupur they monitored, the car was recorded in at least 100 cameras. “It took 12 days of monitoring these footages to get close to them. They travelled to various districts in a car, burgled houses without CCTV cameras and sold the jewellery through their jewellery outlet,” he said.

The Dindigul police have sought police custody of the accused to probe them for similar cases.

HYDERABAD: Most schools in Old City remained shut and several children participated in the Tiranga rally with their parents on Friday. Many school buses were seen ferrying protesters to Eidgah Mir Alam, where thousands of people had gathered for the rally.

“We did not take to the streets after Ayodhya verdict, when triple talaq was criminalised or during abrogation of Article 370, but now the issue is about our citizenship,” said a school teacher. An official holiday was not declared in schools, but most remained closed, and those that were functioning registered poor attendance.

“We did not even bother to check whether the school declared a holiday or not. I decided not to send my child to the school for a day to ensure a good future for him and coming generations,” said Ahmed Khan, a resident of Chandrayangutta.

At the protest rally, several children were seen holding the Tricolour and placards against CAA and NRC. Slogans such as ‘tanashai nahi chalegi, CAA ko wapas lo’ were being raised by the children.

Shops selling the national flag were packed with crowd, and several roadside stalls selling Tricolour also surfaced along the the rally route.

Parents were seen buying flags for their children and pasting small Tricolour stickers on the cheeks of their kids.

He took part in the sixth annual day celebration of Police Boys and Girls Club, Karumbalai in Anna Nagar on Saturday evening. Addressing the children, who gathered in large numbers, the commissioner said the club leads other clubs in the state. It prevents children taking the wrong path by engaging them in various useful activities and keeps them focused in positive things.

There are seven police boys club - Karumbalai, SS Colony, Tallakulam, Karimedu, Thilagar Thidal, Thideer Nagar and Teppakulam - in Madurai. The clubs were started at these places, to wean out youth involved in criminal and anti-social activities.

Devasirvatham said that apart from Karumbalai club, the one in Teppakulam is also doing a good work by taking tuition for students.

“The success of clubs depends on the volunteers. We have got good volunteers for Karumbalai club. Other clubs can also be made to function in a better way if there are dedicated volunteers. It would be difficult for the police to run it on day to day basis,” he said.

Coordinator of Karumbalai club S Vicky said that there are 50 boys and 42 girls in the club. Various activities like educational assistance, cultural programmes, book reading and music classes are being conducted to students. “We have a library with more than 4,000 books covering various topics and subjects. Children are encouraged to read them. Varshini, a Class 12 student, finished reading 22 books in the last one year,” he said.

Vicky, who has completed doctorate in social work, said that many youths from the club have become teachers and policemen and have become respectable citizens in the society.

Shekhawat visited the affected villages of Pokhran and Luni in his constituency on Saturday and assured villagers of carrying out a survey of damaged crops in three days.

Expressing disappointment over the poor handling of the menace by the state government, Shekhawat advised Gehlot of not playing politics when it comes to water and farmers.

“The central government has sent Rs 506 crore relief to the state. The state should carry out the survey as soon and possible and grant the amount to the farmers,” said the minister. Rajashan is facing its worst locust attack in the last five decades.

During his visit to the Salawas village in Luni, he lambasted officials after learning that farmers lost mustard, wheat and isabgol crops because of the insect menace. The farmers told the minister that none of them had received any help from the government. The minister expressed his disappointment that the state hadn’t carried out the survey of the damaged crops despite the continued attack since May 23.

He told that the state-level relief fund gets 75% from the central government while 25% comes from state. “I was told that state has a total relief fund is Rs 1,250 crore,” Shekhawat said.

Tuticorin: A lot was drawn to elect the chairperson of Ottapidaram union in Titicorin district after two elected DMK aspirants vied for the position. Of the 22 councillors elected in the union, the DMK has won the majority with 12, followed by AIADMK (6), CPM (2) and an independent. Competition ensued between DMK’s Ottapidaram MLA Shanmugaiah’s relative Ramesh and the party’s union secretary Kasi Viswanathan.

The two councilors, who also had a pact with the opposition party councillors to win the election, were polled 11 votes each in the indirect polls. As there was a stalemate, it was decided that lots would be drawn to elect the winner. A retired government employee, Prakash, was called to pick up the lot and Ramesh was elected winner by lot.

Tense moments prevailed at Kovilpatti as the indirect election to the post of chairperson and deputy chairperson of the Kovilpatti union in the district had to be called off at the last moment after the returning officer (RO) was hospitalised. Officials said that deputy registrar of cooperatives C Jayaseelan, who is the RO at Kovilpatti, complained of severe chest pain and was admitted to the Tirunelveli Government Medical College Hospital.

Tuticorin MP and DMK women’s wing president Kanimozhi Karunanidhi, who interacted with the party councillors in the union, accused the AIADMK government of purposely indulging in activities that will hinder elected DMK representatives from assuming office. She told reporters that she will take the issue to the election commission.

Of the 19 wards in Kovilpatti union, the DMK won nine wards, followed by the AIADMK in six wards and independents in four wards in the direct elections in December. The decision to postpone the election was passed to the councillors only after they assembled at the Kovilpatti union office on Saturday morning. Officials informed the councillors that the election to the post of the chairperson would not be held but the deputy chairperson election will be conducted.

This was opposed by the councillors, following which a notice announcing postponement of the indirect election to both the posts was affixed on the notice board. The noticed added that the date will be announced later. Superintendent of police, Tuticorin district, Arun Balagopalan visited the spot as tension prevailed.

Representative image

JAIPUR: Swasthya Mitras will be deployed in every village of the state to bridge the gap between the health department and patients.

Apart from the existing fleet of auxiliary nurse midwives, ASHA and anganwadi workers in every village, the health department is gearing up to deploy ‘swasthya mitras.’ The government will select two persons from each village of the state.

“There are more than 40,000 villages in the state. Each village will have two swasthya mitras— one man and a woman. A total of 80,000 swasthya mitras, on voluntary basis, will be selected from the villages,” said health minister Raghu Sharma, adding that it may take some time.

Swasthya mitras, who will be selected from the villagers, must have knowledge of national and state’s health programmes and health and medical policies launched by the state government.

According to health department officials, the role of swasthya mitras will be to bridge the gap between the government officials and patients. They will help the patients by providing information about diseases and treatment. Moreover, health mitras will create awareness about diseases under Nirogi Rajasthan scheme.

The move also aims at bringing down maternal mortality ratio and infant mortality rate along with improving other health indicators such as immunisation, institutional deliveries, ante-natal check-ups and also aimed at encouraging people to adopt family planning measures.

Swasthya mitras will play instrumental role in preventing spread of vector-borne diseases such as dengue, malaria and chikungunya by encouraging people not to allow mosquito breeding and to keep their houses and nearby areas neat and clean to create healthy environment.

Madurai: Violence and protests marred the elections to the chairman and vice-chairman posts of the panchayat unions in the southern districts. A deputy superintendent of police, identified as Venkatesan, was injured in the violence at Narikudi union in Virudhunagar. Elections were cancelled in many unions due to law and order issues in the districts.

Tense moments prevailed outside the halls in many unions where indirect elections were held on Saturday as only elected representatives were allowed to enter the halls.

Protests were reported in places where the margin between the DMK and AIADMK was small, as each party alleged that the rival was trying to lure the independent candidates, whose votes were crucial for victory. In Usilampatti in Madurai district, the AIADMK supporters staged a protest in the council hall. The union has 13 councillors, of which the DMK and AIADMK have five each, two were AMMK councillors and an independent candidate. The independent candidate extended his support to the ruling party and the two AMMK councillors supported the DMK, which resulted in the DMK gaining majority. Later, S Ranjani of the DMK was elected chairperson of the panchayat union and R Pandi of the AMMK vice-chairman.

Violence prevailed outside the election hall in Narikudi union in Virudhunagar district. The DMK and AIADMK got seven votes each in the 14-seat union on Saturday’s indirect elections. Heated arguments erupted inside the hall. As DSP Venkatesan tried to intervene, a four-member gang barged into the hall throwing stones and attacked the officer with a machete injuring his right hand. The elections to the union were cancelled following the violence and two people were arrested in connection with the incident.

In Madurai district, the DMK and the AIADMK bagged 12 panchayat union vice-chairman posts each. The election to the Vadipatti union was cancelled as the quorum was not formed. Elections were cancelled in many unions in the districts including Kallal in Sivaganga, Chinnamanur, Periyakulam, Mayiladumparai in Theni district for the post of vice-chairmen.

The election to the post of the vice-president of the Sankarapuram panchayat in Sivaganga district was cancelled by district collector Jayakanthan as the dispute regarding certificates issued to two female candidates for the president’s post is pending before the court.

CHENNAI: The Madras high court has made it clear that completion of probation for professors appointed to state universities is not automatic, and that in the event of non-confirmation of their service after the expiry of probation period, such candidates cannot claim regularisation as a right.

Justice V Anand Venkatesh made the observation while concurring with the submissions of advocate P Sanjai Gandhi, who represented Tamil Nadu Open University and dismissing pleas moved by professors E Ravi and S Prabakaran.

According to the petitioners, they were originally working as lecturers in Annamalai University. In 2014, Tamil Nadu Open University called for applications for the posts of professor and associate professors. The petitioners applied for the posts and got selected. On November 28, 2015, they were appointed to their respective posts with twoyear probation with a lien for the same period in Annamalai University. However, even after the expiry of the probation period they were not absorbed permanently for the posts. The lien provided for them in Annamalai University also expired. Therefore, they made a representation to the open university to regularise their service. To their shock, the open university refused to absorb them permanently and passed an order dated February 1, 2018. Aggrieved, they moved the present plea challenging their removal.

Mohali: A 52-year-old woman was pushed into a car, robbed of her gold bangle and thrown out of the moving vehicle in a brazen crime carried out by two women in broad daylight here on Saturday.

Joginder Kaur, a resident of United Enclave in Sector 68, was waiting to witness a religious procession on the main road opposite Army Institute of Law in Sector 68 when a woman stopped her Maruti car next to her. Joginder said the woman told her she lives in her society and could give her lift, opening the door. While Joginder was considering the offer, another woman came from behind and pushed her into the car which drove away. Joginder alleged the accused cut her gold bangle and pushed her out of the moving car after travelling for 1km. Joginder claimed her gold bangle weighed 3 tolas.

Joginder’s husband Daljit Singh said he had dropped her at Phase VII gurdwara in the morning. After paying obeisance, Joginder accompanied some of her friends to a house of another devotee at Balongi to attend a religious discourse. Joginder then boarded a CTU bus from Balongi to reach outside the Army institute of Law.

Phase VIII police station house officer (SHO) inspector Shivdeep Singh Brar said, “We are trying to procure CCTV footage from nearby areas. Based on her statement and description of the accused, we are sending teams to nab them. The victim failed to note down the registration number of the vehicle.”

Police registered a case at the Phase VIII police station.

Rajkot: A woman match maker who allegedly duped a youth and his family members in Junction Plot locality of Rajkot was arrested on Saturday.

Police said the accused, identified as Anu, had allegedly taken Rs 1.25 lakh from the victim and got him married to a woman from Nagpur. A few days after her marriage, the woman had stolen cash and jewellery worth Rs 3.25 lakh from her husband’s house and had decamped.

CM Yogi Adityanath

LUCKNOW: Ahead of the five-day-long Ganga Yatra , which is scheduled to begin from January 27, chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed officials to create platforms in all 1,638 villages along the river so that Ganga aarti can be performed from there.

Along with these platforms, Ganga Maidans or playgrounds are also to be developed in all gram panchayats. These grounds will provide facility for walking and open gyms, among other activities. During the five-day event, sports activities, including rowing and boat races, are also to be organised.

Organisations like Yuvak Mangal Dal, NCC, NSO and Nehru Yuva Kendra will be linked with the yatra and their members will be encouraged to participate in the events.

“The CM and other members who participate in Ganga Yatra will perform pooja and aarti at all places where the yatra halts. We will also construct platforms in all villages along the river so that aarti can be performed there at all times. Performing aarti will be voluntary and the government will not be supporting it financially,” said Jal Shakti minister Mahendra Singh.

In a meeting on Saturday, the CM deputed various departments to ensure that the yatra, being organised to create awareness about the Ganga and attempts to clean it, is successful.

During the yatra days, no solid or liquid waste is to be allowed into the river. Accordingly, the CM said, there will be a ban on single-use plastic while all drains emptying into the Ganga will have to be diverted through permanent or temporary means.

To ensure water conservation, the CM said that Ganga ponds and Ganga parks should be created under all local bodies. Ganga ponds will encourage fish farming, duck keeping and farming of water chestnut. On the same lines, Ganga nurseries have to be created in all 26 districts along the river. Fruit trees will be cultivated in these nurseries and distributed from here, especially to be planted along the river. The nurseries will also be developed as parks.

The yatra has been divided into two sections, one will start at Ballia and the other at Bijnor. Both will conclude in Kanpur. From Bijnor to Kanpur, the yatra will cover 538km by road and 56km by water.

From Ballia to Kanpur, the yatra will cover 624km by road and the remaining 52km by water. Along with the CM, ministers, MLAs and general public are expected to participate in the five-day programme.

327,['12/01/2020'],DeMo demons return to haunt jewellers,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Ahmedabad: The ghosts of demonetisation have returned to haunt jewellers in Gujarat, as the income tax (I-T) department has asked about a thousand of them to pay tax on cash deposits they made between November 8, 2016 and December 30, 2016. The tax demand has been raised for the assessment year 2016-17 through assessment orders (AOs) issued by the I-T department. Each jeweller is being made liable to pay taxes ranging from Rs 2 crore to Rs 50 crore, according to estimates by Jewellers’ Association of Ahmedabad (JAA).

The AOs issued by the I-T department to these jewellers have classified the income of the jewellers as being from undisclosed sources.

“The high incidence of cash deposits in old currency notes during the demonetisation period is suspicious and it was observed that cash in hand increased before the declaration of demonetization and books of account were manipulated,” states one such AO, a copy of which TOI has accessed.

Jewellers opposed the I-T department move saying that their income and deposits are substantiated by proper bills and cannot be classified as coming from undisclosed sources. Most jewellers who received AOs in the last week of December, had received show-cause notices from the I-T department between September and December.

“We have responded to all such notices and furnished bills for every transaction. Therefore, our income cannot be classified as undisclosed. Moreover, when notices were issued to us, the department sought PAN data and proof of residence of customers who had bought gold. When there was no rule to seek proof of residence or even PAN data, there is no basis for the department to seek these details. We will not be able to furnish it,” said a senior member of the JAA on condition of not being named.

Jewellers also raised concerns about having to pay hefty fines at the time of recession over such ‘baseless’ allegations. “The industry is currently reeling from the severe recession. Even if we want to opt for an appeal, we would have to pay 20% of the sum concerned, which is unpalatable at a time when payment cycles are stretched and incomes are affected,” said another jeweller, who was also not willing to be named.

Jewellers said they will make a representation to the chief commissioner of I-T in Ahmedabad next week over the issue.

Amol Palekar with his wife Sandhya Gokhale

BHUBANESWAR: Veteran actor and director Amol Palekar on Saturday came out in support of actor Deepika Padukone for showing solidarity with the agitating students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Palekar, the protagonist of several middle of the road movies, said it needs courage to do what Padukone has done.

“Being a mainstream actor with her film supposed to be released in two days, it needs lot of courage to do what Deepika did by standing with the protesting students at JNU,” said Palekar who was in the city to attend the Tata Steel Bhubaneswar Literary Meet where his play ‘Kusur’ (The Mistake) was staged on Saturday.

“Expressing dissent or protesting is one of the biggest strengths of democracy and I am happy that the young generation in our country are doing that,” he said, showing his admiration of the student protests taking place in several parts of the country.

“I am extremely happy that the younger generation is expressing itself in a very strong way. They are saying that they are not going to just keep quiet and lie down. They will protest and which according to me is one of the biggest strengths of democracy,” he added.

Palekar, remembered for films like ‘Rajnigandha’, ‘Chhoti Si Baat’, ‘Chitchor’, ‘Golmaal’ and ‘Baton Baton Mein’, returned to theatre with ‘Kusur’ after 25 years, a play which he has written and co-directed with wife Sandhya Gokhale.

But Palekar disagrees he is making a comeback. “Comeback is when one may continue further, but I am not going to do that. It was my precondition that I will be performing 25 shows of the play across the country. There is something so challenging and exciting in this play that I decided to return to theatre,” Palekar said.

Talking about the play, Gokhale said, “Kusur was my gift to him when he turned 75. All these years I have heard him say no to offers of films, theatre and web series. The reason was that he did not find roles challenging. Then we saw a Danish film ‘Den Skyldige’ and I thought if I adopt it he may like it to do. That’s how it all happened.”

Talking about the popularity of theatre in the internet age, the director of films like ‘Thodasa Rumani Ho Jaye’, ‘ Daayraa ’ and ‘Paheli’ said, “Despite technological advancement, watching live performance in a theatre is something magical and nothing can replace that. All the shows of ‘Kusur’ so far has been houseful.”

Putting emphasis on development of regional cinema, Palekar said, “It is very unfortunate that we don’t speak about regional cinema but only about Bollywood . Regional cinema is true Indian cinema and it has been strengthening the latter. If I get a chance to do anything that helps improve the status of Odia cinema, I will be more than happy.”

Mumbai: The HSNC University will be headquartered in the upmarket Worli locality, which earlier housed Watumull College of Engineering managed by the same group. The college was shifted to Ulhasnagar a few years ago and the building is now being renovated and is likely to be ready in three months. The university will start functioning from the 2020-21 session. An official from one of the colleges said some technicalities still need to be worked out on independent roles of the colleges.

The vice-chancellor’s appointment will be done by a committee which will have representatives from the state government and the parent body—in this case, the HSNC board. The board will also have the power to recommend a provost to the university, who will be the link between the chancellor and the vice-chancellor, said HSNCB secretary Dinesh Panjwani. The state governor will be the chancellor of the newly formed university, as is the case with all other public universities.

Panjwani further said it is the first model in the state and in the country where the parent body of a state university is a charitable trust. The university will have the potential to become a role model for private trusts in other states where it can be replicated, he said.

The cluster university, though, will not be an affiliating body. According to the gazette notification released by the state government, only three colleges—HR, KC and Bombay Teachers’ Training College—will be its constituent colleges. “In future, if the university wishes to adopt more colleges—only the ones run by the HSNC Board—we will have to seek permission from the state government and a fresh notification will have to be issued,” said Panjwani.

The concept fits into the framework recommended in the proposed National Education Policy as well, which states that all institutions should be made degree-awarding universities.

Under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shikshan Abhiyan (RUSA), the new university will get 60% of the Rs 55-crore grant set aside for each cluster university and HSNC board will have to raise the remaining 40%. The funding will be used to create new infrastructure, new courses, academic development, appointments, etc.

Academic bodies under the new university will be formed with help from all the three constituent colleges. To get a global outlook, the board has invited experts from a Malaysian university on January 20. The university may have a school of law, school of management, independent research departments in the future.

HSNC will be the second cluster university in the city after Dr Homi Bhabha State University which brought together Sydenham, Elphinstone, Secondary Training College and Institute of Science. The latter, though, was a cluster formed with government colleges alone.

CHANDIGARH: The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) has directed the UT administration to expedite work on the source appointment study which will help it prepare data to quantify the proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution.The directions were issued in a recent meeting between NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel and UT officials.Debendra Dalai, director, environment, and vice-chairman, Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC), said UT environment secretary has already given approval for floating a tender to engage an institute to carry out the study.The central government has already sanctioned Rs 10 crore under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) out of which Rs 80 lakh would be for the study. At present, the UT does not have any data to quantify the proportion of various elements to the overall level of pollution.In 2018, the administration rejected the proposal because of its high cost. In 2017, the environment department representatives held a meeting with officials of the Union environment ministry in which it was discussed that IIT, Kanpur, had procured Switzerland-made monitoring devices worth Rs 5 crore each to conduct the study in four different cities. One such device was proposed to be installed in Chandigarh. As the cost was very high, the proposal was then turned down. Now, the administration would float a tender to carry out the study.The administration had recently submitted its action plan to control air pollution in Chandigarh to the Union government. The UT had submitted that it has already launched extensive drive against polluting vehicles and prepared an action plan to widen roads and improvement of infrastructure for decongestion of roads.The other initiatives mentioned included synchronization of traffic signals in the city, greening of open areas, and introducing water fountain at major traffic intersections, wherever feasible, with the use of tertiary treated water, promoting battery operated vehicles, green buffers along traffic corridors, and introducing intelligent traffic management system.The UT submitted that the ambient air quality of the city is mainly affected by the increase in the number of vehicles. “There has been an increase of around 60% in the number of vehicles in 10 years with no change in the length of roads. Increase of light motor vehicles (LMVs), basically cars, by more than 100% in the past 10 years in comparison to approximately 48% increase in two-wheelers. This has resulted in more congestion, ultimately contributing to air pollution,” the UT had submitted.The officials maintained that construction and demolition waste, dust, crop harvesting seasons, effects of pollens due to greenery, temperature effect, industrial surroundings and vehicular density are the main reasons behind high pollution.In list of 100 citiesThe Union government had recently fixed a target for pollution reduction. The UT administration decided to prepare a comprehensive action plan. Chandigarh is in the list of 100 cities identified on the basis of level of pollutants such as NO2, PM2.5 and PM10 by the central government for pollution reduction. The government aims at cutting pollution level by 35% in the next three years and 50% by the next five years.",chandigarh,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73210054,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1232827,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chandigarh/expedite-work-on-pollution-study-ngt/articleshow/73208299.cms

The Centre’s letter warned that “disobedience could attract provisions of Article 356, and one could proceed on the basis that Central laws would implicitly be obeyed by state governments.”

On January, 9 state transport minister and Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab said that traffic fines proposed should be proportionate to the violation.

Gadkari, who on Saturday inaugurated the Road Safety Awareness Week at Vanamati, explained the need for hefty traffic fines. He said every year five lakh accidents take place across the country, killing 1.5 lakh people and injuring 3 lakh seriously. “It accounts for 62% of youth in the 18-35 age group. In Nagpur district, as many as 634 people have lost their lives in road accidents in recent years. This causes a loss of around 2% of GDP. This is worrying,” he said.

The minister linked the rise in road accidents to the ease with which driving licence are issued across the country.

While praising the Tamil Nadu government “for bringing accident and deaths down by 29% through various initiatives”, Gadkari suggested that Maharashtra should follow the southern state.

He emphasized on the public works department becoming proactive by identifying black spots, repairing potholes, marking zebra crossings and putting warning signs about road repairs. “These simple initiatives can reduce road accidents,” he said.

Gadkari was critical of new Sadar flyover’s design and said that its landing near RBI can lead to road accidents. He added that agencies concerned have been told to take corrective measures like installing traffic signal at the spot.

Mayor Sandip Joshi talked about how the NMC, in association with NGOs and 1,400 schools, is creating awareness about keeping the city clean and following traffic rules under its ‘Mummy Papa You Too’ campaign beginning from January 13 across the city.

Maharashtra minister Sunil Kedar, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Chinmay Pandit, RTOs Shripad Wadekar, Dinkar Manwar, deputy RTOs Vinod Jadhav and Atul Adey were present. Gadkari also flagged off a motorcycle rally for creating road safety awareness.

‘Clear all accident prone spots in district’

Union minister and city MP Nitin Gadkari chaired a meeting of the newly formed district road safety committee at Vanamati. He directed the departments concerned to remove all accident prone spots from the district. It was informed that the district had 82 black spots or accident prone spots and corrective measures have been taken at 66 spots. Gadkari also asked the government agencies to take help of VNIT for improving faulty designs of traffic junctions, road dividers and traffic signals.

The MP is chairman of the committee and collector member secretary. Chief executive officer ZP, NMC commissioner, official from development agencies, all eight MLAs, sub-divisional officer, representatives from NGOs Janakrosh are members of the committee.

Visakhapatnam: Despite a ban on glass-coated manja, its sale and use is rampant across the city.

Many kite flyers and sellers STOI spoke to were unaware that nylon manja also called ‘Chinese dor’ is banned under Environment Protection Act, 1986 and as per National Green Tribunal and government orders passed by various states including Andhra Pradesh.

The kite flying tradition during Sankranti has become a bane for animals in the past few years with markets being flooded by synthetic manja. The nylon thread is dangerous not only to birds and animals, but even people are being injured by the razor-sharp glass-coated threads often not clearly visible to the eyes. A three-year-old boy from Guntur died after a manja got tangled around his throat, slitting it, while he was riding on his father’s bike on Monday.

Vivek Chevvakula, a CA final year student, who rescued a bleeding barn owl, said, “It was a victim of the killer manja. Its right wing including the bone had been cut off, making the bird unable to fly. After first-aid, I handed it over to Indira Gandhi Zoological Park .”

Unaware that sale of Chinese manja is a punishable offence that can attract a fines running into lakhs of rupees and even imprisonment, many sell plastic kites and synthetic manja.

Nylon manjas are priced between Rs 100 and Rs 200 depending on their quality. They are hard and sharp and therefore preferred by those competing in kite flying competitions. A shopkeeper from Alipuram said strong Chinese dor was needed to fly huge plastic kites as ordinary thread would not be able to support their weights.”

When contacted, DFO, north coastal Andhra Pradesh, C Selvam, said, “We are not aware if nylon manjas are being used in Vizag as we have not received any complaint, so far. However, we will send a team to ascertain if such glass-coated synthetic manjas are being sold in markets along beach road. Those who find injured birds may call the city zoo at 0891-2552081 for help.”

KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit amidst protests against the anti-Citizen Amendment Act was a challenge for both Kolkata Police and the central agencies, but, courtesy the special protection group (SPG) — that handled Modi’s programmes and movement — and Kolkata Police — that controlled the protests in the city — most of the day passed seamlessly.However, the situation changed dramatically in the city centre in the evening when cops tried to clear Dorina Crossing at Esplanade that was overrun by protesters. The situation soon spiralled out of hand and protesters squatted on the road, refusing to leave even after CM Mamata Banerjee’s pleas. A group of Jadavpur University students had earlier broken three police barricades to approach the Trinamool protest dais on RR Avenue.Apart from the traffic concerns here, the rest of the security issues were handled smoothly. “Just as we did not want the PM to be embarrassed during his engagements here, we also did not wish the protesters to feel disgruntled,” said an officer.Modi’s wish to stay at the Ramakrishna Mission headquarters at Belur left the security forces scurrying to make last-minute changes. While Kolkata Police’s river traffic unit was asked to step up patrolling, with the Indian Coast Guard taking the lead, Howrah City Police got support from Kolkata Police in deploying men at night. With Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary scheduled to be celebrated at Belur amidst thousands of devotees, the SPG has scaled up its presence in the area. All ferry services on the route were regulated from the evening and every narrow crossing between Dakshineswar Bridge and Belur Math was under watch.On Saturday, the challenge of negotiating with protesters near the airport and Kaikhali was practically nullified with the SPG opting for the chopper route to take the PM to RCGC. A students’ rally near Rabindra Sadan was rerouted through Shakespeare Sarani and Camac Street while supporters from both Left and Congress who had gathered outside Race Course were not allowed to go beyond the Vidyasagar Setu ramp.Modi’s 17-car convoy, which travelled to Old Currency Building and Millennium Park, led to cops “holding up” traffic for at least 45 minutes in advance. “We tried not to divert too many vehicles as that would have complicated the job. It was a Saturday, but we still had to run traffic in the CBD,” said an officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209467,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-723606,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/security-ring-insulates-pm-from-protests/articleshow/73208311.cms

Community holds a candlelight protest

Ahmedabad/Palanpur: Three persons named by the family members of the 19-year-old Dalit girl, who was found hanging in Sayra village near Modasa on January 5, were formally arrested after they surrendered before Modasa police on Saturday.

Police have also also seized the i20 car of the accused which cops believ had been used to allegedly kidnap the girl.

The trio — Bimal Bharwad, Darshan Bharwad and Jigar Parmar — arrested on Saturday, were among the four named by the girl’s family in the police complaint. They had accused the four of abduction, rape and murder.

“One of the accused, Satish Bharwad, is still absconding and we are searching for him,” said deputy superintendent of police, Aravalli, SS Gadhvi.

The development followed after cops recorded the statement of the deceased’s sister. She told the police that she had seen Bimal kidnapping her sister in the car from near Modasa bus stand on January 1. She further told the cops that when she confronted Bimal, he allegedly threatened to kill her and her family.

This is for the first time after the incident that the statements of the family members were recorded at Modasa rural police station.

The death of the girl had sparked a massive outrage among the Dalit community that have been protesting demanding immediate arrest of the accused since January 5.

Aravalli SP Mayur Patil said that they will be interrogating the accused to get details of their alleged crimes.

Earlier, the postmortem had ruled out gangrape and murder and prima facie it looked like the girl committed suicide. However, the cops are awaiting forensic report of the vaginal swab and blood examination to ascertain sexual assault.

A rally was also held by Dalit community members in Surendranagar on Friday, demanding handing over the probe to the state CID crime.

File pic of a worker removing waste from J K Lon hospital

JAIPUR: Following the deaths of over 100 kids at Kota’s J K Lon hospital, the authorities have shifted focus to sanitation and hygiene. The hospital has called private companies who are giving demonstrations of auto cleaning machines.

Officials evoked sharp criticism as the hospital attracted attention following deaths of children in the hospital. Hygiene and sanitation have been one of the major problems in the hospital.

“We have invited private companies and manufacturers who sale equipment for cleaning the hospital. They gave presentation and demo of the equipment. The procurement of the equipment will take some time as a process has to be followed which is according to the government’s norms,” Dr Suresh Dulara, medical superintendent, who took over the post, in December’s last week, told TOI.

However, deaths in the hospital still continue, though the mortality rate has gone down slightly. In January, 19 children have already died in the hospital till Saturday, said J K Lon Hospital authorities. However, they claimed that the mortality rate has gone down significantly in January so far in comparison to the mortality rate of children in the hospital in December.

Constructed on sprawling 40,000 square metre land, the hospital authorities are worried about the menace of langoors (monkeys) and stray dogs. Also, there are stains of paan or gutkha near stairs and also in the corners of corridors. The hospital is also strengthening measures for waste disposable.

AHMEDABAD: International Kite Festival-2020 held by the state tourism department and the flower show organized by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Sabarmati riverfront witnessed a heavy rush on Saturday bringing traffic to a halt for around three hours on the Riverfront Road and Ashram Road.

Traffic police officials said that improper and haphazard parking at various places by citizens who couldn’t park on riverfront caused the jam. Arrangements of the civic body were overwhelmed by the heavy crowd and the AMC’s vaunted parking management was found lacking pitifully. Needless to stay, the traffic police failed to regulate the incessant stream of vehicles.

Ajit Rajian, DCP traffic (West), said parking facilities were given nearly 500 metres away from the event venues, but many people chose to park haphazardly. Due to this, traffic jam occurred on Riverfront Road and the Ashram Road.

Rajian said a traffic jam is expected also on Sunday due to the rush for the kite festival and flower show. He said people should park their vehicles in the parking lot given by the AMC and should walk to the flower show and kite festival venues.

If you ask indie-folk musician Saby Singh, the era of independent music is finally upon us, having battled all kinds of odds. “It is the best time to be in the scene right now. People have never been so receptive. They know rock bands like The Local Train, Ankur (Tewari of Gully Boy fame) has literally millions of listeners on Spotify , and this is substantial in terms of where we come from - small cities, middle-class families with zero fancy networks,” says the Jammu-based singer-songwriter who recently completed a 22-city tour without a record label to back him.Saby’s optimism isn’t unfounded, as Barack Obama ’s favourite songs of the year list featuring Delhi-based singer-songwriter Prateek Kuhad showed. Though it isn’t just about Obama, this has been a long time coming. Depending on who you ask, the past decade has been leading up to this moment. First came YouTube which levelled the field for DIY artists who didn’t need a record label to produce and distribute music, and then a whole host of music festivals that couldn’t care less about (and which tend to turn their noses up at) Bollywood. In the last five years, independent music has been transformed by streaming platforms like Gaana, Spotify or Apple Music by, by allowing artists to expand their audience from the people who see them at shows or buy their CDs to basically anyone willing to listen (or anyone magical algorithms pull in the direction of a certain musician).Independent music in India means different things to different people. For some, it is artists with no record label or production company bankrolling their work. Yet others keep it simple – is it non-Bollywood? Cool, you’re in! Welcome to the club! The scene is also incredibly vast — from dream-pop duo Parekh and Singh, electronic music star Nucleya, Delhi-based Peter Cat Recording Co, to Hindi musicians who have taken over YouTube like Arjun Kanungo, Darshan Raval and music group Sanam (some of whom eventually made their way to Bollywood). That’s not even counting the various regional music scenes, primarily Punjabi independent music.Anirudh Voleti, a talent manager at boutique artist management agency Big Bad Wolf, who has managed acts like Pentagram, Swaratma, and for the last 18 months Kuhad, says that streaming has been a game-changer. “It’s become a lot easier for musicians to distribute their music, and for people to be able to consume it. People don’t have to go and torrent anymore, they can subscribe to a service that costs less than a cup of coffee now days,” he says.It’s allowed youngsters like Arjun Kanungo, who comes from a family with no musical background, to set up a recording studio at 18, and become a singing sensation by 29. Little wonder that the singer whose music videos get tens of millions of views on YouTube feels success is all about self-confidence. “If you believe in your own songs and you’re willing to go all in on yourself, then chances are you will have an impact,” says Kanungo who is committed to his indie roots even though Bollywood offers are pouring in.Pawan Agarwal, head of Music Content Partnerships (India & South Asia ), YouTube says there are a number of artists who have found their footing on the platform. Take for instance Vidya Vox, a musician with 6.4 million followers, and Gajendra Verma whose sonng Tera Ghata has a whopping 293mn views. “India’s hip-hop culture has also witnessed unprecedented growth, with independent artists like DIVINE, Naezy, Raftaar, and others making quite a loud bang locally.”The explosion of music festivals across the country has also played a huge role. From Magnetic Fields to Echoes of Earth to Spoken Word and Weekender, they give artists the opportunity to play to huge crowds. Tajdar Junaid, whose “therapeutic” new album ‘What Colour Is Your Raindrop’ has amassed almost 7.5 lakh streams on Spotify, agrees. He says, “For the longest time there was a trend of playing covers by international bands but more of them now explore who they are in essence and spirit.”For Chaitanya Kataria, longtime manager of rap artist DIVINE, hiphop is the one genre in Indian independent music that really has the ability to be marketable without becoming Bollywood-ised. With its close relationship to youth and urban culture, it’s easy to make brand deals with sneaker brands, or monetise the social media profiles of artists.For most indie artists, it’s still tough to make money purely on gigs and streaming, and that’s why the lure of Bollywood is ever-present. Pop artist Taba Chake, whose newest album has received 1 million streams on Spotify in just six months, says he wouldn’t mind singing and composing for Bollywood. “There are no rules, I compose, do film scores. I’m open to everything,” says the 27-year-old.",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73207598,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1581958,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/not-just-kuhad-indias-indie-music-scene-is-rocking/articleshow/73207587.cms

Rallies were organized across the city on Saturday

KOLKATA: Day-long protests by several groups and parties against PM Narendra Modi’s visit turned into a volatile confrontation between them and Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad activists at Esplanade on Saturday evening, forcing chief minister Mamata Banerjee to rush to Rani Rashmoni Avenue to control the situation.

Protests against the PM with chants of ‘Go back Modi’ started in Jadavpur, College Street, Kaikhali, Kidderpore and other parts of the city early on Saturday morning, long before Modi touched down around 4pm. As he boarded a chopper and headed for Race Course en route to Raj Bhavan, anger spilled over on the streets. A section of protesters blocked VIP Road near Kaikhali. Another group that had planned to wave black flags at the PM began chanting ‘Azadi’ slogans at Chinar Park.

While all the protests were directed at Modi till he reached Raj Bhavan, the mood of agitators began to change with slogans against Trinamool Congress after the CM met Modi at Raj Bhavan. The anti-Trinamool pitch turned even more shrill when the CM again joined Modi at a programme at Millennium Park after briefly addressing the Chhatra Parishad protesters at RR Avenue in the evening.

“CAA-CAA Chhee Chhee is actually Kachha Kachhi (The anti-CAA stance is posturing. Actually, the TMC and BJP are close),” said a protestor. Matters came to a head when police tried to evict the Left-led protesters from Dorina Crossing. Forced out, thousands headed to Rani Rashmoni Avenue, which Trinamool Chhatra Parishad had occupied since Friday evening.

As the enraged protesters broke through three barriers set up by police and threatened to over-run the depleted Chhatra Parishad platform, Banerjee, who was leaving Millennium Park, rushed to the spot and tried to defuse the situation. But her attempts to clarify why she had met Modi and that the government’s stance against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens hadn’t changed was drowned in the cacophony.

With the situation on the boil, police set up barricades leading to the city centre, enlarging the perimeter of road blocks that had earlier ring-fenced Raj Bhavan and maintained a safe distance between the VVIP guest and the protesters. The gridlock brought traffic in central Kolkata to a standstill with snarls up to Girish Park in the north and Theatre Road in the south.

At Esplanade, cops had set up a three-tier barricade even as several groups started assembling at 1pm. While some raised slogans against CAA and NRC , others sang protest songs. At the other end of the city, a minor scuffle broke out between cops and Left Front workers near airport gate 1 around 2.30 pm. A couple of kilometres away at Chinar Park, police blocked 500-odd protesters from advancing towards VIP Road.

Several groups, including political outfits and student unions, had planned rallies in the city to show black flags to the PM over CAA and NRC, but their plans were frustrated when Modi took the arial route. The protests foiled, the groups began to march towards Esplanade, converging there in a couple of hours. There, they chanted slogans and sang protest songs till the police eviction led to the charge towards RR Avenue.

Though the CM left the stage on RR Avenue around 9.45pm after addressing the gathering, protesters continued to occupy Esplanade and a huge contingent of police remained on standby.

NAGPUR: Increasing number of caesarean section deliveries is one of the most debatable subjects these days. Gynecologists are often blamed to carry the procedure even when it is not really necessary or indicated. On the other hand, many young women prefer to go for C-section to avoid labour pain and request doctors for surgical birth.

Clearing doubts on both the sides, Dr Jaydeep Tank, national secretary general of Federation of Obstetric & Gynaecological Societies of India ( FOGSI ) said that giving birth by natural way or going for caesarean section is a personal choice of would-be mothers and society should respect it with no prejudice. Dr Tank also refused the allegation on private doctors saying that no doctors go for surgical deliveries when it is not necessary.

“FOGSI has about 35,000 gynaecologists in India attached to it and we all follow Robson Classification, a global standard for assessing, monitoring and comparing caesarean sections. It’s wrong perception that doctors conduct C-sections even if not necessary,” he said.

According to him, more than 70% districts in the country have recorded low C-section rate. Surgical deliveries are more in urban areas because hospitals in cities are tertiary health care centres and serious cases from periphery are referred here.

Dr Tank said that if a woman asks for C-section delivery, it should be considered as a sign of empowered woman having her own choice. “Women should have a right of choice about how she wants to deliver the baby. Society should respect it,” he said.

Dr Tank was speaking with reporters on the backdrop of Masterclass Infertility IV — an academic event for infertility specialists organized by Femicare Foundation, Shrikhande Hospital and research centre and Nagpur Obstetric and Gynaecological Society (NOGS). Dr Shrikhande said that doctors from all over India are getting valuable academic tips from this event.

“Infertility has been one of the major challenges of new lifestyle. This Masterclass aims to convey to the people that every new technology and recent advances to deal with this problem are available in Nagpur. Infertility problems right from simple to complicated can be very well managed and treated in the city,” she said. NOGS President Dr Priyanka Kamble and Secretary Kshama Kedar were also present.

FOGSI to conduct menstrual awareness drive in Beed

Dr Jaydeep Tank also cleared FOGSI’s stand on mass hysterectomies of cane-cutting labour women in Beed district. The issue had got major media hype three months ago and local doctors were blamed for conducting unnecessary hysterectomies. “Cane cutting contractors do not hire women who menstruate. Due to this, these poor labour women ask for hysterectomies. Social awareness about menstruation is must in this area. FOGSI will lead mass awareness mission on it this year,” he said.

home sweet home: People teem Dwaraka bus station in city

Visakhapatnam: The transport department launched a special drive since January 2 against private buses which are fleecing passengers by charging excess fare than announced by the government.

Officials said private bus operators carry out this unfair practice throughout the year, but it increases during festive seasons like the Sankranti. “We are carrying out this drive at various places on the highway (NH16). We have already slapped cases against 72 operators and have seized over 25 buses,” a transport department official from Visakhapatnam said.

He added that most of the buses charging excess fares were coming from Vijayawada and Hyderabad. Some buses are also from the state’s northern-most district of Srikakulam. “These buses were charging over 20 to 30 per cent more than the specified fare. Because of Sankranti, there’s huge rush and demand for seats. Passengers are left with no option and are forced to book these high-priced seats. The bus operators are taking advantage of the situation,” the official added. The transport department has appealed to all passengers to lodge complaints if they find any bus operator charging more than the specified fare. “They can lodge a complaint with the transport department. They can also inform the nearest traffic cop if they find any discrepancies in the fare. We will take strict action against such operators,” said G Raja Ratnam, deputy transport commissioner in Visakhapatnam.

During Sankranti, which falls on January 15, locals who have migrated to other parts of AP or to other states come back to their native place for the festival. They again start returning to their workplaces from January 16. Transport officials said they would keep a strict vigil on private buses till the end of this month.

Meanwhile, APSRTC has decided to run additional services to various major destinations from the city till January 20 to clear the Sankranti rush. “We are operating around 250 additional buses from Visakhapatnam to other towns and cities in the state,” said an APSRTC official.

Visakhapatnam: In the wake of the state government announcing its plan to develop the city as the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh, the civic body here has stepped up efforts to redevelop the Port City’s beaches.

The beautification works which is expected to drum up tourist footfall by 20 per cent will be taken up using funds from World Bank.

Tenders for the revamp of RK Beach at a budget of Rs 109 crore and redevelopment of Kailasagir at an estimated cost of Rs 56 crore are still in the evaluation stage, but may be finalised soon.

As part of the project, a 1.5-km stretch along Bheemunipatnam or Bheemili beach will be given a makeover of Rs 33 crore. “Facilities such as drinking water, washrooms and sit outs among others will be provided along the stretch,” a Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) officer said. He added that the revamp would include soft landscaping apart from the construction of facilities.

Sources TOI spoke to said there were elaborate plans to use aesthetic landscaping to create a garden along Bheemili beach.

GVMC Commissioner G Srijana pointed out that the measures were being taken up keeping tourists in mind and the proposals of the civic body were currently being assessed for feasibility by the World Bank.

“If everything goes well, tenders will be called for the redevelopment of Bheemili beach very soon,” an official said. As per the proposal, works will be completed in 18 months. The civic body is also planning to beautify Rushikonda beach, Sagarnagar and Tenneti Park with a budget of Rs 70 crore.

An official with the engineering wing of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporationsaid that the redevelopment of other beaches would reduce congestion at RK beach. “Not only locals, but tourist too would visit other beaches if we can provide quality facilities. These measures are expected to enhance tourist footfall by another 20 per cent ,” he said.

Sunil Ambekar (RSS leader and former organisation secretary of ABVP)

NAGPUR: The trouble brewing at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is a leftist conspiracy against those who are working for the nation, said Sunil Ambekar , RSS leader and former organization secretary of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).

Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of an event organized to talk about his book on RSS, Ambekar said the ideology of people who take support of guns (referring to Naxalites) is harming JNU.

“I still say that you must not look at what is happening at JNU as right-wing versus left-wing. This is a struggle between those who love their country and those who want to break it up. There are hundreds of universities in the country and the unrest is happening only at a select few,” said Ambekar.

His book “The RSS roadmaps for the 21st century” was released last month at New Delhi by the organization’s chief Mohan Bhagwat. “This book will help people understand how RSS works and the way forward,” said Ambekar.

He said it is crucial to prepare a citizen who is capable of absorbing the best from different aspects of the society. “Technology is one such field where how to use it requires sound judgement by humans. And we all must ensure that the citizen is well prepared to make an informed decision,” said Ambekar.

He said the challenge before RSS now is a “positive” one. “I call it positive because now the task focuses on getting more and people together. Already, people are aware of the good work RSS is doing,” said Ambekar.

Talking about his book, he said, “I have heard from many people that there must be a book from someone inside the RSS who writes a detailed account. They said such a book was needed because a lot of misinformation was being spread about RSS.”

AHMEDABAD: In what could help reduce Gujarat and India’s dependence on foreign countries, the central government has cleared the decks for setting up dedicated parks for bulk drugs and medical devices in Gujarat. Although a leader in production of drug formulations, Gujarat is far behind states like Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in bulk drugs manufacturing.“The Scheme Steering Committee (SSC) operating under the department of pharmaceuticals (DoP) in the Union ministry of chemicals and fertilizers has agreed to provide funds for bulk drugs and medical devices parks in Gujarat,” confirmed H G Koshia, commissioner, Gujarat Food and Drug Control Administration (FDCA).The park for bulk drugs — also called active pharmaceuticals ingredients (APIs) — has been okayed for Bharuch. API is a key raw material used to manufacture drug formulations. The medical devices park will come up some 30km from Limdi towards Rajkot. “SSC offers financial assistance for creation of common facilities in an industrial park. Gujarat government’s proposal was accepted by SSC this week,” said Koshia, who was present during Gujarat government’s presentation to SSC.Gujarat will get funds to the tune of Rs 200 crore for bulk drugs park and Rs 25-50 crore for the medical devices park. Detailed project reports for the same will now be submitted.“Gujarat is already a top state in pharmaceutical production. These parks will further encourage production of bulk drugs and medical devices, for which we are very much dependent on the global market,” Koshia added.“The cost of production comes down due to usage of common facilities in a park and local players can become price-competitive globally,” Koshia said.More importantly, these parks will help reduce growing dependence of Indian pharma firms on Chinese bulk drugs. Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) data reveals that China accounted for 68% (Rs 17,263 crore) of India’s total bulk drugs and intermediates imports worth Rs 25,552 crore in 2018-19. Overall, India's dependence on imports has gone up by 23% from 2016-17 to 2018-19. Similarly, around 60% of medical devices in India are imported.“There is a buzz in the market that the central government is planning to streamline procedure for obtaining environment clearance by API units. In this backdrop, approval to bulk drugs park will further provide impetus to API production in the state. It will also help reduce our dependence on Chinese imports,” said Viranchi Shah, chairman, Gujarat State Board, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA).Similarly, around 60% requirement for medical devices is met through imports. Previously, Gujarat government had planned a medical devices park at Sanand and land was also earmarked. However, the common facilities could not be developed, said sources privy to the information. The government of India has asked the state government to earmark 750-1,000 acres land for bulk drugs parks. Around 250 acres of land has already been provisioned for the medical devices park.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73212095,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-528918,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/boost-for-bulk-drugs-medical-devices-as-two-dedicated-parks-approved/articleshow/73209054.cms

AGRA: Agra police on Saturday lathi-charged members of National Students Union of India (NSUI) and Samajwadi Chatra Sabha (SCS) on the campus of Agra university while the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists, who were also protesting, were reportedly not touched. NSUI state coordinator Ankush Gautam was badly injured and fell unconscious.

On Saturday afternoon, ABVP activists had gathered at the Paliwal Park campus of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University to stage protest against the recent violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and demanding a ban on the left-wing organizations on the campus.

Later, NSUI and SCS members gathered to counter the ABVP. Both the sides indulged in high-pitch sloganeering against each other for over 40 minutes. Some of the ABVP and NSUI indulged in a scuffle after which “police started abusing and beating NSUI and SCS workers”.

The lathi-charge took place in the presence of city magistrate Arun Kumar Yadav. NSUI workers alleged that station house officer of Hariparwat Ajay Kaushal was the first one to target them. “Later other policemen also joined him while city magistrate remained watching the entire incident,” the NSUI members alleged.

City magistrate Arun Kumar Yadav, however, told TOI, “After taking memorandum from both ABVP and NSUI members, all the protesters who had gathered on the varsity campus in violation of CrPC’s section 144 were asked to leave. Later, ABVP activists left the campus, but NSUI and SCS members started creating a scene. Even after repeated warnings, they were not ready to leave the campus. Therefore, police had to use force against them.”

Saurav Dixit, additional superintendent of police, said, “Four NSUI members were taken to hospital for medical check-up while a case has been registered against 30-40 unknown protesters associated with ABVP, NSUI and SCS for rioting, voluntary causing assault and breach of peace. They are being identified. On basis of the available evidence, suitable action will be taken.”

NSUI spokesperson Apoorv Sharma said, “The police and administration are biased in favour of ABVP. Our workers were mercilessly beaten by police for countering ABVP in a peaceful manner. We will move court against the police action.”

About 65 students studied the traffic situation and the flow of vehicles at the junctions in three time slots ... Read More

NASHIK: Lack of synchronisation of traffic signals, improper location of bus stands or rickshaw stands, crooked zebra crossings, improper size of traffic islands and impediments for free left at junctions are among the many problems faced by commuters at most junctions in the city.

These findings were put forth by the students of NDMVP Samajs College of Architecture after they conducted a detailed survey of 85 major junctions in the city. The survey was conducted after commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre-Patil approached the architecture students with a proposal on December 5.

During the meeting with the students, the commissioner directed them to study several junctions in the city and come up with ideas to manage traffic flow at these junctions. As discussed, the students conducted a survey and submitted the findings on January 7.

About 65 students studied the traffic situation and the flow of vehicles at the junctions in three time slots — morning, afternoon and evening — and noted down the information based on various parameters including the flow of traffic, condition of road dividers, locations of signals, signboards and the information on them, location of rickshaw and bus stands, the size of traffic signals, number of trees in the area and any other things that hampered free flow of traffic.

The students then sought the help of their professors to make a photographic documentation of their findings with Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping and suggested various ways and means for free flow of traffic.

Prajakta Baste, principal of NDMVP Samaj’s College of Architecture, said, “Being locals, the bonding of students with the city is unique. As citizens and architects, they developed a natural interest in the subject and they worked with zeal for over a month to come out with their solutions to do away with the congestion at traffic junctions.”

The experiment also helped the students to get an exposure of practical issues and experience working with concerned authorities and prepare for their subjects of Research in Architecture and Urban Design.

Deputy commissioner of police Pournima Chaugule said, “Police often take up measures to reduce traffic congestion , control vehicular traffic and prevent accidents. However, a study from traffic angle was the only thing missing. With over 100 junctions in the city and every place having its own set of problems, the study and findings by these architecture students and the suggestions made by them could prove to be of great help to traffic police.”

Meanwhile, the city police along with the traffic police are visiting the junctions studied by students to check if their suggestions are feasible and can be implemented. The places where the suggestions do not seem feasible, the architecture students, who are joining police in their inspection visits, are providing them with other alternatives to do away with the vehicular congestion.

Rayid Ali | 18 years

In the next elections, Rayid will among the many first-time voters standing in queue to exercise their electoral right. And when he does, the engineering student feels, he’ll be well equipped to make the right choice. Reason: his decision to make himself politically aware and associate with forums that discuss public policy. “Until sometime ago, I was ignorant about the political system. Even when conversations around NRC started, from Assam, I read news articles but didn’t react. Then, as more material started getting circulated through social media, I decided to study about it,” said Rayid, speaking about how the rallies that he participated in, subsequently, helped him gain a better perspective on the issue. “I realised the power of youth. I also understood how it is important for people like me to be politically aware because the choices we make today, will impact our future,” he added.

Aditi Chandra | 19 years

Soon after the JNU attack last Sunday, Aditi created a piece of art that got her parents worried. It was clearly anti-establishment and depicted how JNU’s freedom, to voice dissent, was under threat. But that didn’t deter her from circulating her work on social media or joining every ‘I support JNU’ rally organised in the city, thereafter. “The youth today have tremendous power and we have to use it if we want our present and our future to be better,” said the artist-cum-photographer, adding, “Art can make a huge impact.” She’s a proud member of the queer community, whose journey with politics began from the pride marches that ultimately led to the Supreme Court decriminalising gay sex by consenting abolishing Section 377. In the more recent students’ movement unfolding across India, Aditi has been an active member despite her “privileges”. “The CAA or the NRC might not impact me directly. Yet, I feel it is necessary for me to lend my voice to the protests,” Aditi said.

Abdus Sami | 20 years

Abdus Sami understands that youth is the biggest asset for a developing country. “So, I thought it was important for me to support issues that I feel strongly about,” Abdus said, referring to his decision to join the protests against CAA and NRC. “While I have been part of conversations on Triple Talaq Bill, Article 370 and mob-lynching, I wasn’t actively involved in political rallies or gatherings before. When CAA was passed, I decided to speak up,” said the BSc (biotechnology) student, confessing that his faith played an important role in his decision. “It affects people like me because we practice a certain religion,” he added. While Abdus believes that people of his generation do not differentiate between each other based on religion, he feels that many continue to be detached from what is happening in the country. “As long as it doesn’t impact them, they want to steer clear of politics. This attitude must change,” he said.

Gargi Mondal | 20 years

After rallying for various issues on campus over the last two years, Gargi is certain about one thing: if the youth throw their weight behind a case and fight for it consistently, it is sure to yield results. And that has been driving her to participate in every demonstration organised on issues that she thinks is “unfair and unjust” to one or many sections of society. And while, at times, people, chose not to take her seriously because of her age, she says it is never a deterrent. “When I was the student representative on the Gender Sensitization Committee against Sexual Harassment on campus, people were dismissive of me sometimes. But I made sure that I was heard,” the student of Hyderabad Central University said. But isn’t she scared of backlash? “That fear is one reason why many people my age chooses to take the neutral path. But I am not scared,” she said.

Meghna | 19 years

Until 2018, Meghna was another schoolgirl whose life revolved around textbooks and examinations. But when she came to Hyderabad, to pursue her graduation, she was exposed to a world of politics, she never knew existed. Today, she’s is at the forefront of many demonstrations and isn’t scared to raise her voice against matters that do not align with her beliefs. “But before I dived into the protests, I studied it well and understood how it’ll work,” said Meghna, sharing her concerns with CAA and NRC. “It fails to take into account various communities. The transgender community is one such example. It is very difficult for them to establish their identity and gather necessary documentation,” she added. Speaking about her decision to stand in solidarity with students of JNU, Jamia Millia or Aligarh Muslim University, she said: “It is important to protect such spaces as they allow people to speak their mind.” Appealing to more people her age to become politically aware, she said that it was necessary so that the youth can choose their leaders wisely.

Khalid Rahman| 18 years

Want to connect with a Member of Parliament about an issue bothering you? The mpConnect mobile app might be a good idea. And it isn’t designed or handled by any political party. It’s a neutral platform created by Khalid, a BBA student from a city college. “Everything in our lives today is connected to politics – be it getting our neighbourhood road fixed or finding a job,” said the teenager, adding, “My objective, through this app, is to bridge the gap between politicians and the common people.” While the app was designed a few years ago, Khalid decided to update it and relaunch recently. “People have varying views on what is going on around them and are seeking ways to convey them to the authorities. This app is relevant in current times,” Khalid said. But this app isn’t the teenager’s first political endeavour. During the 2019 general elections he created a website, www.loksabhaelections.com, to enable voters to examine poll results. “I turned to my father and uncle for technical support, but the idea was mine,” he said, agreeing with the need for more young voices in the political space.

BAREILLY: Suspended station house officer (SHO) of Bhuta police station inspector Rajveer Parmar and a sub-inspector, Harikesh, were declared absconders by senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shailesh Kumar Pandey, following the directions of deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Rajesh Pandey.

Both officers were suspended after a departmental inquiry found them accused of accepting a bribe of Rs 1.82 lakh for releasing a truck driver transporting illicit liquor.

According to police, Bhuta police had on October 14 impounded a liquor-laden truck that was on its way to Bihar from Chandigarh. “The truck driver was let-off by the then SHO Pramar and SI Harikesh after the money was transacted into the bank account of one of Parmar’s relatives online,” said police.

When the truck entered Pilibhit district , police stopped the vehicle again and the driver told Pilibhit police that he had already paid the money to Bhuta SHO for nonstop movement,” said police.

Pilibhit police, however, arrested the driver and informed SP Abhishek Dikshit about the driver’s claim. Dikshit, in turn, informed DIG Pandey, who sought a report in this connection from the Bareilly SSP.

“During the investigation, we found inspector Parmar and SI Harikesh guilty of accepting the bribe from the truck driver. They were suspended and an FIR was registered against them. Since they did not report me despite an order issued to them, both were declared absconders. Soon, they will be arrested and sent to jail,” said SSP Pandey.

AGRA: Two days before the Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) reopens, vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor has written an “urgent” letter to the district police chief expressing apprehensions of threat to his life by “anti-social and lumpen elements”, and demanded appropriate security for himself.

In the letter, the VC wrote, “The university is opening on January 13 and these anti-social and lumpen elements may try to create law and order issues and may also attempt to harm me and my family members and may also instigate others by labelling me as member of RSS/BJP and supporter of CAA.”

“If these lumpen elements are not controlled and if any untoward incident occur, it will have a cascading and spiralling effect across the nation because AMU is a sensitive national institution,” the VC wrote.

Confirming that he has received the letter, DIG Akash Kulhary said that extra security will be provided to the AMU VC and registrar.

“Internal security audit is also being conducted by us to assess what kind of security mechanism is required inside the campus to strengthen their security standards,” said the DIG.

Kulhary said that force will be deployed at the VC’s lodge, administrative block and registrar’s office on the opening of the university.

Meanwhile, AMU students issued a statement, saying that the VC’s claim of security threat is “misplaced and ridiculous”. The students said that the VC has “no threat from AMU students, who have been peacefully protesting against CAA-NRC from December 8 and will continue with non-violent protests”.

Spokesperson of the varsity, Shafey Kidwai said that the VC did not say anything about students. He has categorically mentioned anti-social elements.

Vice-chancellor Prof Mansoor said that the university administration will meet senior students along with provosts and senior teachers to redress all their grievances.

AGRA: Commenting on Delhi Police booking JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh for violence on the campus, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav launched a scathing attack on the central government, which controls the national capital’s police force, saying it was typical of “how BJP works”.

“Group of people wearing masks armed with rods and sticks barge into the university, assault students and teachers, but Delhi Police who reports to Centre, booked the injured JNUSU president, Aishe Ghosh. That’s how BJP works,” said the Samajwadi Party president.

He was in Firozabad on Saturday where he visited the families of those who were killed in the December 20 anti-CAA violence.

“The BJP government in UP and the administration is responsible for the violence during anti-CAA stir. Innocent men were killed. In Firozabad, six lives were lost. Till date, the families of deceased victims have not received autopsy reports. We want to know the reason behind the delay. Why wasn’t violence reported in non-BJP ruled states? Millions of protesters marched in Hyderabad, and Mumbai, but not a single incident of even scuffle was reported. We demand that a sitting judge of HC or SC must probe the killings of UP residents,” said Akhilesh Yadav, who represents Azamgarh in Lok Sabha.

Maintaining that the citizenship amendment law was not needed at all, Yadav said, “There is no need for CAA, NPR or NRC, when the government has biometric information of 125 crore people in the form of Aadhaar.”

Yadav said that if voted to power, his government will withdraw all riot cases related to anti-CAA stir. “CM Yogi Adityanath has taught us that even riot cases can be withdrawn. If our government came to power, innocent and poor will be provided justice,”he said.

Speaking on the Friday night’s Kannauj accident which killed over a dozen and injured many more after a private bus collided with a truck, Akhilesh said, “Every victim should be compensated Rs 10 lakh and not a penny less. In our tenure, we had planned to build a fire brigade station at the location close to accident spot, but Yogi government dropped that idea. Had the government executed our plan, many lives could have been saved with quick response from the fire tender service.”

BAREILLY: At least five trains on the Delhi-Lucknow route were delayed after a sand-laden tractor-trolley overturned at a level crossing between Rasuiya and Cantt railway stations on Saturday morning, hitting the rail traffic.

According to railway officials, the alert loco pilot of a goods train averted a major accident by applying emergency breaks soon after spotting the tractor-trolley. The engine, however, hit the trolley and it overturned.

Bareilly Junction station superintendent Satyaveer Singh said due to the blocked, at least five trains were halted at Bareilly Junction, Rusaiya and Cantt stations.

Cantt station master Shambu Kumar said the accident took place at the Palpur-Kamalpur unmanned level crossing when a tractor-trolley was crossing the tracks. Seeing the tractor-trolley on the tracks, the loco pilot blew the horn, but the tractor driver couldn’t move the vehicle forward.

“The train was running at the speed of 60 kmph when the loco pilot applied the emergency brake, but the engine hit the trolley and it was delinked from the tractor. And as soon as the tractor was detached from the trolley, the driver fled the spot with his vehicle, but the trolley remained overturned on the tracks,” said Kumar.

Meanwhile, the government railway police reached the spot and cleared the tracks with the help of local villagers. “We have cleared the track by 10.55am,” he said.

The trains were halted are Rajyarani Express (down), Triveni Express (up and down), Bareilly Express and Varanasi-Bareilly Express.

RTO working on seven day enforcement plan

BAREILLY: The Regional Transport Office (RTO) and traffic police department kick-started a week-long “road safety drive” in the city with a motorcycle rally. Some 300 policemen on motorcycles were flagged off from Transport office and ended the rally at Satellite crossing. The road safety drive , to sensitize vehicle users of traffic rules and check violations , is to be observed across the state.

Officials at the RTO said every year, the second or third week of January is observed as “road safety week”. “We have launched a special drive which will continue till January 17. During the period, camps will be set up at public places across the city to sensitize drivers/commuters of adhering to traffic norms. Commuters will also be checked for violation of traffic rules. Free eye checkup camps will also be set up near bus stands for examining the eyesight of public transport drivers.

Speaking with TOI, senior assistant regional transport officer (ARTO), Bareilly , RP Singh said, “During the seven-day drive, awareness camps in parts of city will be organized and road users will be made aware of traffic regulations and penalties that will be imposed on violation of rules. Locals will also be informed about the importance of following traffic rules and safety measures that should be taken while on the road. For convenience of public transport drivers and to ensure security of passengers traveling in public vehicles, an eye checkup camp will also be set up at Satellite bus station, where drivers of UPSRTC and of other public transport vehicles -- autorickshaws and tempos -- will be able to get their eye-sight examined free of cost.”

The ARTO added, “The aim is to make drivers aware of their eye problems, which most of them ignore. Drivers who visit will also be sensitized about the adverse impact of weak or poor eyesight if not treated in time. Doctors from the district hospital and Rohilkhand Medical College will be examaining the eyesight. This is the 31st ‘road safety week’ being observed in Bareilly.”

Officials said similar camps will be organized during the week and pamphlets displaying traffic rules will also be distributed among people.

BAREILLY: Sun shine on Saturday brought some relief to residents here from the biting cold that had gripped the city after the recent spell of hailstorm and rainfall. A sunny afternoon accompanied by cold winds that blew across the city proved to make the day a pleasant one for residents.

However, the morning was very cold with minimum temperature dipping to 7.0 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature was recorded at 14.0 degrees Celsius. The meteorological department has predicted similar temperatures with moderate fog for the next couple of days. The weather forecast said there would be no significant change in the conditions during the next 48 hours. However, temperatures are likely to rise by a couple of degrees after January 14.

According to the Met departmental sources, both minimum and maximum temperatures rose slightly on Saturday. The minimum temperature was recorded at 7.0 degrees on Saturday against 6.3 degrees Celsius on Friday. The maximum temperature was recorded at 14.0 degrees Celsius against 12.9 degrees Celsius recorded the previous day.

Despite slight increase in temperatures, a cold wind swept the city throughout the day. The cold but pleasant weather enabled locals to step out of their homes to bask in the sun in parks, gardens and other public places. As a result, city parks were seen teeming with residents. Some laid out mattresses in the gardens and took an afternoon nap while children enjoyed themselves playing in the sun.

Ravi Kant, a resident of Jagatpur at CI Park, Premnagar, said, “Though there was a chill in the air, the sun shone in the afternoon making it pleasant. Therefore, I decided to go to the park and soak in the sun. The sun was shining after quite long time and I am hope there is a very thin or no fog in the evening as well.”

Elsewhere at Gandhi Udyan in Civil Lines area, children accompanied by their parents enjoyed the day, playing games in the sunny afternoon. “As Saturday was a school holiday, we decided to take our children to the park and spend some time there,” said Vineeta Shukla, a resident of Nakatiya.

Retired assistant professor, geography department, Bareilly College, Neeru Agarwal told TOI, “The slight change in intense weather and relief from foggy conditions is due to a change in wind pattern as western disturbance is approaching the northern hills.”

The Met department has predicted moderate fog till January 14 and possibility of light rainfall thereafter. The maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to hover around 16 degrees Celsius and 7 degrees Celsius, respectively for the next couple of days.

NASHIK: Yogita Wagh and Rohit Yadav bagged ace positions in the first-ever 10,000-metre race organised as part of the 18th edition of the Nashik Run .

Since 2003, the Nashik Run Charitable Institution in Nashik city has been organising the event to draw contributions from citizens for charity work aimed at improving conditions of the poor in the district. The run has been limited to 4.5 km, but it is for the first time a 10K run was organised. The Nashik Run is organised on the second Saturday of January every year. This weekend, the run started at 6.30am from the Mahatma Nagar Cricket Ground, Nashik.

Scores of people participated with citizens from the various walks of life and age groups running the 4.5 km event.

Runners made their way through Mahatma Nagar, Jehan Circle, Swami Samarth Chowk, Nand Sweets, Bhonasala Chowk and then back to Mahatma Nagar.

“It is fun to participate in the 4.5K run as it is not the race event. We can stick together as a family for the run,” said 8-year-old Saini Shah who took part along with her parents.

Another young student, Sanket Yadav — a Class VIII student at an NMC school — said he was running for a cause. “I want others to contribute too — at least for personal health,” Sanket, who took part with his elder brother, said.

Enthusiasm was high among participants. “It is good to see many people running together and caring for each other. I must thank the organisers who started the event in 2003. I have taken part in all of them,” Shalini Jadhav, a 59-year-old medical practitioner, said.

Police commissioner Vishwas Nangre-Patil, mayor Satish Kulkarni and several other officials were also part of the event.

Among the competitors, Yogita Wagh, Disha Borse, Nivrutti Dhawad bagged the top three positions in the women’s 15-35 years age group. Rohit Yadav, Sunit Kumar and Ravi Kumar were the first three finishers in the men’s category.

Ashwini Dore, Nitu Singh, Neeta Narang bagged honours in the 36-50 years age category, while Savliram Shinde, Santosh Wagh and Nandu Ugle won the top positions in the men’s group.

362,['12/01/2020'],Karnataka: New government medical colleges may be under PPP model,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: The upcoming government-sponsored medical colleges are likely to be under Private-Public Partnership (PPP). This was discussed at the first meeting with NITI Aayog members to define the process here on Saturday.

The plan is to invite private medical colleges to work with the government and strengthen government hospitals and overcome staff shortage.

“There are 14 districts in Karnataka which don’t have medical colleges, but have government district hospitals. There is scope for starting medical colleges there so that hospitals also benefit,” said officials.

Officials of the health & family welfare and medical education departments were present at the meeting where private medical college managements and entrepreneurs discussed the PPP model .

NITI Aayog wants to build 75 district hospitals across the country under the PPP model. The partnership will differ from case to case, depending on land ownership, infrastructure and hospital. The final list of chosen districts will be published by NITI Aayog in February.

“Educational institutions with experience in running medical colleges, that have run medical colleges with at least 150-200 beds can be given the opportunity to establish medical college in these districts by using existing government hospitals. Detailed discussions are yet to be held,” sources said.

Medical education minister and deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan said the move is to encourage private institutions to work with the government. “Through the PPP model, the hospital running cost can be reduced for the government. We can overcome staff shortage, specialists’ posts get filled, and district hospitals can bring in superspecialties,” he said. He did not specify the modalities and number of medical colleges that will be built under PP model.

Sources said Ramanagara district where RGUHS wanted to build a medical college is likely to be considered for this model. But, Dr S Sacchidanand, VC, RGUHS, said no such matter was discussed. “Currently, status quo is maintained at the project of the university in Ramanagar,” he said.

The move has raised concerns about fee structure in colleges under PPP model, sharing of seats between government and private management and cost of treatment in the hospital connected to the college.

MYSURU: Several schools in Tamil Nadu, Kerala, UP, MP, Rajasthan and one in Nanjangud have been painted like trains but students of the Railway Colony Primary School in Mysuru city have the real deal.Employees of the South Western Railway workshop in Ashokapuram have refurbished two condemned coaches into classrooms and donated them to the government school. The ‘Nali Kali’ (joyful learning) coaches were inaugurated on Saturday.The workshop employees volunteered to rehaul and paint the coaches while several items, like fans and panels, were sourced from other wagons. “We spent a total of Rs 50,000. It was a collective idea of the workshop employees and carried out as part of corporate social responsibility. Majority of the children studying in this school are from families below the poverty line,” said chief workshop manager P Srinivasu.The government school, sanctioned over two decades ago, does not have a building of its own and has been functioning from railway department buildings on the workshop premises. The railway department charges no rent and has added facilities over the years. Scores of children have, in fact, studied up to Class 10 here and delivered good results. The coaches will be an added encouragement for students and the teachers, railway staff said.“These coaches have been fully refurbished. They have fans and adequate lighting to provide a comfortable learning environment for the students. Two bio-toilets have also been provided. One coach will serve as a classroom for classes 4 and 5, and have been fitted with teaching aids. Another will be an activity hall for all students,” Srinivasu said. The exteriors, painted a rich lavender shade, depict ecological themes.The coaches were inaugurated by Ajay Kumar Singh, general manager of SWR at Hubballi and Sujatha Singh, president of SWR Women’s Organisation.",mysuru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73210224,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-893754,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mysuru/rlys-class-act-mysuru-govt-school-gets-wagonrooms/articleshow/73207580.cms

NEW DELHI: Sandwiched between the high-rise buildings of Nehru Place and a long belt of slums and JJ camps , the 1.8 lakh voters of Kalkaji assembly constituency are as diverse as the devotees of the 18th century shrine of Goddess Kalka from which the locality derives its name. What makes this south-east Delhi contest interesting is the even distribution of Punjabi refugee families who arrived after Partition and slum-dwellers and economically marginalised groups from the Poorvanchal region and West Bengal.The demographic diversity means the concerns of the electorate also vary from one region to another. Middle-class contentions about road infrastructure, traffic congestion, parking woes and anxieties about business premises being sealed dominate the discourse in Kalkaji, Maharani Bagh and Sukhdev Vihar. Deepak Singh, 28, a property dealer, complained about vehicular proliferation, poor road maintenance and neglected parking infrastructure. “Kalkaji is a nightmare with just one parking facility near the main market. Road congestion has definitely diminished the quality of life,” he said.More than 40% of the voters in Kalkaji area are Partition refugees and are characteristically referred to as ‘double-storeywalas’ because of the structures of the houses allocated to them in the 1950s. Most of them are today entrepreneurs working as retailers, auto-parts sellers, daily goods suppliers and garment shop owners. The BJP-Shiromani Akali Dal combine is expected to rely heaving on this urban voter base. The alliance did cash in on this when winning two of the three municipal wards of the constituency in 2017, leaving one to Congress. The assembly seat, however, went to AAP in 2015.Jogeshwar Yadav, a resident of West Friends Colony, complained that while the area got a Delhi Metro station for improved transportation, last mile connectivity was not up to the mark. “The Gramin Sewa vans only add to the problem. It is not safe for women to walk during the night,” Yadav said.In nearby Sriniwaspuri, with its low-lying neighbourhoods, poor drainage is a major issue. The residents grumbled that during rains, the streets turn into pools of murky water. “Unplanned growth and construction have narrowed the main streets, and there is no outfall for the water,” said Lalit Verma, a Sriniwaspuri resident.The other key voting group — slum dwellers — live in the more than 25 slum clusters, the major ones being Priyanka Camp, Gandhi Camp, Nehru Camp, Bhumiheen Camp, Navjeewan Camp and Karpoori Thakur Camp. These were traditionally strongholds of Congress until AAP swept the elections in 2015 and dethroned the sitting Congress MLA, Subhash Chopra, now the party chief, who had romped home in 1998, 2003 and 2008 assembly elections, having received more than 50% of the votes on each occasion.Congress hopes to revive its roots in these places, where EWS flats were allocated to relocated slum dwellers during former CM Sheila Dikshit's tenure. However, many complain about unfulfilled promises and less than salubrious conditions, such as the sanitation disaster, open drains and the need to pay bribes for putting up business stalls.The people also have not forgotten about the in-situ slum development announced in 2009 but never implemented. Adhir Chand Rai, 79, said only the foundation stones were laid before the elections but nobody got any flat. “These promises are made before every poll,” shrugged Rai, pointing to the granite foundation stone at Bhumiheen Camp. Rai, however, conceded that water supply lines, which earlier reached only the DDA flats there, have now entered the narrow lanes of the JJ camp.AAP registers a strong presence in these localities. Shopkeeper Pramod Mandal, 42, brightly said that 99% of the colony household had not been required to pay the electricity bill after AAP’s free power scheme was implemented. “Conditions aren’t too good here,” he said, “but some progress has been made, and the poor don’t really expect much.”",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73210424,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-814633,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/varied-voter-base-holds-hope-for-the-primary-contenders/articleshow/73209109.cms
365,['12/01/2020'],What should SCB do to improve its Swachh ranking?,"This story is from January 12, 2020

With SCB attributing low Swachh rank to failure in uploading relevant reports, TOI asked readers what should be done to avoid this in the future.

It was appalling to see Secunderabad Cantonment Board at the bottom of the Swachh Survekshan ranking. It is time to get authorities and citizens on the same platform and work towards achieving a cleaner Cantonment. We should have green drives and cleanliness campaign across all wards. Each ward should have a designated team with officials as well as residents who will monitor the cleanliness of the area . The ward members should make it a point to review work that has been designated. Overall involvement of all citizens is absolutely necessary. Schools under SCB limits should have cleanliness programs twice a year under the aegis of SCB. Elected members should make it a point to visit and guide them. Schools and colleges should contribute to the cause by making students environment-aware. Dustbins at various places should be installed so that people use them most and set an example too. Small effective changes are needed to see the change we wish to see.

- Deepesh Surana

With heaps of garbage on roads and footpaths, overflowing drains and uncleared construction debris still a common site in many lanes and bylanes under the SCB jurisdiction, civic authorities coming out with a lame excuse that reports relating to sanitation duties could not be uploaded due to preoccupation in other activities is unconvincing and totally unacceptable. In fact, civic officials failing to meet the parameters relating to swachh is the reason for the second largest cantonment relegated to 62nd position. SCB authorities urgently need to awaken the lax officials to ensure that garbage is lifted from bins on a day to day basis, roads in every lane are swept daily. A special cell needs to be set up to monitor and review that tasks are regularly carried out without interruptions. Surveillance cameras need to be installed in every lane to detect and stop anyone from dumping garbage on the road. Health and sanitary wing of SCB must act quickly to plug leakages. In addition, SCB officials should bring about an awareness in residents by educating them not to throw waste on roads. Similarly, ensure that visitors to parks do not litter the place.

- K.R.Srinivasan

It was interesting to read that SCB officials have not uploaded the needed documents that would be considered for the Swachh ranking . Though SCB officials have taken the blame, The excuses given by the SCB officials appears to be silly and it exposes their lackadaisical attitude. With all the digitalisation, these documents can be uploaded in a few minutes. Clearly, there is a lack of interest. SCB has failed to keep the city clean and has allowed malls and big structures to come up without providing adequate infrastructure, keeping in view the massive haphazard growth. To get a better rank, roads need to be cleaned, the debris should be removed, street lights and CCTV cameras need to be installed. RWAs should be involved in the upkeep of colonies and they must be supported by GHMC. Incentives should be provided to colonies to improve their performance.

- GV Kumar

The SCB’s response that the low rank was due to failure in uploading documents is like a child saying her pet dog ate her homework. The SCB has clearly failed to perform the civic duties and this has translated to SCB being on the 62nd position. Instead of passing the buck, officials would do well to focus on improving the rank. They should interact with citizens and find out what is needed to improve the situation.

366,['12/01/2020'],"Removing 70,000 tonnes debris in 60 days may be a tall ask","This story is from January 12, 2020

Kochi: On paper, it all seems fine. The authorities claim that debris removal will be completed in 60 days -- they have 20 trucks that will be making 15 trips daily with concrete debris from the four demolished apartment complexes at Maradu to the two stock yards at Aroor and Chandiroor, 8 to 13 km from the sites respectively.

But a reality check indicates that narrow roads, traffic bottlenecks, peak-hour traffic, toll booths and the notorious gridlock at the under-construction Kundanoor flyover could scupper the best-laid plans.

The initial obstacle that trucks from Alfa Serene would face in terms of traffic will be the first 1.5 kilometres where the vehicles will have to make at least six sharp turns through narrow roads that are already in a bad shape before reaching NH 66 to head towards Aroor. “The inner roads are bad and our worry is that the water pipes under the roads would break with loaded trucks plying over it, slowing down traffic further,” said Disha Prathapan, municipal councillor from the ward where Alfa Serene is located.

Traffic police said that the bottleneck at Kundanoor would become an issue for trucks plying from Golden Kayaloram and H20 Holy Faith to the yards. Trucks leaving H2O Holy Faith can enter the highway through byroads to skip Kundanoor junction, but sources with the contractor removing the debris said that the trucks would prefer going through the highway as moving through pocket-roads which pass through residential areas could lead to opposition from residents, especially during night.

Debris from the other two buildings can be transported without touching Kundanoor. Trucks with debris from Jains Coral Cove can reach NH 66 bypassing Kundanoor traffic bottleneck after covering about 700 meters through Moothedam Road.

Apart from the traffic and roads, timing would be another matter of concern, as the trucks will not be able to ply between 8 to 9.30 am and 3 pm to 4.30 pm, when there is a ban in place for trucks as it is the time when students are commuting to and from schools.

PD Sunil Babu, a senior road safety expert said that it wouldn’t be a smooth ride through the highway even during non-peak hours. “Even if we take the time between, like from 9.30 am to 3 pm, there would still be traffic on the highway. Even after 4.30 pm, there will be rush at least till 7.30 pm. So ideally, the transportation should happen in the night,” said Babu.

The vehicles will also undergo checking by authorities. Ernakulam RTO Manoj Kumar said that the motor vehicle department would strictly monitor the transportation. “We would check if the trucks are properly covered. Also, we would check if the load carried by these trucks exceeds permissible limits,” the RTO said.

Despite all this, Prompt Enterprises, the official contractor for removing the debris, is confident that they can remove the 70,000 tonnes much ahead of the 60-day deadline, if the demolition team completes removal of steel from the debris on time. “If everything goes as planned, a total of 300 trips (15 trucks x 20 trips) will happen daily and around 3,900 tonnes (300x13) of debris will be removed each day to the two yards each in Aroor and Chandiroor. If so, 70,000 tonnes can be mathematically removed in 18 days, which is less than half of the time allotted as per the contract. Even if there is delay, the work will be completed much ahead of the deadline,” said Anwar R, one of the directors of Prompt Enterprises.

However, only time will tell if the plan would be actually possible especially considering the obstacles and restrictions the process is certainly going to encounter.

The residents grumbled that during rains, the streets turn into pools of murky water. “Unplanned growth and construction have narrowed the main streets, and there is no outfall for the water,” said Lalit Verma, a Sriniwaspuri resident.The other key voting group — slum dwellers — live in the more than 25 slum clusters, the major ones being Priyanka Camp, Gandhi Camp, Nehru Camp, Bhumiheen Camp, Navjeewan Camp and Karpoori Thakur Camp. These were traditionally strongholds of Congress until AAP swept the elections in 2015 and dethroned the sitting Congress MLA, Subhash Chopra, now the party chief, who had romped home in 1998, 2003 and 2008 assembly elections, having received more than 50% of the votes on each occasion.Congress hopes to revive its roots in these places, where EWS flats were allocated to relocated slum dwellers during former CM Sheila Dikshit's tenure. However, many complain about unfulfilled promises and less than salubrious conditions, such as the sanitation disaster, open drains and the need to pay bribes for putting up business stalls.The people also have not forgotten about the in-situ slum development announced in 2009 but never implemented. Adhir Chand Rai, 79, said only the foundation stones were laid before the elections but nobody got any flat. “These promises are made before every poll,” shrugged Rai, pointing to the granite foundation stone at Bhumiheen Camp. Rai, however, conceded that water supply lines, which earlier reached only the DDA flats there, have now entered the narrow lanes of the JJ camp.AAP registers a strong presence in these localities. Shopkeeper Pramod Mandal, 42, brightly said that 99% of the colony household had not been required to pay the electricity bill after AAP’s free power scheme was implemented. “Conditions aren’t too good here,” he said, “but some progress has been made, and the poor don’t really expect much.”",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73210424,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-814633,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/varied-voter-base-holds-hope-for-the-primary-contenders/articleshow/73210441.cms

Nashik: City Mayor Satish Kulkarni assured the residents of Pathardi Phata to seriously pursue their demand for having a hospital in the vicinity and pursue the same accordingly.

Speaking during the ‘Mayor at your doorstep’ programme, Kulkarni had planned to tour many parts of the city, listen to the issues of the citizens and resolve their problems.

The mayor was flooded with the various development work requests from the construction of roads, building a hospital and development of the rural areas of the city. “We have set the priority for the development and have asked the officials to set the ball rolling for the hospital on the top priority. We will search for the NMC land and plan for the same soon,” Kulkarni said.

Due to the lack of medical facilities in the vicinity, the citizens have to travel to the Ambad police station for the same. There are private hospitals in the area but the cost is too high and hence the NMC should fulfill their demands from the region, the citizens demanded collectively. Construction of quality roads in the vicinity was another demand that they put across to the mayor.

As Pathardi falls in the outskirts of the city, the residents demanded that NMC should make efforts to the development of these areas. Basic amenities like street lights, drainage lines, and water supply pipelines should be the focus of development. “During the past several years the issue of drinking water has been resolved by the NMC. It should now focus on other issues. We have been raising the same with the local officials but they are only advising us to wait for some time,” Gautam Donde, said.

The Mayor after hearing to all the complaints, suggestions and demands assured to them that he would take up the issue of hospital soon.

Chief of Delhi state

BJP

Manoj Tiwari

, who is leading the party in the assembly elections, accuses AAP of perception management on various issues like education, water and power without delivering much. Speaking to Atul Mathur, he says BJP has a five-point agenda for the city, and if it gets the mandate, Delhi will get a three-engine government – in state, Centre and corporations

What is the BJP’s agenda for the upcoming polls?

Delhi government claims it is giving potable water to every household.

Why do you think the water being supplied is not clean?

When you say BJP will give five times of what the AAP government is giving, what exactly do you mean? And what are your views on giving freebies?

In principle, are you in favour of giving freebies?

CAA has become a major election plank for BJP. How is it relevant to assembly polls?

But won’t BJP benefit from any polarisation of voters?

AAP says giving ownership rights in unauthorised colonies is a big fraud as land use has not been changed.

Don’t you think people will judge BJP on the basis of the performance of civic bodies where corruption is rampant?

Do you think there has been some improvement in Delhi government schools?

The youth is restless and coming out on the streets. You are a relatively young leader and an artiste at heart. What would be your message to them?

Kejriwal wants police under him to control the law and order situation.

Delhi BJP has too many leaders. How will you solve the leadership problem when it comes to choosing the CM if BJP wins?

How many seats is the BJP going to win?

We are working on a five-point agenda. First point is providing drinking water through tap. We have set a three-and-half-year deadline for that and have a plan ready. The second is to reduce air pollution by 70%. We have seen many cities, like Beijing, coming out of a dangerous situation. The government should have put more focus on the issue which unfortunately didn’t happen.Our third priority is the Yamuna. Amit Shah ji has mentioned this in his speeches. We want to develop a riverfront on the lines of Sabarmati. There will be a separate channel for drains, and sewage won’t be allowed to enter the river. A new dam, on the lines of Sardar Sarovar project, will be constructed at Okhla and a reservoir created. The river will also have 20-25ft of water, which will help in its conservation.Our fourth target is to improve Delhi’s public transport and fifth is to work on healthcare. We want to give the below poverty line section free treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh every year, which the AAP government has not allowed. Hospitals in Delhi are closing down. Instead of improving dispensaries, the AAP government has destroyed them.We also want to give pucca houses to homeless under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, which Delhi government has not implemented. They want it to be renamed as Mukhya Mantri Awas Yojana.Water samples in Delhi were tested by BIS but the AAP government said the agency was lying in its report. You can accuse BJP of lying but can you come with us on the streets and say with conviction that the water being supplied by Delhi Jal Board is clean? I went to Shashi Garden in Patparganj (constituency of deputy CM Manish Sisodia) where an elderly woman almost held me by my collar for supply of contaminated water.The water is not clean because the old pipelines are broken and sewage mixes with drinking water. The chief minister has in his own townhall programmes admitted that there was water contamination at some places. Delhi government is giving 20,000 litres of water free every month, which is a good thing. But DJB has to bear a loss of about Rs 800 crore — earlier, it had a profit of Rs 600 crore and now it is showing a loss of Rs 168 crore. We have got this information through RTI. When you cannot check losses, how will you replace broken pipelines? They are not able to pay salaries to DJB employees. With these announcements, the AAP government has created a perception but destroyed the organisation. We will not only continue giving subsidy on electricity and water, but also ensure that these losses are reduced.We are talking about giving five times the benefits being given by the AAP government and not five times the subsidy. BJP had also promised to give 30% relief on electricity bills in 2015. If you look back, the AAP government has not given as much relief as promised by BJP. They had said electricity bills would be halved but within 15 days they took a U-turn and gave 50% subsidy on consumption of up to 400 units only. They had said water will be free. They, once again, made a U-turn after forming the government and said only 20,000 litres will be free. They increased fixed charges on electricity connections and collected Rs 9,000 crore from consumers. When elections approached, the fixed charges were reversed. Just two months before the polls, they made 200 units free. From the amount of Rs 9,000 crore they had collected, only Rs 400 crore was spent on free electricity. They don’t have any plan to give free electricity. No such notification has been issued till date. The order issued by the power department says consumers will get free electricity only till March 31. It is just an election gimmick. Some people are still getting power bills despite consuming less than 200 units of electricity.You can give relief on electricity. In BJP-run states, we are giving cheaper electricity to factories and household industries. The power tariff for industrial connections in Delhi is three times more than Uttar Pradesh. If you consume even one unit over 400, you will have to pay 1.5 times of the bill. We will streamline this system so that the benefit reaches every section of society. The power tariff of industrial connections will also be rationalised.Everybody knows now that CAA has nothing to do with Indian citizens. But Congress and AAP misled people and incited violence in the name of CAA and Delhi will teach them a lesson for this. Delhi wants a safe city to live in but the opposition parties caused violence in New Friends Colony, Jamia, Jaffrabad and Seelampur.I don’t understand polarisation of voters but people have got the message that for BJP, keeping society safe from violence is a priority. Everybody wants acts of violence and rioting to be dealt with strictly. Our government in UP took strong decisions and no rioter came on street the second day. But in Delhi, the state government openly supported such acts. What is more dangerous is the fact that the state government distributed Rs 5 lakh among rioters. The government gave cheques to those who spread violence, burnt buses and got injured in police action. This stand of the local government to support violence is going to hurt it badly in upcoming elections.The main motive of regularising unauthorised colonies was to give ownership rights to people. Regularisation of colonies was a precondition for conferring ownership rights for which a proper layout plan has been prepared for each colony with space earmarked for parks, roads and community centres. That’s why we changed the law and removed the precondition of regularisation to give ownership rights. I believe in the next 5-7 years, after the redevelopment works starts, these colonies will be the most developed areas in Delhi. This is their frustration over what they could not do but the Modi government managed to do.They will indeed judge us on the performance of the corporations. Delhi government is either visionless or is intentionally harassing people. We asked Kejriwal, who has stolen Rs 20,000 crore of the corporations? This is due from Delhi government, which has not been paid, and even the court has said this. Stopping the corporations’ funds and then saying, see the civic bodies have not performed, is what they have been doing. That is why we are saying that one vote this time will bring a triple engine government to power. We are indeed struggling with the problem of corruption and have made several efforts to end it. We have made our system 90% digital.There has been improvement in eight of 1,000 schools, which have been developed as a ‘sample’ by the AAP government. I got a reality check of Delhi government schools done and found the conditions really bad. The buildings are dilapidated, toilets are not functional and roofs may collapse any time. They have just tried to create a false perception about education. In the past five years, five lakh students of Class IX have failed and dropped out. The result of Class X has gone down by 20%.I want to tell them that before joining a protest, please understand the issue first. You are future of our country but have often been misled. I saw a girl raising azaadi slogans on JNU campus. When somebody asked her from what do you want freedom from, she said BJP. It was clearly a political protest. The Left and Congress would obviously want freedom from BJP. I called 500-600 Muslims to my house and some youngsters also came. When I told them that NRC was not even planned and CAA had nothing to do with Indians, they accepted they had been misled.Kejriwal is among those people who have a ‘vikrit maansikta’ (deformed mentality). We have seen a similar case in Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal. If such people get police in their control, they can prove to be very cruel rulers. Kejriwal could have been one of them.Since I became president of the state BJP, things have improved and I have got support from everyone. Though people still say there is factionalism in the party. We have a parliamentary board which will make the announcement at the right time.I think we will get 45-50 seats.

Muzaffarnagar: In a major crackdown on petrol mafia in the district, a joint team of the supply department and police arrested three suspects and seized 1 ,800 litres of diesel worth 1.30 lakh from New-Mandi area in Muzzafarnagar on Saturday.

According to police sources, the gang has been in the business of trading adulterated fuel oil for several years, and used to supply them in rural areas. Police have registered a case against them under section 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955.

“After getting a tip-off, we raided the premises in New-Mandi area and recovered a dozen of drums loaded with 1,800 litres of adulterated diesel worth Rs1.30 lakh from a truck and arrested three men, who have been identified as Sunil Kumar, Danish, and Salman,” deputy Superintendent of Police (City) Harish Bhadauria, said.

The police officer further said they have launched probe to trace other gang members.

The station house officer of the New-Mandi police station, Deepak Chaturvedi said, “The fuel was being supplied to biodiesel stations in the rural area from where farmers buy fuel for farming purpose. After lodging a case, all the three were sent to jail.”

Police sources said the accused used to bring raw materials and chemicals from Meerut district and after mixing it into little quantity of the diesel, they would produce the adulterated fuel and supply it in Muzaffarnagar.

It should be noted that in a similar incident a couple of months ago in Charthawal area of the district, the police had busted a gang involved in siphoning fuel from vehicles parked on highways. Two of the four gang members were arrested while two managed to escape.

372,['12/01/2020'],"Civic body set to evict 1,200 illegal hawkers next week","This story is from January 12, 2020

KMC may start eviction of hawkers from Monday onwards

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is likely to initiate eviction procedures against 1,200 hawkers next week.

Hawkers were asked to prove the legality of their establishments by January 10. An official from the municipal corporation said the hawkers’ associations had requested an extension of the deadline, which he said would most likely be turned down.

A senior official from the estate department, on the condition of anonymity, said: “We have submitted the list of hawkers who have failed to submit documents to the anti-encroachment department. The department will now initiate action after assessing the required number of staff and adequate police protection. This is set to be the first major move against illegal hawkers in years. We will ensure leaders of the hawkers’ associations are taken into confidence before the action. Legal businesses have been facing problems because of illegal hawking.”

The KMC has been carrying out surveys of hawkers — with help from the city-based All-India Institute of Local Self Government — for the past six months. The agency was provided with a mobile application to load details of hawkers. It has emerged that the 1,200 hawkers, who face eviction next week, have not been able to produce any receipt of payment to the KMC.

“We had initiated the task to relocate hawkers from the Rajarampuri area to Shahupuri. The work is not over yet as many illegal hawkers continue to obstruct sites earmarked for rehabilitation. After the evictions, we will initiate rehabilitation procedures and the list of no-hawker zones will be published after consultations with the hawkers’ associations,” the NMC official said.

The KMC survey found that nearly 4,000 hawkers have documents proving their businesses are operating legally. A demand to regularise operations of the 1,200 illegal hawkers is likely to be made, but the KMC official said such a request will only be considered after rehabilitation of the legal hawkers.

373,['12/01/2020'],KMC has collected only Rs 4.5 crore in local body tax dues,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Representative image

KOLHAPUR: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) is staring at a huge loss in revenue from the traders who have failed to pay the local body tax (LBT) dues for the 2011-2015 period.

The KMC is in the last leg of its LBT assessment drive. In a recent drive that ended on December 31, only 175 traders had turned up to get the LBT dues assessed. The officials said that the documents of over 2,500 traders have to be scrutinised to recover over Rs 20 crore dues from them. As of now, the KMC has recovered just Rs 4.5 crore and the traders’ bodies are opposing the assessment alleging harassment from the LBT officials.

Sunil Bidre, the LBT officer of the civic body, said: “We are going to issue the notices to the traders with the ex-parte demand. This means, since they have not got the LBT dues assessed, we will fix the amount as per our wisdom. The recovery notices will be issued to them soon. Since there is no deadline for the assessment of the LBT dues, we can continue the assessment and thereby the recovery even in the next financial year.”

After the abolishment of the LBT by the earlier government in August 2015, the directions were issued to the civic bodies to get the dues paid from the traders. The civic bodies were asked to launch the concession scheme to waive the fine amount fixed over the principal amount of the LBT dues. Accordingly 2,200 traders signed up for the scheme. However, many failed to submit the documents.

Also, the KMC initiated the assessment of the dues of the traders who did not sign up for the concession scheme. The officials claim that in other civic bodies, such as in Pune and Parbhani, the assessment has started just now; and in Sangli, the assessment has been stopped due to opposition from the traders.

Bidre claimed that though there is much delay in completing the assessment process and recover the dues, the KMC is much ahead in the assessment task when compared to other civic bodies.

Ajit Kothari, a city-based trader and director of the Kolhapur Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI), said: “As per the state government’s order, the assessment of the traders who had signed up for the concession scheme has ended in March 2018, and the assessment of traders done thereafter is illegal. For the rest of the traders, many of whom have paid the tax regularly, the ex-parte demand cannot be issued without calling them for the hearing. Many of the traders who are buying and selling the goods within the city limits are called for the assessment. Such traders are not to pay the LBT.”

KOLHAPUR: Rajyasabha member Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati on Saturday called off his hunger strike after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray assured him to look into pending issues of Pune-based Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI).

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar had advised Sambhajiraje not to sit on the hunger strike. However, he went ahead with his plans. “The CM has assured me that the autonomy of the institute will continue to be unaltered. One of the demands, to remove principal secretary J Gupta from heading the administration of the institute has been accepted along with scrapping all the orders passed by him,” said Sambhajiraje.

KOCHI: A day before the demolition of Holy Faith H2O and Alfa Serene, several flat owners returned to Kochi seeking compensation . “We will continue our fight for justice. It is a difficult time for all of us,” said Biyoj Chennat, a flat owner at Holy Faith H2O, who was in Kochi along with a few other owners from Thursday.

Ramesh Menon, who owned a flat at Holy Faith H20, said his family shifted to his ancestral home in Nettoor. “I dumped my belongings at a nearby warehouse and later took it to my ancestral home. We will approach the Supreme Court on January 13. It is mainly about compensation,” he said. Meanwhile, many others left their belonging at various places and went abroad.

Flat owners also expressed their disappointment over the delay in getting the interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh. On Friday, some of them addressed the media to convey their dissatisfaction about the state governments ‘irresponsible attitude’. Maradu Bhavana Samrakshana Samiti, a collective formed by the displaced flat owners, said 22 flat owners still haven’t received the interim compensation.

“The commission, which is in charge of determining compensation, should abandon its apathy and submit before the Supreme Court the need to determine the existing market price of the buildings and pay a fair compensation to flat owners,” said Shamsudeen Karungappally, a lawyer and chairman of the samiti. He said all flat owners have submitted relevant documents and yet compensation disbursal is taking time.

Some flat owners at Alfa Serene spoke to TOI on condition of anonymity. “We are ruined. The country is heading for destruction and there is nothing much to say at this point,” said an owner.

Meanwhile, the samiti asked the chief secretary to submit a list of all illegal constructions in Kerala before the Supreme Court without delay.

Meerut: Taking on Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav for stating that he won’t comply with the National Population Register (NPR) process, Union minister and BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar Sanjeev Balyan on Saturday said the former chief minister will not be allowed to contest elections if he does not show his papers.

Baliyan, who was in Saharanpur to garner support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), said, “False rumours are being spread about NPR. Is India a ‘dharamshala’ where there will be no record of people coming, going or willing to stay? Is there a problem? Akhilesh Yadav says he will not register for NPR. Other opposition leaders have also been claiming the same. You will not be allowed to contest elections if you don’t register. This country is not a dharamshala. There is a rule of law— of Modi and Yogi raj. People trying to create menace will be treated accordingly,” Balyan said

“This time, the Samajwadi Party government won’t get away as they did in the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013 and the Saharanpur violence in 2014-15. Anyone trying to create anarchy will face consequences,” he added.

The ruling party has been drumming up support for CAA, which has been receiving criticism and that has led to several protests across the country. Senior BJP leaders, including state and cabinet ministers, have been deputed to amass support for the CAA.

Earlier, Muzaffarnagar’s BJP MLA Vikram Saini had courted controversy when said that Pakistan should also make law and give citizenship to all those Muslims who are feeling persecuted in India.

“The CAA and NRC are in favour of the country. Hindus and Sikhs are facing persecution in Pakistan for decades now, and we are providing shelter to them. I would like to say that Pakistan should also enact such a law for the Muslims,” Saini had said.

379,['12/01/2020'],Jaipur: Accused likely in a pact to kill each other’s wives,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Representational image

JAIPUR: The horrific murders of city-based housewife Shweta Tiwari (35) and her 21-month-old son Shreyam — conspired by Shweta’s husband Rohit and executed by a hired killer Saurabh Chaudhary — bear an uncanny resemblance to the book ‘ Strangers on a Train ’ by Patricia Highsmith, which was later made into a movie by Alfred Hitchcock. In the book, two strangers meet on a train and decide to kill each other’s wives.

The twin murder was carried out on the same lines, except that the fictional conspirators were strangers who met on a train while Rohit and Saurabh — who were arrested on Friday — knew each other from before. Police also detained Rohit’s friend and former colleague Hari Singh from Udaipur in connection with the crime. Singh had recommended his brother-in-law Saurabh to Rohit for committing the murders.

“During questioning, we learnt that the arrested duo had turbulent marital lives, a common grievance for both. Saurabh’s pregnant wife was living away from him in Agra while Rohit was also unhappy with Shweta. The two might have made a pact to kill each other’s wives ,” a senior police officer told TOI. Cops got a hint of this suspected pact as Rohit had paid Saurabh only Rs 20,000 to kill his wife and son. “The amount is too less for such a crime. Since both had a similar history of marital discord, the agreement could have involved more than just money,” the officer said.

Rohit had earlier claimed that he got rid of his wife and son because he wanted to move on in life and marry again. He couldn’t do so with them around since he came from a “traditional family”.

Both mother and child were killed on January 7. While Shweta’s body was found at her Pratap Nagar residence by her maid later in the day, her son Shreyam couldn’t be found, and Rohit had filed a missing complaint. The next day, the child’s body was found dumped in a vacant plot next to the residential complex where the Tiwaris stayed.

Police are building a foolproof case against the duo and will retrieve CCTV footage from the hotel where the accused had met on January 3. Sources said cops found Saurabh’s identity proof at a shop where he purchased the mobile phone in which he inserted Shweta’s SIM card after killing her and dumping her phone in a drain. He used her number to call and message Rohit, demanding ‘ransom’ for Shreyam’s release.

“We recovered Saurabh’s shoes and trousers with bloodstains on them. He was captured on the neighbour’s CCTV camera and also one on the road a distance away from the residential complex where the Tiwaris lived,” said a police officer.

While sleuths have substantial proof against Saurabh, the evidence against Rohit is still circumstantial even as investigators are still collecting proof. “Rohit’s behaviour from the beginning indicated his involvement in the crime as he didn’t even attempt to gather the Rs 30 lakh ransom amount which was being demanded. When cops were searching his house after Shweta’s murder, he seemed absolutely unaffected and was looking around the flat to check if his ‘missing’ son was actually hiding somewhere. He even offered us tea,” the officer added.

380,['12/01/2020'],FM’s absence from pre-Budget talks sends wrong signal: Yashwant Sinha,"This story is from January 12, 2020

NASHIK: Yashwant Sinha , India’s finance minister during the Atal Behari Vajpayee administration, on Saturday slammed the absence of current finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman during the pre-Budget talks with experts from various fields.

Sinha, who has presented five Budgets, is currently heading the ‘Gandhi Shanti Yatra’, which is set to cross the states of Maharashtra , Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana before culminating at New Delhi’s Rajghat on January 30.

“The Budget is the subject of the finance minister. It is she who should be present for the pre-Budget dialogue with experts — maybe along with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But here, Modi is being seen despite it not being his subject,” he said and added that the finance minister’s absence sends out wrong signals. He said the absence hinted the Prime Minister’s Office was now in charge of the affairs.

The former bureaucrat from Jharkhand said the timeline of the current Budget suggested the financial blueprint of the country has already gone for printing, which meant the consultations with industry leaders by the PM was now a futile exercise.

Sinha, who also held the office of the minister of external affairs, said the current government has failed to steer foreign policy well. “We spent our force to dehyphenate India from Pakistan. Even during the nuclear test, India maintained the threat was from China and didn’t even care to speak of Pakistan. The Modi government has gone in the wrong direction. Today, it’s India-Pakistan that is being discussed, instead of India-China,” he said.

On the widespread opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said granting of citizenship and its rejection — under the current set of rules — would not stand in the court of law. “For a person to be religiously oppressed or even with fear of it, has to present evidence. In this case, the evidence (if at all) will be on foreign lands. How will one prove to be the affected one?”

Hr added, “The violence against CAA protestors was in BJP-led states, as they believe in coercion and use of force. Rest of the states, even Kerala, have been largely peaceful.”

On the alleged RSS involvement in state policy, Sinha said the organisation was always there, but the Vajpayee administration ensured decisions were the result of consensus. “The Modi government is directly implementing the agenda, in an authoritarian manner and not democratically,” Sinha said.

KOLHAPUR: Half the city is set to face water cuts for two days starting Monday.

The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation has reported leaks in a main pipeline that carries water from the Aptenagar pumping station to Phulewadi and other suburbs. The repairs, starting on Monday, will cut supply to certain areas. On Tuesday, officials said citizens could experience low pressure in their taps.

“Localities across A and B wards along with nearby suburbs will not receive water. We will ensure water supply resumes on Tuesday. We urge citizens to store adequate water for two days,"" said a senior KMC official.

Major neighbourhoods set to be impacted include the entire Phulewadi ring road area, Saneguruji Vasahat area, Aptenagar, Rajopadhyenagar, Kanerkarnagar, Krantisinha Nana Patil Nagar, Tulja Bhavani Colony and Devkar Panand. Officials from the KMC said water tankers would be deployed to affected localities. The civic body has also added four new water tankers to its previous number of six. These tankers will be filled at the Kalamba water filter house.

“We have procured four new water tankers. The 10 water tankers will help us deliver water to residents on time. On normal days, the new tankers will be on standby at treatment plants in various parts of the city. The trucks can be deployed if water supply to areas that come under that treatment plant is shut,"" said an official.

Each of the new water tankers has a capacity of 9,000 litres. Officials said they will also get older water tankers repaired - there are six such vehicles which are not being used currently.

The KMC has spent Rs 80 lakh to procure the four water tankers, which officials said, will help them move away from relying more on private water tanker suppliers.

Karan Adani

AHMEDABAD: India’s largest commercial ports operator Adani Ports and Special Economic Zones Limited (APSEZ) recently announced the acquisition of 75% stake in Krishnapatnam Port Company Ltd (KPCL) for an enterprise value of Rs 13,500 crore. Located in southern Andhra Pradesh, Krishnapatnam port is the second largest private sector multi-cargo port in India.

The acquisition fits well into Adani group ’s dream of operating a string of ports dotted across the Indian coastline. The man spearheading the group’s aggressive expansion in ports is Karan Adani, chief operating officer (CEO) and whole-time director, APSEZ.

Just a day before inaugurating the construction work of Vizhinjam transshipment port in Kerala on December 5, 2015, Karan, then executive director at APSEZ, made his intentions clear by saying, “We are looking at developing port projects in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. We will be acquiring existing assets in these states.”

A few weeks later, Karan, the eldest son of Adani group patriarch Gautam Adani, took over as the CEO of APSEZ. He worked hard to achieve the group’s target of handling 200 MMT cargo (accomplished in 2018-19) and has now geared up to realize 400 MMT vision by fiscal 2025.

The 32-year-old is currently spearheading a transformation at APSEZ to form an integrated logistics company with the objective to add further value for the customers.

Karan, who holds a degree in economics from the Purdue University, USA, has been managing various port operations of Adani Group since 2009. He started his career by learning the intricacies of the port operations at Mundra. Accumulating experience right from the base level, the young CEO today is responsible for the strategic development of the Adani Group and overlooks its day-to-day operations.

He believes in setting the highest benchmarks in all areas of business and has successfully steered the growth strategy of APSEZ resulting in its rapid expansion spanning ten ports and terminals in less than a decade.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala coastal zone management authority (KCZMA), which suffered a major setback in the DLF case two years ago despite it being a win-win situation, fought cases related to Maradu apartments and Kapico resorts purely on technical grounds to extract favourable verdicts.Padma Mahanti, former member secretary, KCZMA, along with her team made use of satellite images to counter each contention being raised by the project proponents. In case of Kapico, the key point that had to be proven was the existence of filtration pond and for other violations KCZMA was tasked with the mission to establish that constructions happened without clearance on areas where regulations under Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) applied.The team which worked hard on both cases recall how they had to trace all files related to Maradu and Kapico as many of the key documents were missing. The authorities had to gather documents from individuals who had earlier obtained these files through RTI. Based on satellite images, time series was constructed which depicted in detail how the construction happened in a landscape which was earmarked as no development zone as per CRZ norms. High profile cases were regularly included in the agenda of KCZMA meeting to keep the issue alive and minutes were recorded to make sure that such cases of huge violations were pursued with all the intent.When project proponents of Kapico filed an application with Union ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) seeking benefits of MoEF notification in March 2017 pertaining to constructions done without obtaining prior environmental clearance under Environmental Impact Assessment notification 2006, KCZMA sent a strongly worded report to MoEF.It was pointed out that the MoEF notification does not cover those projects which have been declared by the courts of law as illegal and violative of environmental norms. KCZMA also pointed out that the regularization of the constructed Kapico Resorts Kerala Pvt Ltd in Nediyathuruthu Island, Panavally, is not a permissible activity as per CRZ Notification 1991, 2011 & MoEF notification dated March 14, 2017. The latest Supreme Court order on Kapico upheld the points in the report sent by KCZMA regarding MoEF notification of 2017.The SC observed that the notification does not deal with cases of violation of CRZ notification. The SC also set aside contention based on CRZ notification 2019, that even if all the constructions put up by the project proponent are demolished, they would be entitled to build approximately 60% of the area covered by existing structures. SC observed that the reduction of distance parameter to 20 metres from HTL as per CRZ notification 2019, was not intended to confer a benefit upon persons like the project proponent.Mahanti, who put together a team to work on high profile cases, said that the verdicts on Maradu and Kapico send out a very strong message. “It proves that rule of the law will prevail no matter how big you are. Besides it has created larger sense of awareness among people as to how they should be cautious about violations. It also asserted the point that we have to respect the bond between coastal community and the coast,” said Mahanti who is now chief conservator of forest, eco-development and tribal welfare.",thiruvananthapuram,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73211413,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-182049,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/thiruvananthapuram/coastal-authority-used-tech-rti-to-win-legal-battles/articleshow/73208433.cms

NASHIK: District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has directed the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to improve the basic infrastructure at the truck terminal in Adgaon.

Bhujbal, who is food and civil supplies and consumer protection minister, was on a day’s tour to Nashik when a delegation from the transport industry met him and presented the demand for the upgrading of facilities at the terminal where truckers from across the country coming to Nashik halt.

“The truckers coming here need to be given humane treatment. The situation is very bad for the truckers and even the operators here. When we presented out demands, the minister asked the NMC to ensure that the facilities are provided on time,” president of the association Rajendra Fad, who led the delegation, said.

There are about 47 shops at the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar truck terminal, Adgaon, of which only 10-12 have been occupied by the operators. The truckers park their vehicles for a brief period. People are unable to stay there given the lack of sanitation, water supply, lighting facilities and much more. This situation leads to the health problems among truckers and even the operators, the delegation said. The security wall of the terminal is also in bad shape.

“If the NMC pays a little attention to the facilities, the vacant shops will also be taken up by businesspersons. That will ensure that the civic body earned revenue from the infrastructure now lying unused,” the delegation said in a memorandum presented to the minister.

The delegation has also put the focus on transportation issues. The members have sought a safe vehicular underpass at Sinnar on the Nashik-Sinnar-Pune highway.

The Sinnar-bypass has two junctions — one each at Nashik-end and Sinnar-end — and at both the junctions, speeding vehicles are often involved in head-on collisions.

The delegation also demanded truck terminal at Ambad .

KOLHAPUR: The Laxmipuri police investigating the nursing student suicide case are exploring various angles to determine the reason behind the death.

The deceased — Shefali Raju Pawar alias Pooja — was found hanging from the ceiling of a room at the premises of Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) civil hospital on Friday morning. She had joined the nursing course two years back and was staying at the CPR hostel.

“We are investigating the case in details to find out the reasons behind the suicide. We are exploring several angles in this regard. One such angle is that she might be under stress due to regular college work as well as pressure of the study material. There can be also other factors that might have led her to take extreme step,” said a police officer investigating the case.

The officer said that they are questioning other students at the college, especially the deceased’s close friends including her classmates. “We are also searching for those who were in constant touch with her and with whom she communicated before ending her life. We expect to get some leads regarding her death if she had hinted about taking such step while talking with anybody,” he said.

Traffic on road continues as district celebrates Road Safety Week

KOLHAPUR: Even as various government departments are busy celebrating the ‘ Road Safety Week ’, the traffic woes continues to hamper the commuters on daily basis.

The city traffic department and other government agencies have declared a series of events that starteded on January 11. The drive will continue for seven days and the officials will spread awareness among the people to curb road accidents and minimise casualties during accidents.

The major roads in the city including Station road, Bhausingji road and internal roads in the city are always crowded with traffic jams. “The police celebrating Road Safety Week is a good step but instead of spending money on this they could have used it on providing infrastructure. This would have been a welcome step,” said Mahesh Kulkarni, resident of the Rankala area.

Kolhapur is one of the important tourist place in the country and during Saturday and Sunday, the traffic is very chaotic. “If this is experienced by the tourists that enter the city. It is not a good sign for Kolhapur to emerge as the major tourist destination,” he said.

There is a number of roads without traffic signs including zebra crossing and other marks. “The steps should be taken by the concerned authorities to ensure that the signs on the roads are visible for people riding vehicles so that they don’t break the rules and help in reducing traffic jams,” he said.

According to RTO officials, there are around 13.36 lakh registered vehicles in Kolhapur district including the city premises. Out of these vehicles, 10.56 lakh are two-wheelers and 2.80 lakh are four-wheelers and other heavy vehicles.

“The number of vehicles continues to increase every day whereas the length of the roads remains the same. There are 22 traffic signals in the city and there is a need to install some more signals to manage the crowd in the city. We need additional funds and the assistance from civic body to regularise traffic in the city,” said the police officer.

NASHIK: The district administration has pulled up 541of the 4,446 booth-level officers ( BLOs ) for their alleged failure in discharging duties during the on-going summary revision of electoral rolls.

“There are some BLOs who have failed to discharge their duties as per expectations during the summary revision programme of the Commission. We have noted their turnouts and warned them against neglect of duty,” said Kundan Sonawane, the deputy district election officer, Nashik district, said.

Reviewing the work done by the BLOs in the respective talukas of Nashik district, the deputy district election officer pointed out that the work of creating pure electoral roll by the BLOs had suffered at some of the election centres without any valid reason for the same.

“Since the EC has ordered the preparation of the works at the earliest, every BLO has to pitch in and carry out door-to-door survey to ensure that the person recorded with the electoral roll lived at the same address as noted or even if the voter had already shifted from the location,” another senior officer from the election office said.

“We have warned the BLOs who were lagging in the count against neglect in the duty that if they fail to discharge duty diligently, they will face action by the department,” the officer said.

The action that could be taken against the BLOs is that a remark may be carried in their service record and even a case can be registered against them for violation of EC orders, said the officer.

The officer has called on tehsildars as well to expedite the process of verification of voters so that the same is completed well in time.

There are 45.73 lakh voters in the district.

Balasaheb Thorat

NASHIK: A day after the Home Ministry said in a notification that the provisions of the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) came force on January 10, Maharashtra Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat on Saturday reiterated that the new law would not be implemented in the state.

Addressing a press conference here, Thorat said: ""Anti-CAA protests are being held across the country. The Congress party is extending full support to the people as the Act is against the Constitution. The CAA will not be implemented in Maharashtra.""

Thorat further stressed that the Maharastra government wants to free the farmers from their loans as the state has consistently recorded the highest number of farmer suicides.

""Maharashtra is a drought-hit state. Farmers were debt-ridden. Thus, there was an increase in farmer's suicide. The Centre did not support the state. There were just more speeches than fulfilling the promises,"" he said.

According to the data recently released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 10,349 people working in the farm sector committed suicide in 2018.

Talking about the violence in the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on January 5, he said: ""It is strange that those who were attacked, an FIR is being lodged against them. We condemn this. We are against it.""

The Delhi Police have filed an FIR against JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and 19 others for allegedly vandalising the server room of the JNU and attacking the staff members. (ANI)

How to reach

Legend has it

Flora and fauna

Ambolgad, a remote coastal village on the west coast of Maharashtra , features in the list of having rich heritage among the many other places in the state— all thanks to a historic fort that can be found here. Though the fort is partially in shambles, the beauty of this heritage structure lies in the fact that commercialism has failed to touch this ancient fort, which only adds to the aesthetics of the place. Located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, Ambolgad fort has something in store both for nature enthusiasts and lovers of history.Ambolgad fort is located in Rajapur tehsil, Ratnagiri district and is 143km away from Kolhapur city. It takes around three-and-a-half hours to reach the beach side fort via Anuskura ghat. From here, one has to take the Rajapur- Nate route or the Ratnanagiri- Adivare- Nate route. One can also visit Yashwantgad fort on the way to Ambolgad fort.The fort dates back to the 17th century. Sagar Patil, a trekker and history lover said, “This fort was built during the Maratha reign in the 17th century to keep an eye on the ancient ‘Musakaji’ port and the trades running through the coastal route. Britain’s Colonel Emlock captured the fort in 1818. By 1862, the fort was made free from human presence.”“Today, much of the fort is in ruins. One can find a deep square well, a broken canon, a bastion , flag post and some fortification wall next to the beach. A huge banyan tree at the centre of the fort has spread its roots across the structure, which covers around 1,200 sq-m area. Gagangiri Maharaj ashram is another attraction here, which can be visited over the plain plateau next to the fort”.Since it is located on the coast of the Arabian Sea, Ambolgad fort offers stunning landscapes of the sea. If lucky, one can get to see dolphins in the sea water right next to the fort walls. Monkeys, squirrels and plants like mango, coconut, cashew, banyan and Hirda can be found aplenty in the surroundings. There is no food facility out here so visitors are advised to carry their own food and water while visiting this fort.",kolhapur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73211162,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-750886,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolhapur/head-to-this-fort-whose-beauty-lies-in-its-ruins/articleshow/73208454.cms

393,['12/01/2020'],Cong MLA raises banner of revolt against Pondy govt,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Puducherry: In an embarrassment to the Congress government in Puducherry , a ruling party MLA has raised a banner of revolt against chief minister V Narayanasamy and health minister Malladi Krishna Rao.

Speaking to the media on Saturday, Congress MLA N Danavelu accused Narayanasamy and his cabinet colleague of indulging in corrupt practices and said he will soon submit a list of their corrupt practices to the party high command .

Danavelu recalled that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi while stepping down from the post of president after the party’s defeat in the last Lok Sabha polls attributed the defeat to the corrupt practices of senior Congress leaders and their family members in the states and Union territories.

He said the local party unit has started targeting him for opposing the corrupt practices of the government. Alleging that corruption is ruling the roost in almost all departments in the government, Danavelu specifically targeted the health directorate, claiming that it failed to ensure adequate stock of life-saving medicines in government hospitals.

He cited the example of Villianur primary health centre where the staff had a week ago put a notice declaring that the centre does not have life-saving drugs and medicines for diabetic and BP patients.

The MLA charged that patients approaching Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Research Institute were forced to get blood tests done in private labs as it does not have adequate facilities or staff to perform the tests. Similarly, there are no adequate life-saving drugs at Bahour primary health centre, he said.

Danavelu said he protested two days ago demanding that the government equip the hospitals with adequate stock of life-saving drugs, infrastructure and medical and paramedical staff. He said the health minister attempted to cover up the inadequacies in the directorate dismissing his charges as false.

“Health minister stays just two or three days a week in Puducherry headquarters. He may not be aware that diesel for the ambulances in the centre was made available just two days ago,” the MLA said.

He challenged the chief minister and health minister for an open debate on his corruption charges against the government in the presence of media. The Congress cannot retain power if the chief minister and his colleagues do not correct their mistakes, he said.

Danavelu said incidences of land grab have touched an all-time high in the Congress government and said ministers have registered properties worth several crores of rupees in the recent past.

The government has been violating rules and regulations to promote private players while launching attempts to close government corporations. He was highly critical of the government’s latest proposal to open casinos in the territory stating the move will wipe out the cultural, ethical, moral and spiritual values of Puducherry and its people.

AJMER: The district administration has announced lucrative gifts for people — both men and women — who can convince others to opt for vasectomy , a surgical procedure for male sterilisation or permanent contraception.

The rewards are: A bike for an individual who can convince 50 or more men to go for the sterilisation, three mopeds for three persons who can motivate 35 males or more and 8 LED TVs for persuading 25 or more.

Announcing the scheme at the first vasectomy programme held at Jawahar Rang Manch here on Saturday, district collector Vishwa Mohan Sharma said the incentives had been announced to promote birth control .

Such rewards were previously announced in Pali and Jhunjhunu districts.

Sharma said the scheme was open to anybody, be it a government servant or an individual. The administration also honoured males who went for vasectomy and allowed them to share their experiences after the operation.

Government records say in the last six years, only 442 males went for vasectomy, while more than 52,000 women stepped forward for sterilisation.

Currently, the state government gives Rs 2,000 to a man who opts for vasectomy, which has hardly found many takers.

The health and medical department has now decided that it will organise programmes to promote vasectomy every third Wednesday of a month.

395,['12/01/2020'],Shiv Sena MLA Tanaji Sawant’s supporters face heat,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Tanaji Sawant

PUNE: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray struck the first blow on former minister and defiant MLA Tanaji Sawant by expelling his supporter Laxmikant Thonge-Patil, who was the deputy district chief of Solapur unit, for indulging in anti-party activities.

Shiv Sena has also announced the appointment of Purshottam Barde as the new Solapur district unit chief through its party mouthpiece Saamana. Till now, Sawant is in-charge of Solapur district. The moves are being seen as a strong signal to Sawant and his supporters from Marathwada and Solapur that the party would not tolerate any indiscipline.

Sawant was upset at not being appointed a minister in the state cabinet in December. He aligned with the BJP and defeated candidates of the new Maha Vikas Aaghadi in local polls in Osmanabad earlier this week, angering Sena leadership. His decision to go with the BJP is being seen as rebellion within the Sena.

Solapur and Osmanabad leaders of Shiv Sena have been summoned to Mumbai to discuss the situation. Though Sawant’s supporters and detractors have reached Mumbai but he himself did not attend a meeting on Saturday.

A group of Sena leaders from Solapur want Sawant to be removed from the party and are camping in Mumbai. Osmanabad MP Omraje Nimbalkar has already demanded expulsion of Sawant from the party. A strong decision on Sawant is expected in Mumbai, said Sena sources.

In the meantime, the Solapur unit of Shiv Sena is split into two groups and they are engaged in verbal duals. A group of Sena leaders, which was already upset due to the decisions taken by Sawant during Assembly election, has taken aggressive stand, demanding his expulsion from the party. The other group wants him to be removed. The two warring factions in Sena had even put up hoardings against each other in the city.

Sena leaders, who are angry with Sawant, have blamed him for the party’s poor performance in Solapur district in Assembly election. Mahesh Kothe, who was denied ticket and was expelled from the party for rebelling against official party candidate, has also been invited for Mumbai meeting. Narayan Patil, former MLA, who was expelled from party, has also reached Mumbai.

Sources in Sena said that Thackeray is personally handling the issue and sending out a strong message to disgruntled elements in the party. Dilip Mane, who was given ticket at the insistence of Sawant, has also reached Mumbai.

Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Extending further the realm of populist measures, the LDF government is mulling over offering social security pensions for nuns in the state.

According to a communication in this regard, accessed by TOI, the social justice department has been asked to undertake a detailed study on the status of nuns above 60 years of age in the state and the financial commitment the state will have to bear for bringing them in the category under the old-age pension net.

The directorate of social justice would soon undertake the study. The decision was triggered by an application from a group of nuns from Mount Carmel Cloistered Convent, Malayattoor, submitted to social justice minister K K Shailaja. Their complaint said that despite being inmates of the convent, they have no income and are suffering from various kinds of age-related ailments. An earlier application by the same group of nuns before the Malayattoor Neeleeswaram grama panchayat was turned down citing that the inmates of religious centres, convents and old-age homes are not eligible for welfare pensions offered by the state.

Two years ago, another group of sisters from St Anne’s convent at Muttada in the capital, under the Latin Catholic Church, had approached the city corporation requesting pension for unmarried women above 50 years.

The state is offering seven types of welfare pensions at present, namely, agricultural pension (Rs 1,200 per month), Indira Gandhi national old-age pension scheme (Rs 1,200 pm), Indira Gandhi national old-age pension scheme age greater than 75 years (Rs 1,500 pm), Gandhi national disability pension scheme (Rs 1,200 pm), Indira Gandhi national disability pension scheme where disability is more than 80% (Rs 1,300 pm), pension for unmarried women above 50 years (Rs 1,200 pm) and Indira Gandhi national widow pension scheme (Rs 1,200 pm).

The government has been revising the eligibility criteria to draw the welfare pensions from time to time. The general criteria for being eligible for old-age pension scheme that began on August 1, 1996 with a monthly pension amount of Rs 110, include that the applicant must be a destitute where there are no one to look after him or her and such persons who are admitted to any poor home will not be eligible for such pension.

Kerala Catholic Church Reformation Movement executive committee member George Joseph said that the move was a ploy by the church to make it the government’s responsibility to take care of the nuns, after devoting their lives for the church. “There is no justification for their request. They are attracted to the church with big offers and after devoting their lives for the church, it is the church’s responsibility to look after them,” he said.

Chandigarh: City residents can now call the sanitation department of the municipal corporation round the clock for sweeping and non-lifting of garbage.

The move has started for sanitary facilities to residents as the civic body authority has kicked-off the initiative a couple of days ago.

Seven dedicated GPS-enabled vehicles and around 60 employees have been given the task of round the clock sanitation.

Chief sanitary inspector and two sanitary inspectors are monitoring the entire exercise and reporting the same to the senior officers daily.

“We are trying our level best to provide better sanitary services to residents of Chandigarh and secure good ranking in the ‘swachtta survekshan’. This is first of its kind exercise for better sanitary services with dedicated staff and we are hopeful that this new initiative will give better results. Since we have dedicated vehicles and staff for this exercise, vehicles will run in three shifts and each vehicle has one driver and at-least six helpers. All complaints, calls will be attended in a time-bound manner,” said Dr Amirt Warring, medical officer of health, who heads the MC’s sanitation department.

“Since we have released the dedicated complaint number for the public, the same is being advertised through different methods to make people aware about the same,” he added.

Since proper sanitation remained a major challenge for the civic body authority and it is also one of the key reasons of bad ranking, sources in the MC revealed that the authority had recently got over 200 more employees through outsourcing to fill the manpower gap. Most of these employees have been taken on companionate ground.

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi rubbished chief minister V Narayanasamy ’s charges that she has launched efforts to appoint her officer-on-special duty G Theva Neethi Dhas as the state election commissioner.

In an open letter to Narayanasamy, she regretted that the chief minister continues to ‘misinform and mislead’ people. She termed his allegations as figments of his imagination. She said she cannot spare the services of Dhas for other assignments as long as she serves as the lieutenant governor of Puducherry .

“He (Dhas) is indispensable to the lieutenant governor’s office in view of his long and outstanding public services rendered. He provides this office critical institutional memory so essential for me personally coming from outside the region. Hence, please stop spreading falsehood through media as my office needs his services in view of his integrity, vast experience and capability. He too is not interested in any such posts,” Bedi said.

She said the chief minister’s lies are now becoming too frequent to the extent that the day he tells the truth, people may find it hard to believe him.

“Please redeem the reputation of your public office as people of Puducherry deserve to have a trusting chief minister. The matters of appointment of SEC and that of free rice scheme are sub-judice and a judicial verdict from the hon’ble Madras high court is expected any time. Please be patient (if you can be),” said Bedi.

The translation was done by Subhash Bhavsar, a retired school principal.

NASHIK: A book on the life and sacrifices of the 10th guru of Sikhs — Sahib-e-Kamal Guru Gobind Singh — was translated in Marathi and released by Guru Gobind Singh Foundation on Friday.

The translation was done by Subhash Bhavsar, a retired school principal. It was originally written in Urdu by Lala Daulat Rai (Aryasamajist) in 1901, as Arabic was the a prevalent script in North India at that time.

The book was later translated in Gurmukhi (Punjabi) in 1979 and then further translated in Hindi, English, Gujarati, Bangla, Japanese and Spanish. Bhavsar finally translated it from Hindi to Marathi.

The book is published by Harbans Singh, who had inspired Bhavsar to translate the book. “I know Marathi but I am not a writer. But when I read the book given to me by my friend Harbans Singh, I could not stop myself from translating it. The publication of the book is an enrichment of Marathi language,” said Bhavsar.

The publisher Harbans Singh told TOI, “We are born and brought up in Maharashtra and we are well versed with the Marathi culture. It was my wish to explain our culture to Marathi speakers. Bhavsar was moved after reading the book and decided to translate it. We are really grateful to him.”

The Hindi version of the book is 292 pages long which Bhavsar translated in six months. “Within six months, the book is out in our hands. He had finished the translation quite soon and then I proofread it several times. I also gave it to a few colleagues to go through it so that there is no error in the translation. Wherever Bhavsar was stuck in translating, my colleagues helped without changing its meaning,” added Harbans Singh.

Thus, the accused does not deserve any leniency under Probation of Offenders Act 1958. So, convict Ashok Mittal is sentenced to undergo a rigorous imprisonment of one year for commission of offence punishable under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. Further ends of justice would be best served if the convict is directed to pay compensation.”

The court order further reads, “The convict, Ashok Mittal, is directed to pay compensation under Section 357(3) of CrPC to the complainant amounting to Rs 2 crores i.e. double the cheque amount of Rs 1 crore within a period of one-month of expiry of period prescribed for appeal.”

It was stated in the compliant that the accused had friendly relationship with the family of the complainant. The complainant is a kitty member of kitties being organised and run by the accused. After multiple financial transactions, the accused saught help of Rs 1 crore from the complainant. He then issued cheques to the complainant and all the cheques were returned unpaid due to insufficient funds on December 10, 2014. A legal notice dated December 29, 2014, was served to the accused, but he did not discharge the legal liability towards them. Accordingly, the complaint was filed in the court.

Mohali: Various students unions of Punjab take to streets in Mohali on Saturday in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The unions of Punjab students’ union and Naujwan Bharat Sabha staged a protest and took siege of the road near the YPS crossing. They held the protest for around 4 hours.

The protestors said the Act was anti-secular and anti-constitutional. The Act would single out a community which was against the secularism.

The CAA has invited sharp criticism over the exclusion of the Muslim community from the neighboring countries. Earlier during this year, hundreds of supporters of Pagaam Punjab organised a peaceful protest in solidarity with the students and alert citizens who have been protesting to protect the idea of India and its Constitution.

Supported by various retired Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officers, including S R Ladhar, a human chain was formed along the Airport road in front of Singh Shaheedan Gurdwara to raise voice against the CAA.

Led by Ranbir Randhawa, leader of Punjab students’ union, and Rupinder Chaunda, leader of Naujwan Bharat Sabha, supported by hundreds of students, took siege of the road leading to Chandigarh where they were stopped by the Chandigarh police.

The protestors wore black ribbons holding placards depicting anti-CAA bill slogans.

However, the protest was called off after a memorandum addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi was handed over to the special officer deputed by the Punjab government.

Representative image

KOCHI: The Supreme Court order to prepare a list of CRZ violations in the state is the most significant outcome of the case relating to the Maradu flats, according to a former Kerala State Coastal Management Authority official.

The Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the four apartment blocks on a petition filed by the KCZMA . The court also asked the chief secretary to submit a report on all buildings that have come up in the state violating CRZ norms.

“The government is now obligated to prepare a list of violators. Interim reports have been prepared. Some the district collectors have even begun to convene public hearings. The owners of buildings suspected to have violated CRZ norms can present their case before the collectors,” he said.

The government will consolidate the report, prepare a final list and submit it before SC . “We can expect the court to direct concerned authorities to initiate action. A directive similar to the one issued in the case of the Maradu flats could be issued.”

KCZMA’s battle started in 2012. “Despite listing out the buildings which were suspected to have violated CRZ norms and sending it to local bodies, no action was initiated. Without the local bodies vetting the list it would not be possible for KCZMA to proceed with legal action against the illegal constructions,” the former official said

“The local bodies will have to verify whether buildings previously existed on the spot or whether there were any reconstructed structures. Only local bodies can confirm these aspects. But they never came back to KCZMA.” Though KCZMA cannot take direct action against illegal builders, they can report violations to district collectors, he added.

Chandigarh: The Uttarakhand school of Ridhima Pandey waits to hear the 11-year-old global climate activist, while she speaks at the Indian Institutes of Technology and big companies all over the country, and now TEDX here on Sunday.

This girl from Class VIII shoulders the double burden of fighting the Indian government in the Supreme Court along with preparing for her board examinations due from January 15. She has a packed fortnight of talks and seminars to make students aware of environmental crisis. She said: ‘I wait for the day when I’ll address my school mates about the issues about which I spread awareness across the country. I had chance to address only two sections if them. Thin turnout cancelled a few assemblies, while a few other times, schedules didn’t match.”

She was four when a devastating flood hit Uttarakhand in 2013 and she asked her parents about who was responsible for the death of all those children in the disaster. They guided her about climate change, which turned her into an environmental activist. Dissatisfied with NGT that dismissed her application for stronger efforts by India, she moved the SC a year ago.

In 2019, she was invited to the Climate Action Summit at the United Nations General Assembly. On September 20 last year, she joined Greta Thunberg’s now famous global climate strike in New York. She spoke at the XYNETO exchange conference in Norway about climate change. Recently, Sweden’s king Carl XVI Gustaf and queen Silvia interacted with her in Rishikesh.

CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court has issued notice to the municipal corporation (MC), Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (Gmada), deputy commissioner (DC) and Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (Puda) on a PIL seeking removal of paver blocks from within a radius of 2 metres of trees in markets, green belts and parking lots.

The matter would come up for hearing on May 4.

H C Arora, the counsel for the petitioner, NGO Save My Trees Foundation India, said trees are decaying and dying, with the greenery in the city being destroyed.

He said root aeration is necessary for the safety and survival of trees but the corporation has installed paver blocks along the roads in sectors 52 to 61 and onwards touching their stems. As a result, most trees have died, and the remaining are on their death bed, he said.

The petition said spots earmarked for trees along the roads have not been spared and paver blocks installed on them. It was further submitted that in laying paver blocks and putting concrete/bitumen close to the stems of the trees, the civic body has overlooked the fact that the roots of the trees and green belt are also helpful in recharging the groundwater.

“By destroying standing and pouring concrete in spaces for them, the MC is destroying the environment and ecology of the town and preventing groundwater recharging. The lanes of paver blocks in areas other than footpaths of 5ft width will result in total runoff water, which will further result in flooding of downstream areas of Mohali, the petition said.

Going by the company’s current m-cap, the 65.12% stake bought from BG Group is now valued at Rs 11,763 crore, which is nearly five times the money paid by the state government at the time of acquisition.After having acquired the controlling stake from BG Group, GSPC and its affiliates also made an open offer to acquire additional shares from the public. At present, Gujarat government through its companies holds 74.68% in GGL and its valuation is around Rs 13,498 crore. In the past one year alone, GGL’s share price has galloped by 94% from Rs 134.35 on January 10, 2018.“GGL has been managed very well and that is what the investors have liked. The company has delivered in terms of growth expectations. At the same time, they maintained the balance sheet strength and gave consistent earnings growth and also ensured that return ratios are attractive,” said Harshvardhan Dole, vice-president, IIFL Securities.The company also received a shot in the arm after the National Green Tribunal ordered shutting down of coal gasifiers in Morbi, which is the largest gas consuming cluster in India. “With several tilemakers switching to natural gas, the demand for GGL’s piped natural gas (PNG) has almost doubled in this area and it has resulted into higher volume growth,” said a stock analyst.GGL became the largest city gas distribution company after the merger of erstwhile Gujarat Gas Company Ltd and GSPC Gas Ltd in 2015. It continued to bag natural gas retailing licences for new cities during the eight, ninth and tenth round of CGD auction by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB). Currently, the company has gas retailing licences for 41 cities.“The new (CGD) licences that the company has bagged have helped improve the growth visibility. Based on these licences, there is a clear growth visibility for next 10 years,” Dole added.“GGL has seen improved margins on the back of volume growth and weak LNG prices globally due to supply glut. The company’s profits have surged fifteen times during the period from FY14 to FY19,” said Vaibhav Shah, MD, Monarch Networth Capital.“Profits are likely to rise further due to higher volume growth in FY20 following an increase in demand for natural gas after the NGT’s order regarding Morbi,” Shah added.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209654,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-280657,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/gujarat-govt-strikes-gold-ggl-stake-value-jumps-five-fold/articleshow/73209163.cms

The spot of explosion

KOLKATA: More than 48 hours after a massive explosion damaged around 156 houses at Naihati on Thursday, a team of forensic experts visited the spot on Saturday to collect samples, raising concerns about disappearance of proper evidence .

Barrackpore cops were defusing firecrackers and explosive materials simultaneously, when the explosion took place.

District administrative officials identified around 156 homes damaged in the blast, clicked their photographs and sent them to the higher authorities so that compensation can be paid to the victims, as declared by chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

Barrackpore’s BJP MP Arjun Singh alleged deliberate negligence by the state administration. “Forensic experts were sent late on purpose so that crucial evidence was already destroyed. Illegal firecracker units here have turned into crude bomb-making factories at the behest of the administration.” Trinamool MLA Partha Bhowmik said, “Singh and his men are associated with the bomb-making trade. So he has details of such units.”

Education minister Suresh Kumar launched Sarada Vilas Advanced Research Centre in Mysuru on Saturday

MYSURU: Making the public stand in a queue in front of government schools for admission before completing my tenure is the biggest dream of my life, said S Suresh Kumar, minister for primary and secondary education.

Participating in a two question and answer session at Sarada Vilasa Educational Institutions and Kautilya Vidyalaya, he said that today our schools are divided into convent, middle level, and government schools. “I am trying to bring a uniform education system. If everyone agrees, I will implement it from the coming years,” he said.

Stating that today's education system is not enough for the competitive world, he stated that the students must determine to achieve something in their life. “We shall not become a burden to our society. Instead, we shall become a hope for all. In the new education policy, stress is given to make a person a complete human being along with the competitive education,” he said.

“Students need to write more. They must get ready for the competitive world. That is why we are changing the question paper pattern,” he said.

On the facilities in government schools, he said that the state government is receiving funds from Union government to give mid-day meal till Class VIII. “But we are giving till Class X. This year, hundreds of classrooms were damaged in floods. We are repairing them,” he said.

“In the North Karnataka region, even today government schools are functioning well. If the public extends support, we can save government schools everywhere,” he said.

“Today, starting an educational institution has become a business. Schools have become like jails. Students run away from the school once the last bell rings. We must try to change this,” he said.

He also stated that efforts are being made to ban tobacco farming by encouraging the farmers to grow alternative crops.

424,['12/01/2020'],Just $1 more per person can cut suicides by 6%: American study,"This story is from January 12, 2020

MUMBAI: An addition of as little as $1 (or Rs 72) to minimum wages could reduce suicides in the US by up to 6% annually, suggests a new American study. This study came a few days ahead of the National Crime Records Bureau's 2018 data that revealed that seven out of 10 suicides were by India's poor who earned less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. Experts say social and environmental factors in suicides should not be downplayed but considered as important as mental health factors.

Dr Debasish Basu, editor of the Indian Journal of Social Psychiatry and professor at PGIMER Chandigarh, said basic social drivers of suicides are more important on a ""macro scale than biological factors"". He said while individual factors of suicide such as genetics, developmental or early childhood issues play a role, the social and economic factors cannot be ""emphasised enough"".

Here's another detail from NCRB data that underlines poverty as a deciding factor in suicides: 12,936 unemployed people committed suicide in 2018, higher than the number of farmers (10,349) who took their lives.

The 25-year-long American study published in the indexed Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health last week said that between 1990 and 2015, raising the minimum wage by $1 in each state might have saved more than 27,000 lives. An increase of $2 in each state's minimum wage could have prevented more than 57,000 suicides, the study added.

Consider Brazil, which in 2003 introduced the Bolsa Familia Programme to provide low-income families with cash transfers on the condition that they send their children to school and ensure that they are properly vaccinated. A study published in the May 2019 edition of Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology said that municipal areas that offered higher cash transfers over a three-year period witnessed a reduced suicide rate.

Suicides, said Pune-based psychiatrist Soumitra Pathare, are an intersectoral problem and mental health is only one aspect. ""Verbal autopsies have shown that 50% of the people who commit suicide did not show any mental health problems or symptoms,"" he said.

Unfortunately in India, suicide by farmers is seen as a social issue, while suicides by non-farmers as a mental health issue. ""We miss the obvious fact that every suicide is a mix of social and mental health issues,"" the psychiatrist added.

Pathare said that it is important to underline to people as well as the administration that suicides are preventable. ""We need policy interventions and the community needs to get serious about checking the number of suicides,"" he added.

Mumbai-based psychiatrist Harish Shetty said the government needs to expand pro-poor policies. ""The increases in suicide rates are a consequence of fewer mental health professionals and low priority by the state. A mental health policy is a must, with a focused ministry with a mental health minister at the Centre and in states. Even districts and cities need mental health commissioners,"" Shetty said.

A meeting was held at the civic headquarters where its health wing doctors expressed concerns over rising number of malaria cases among Kolkata’s pavement dwellers especially in large parts of central and northern Kolkata

After a detailed discussion, it was decided that the KMC health department will press into service mobile medical vans that will do rounds in central Kolkata pavements from next month with an objective to collect blood samples from pavement dwellers.

A KMC health department official said the samples would be tested to prove whether the danger of malaria was lurking in the areas where the civic body had registered the maximum cases in 2019.

“We have targeted Taltala, SN Banerjee Road, Elliot Road, Park Street and its adjacent localities, and our mobile teams will visit these areas to collect blood samples,” said KMC deputy mayor Atin Ghosh.

Items on display for the swap meet at Besant Nagar’s TNHB Community Hall

Last year, Greater Chennai Corporation had rolled out a smokeless Bhogi drive to sensitize people against the ritualistic burning of tyres, plastic and household items in a symbolic heralding of new beginnings as it led to a spike in air pollution levels.

In 2020, they decided to start a sustainability campaign — urging people to donate or swap goods ahead of Bhogi Pongal (January 14) instead of throwing it away or burning it. The drive has generated truckloads of goods, say officers of the corporation, who were busy all of Friday racing against time to sort out donated items at the TNHB Community Hall in Besant Nagar, where the swap meet is set to take place this weekend.

“Chennaiites have been generous. We have received everything from furniture, gas stoves, clothes and books to handbags, cycles and stoves. Some of the items are new. We have arranged mini trucks to get everything to the venue of the meet,” says Priyadarshini S, who handled the swap-drop in Saidapet. Her counterpart Viji at Guindy rounded up a collection that included crockery, kitchen appliances and even refrigerators. “We will be placing values on each of the items and those who come to the meet can barter with items of an equivalent value,” says Viji. The idea, say corporation staff, is to exchange materials which can be reused by others so that the total consumption of the society as a whole can be brought down.

It isn’t just the corporation that is taking the 3R route of reduce, reuse, and recycle, residents too are organizing meets and drives to make the city cleaner this Pongal.

At Rani Meyammai Towers (RMT) in MRC Nagar, residents got together on Thursday and Friday to host a swap meet where they free-cycled or exchanged household goods from vases and baby sterilisers to kitchen appliances and photo frames. The ‘give and take’ event was the second that the green team at RMT hosted, the first had taken place ahead of Diwali, another time in the year when people look to discarding items. “We are planning to hold these swap meets before every major festival to reduce waste,” says Arulpriya S, part of the team. The items that remained have been sorted and are being donated to the corporation’s swap meet, she adds.

In Semmancheri, Nishaal Guzzar, a Class XI student of BVM Global, who heads the Garden City Youth for Change movement in his apartment complex, is hosting a Pongal tree planting drive on Saturday between 7am and 10am. “We expect around 75 students to participate. There is also a composting seminar after the tree planting,” says Nishaal, who adds that the idea is to have a cleaner city during Pongal and not pollute.

BENGALURU: For the past few years, Manjesh has been a freelance physical fitness trainer. He enjoyed the work, and was happy with the money that he made. “I used to train people at local gyms, and at places like SnapFitness. There were always people who wanted personal attention given to their gym routines, and they would pay me for my advice and support,” he says.

But that model no longer works. “Nowadays these app-based fitness centres and their workouts have become really fashionable. These centres have eaten into our livelihood, primarily clients opting for personal training,” Manjesh says. He’s looking for a change of career.

Say you want a resolution

More often than not, “these centres” refer to the CultFit chain of gymnasiums. And for CultFit, the reliance on personal trainers at traditional gyms presented an opportunity. “What happens when someone joins a gym? You make a resolution on New Years Day and you join a gym. And a gym membership costs money. You go to the gym, but most of the trainers are busy with their own clients. They don’t have much time for you, if you aren’t being trained by them. The floor trainer has a limited amount of time, and you feel ignored – unless you are willing to shell out more for personalized attention. All this is discouraging, and people find their gym attendance trailing off after the initial enthusiasm,” says Naresh Krishnaswamy, head of growth and business at CureFit. According to him, this business model also forces trainers to become salespeople. “And that’s not their core strength,” he says.

The app-based model provides benefits that make attendance much higher, according to Krishnaswamy. “There are reminders that you have a session coming out. If you have to cancel a class that you are unable to attend, you can do so up to an hour before the actual class begins, at no cost,” he says.

Growing strong

CultFit is the physical fitness part of the healthcare and wellness startup, CureFit. CureFit was started in 2016 by Myntra co-founder Mukesh Bansal and senior Flipkart executive Ankit Nagori, and was last valued at $500 million in 2019. CureFit then invested in Cult, a fitness centre run by brothers Rishab and Ritesh Telang – and Rishab Telang is now responsible for the fitness of Cult and its members.

From one gym in early 2016, the chain now has 270 centres across India – and as part of its first step overseas, Dubai – and over a 100 in Bengaluru alone.

Despite the rapid growth, there haven’t been issues with scaling, says Krishnaswamy. “It’s something that we have planned for. There were two things that we needed to worry about – the real estate aspect and the quality of trainers and the standard of training.” To handle the first, the company has a team of real estate scouts combing target areas for good locations, and back-office systems that can ensure that a centre can be up and running within 45 days of signing the contract. And as for the second, the company adopted a specific strategy to ensure a steady supply of trainers.

A matter of training

“We go to tier 2 and tier 3 cities, and look for sports people. Now sportspersons are already fitness conscious. But usually, by the age of 25, they have either gone national – or are deciding whether to go for a different kind of job – a desk job, or maybe sales. We offer them the chance to stay with something that’s important to them, to stay fit,” says Krishnaswamy.

These recruits are then trained in one of the company’s three training centres – and the focus of the training is on handling groups of people, and communicating with them. The company also provides support to its trainers in the areas of finding a place to live, getting appropriate transport to and from work, and nutrition, Krishnaswamy says. “They only need to concentrate on the class and the participants. Unlike traditional gyms, they are not required to sell services. Their evaluation depends only on customer feedback, and therefore, on how well they ran the session,” he says.

According to Vikas Arora, a 32-year-old marketing manager, and a member of the company’s Fraser Town centre, it works. “Their trainers are good, they are so enthusiastic, they will pump you up during class and motivate you to want to try different workouts,” he says.

Healthy criticism?

Traditional trainers disagree. “These centres don’t appreciate the value of personalized training. They have no place for people with experience,” says Manjesh. And it’s not just people who provide one-on-one training who feel uncomfortable. “They don’t want to recruit people with adequate experience but hire beginners who they can pay peanuts. As I understand it, these centres have a few well-qualified fitness trainers who they keep shuffling to new centres to attract the first batch of clients. Later the training job is handed over to amateurs,” says Neeraja, a trainer who works with a south Bengaluru gym.

The company’s focus on large class size is a problem, says Nishita Chinappa, a trainer at city gym. “I know of cases where clients have got hurt because of bad equipment or bad training. A client had to be carried out in an ambulance once. The numbers game is bad when it comes to specialised fitness programmes. I’ll explain this with an example. In a CrossFit class, the recommended ratio of student to trainer is supposed to be 10:1 because that enables the trainer to focus on every student closely. In CultFit the ratio is 25:1: how will one trainer be able to lend personal attention to all 25 students? Also, the space in every CultFit centre is so cramped up, that is because their goal is to minimise space (per person) to maximise revenue,” she says.

Arora, who is a fan (he calls the app-based model ‘the idiot’s guide to physical fitness’ and appreciates the professionalism of Cult’s ‘American Corporate setup where things work like clockwork) acknowledges these issues. “The drawbacks are that there is no personal attention: these are group classes with a lot of students, after all. This also means that they may not see if a particular workout suits you or not. The centre can get cramped during peak hours,” he says.

Number crunches

An advantage for these centres is that they do not have to invest in the things a traditional gym has to. “There are no treadmills. There are no chest exercise machines or leg presses. And they’re not needed – because only one person can use them at a time. You have to wait till someone finishes their turn. Whereas you can do all the strength training you want with the efficient use of barbells and dumbbells. In fact, strength training is one of our most popular programmes,” says Krishnaswamy.

It also makes good economic sense. And traditional gyms, whether they are high-end operations or little neighbourhood rooftop affairs, are finding it harder to compete.

“Today, if I want to open a fitness centre out of passion, I cannot do it because I cannot afford it. CultFit has made it so. So they will either buy me out or set up their centre near mine and their money power will ensure that I shut down. This is how all the good gyms in the city – like Volt Fitness, Apple Fitness, Fitness First have shut. They have created a monopoly,” says Chinappa. “Five years ago, small gyms in neighbourhoods were doing decent business with local clients. Now they’re all going out of business,” says Santosh Kumar, a fitness coach from Cooke’s Town.

But for CultFit, it’s all upside. “Our customer ratings are increasing year on year. Our trainer attrition rate is just 1.5 percent,” says Krishnaswamy.

430,['12/01/2020'],Kolkata lauds Martin Sheen’s Tagore recital,"This story is from January 12, 2020

KOLKATA: That Tagore has transcended timeline and time zones was proved once again when Hollywood actor Martin Sheen recited “Where the Mind Is Without Fear” at a climate change protest at a Fire Drill Fridays event in Washington DC on January 10. Sheen and ‘ Joker ’ star Joaquin Phoenix were the latest celebrities to be arrested at this week’s Fire Drill Fridays, started by actor Jane Fonda .

Sheen’s India connection goes back to the days of shooting for ‘Gandhi’ in Delhi, Porbandar and Mumbai and for ‘Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain’ in Hyderabad. Tannishtha Chatterjee, his co-actor in ‘Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain’, in which he played the Union Carbide boss, said, “Sheen really believes in things. When we worked in this film, he didn’t do it not only because he was a hired actor but also because he believed the story had to be told. A poet inspires people because he understands universal human predicament. Tagore’s lines inspired Sheen so much that he recited them at the event.” Describing the poem as a Tagore masterpiece, Chatterjee said it was “extremely relevant in a democratic society”. “Sheen’s recitation shows how Tagore has been inspiring people from different cultures across generations, centuries and political histories,” Chatterjee said.

Poet Subodh Sarkar remembered how Sheen recited Tagore in 2016 as well, urging Americans to vote. “I think he has consciously used the word ‘heart’ instead of ‘mind’ in his recitation. It’s incredible that a poem written more than a century ago is still so relevant,” Sarkar said.

Having travelled abroad, poet Srijato is privy to Tagore’s popularity worldwide. “I feel good that on such an occasion, poetry has become the language of protest. That holds true for a student as well as a Hollywood star,” he said. Poet Prabal Kumar Basu agreed: “We have always sought strength from Tagore’s poetry. As a Bengali poet, hearing Sheen’s recitation gave me immense joy. This is how poets contribute to society, breaking the language barrier.”

But Sarkar found “irony” in the timing of the arrest. “The sheer timing of his recitation takes his arrest to a different level,” Sarkar said.

PUNE: Commuters using the Swargate grade separator are appalled by the poor condition of the underpass and want the authorities in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) to fix the problems at the earliest to eliminate chances of accidents.The grade separator, which connects Shankarsheth Road to Sarasbaug, is used by hundreds of vehicles every day. Bikers have said besides the carriageway, mud and garbage is lying unattended on both sides of the road inside the grade separator.The lids of drainage channels are broken and have become uneven at many spots inviting trouble for riders. There is a continuous flow of drain water inside the facility which has made the road slippery, the commuters said.The facility was thrown open in 2017. It has two lanes with one-way traffic flow towards Sarasbaug chowk. Regular users have said within the first few months the underpass developed potholes, leakages and suffers from poor lighting.Ajay Salunkhe, who uses the facility daily, said the entire carriageway inside the grade separator had developed huge potholes during the monsoon . Repairs have been done now but the road surface has become uneven post repairs. The repaired patches are visible.Aditi Joshi, a teacher in a private school, said water has been seeping from the walls of the underpass for months. There are channels for water to drain out but it still flows on the carriageway making it accident prone.This proves that the drain system was not done properly. Also, authorities must find out the source of water to stop the flow permanently. It is dangerous, especially for bikers, to negotiate the wet carriageway, Joshi said.The civic authorities said the maintenance and repairs of grade separator were still with MSRDC. A senior official in the PMC said, “We have written to the MSRDC highlighting the problems and have urged them to initiate corrective steps. The civic body also cleaned up the grade separator recently,” the official added.Officials in the MSRDC said they were working on an option to keep the grade separator closed for traffic for a day to initiate repair works. The plan is being chalked out, officials said.This is hardly the first time a key civic facility has been in a state of disrepair. The oft-delayed underpass at Ramwadi — a key conduit to the Pune airport — was in the news for all the wrong reasons last year.The underpass, a portion of which was completed after many hurdles, was decked up for its big opening with murals singing paeans to Swachh Bharat Mission and the cleanliness survey. Almost immediately, the underpass was marred by water leakages from the supporting walls and its ceiling. Frequent users had complained that the leakages made carriageways on both flanks extremely slippery and dangerous to drive on.Potholes and poor-quality roads are also a regular sight in the city during the monsoon, with the incessant rains eroding many a carriageway, making for a bumpy and dangerous ride.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73210013,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-661674,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/bikers-are-at-risk-on-slushy-swargate-grade-separator/articleshow/73208565.cms
432,['12/01/2020'],Traders ready to take bus to ease traffic in old markets,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Indore: To ease traffic in traditional markets, Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) is identifying routes to provide better bus connectivity for traders, so they can shun their vehicles and use public transport to work.

“We’ve recently conducted a survey of traditional markets of Rajwada and nearby areas. We found that most of the available parking space in market areas is used by vehicles of shopkeepers and this leaves no space for visitors and customers and due to space crunch, they park their vehicles on roads,” IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh said.

He said that they were working on identifying dedicated bus routes to provide an alternative commute option for shopkeepers to travel between their home and shops. “Timing of buses would be planned as per the convenience of shopkeepers, so they don’t have to rely on their vehicles,” he added.

Vardhman Nagar, Usha Nagar, Jairampur Colony, Chhatribag, Manikbag, Bijalpur, Gauri Nagar, Sukhliya, Malwa Mill, and Lalaram Nagar are among the list of tentative areas where most of the shopkeepers reside and require proper city bus connectivity option.

AICTSL’s chief executive officer Sandeep Soni said that there are around 15000 people including shopkeepers and their workers who need to be covered. “We will provide good connectivity of city buses from all identified areas. We would also increase frequency of city bus service and improvise their timings if we already have our buses running on these routes,” he added.

TOI on Saturday spoke to traders’ associations of some of these markets to check if they would agree to shun using their vehicles if they have direct bus connectivity option.

While some of them said that the arrangement would be a big relief for them as well as for their customers, others recommended availability of buses during early morning and late evening hours with a city bus every half-an-hour’s gap.

“No shopkeeper will use his vehicle if there's proper connectivity of public transport. This would not only ease traffic congestion, but also increase footfall as consumers will have adequate space on roads to park their vehicle,” said Arun Bakliwal of cloth market association.

433,['12/01/2020'],Pune: Indian onions fetch higher prices than imported ones from Turkey in Chakan,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Traders said homegrown onions are better suited to the Indian tastebuds

PUNE: Onions imported from Turkey are no match for the Indian variety. They simply do not suit the desi taste. And the buck stops there.

Naturally, the imported fetched lower prices than the Indian variety in Chakan. Vendors, people and traders preferred buying Indian onions at higher price than the imported consignment from Turkey in an open auction conducted at Chakan onion market on Friday.

Turkey’s onions got prices in the range of Rs30 to Rs35 per kg. Aapla (Indian) onion was sold between Rs40 and Rs55 per kg.

“The sole reason is the taste,” said Govind Daundkar, the in-charge of the market, on Saturday.

“The imported onions look attractive, but they are not spicy. They do not taste like the Indian ones,” he said.

About 10 tonnes of imported onions were brought to the market for the first time to control the spiralling prices of the kitchen staple.

“Many hoteliers and small-time eateries had been requesting us to control the prices, but it is not possible in the current situation. To provide relief to them, some traders had come with the imported onions, but they did not make much of a difference,” Daundkar said.

The imported variety did provide some relief to hoteliers, though. Daundkar said. “More than 50% imported onions were purchased by hoteliers and dhaba owners.”

The prices of onions had soared to Rs100 to Rs120 per kg in the second week of December. Now, the prices had dipped significantly in the wholesale and local vegetable markets in Pune, a source said.

“The new harvest of onions has started coming in to tehsil and Pune markets. As a result, prices have remained stable across. This will continue for the next few weeks as there will be adequate supply of fresh onions. The old stock has been exhausted now,” said wholesale onion trader BS Dighe of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune.

Residents of Lavasa approached the Prime Minister’s office and the state government to help speed up the reviv... Read More

PUNE: Mumbai-based Oberoi Realty Group and New York’s financial services group Interups Inc have submitted their Expression of Interest (EoI) for the revival of the Lavasa hill station project.

Residents of Lavasa told TOI that the Oberoi Group and Interups Inc had put out their EoI on December 27 and January 6, respectively. According to sources in the know, the final hearing at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is expected on January 20.

“We are happy that there are more people keen on reviving the project,” said resident Suresh Goswami.

Along with other members, Goswami has even approached the Prime Minister’s Office and the state government to help speed up the revival of the project as the residents are facing innumerable hardships as of now.

The other bidders who have made similar submissions include Pune-based realtor Aniruddha Deshpande, Haldiram Snacks as well as UV Asset Reconstruction Company

The presentation of the resolution plans was made in the Committee of Creditor’s (COC) meeting held recently. The final decision closure was to take place by the end of December. However, since the COC was not satisfied, a decision was taken to wait for further bids.

At the COC meeting, it was also discussed that the old applicants may raise concerns regarding the acceptance of new Resolution Applicants (RAs) at the advanced stage. Nevertheless, residents are of the opinion that a maximum number of bidders would help encourage competitive bidding.

The NCLT had, in August last year, accepted a petition by the creditors of Lavasa Corporation Limited (LCL) to declare the company bankrupt. It appointed a resolution professional to find a solution to the financial crisis being faced by the LCL. Until June, the resolution professional did not receive any bids to take over the project.

According to sources, LCL owed Rs5,559.14 crore to financial creditors and around Rs400 crore to property buyers in the project. While the three bids came up in October, the COC decided to seek more time from the NCLT for the debt resolution of Lavasa Corporation Limited after the bids made by Haldiram Snacks and Pune-based real estate builder Anirudh Deshpande.

Earlier, the Lavasa residents had sent a petition to the Prime Minister’s Office, requesting the central ministry of housing and urban affairs to revive the hill station project under the Smart Cities Mission.

435,['12/01/2020'],"Police-mannequin on duty, keep an eye out","This story is from January 12, 2020

BENGALURU: If the surviving few of a Japanese village find solace in the presence of stuffed dolls representing past residents (Soft Copy, Jan 5), the Bengaluru police have found another use of life-size models. These are mannequins in full uniform, reflector jackets and sunglasses posted at strategic – but changing – locations to “monitor” the city’s maddening traffic.

Reports quoting the police say the 250 new “recruits” have already been assigned posts where 4,500 “real” policemen cannot be. Impressed, a team from the Paris police was in Bengaluru to gather details about this new deployment. Early this month, the Karimnagar Commissionerate (Telangana), bought a few mannequins, with a plan to fix magnetic cameras on them for live surveillance. Whether the idea gets finally adopted by the Préfecture de Police for the streets of Paris or not, it has certainly caught the attention of motorists and pedestrians. City police commissioner Bhaskar Rao, the man behind the project, says he was struck by the brainwave after he saw a scarecrow in a paddy field.

So the mannequins serve two basic purposes: manage activity in the face of staff shortage, and secondly, deter violators with the image of a “live” policeman. In a country where we seem to need police presence at every intersection, the symbolic presence of a constable in some key locations matters. More so, to acknowledge its “scarecrow” utility in a city where road discipline is as rare as wings upon a cat.

Cynics are likely to argue that scarecrows do show a slump in their progress card. They’ll quote studies to say that if this object has to deter birds, it has to have realistic bodily features, and it must move its position frequently. If it can flail its arms and shout, then it’s closer to being bloody real. A plain vanilla model of two crossed sticks, a mud pot, a bundle of straw, burlap sacks and workhouse clothes can hardly make a scarecrow that’s forbidding enough for the birds. A gaunt and leaden effigy could end up making an ideal perch for them. As country folk everywhere say, a good scarecrow is one near which a wayfarer stops to ask for directions.

Nobody likes a close shave with traffic cops these days, what with the steep fines and hand-held technology that catches up with past sins, the most popular example being that of a delivery boy caught last year for 53 violations. So, it isn’t uncommon to notice “gentlemanly alerts” by motorists warning helmetless riders coming up the way, of policemen doing their job at the other end. You can see the glee on the defaulting two-wheeler rider as he acknowledges the caution sheepishly and leans into a tight U-turn, thereby committing two more offences. The young man, you surmise, must have had earlier experiences when he turned sharply into a backstreet only to be detained by cops behind a tree. If such jolts make them jump out of their skin, then the sight of a mannequin in the distance, could well, drive them into dodging the law again. The image of a cop has almost a totemic significance in them, inducing anxiety and panic.

An octogenarian civic activist at TOI’s civic engagement events two decades ago had an account to narrate from the 1960s. “In the lanes of old Bangalore, be it Chamarajpet or Chickpet, cycling in the night without a dynamo-powered light put you at risk. These would be regular beat constables, not traffic cops. One night when I was riding home after a late-night movie show, a constable virtually pounced on me in a narrow street. He seemed to be waiting for young offenders like me in the awning of a shop. It was dark, because the nearest functioning streetlight was at least a furlong away. I asked the cop how fair it was for him to haul me up for not riding without a lamp when public utilities had failed. `Precisely for that reason,’ he said and shut me up. I had to part with the two annas I had. Funnily, there was no way I could have spotted him too.”

Quite so, the mannequin could serve its purpose. If it gets an eye in the form of a camera and a voice, gentle or booming as the situation might warrant, the model might appear more authentic. Or would ventriloquy make it less real? Be that as it may, there’s no ignoring the attention a traffic cop gets on the road. As the uniformed man patrolling the streets would say: “The idea is to not intimidate them, but you can’t help it. The moment they see us amidst them, there’s a sudden stiffness all around. Shoulders straighten, the feet seem to have come off the accelerator, and eyes are fixed on the road or the signal. A couple of them are actually allowing you room to go ahead…”

MUZAFFARNAGAR: District magistrate Selva Kumari J has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the death of Noor Mohammad, a youth who was shot at during violence at anti-CAA stir in Muzaffarnagar on December 20 and he later died at a Meerut hospital. Noor was a resident of minority-dominated Kalhapur area in the district and an FIR under section 302 (murder) of IPC has already been registered against unidentified assailants based on the complainant of the deceased’s family.

Additional district magistrate Amit Singh said, “The family made a complaint that Noor Mohammad was killed by rioters and a case of murder was registered at Civil Lines police station. Now, police have requested to conduct a magisterial inquiry. Anyone can produce any evidence related to Noor Mohammed’s murderers.”

Noor Mohammad, 24, was killed on December 20 when, according to his family, he was returning home after purchasing medicine for his one and half-year-old daughter who was not keeping well. The incident had taken place on Arya Samaj road where police and protesters clashed. He was shot by someone and died on the way to a hospital in Meerut.

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi has visited Noor Mohammad’s house and met his wife who is seven months pregnant. He was the sole earning member of his family. “It’s heart-wrenching. His wife who is seven months pregnant and has one-and-a-half-year-old daughter is left all alone,” she said.

“Wherever injustice has happened, we will stand by the people and help them in whatever way possible,” the Congress leader said.

After the December 20 violence, as many as 47 cases were filed at city kotwali against 250 named and thousands unidentified people under various sections. A total of 80 people have been arrested so far. An SIT formed to probe all anti-CAA violence-related cases is also investigating the case.

437,['12/01/2020'],A zero-waste juice stall in Malleswaram,"This story is from January 12, 2020

BENGALURU: If you go to the Sai Baba temple on Malleswaram ’s Sampige Road – especially on a Thursday, you’ll find it tough going. The temple is usually packed, with lines of worshippers spilling out on to the pavement. And you’ll find a crowd outside a tiny shop standing adjacent to the temple as well. Here, underneath a cheerful red signboard, with the words Eat Raja (Raja written in Kannada) you’ll find a crowd of people drinking juice. Nothing special about that, right? After all, there are probably thousands of such juicebars that dot Bengaluru.

But this one is different. Cups, straws and tissues, the elements of a regular juice shop are absent. Instead, you’ll find people drinking the juice out of the fruits. “We are a zero-waste juice bar and the only one in Bengaluru,” says Anandraj BSN, the owner of the establishment, with pride.

Anandraj was once well-known in media circles as Beat Raja during his stint as a radio jockey, reporting extensively on FM radio on what was going on in Bengaluru. “People knew me as Beat Raja because for over a decade I covered the Bengaluru city beat for various FM radio stations. Now, I’m selling concepts and experiences through my juice bar,” says the former RJ.

Anandraj’s switch from Beat Raja to Eat Raja took place in September 2017 after his father BS Nagaraj passed away leaving behind the juice shop and travel agency on Sampige Road which he successfully ran since the 1970s. Anandraj was a pro behind the microphone but had no clue about the operation of a juice shop. “After my father’s demise we downed the shutters for nearly six months without any clue what to do. It was sad that an establishment my old man built from scratch was remaining idle,” he said.

He coaxed his mother Saroja Velan (73) to come forward to restart the juice business. “I have been a home-maker all my life and coming to a place of business like this and making it operational for me at this age was a daring step I had to take for my family,” says Saroja who joined her son to give the originally Karnataka Travels and Fruit Juice Centre a fresh twist.

Anandraj decided to rename the shop Eat Raja in memory of his father who used to feed his son often with the words “thinnu Raja, thinnu Raja,” meaning “eat, my king”. Apart from the name board, the juices on the menu appear straight from a mother’s kitchen. “We make juices and serve to customer in fruits themselves so that they can drink and eat the juice. Our house specialties are musk melon, water melon and cucumber,” says Anandraj.

Restarted in July 2018, the zero-waste juice bar soon become a social media sensation with netizens lauding the former RJ’s concept which actually began by eliminating top-selling bottled water and beverages from the shop. Today, Eat Raja’s Chilly Guava - served in a guava - is a runaway success and the hot selling item in the shop, especially on Sundays. “Chilly Guava is the best among the lot,” say college students Geethamrutha R, Dhaarini.S and C. Christine who had come to the place on Wednesday to sample the juices after reading about Eat Raja online.

The menu at the juice stall changes everyday and also with the seasons and fruits’ availability. Anandraj also treats his loyal clientèle with some exotic fruits which are high on price. However, the juices at Eat Raja are priced between Rs 10 and Rs 50 and for customers who bring their own containers it is a flat Rs 20 only.

The Eat Raja juice centre is on 14th Cross, Sampige Road in Malleswaram.

When luggage was checked, two rechargeable emergency lights were found concealed among his personal items.

CHENNAI: Customs officials at Chennai international airport solved three cases of gold smuggling on Saturday. One passenger was arrested and another innovative method of concealment of gold was unravelled.

On Saturday morning, based on a tip, customs official intercepted Abdul Rahman, 40, of Kurumbalangode (Kerala), who arrived from Riyadh by Gulf Air flight GF 68 at the exit of Customs arrival hall.

When his luggage was checked, two rechargeable emergency lights were found concealed among his personal items. The lights appeared to be unusually heavy, which aroused suspicion.

On further examination, Customs officials found rectangular gold plates concealed inside the rechargeable batteries. Eight gold plates weighing 593g and worth Rs 24.3 lakh were recovered and seized. The passenger was arrested.

In two separate cases, Yaseen, 46, of Chennai and Mohammad Panis, 35, of Pudur (TN) who arrived from Dubai by AirIndia flight AI 906 from Dubai were intercepted at exit. On questioning, they admitted to having concealed gold paste bundles in their rectums. Four bundles (two from each) were recovered on searching them. On extraction, 944g of gold worth Rs 38.7 lakh was seized.

Overall, 1.53kg of gold worth Rs 63 lakh was recovered and seized under Customs Act 1962.

GANDHINAGAR: Union home minister Amit Shah said here on Saturday that there is no need to be discouraged by the “temporary phase of economic slowdown” and India will surely meet its target of being a five trillion dollar economy by 2024.

“Do not be discouraged by the comments you read because of this temporary phase. The government of India will definitely meet its target of making India a five trillion dollar economy by 2024. The youth of this country will be the biggest beneficiaries when we achieve the target,” Shah said while addressing the convocation of Gujarat Technology University (GTU) in Gandhinagar .

He added that there are many in the country, who paint a bleak picture of the economy, but the Union government has done commendable work in providing homes, electricity, toilets and medical facilities to the people. “For some, a population of 130 crore is a problem, I look at it as a market of 130 crore Indians. A country with such a huge market can dictate terms to the world,” Shah said.

As many as 61,000 students were conferred with degrees at the ninth convocation of GTU. Of these, 173 were awarded gold medals, while 39 were conferred with doctorate degrees.

Amit Shah

GANDHINAGAR: Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday accused the opposition of spreading lies about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and challenged them for a public debate on the topic. Shah was speaking at the launch of multiple projects by Gujarat police and state home department at Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar.

Shah said that those persecuted in neighbouring countries and living in India for several years now have no access to rights such as schools, job opportunities or healthcare. He alleged vote bank politics had prevented regularizing their citizenship so far — but the Modi government did it in the last session of the Parliament.

“The entire opposition — Rahul Baba, Mamata Banerjee, Kejriwal, Communist (sic) — spread lies about the move, saying that it would result in loss of citizenship for minorities,” said Shah. “I want to challenge them from the platform — discuss the issue in public. The law is to provide citizenship and nowhere it’s provisions allow revocation of one.”

“The opposition is not discussing about development, law and order, defence or foreign policy. They don’t have alternative for Narendrabhai. Thus, they are going to the public with lies and they are bound to get exposed eventually,” said Shah.

Shah launched a dedicated website for prevention and detection of cyber crimes in Gujarat, coordination platform for Gujarat and other states, anti-cyber bullying unit, kiosk for virus scan along with two major initiatives in form of Assured Assistance Service Helpline for Victims At Shortest Time (AASHVAST) and Video Integration and State Wide Advanced Security (VISWAS).

HELPING WITH HASHTAGS

A corner of Shaheen Bagh has turned into an impromptu clinic where Dr Rihana Sohail sits and dispenses medical advice. “I see men and women sitting here in the freezing cold and it inspired me to do what I could,” says Sohail, one of about 35 doctors who run a health camp at the protest site. The team of doctors are part of the Progressive Medicos & Scientists Forum (PMSF) whose president Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti also rushed to JNU on January 8 to treat injured students. The move to set up a small team of doctors was prompted by the police attitude towards protestors, he says. “Despite reaching Daryaganj police station, we were not allowed to examine the injured or help those detained after the violence there. It struck me that we should go to protest sites so we can treat patients before they are bundled off. A doctor’s job is not just to sit at the OPD and wait for patients. We have to reach out and save people,” he says.Hours after the police entered the Jamia campus on December 15, lawyer Anas Tanwir and others from the Indian Civil Liberties Union reached Kalkaji and New Friends Colony police stations where people had been detained. “We found that many of the students were injured and scared. We stayed through the night at both stations, and finally all 15 were released on the 16th morning at 2am,” he says. But this wasn’t just a one-off. From securing bail for 57 of the 59 people arrested in Varanasi and fighting for those arrested in Lucknow, ICLU’s team of about 40 lawyers has been burning the midnight oil. “We are a small team but law students and volunteers have been pitching in every day for those who cannot afford legal services,” Tanwir says.As more and more protestors take to the streets, timely legal advice often seem to make all the difference. Like the 15 Daryaganj residents who finally got bail on January 9 after 20 days. They were arrested in connection with the violence in Daryaganj area during an anti-CAA protest on December 20. Criminal lawyer Rebecca John who represented them says police and administration must learn to distinguish between peaceful protest and acts of vandalism. “We find that many of the investigations are extremely biased and with no merit. It is tragic that the police are playing with someone’s liberty. Twenty days after 15 people were arrested, there was no evidence against them. It is the state’s responsibility to determine the evidence before they arrest someone. This pattern of behaviour where the aggressors are protected and innocent people are randomly arrested is a matter of concern,” she says.For others legal advice came in the nick of time. Digital producer Farzeen Khan was at Mumbai’s #OccupyGateway protest when the police asked them to vacate. The group of people was bundled off in a police van and taken to Azad Maidan and kept there for a couple of hours before being let go. “Fortunately a few lawyers came and advised us not to ask people to come to Gateway. This could lead to an ugly situation because the police had unexpectedly banned public assembly in the area,” she says.Others are helping raise funds. Ourdemocracy.in, a crowdfunding platform for young politicians, has started pro-bono campaigns and helped raise Rs 11 lakh for ICLU to fight cases.At the recent #OccupyGateway protest, 25-year-old Pratyancha Patodkar, landed up with medicines, phone chargers, sanitary napkins, tampons, and even fruits for those on a fast. “Usually even the basic facilities are so far from protest sites that I just wanted help in any way I could,” she says. She wasn’t alone. Local pubs invited protestors to use their washrooms, restaurants sent chai and bun-maska while nearby residents offered a place to rest.This kind of support is also what keeps the women of Shaheen Bagh going. Between singing, clapping and shouting slogans, they take a break for fragrant biryani that has come in a small tempo from Jama Masjid. Hina Khan , a housewife, quickly takes charge, ordering people to sit in a row, while some are deputed to distribute. “When the protest started, there were a few days when we were worried about how to feed so many people. But after the first week, there is always more than enough. People are donating blankets, food, water and most importantly their time. We have stopped worrying about how to manage,” says Abid Sheikh, an engineer and one of the organisers. No money is accepted and the extra food is given away to the neighbouring slum shanties. Gurmehar Kaur, a Faridabad resident on her second visit to the protest site, came with bottles of water. “I just felt that I must show my support to these brave women.”The spirit of giving is perhaps summed up in a tweet by artist Indu Harikumar whose mother gave her a dhurrie for the sit-down protest. “I said, “Gimme something that I can leave behind if someone is still sitting on it.” Her mother responded, “The dhurrie is not bigger than people. Just tell them to take it home and wash it and use it.”In the afternoon light, a young boy fills in green colour in a drawing of the Indian flag. Around him the loudspeaker blares, and people often break into full-throttled sloganeering, but in this quiet corner of Shaheen Bagh, the volume is dialed down. This is the ‘Read for Revolution’ corner outside a shuttered shoe showroom where neighbourhood children can draw, paint or write down their thoughts. Osama Zakir, English literature student at Jamia Millia university who has donated about a hundred books from his personal collection, says, “We wanted to find a way to engage young children who had accompanied their mothers to the protest site.” While young children can draw or paint, older children are encouraged to read the preamble and discuss the CAA. “We want them to be able to discuss the act with their friends in school who come from pro-CAA families without anger,” he says. A similar initiative was started outside Jamia college by students to protest against the vandalising of their library. Books have been crowd-sourced with Mahatma Gandhi’s autobiography and the Constitution kept alongside books on Jamia’s history. Jamia student Sahil Tripathi, who started the project, says, “They destroyed our library but they cannot stop us from reading and asking questions.”Delhi-based engineer Yawer* was vacationing in Europe when he first heard of the police entering the Jamia library. “I cut short my vacation. I just felt that we had do something now. Since information is key to any movement, we decided that we would post Twitter threads about the protests,” he says. The Twitter handle @ResistCAA is run by a lawyer, a social media professional and a radio jockey.Other campus groups like Pinjra Tod and the Instagram handle @diary_of_jamian have also been active in putting out videos. We_are_jamians, an Instagram account with 5k followers, saw its followers jump to 38.4k, in a matter of a few weeks. The handle used to put out short videos to showcase individual talent from Jamia University but after the first protest on December 11, the group of over 15 students felt that they had the responsibility of being Jamia’s voice to the world. “We were a very apolitical campus that did not even have a students’ union. But circumstances have made us political,” says Aarish*, a student who runs the account.*Only first name used on requestPHOTO CREDIT: TARUN RAWAT",home,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73207576,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1883178,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//home/sunday-times/meet-the-caa-maritans/articleshow/73207581.cms

NAGPUR: Undeterred by the Modi government’s move to notify the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) gazette and #congratulationsindia, the social media campaign by RSS-BJP supporters, people from across the spectrum gathered at Samvidhan Square to begin a four-day Shaheen Bagh-style dharna under ‘We The Citizens of India’ banner on Saturday afternoon.

The first day witnessed peaceful activities with speeches from the common man to recital of poems, patriotic songs and creative posters. RJ Shahnawaz, who is visually impaired and unschooled, made a powerful recital of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s ‘Hum Dekhenge’, explaining the meaning and context of each verse. Visitors and protesters also participated in a signature campaign on a banner put up on the Vidhan Bhavan grills. An exclusive slot for students has been fixed.

In an attempt to blunt the BJP’s allegations of Congress-sponsored nationwide protests, the organizers, mainly Muslim youths comprising doctors, educationists and social workers, denied permission to political workers to occupy the stage or deliver speeches.

Guardian minister Nitin Raut cancelled his visit after the organizers invited him to sit among protesters and listen to the speakers of the day. Leaders from Owasi’s AIMIM and NCP, who expressed their wish to extend support, too, were asked to sit among protesters on the ground.

“We want to send a strong message to all politicians that this is a people’s protest and has no link with any party or community as being portrayed,” said an organizer.

The speakers were common citizens, office bearers of social and non-Muslim religious organizations and different groups of students. Since noon, over a floating population of 100 protesters stayed put at the spot. Around 80 women, some carrying kids, too, remained squatted near the stage.

A group of protesters from Babadeep Singh Nagar said Sikhs have also stood against oppression and the ‘black law’ (CAA) is nothing but the same. “Muslims and Sikhs outnumber other communities in sacrificing their lives for the country. Yet, both are labelled terrorists,” said Gurvinder Singh, secretary of Babadeep Gurudwara.

The Sikh group said, “If words like ‘Muslim’, ‘Pakistan’ or ‘Bangladeshi’ are banned, then people from BJP-RSS will have nothing to talk about,” they said, adding that the Akal Takht too has opposed the CAA, NRC and NPR as they are unfair to Muslims.

Meanwhile, the city unit of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) staged a protest a day after Delhi police claimed the involvement of Left-leaning students for violence at JNU. The ABVP had planned to hold the agitation at main building of Nagpur University but shifted it to front of PDKV gate as the NU was closed being second Saturday holiday.

NAGPUR: Taking a leaf out of the Jamia Millia Islamia students’ book, a group of youths set up a mini library along the Vidhan Bhavan compound pavement at Samvidhan Square where a four-day protest against CAA, NRC and NPR commenced on Saturday.

In the wake of the attacks on Delhi universities where libraries too were not spared by goons, the students there had taken out their books and stacked them on roads kicking off the ‘Read for Revolution’ movement.

The youths — Shalaka Bhandarkar, Tejaswini Kalmegh, Swaroop Bhartiya, Tuba Sanobar and Preeti Sarvey — said they brought over 100 books on revolutionaries, tyranny, economy and religion to help people understand how nations are destroyed when wrong things happen. The youths are also volunteers of the ‘We the Citizens of India’ protest.

The two books which caught the attention of many were ‘The Diary of Ann Frank’ and George Orwell’s ‘1984’. Frank’s biography brings out the horror of the Holocaust under the Nazi dictatorship which had the blood of Jews on its hands. Orwell’s book is based on a totalitarian regime.

The other celebrated authors are Taslima Nasreen (Lajja), Ramchandra Guha (India After Gandhi), Salman Rushdie (Midnight’s Children) and Shamsul Islam (RSS).

“The idea is when to make youths and others aware about what can happen if they remain silent and ignorant,” said Sarvey.

The youths brought the books from their personal collection and offered them to protesters for the entire duration of the four-day protest.

A couple of protesters were seen taking reading breaks. A law student said that informing people about historical facts and happenings can help a lot in changing their views or reinforcing their beliefs about the present situation of the country.

A protester, who picked up Frank’s book, said history is being distorted and a false narrative has been built to turn citizens against each other. “CAA, NRC and NPR are just a mirage created by the government which is indulging in several anti-people activities,” he said.

“We believe books are a powerful medium to educate as well as spread awareness. Since our learning centres are being attacked, we brought our libraries on to the streets to show our solidarity with the students,” said Tejaswini.

NAGPUR: The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) is planning to start making guided bombs in the coming days. So far, the ammunition it makes for the forces is of the conventional type. Now, OFB has drawn out plans to make guided bombs and is seeking outside technology and also getting it developed in-house. Guided ammunition can find its path right to the target on its own.

The director general of ordnance factory board (OFB), Hari Mohan, said this will be for the first time that the factories will be attempting to make guided ammunition. The factories make ammunition of calibres like 81mm, 51mm, 120mm, 130mm and even more for which a guided version may be out.

The ordnance factories have also begun supplying components to Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), a defence PSU that is into making of the missile.

The factory that has lately developed the 155-mm Dhanush howitzer is also close to making the first prototype of the futuristic infantry combat vehicle (FICV), the new generation armoured carrier for troops. Certain changes have been added to increase its effectiveness.

“With 85% of the work done, it is expected to be showcased during the defence expo planned in Lucknow in February,” said Mohan.

The chairman, along with the other members of the board, addressed workers’ representatives from all the 41 factories as a part of the brain storming session held at the National Academy of Defence Production in the city. “After a similar meeting of all the general managers heading the 41 factories was held, suggestions are now being invited from the grass roots level over the changes needed to be made on the organization’s functioning,” he said.

This has been the first of its kind of initiative in which specific suggestions from the workers’ levels are being invited, said Mohan. “The OFB is an over two hundred year old organization. The legacy brings certain advantages but drawbacks also. Times are changing and there is competition from the private sector also. It’s time for the OFB to change its functioning for which suggestions are being invited from all levels,” he said.

The government had last year proposed to corporatize the OFB, which led to a weeklong strike in the 41 factories. No further move has happened after that. However, post the development, OFB is also planning to revamp its working in light of the changed conditions in the defence manufacturing sector.

The head of the tiger was discovered some distance away from the carcass

CHANDRAPUR: The mutilated body of a fully grown tiger was discovered with its head, paws and tail missing, near Mudjha village in south Bramhapuri forest range on Saturday morning. The forest department is tight-lipped over the cause of death, but sources claimed that the tiger is likely to have been poisoned through cattle kill.

The head of the tiger was discovered some distance away from the carcass. Its teeth were missing. Foresters have failed to trace the paws.

It is learnt that some women were the first to spot the tiger’s body. They informed the local forest guard. Senior officers, including Bramhapuri forest division deputy conservator of forests (DCF) Kulraj Singh and South Bramhapuri forest range officer (RFO) GR Naighamkar, then reached the spot.

Wildlife experts claimed that the crude chopping of the head and paws, and leaving the skin behind indicates the involvement of locals. “Expert poachers would have removed the skin and other valuable parts, and disposed of the remains to keep the matter hushed up,” they said.

Intensive questioning of farmers and shepherds from the area is under way. Two people have been detained for investigations, according to sources.

Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR)’s veterinary wildlife officer Dr Ravikiran Khobragade and the local livestock development officer carried out the post mortem.

RFO GR Naighamkar claimed that veterinary doctors have failed to confirm the exact cause of death and sex of the tiger. However, they suspect it is a male. “Vets have taken the viscera for forensic confirmation,” said Naighamkar.

447,['12/01/2020'],Nagpur: Petitioner demands judicial probe in irrigation scam,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Ajit Pawar

NAGPUR: In response to the anti corruption bureau’s (ACB) clean chit to deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar in several investigated cases of the Rs70,000 crore irrigation scam , petitioner Janmanch has demanded that a sitting or a retired judge of the Supreme or high court hold an inquiry in the case.

In an amendment application filed in the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Friday, the NGO’s counsel Firdos Mirza contended that with Pawar being in an influential position as deputy CM, the NGO doesn’t trust the investigating agency (ACB) any more. The ACB directly functions under the state government.

It wanted to amend the PIL by praying for constituting an inquiry under the ‘Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952’. The NGO had originally demanded a CBI probe into the scam that had rocked Democratic Front government of Congress-NCP in 2012-13.

Accusing the ACB of making all efforts to save the Baramati MLA, the NGO through former president Sharad Patil claimed that the investigating agency and government machinery are trying to save Pawar by “creating incorrect records and misleading the judiciary”.

Quoting the report of Madhav Chitale, former secretary of Water Resources Department (WRD), the petitioner stated that irregularities couldn’t have been committed without directives, connivance and knowledge of Pawar who was then the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation (VIDC) chairman. The NGO sought permission to submit a copy of Chitale’s report in the court.

Further charging the ACB of indulging in unethical and mala fide acts of filing contradictory affidavits of its two director generals Sanjay Barve (now the Mumbai police commissioner) and Parambir Singh, the petitioner alleged that its apprehensions of the agency “not performing its statutory duties honestly are turning out to be correct”.

The petitioner said that in 2014 ex-CM Devendra Fadnavis made a statement in HC that the government would launch an open inquiry against Pawar along with former WRD minister Sunil Tatkare and ex-PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal.

Petitioner stated that there has been little progress in the investigations in the five years of the BJP government. On November 23, 2019, Fadnavis again took over CM’s post for just 80 hours where Pawar was made a deputy CM for the second time.

The affidavits by ACB superintendents — Rashmi Nandedkar from Nagpur division and Shrikant Dhivare from Amravati division — were filed a day after Fadnavis and Pawar resigned on November 26. It granted a clean chit to Pawar.

Those were in complete contradiction to earlier affidavit filed by Barve who had directly pinned the blame on Pawar for allegedly indulging in criminal conspiracy of defrauding the exchequer that led to inordinate delay in important irrigation projects and subsequent suicides by the poor farmers.

After his resignation, Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray took over the CM’s post in a three-party government where Pawar was again appointed as DCM on November 28. The ACB DG Parambir Singh then filed another affidavit during winter assembly session in Nagpur which endorsed the clean chit.

The petitioner said in this changing political situation, where Pawar is playing a major role in the government formation, it doesn’t have the faith in ACB or CBI which is in direct control under state or central governments, where BJP is in power.

“All these activities of ACB is sufficient to demonstrate a need to constitute an inquiry commission under the sitting or retired SC or HC judge and it wouldn’t cause any prejudice to anyone,” said the senior officer.

The 19-storey waterfront apartment turned into a pile of rubble within a span of nine seconds on Saturday

KOCHI: On Saturday, the best laid plans worked without a hitch as the three towers of Holy Faith H2O and Alfa Serene in Maradu - overlooking Kerala's stunning backwaters - crumbled in a matter of seconds after demolition process was carried out as per the Supreme Court order. Though there was a slight delay in the beginning, exactly a minute after the third siren was blown by authorities signalling the beginning of demolition, rapid sequential blasts turned the towers to dust.A moment of silence succeeded the three-second blast sequence, following which the building's right portion crumbled inward and the process spread to the remaining portions in a wave motion. In another four seconds the entire building collapsed 'just like a waterfall'.

451,['12/01/2020'],"Mumbai: Police, builders in touch with gangster Ejaz Lakdawala under lens","This story is from January 12, 2020

Ejaz Lakdawala was absconding for over two decades

MUMBAI: More than a dozen builders/developers, two police informers and some police officers who had ""connections"" with arrested gangster Ejaz Lakdawala (50) are under the city crime branch's scanner.

Police said they will soon book him under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA), as there are more than two serious offences against him and charge-sheets have been filed. Lakdawala is the leader of a gang which threatened and terrorised victims for pecuniary gains, which is a key ingredient of the Act, police said.

Sources said the crime branch may form a special team to probe his 25 extortion offences, including two murders. ""Lakdawala could not have run his extortion racket sitting abroad without a mole here. We had booked people who used to provide informations of possible targets to Ravi Pujari,"" said an officer. The team will summon suspects and record their statements to know the nexus. Sources said they may claim they were victims of Lakdawala and spoke to him under duress. Crime branch had last year arrested Anees Merchant, brother of Obaid Radiowala, for allegedly aiding and abetting arrested gangster Ravi Pujari.

During interrogation Lakdawala, arrested from Bihar on Wednesday, admitted he had two passports. One made in Nepal is under the name of Mubarak Shaikh, and the other is a Canadian passport, under the name of Akshay Bhatia. He told police that besides Roma Thadani, he had married a Canadian, Suman Surekha Bhatia, to get citizenship.

On why he took shelter in Nepal, he told police that as Chhota Shakeel attacked him in Bangkok in 2004, he went to Malaysia, Canada, Cambodia and then Nepal. From Nepal, he said, it was easy for him to enter India to meet his daughter, Shifa alias Sonia Shaikh, who had married a Versova resident. Shifa was arrested for demanding money from a Bandra developer, and during investigations it transpired that she was communicating with someone in Bihar. This helped police track down Lakdawala's location.

Police are interrogating Lakdawala to know how he sneaked into India, and if anyone helped him. ""It was an excellent investigation by crime branch,"" said a senior IPS officer. Crime branch officials said they were verifying the authenticity of Lakdawla's passports as he had no documents when they arrested him Jakkanpur, Bihar. Police got Shifa to meet him in Bihar, when crime branch, with Bihar police help, laid a trap and arrested him.

""Why would a gangster, knowing that if caught, his entire life will be in jail, surrender when he has two nationalities?"" ask a senior police official. Police said they may conduct a DNA test to prove he is Lakdawala.

Police said they were probing Lakdawala's assets, made by threatening builders, hoteliers and celebrities.

President Tsai Ing-wen won a landslide victory over China-friendly opposition challenger Han Kuo-yu to clinch a second term in Taiwan's presidential election, dealing a blow to Beijing, which has long sought to bring the democratically run island under its control.

Han conceded defeat just before 9 pm at his headquarters in the southern city of Kaohsiung. Tsai had a record 7.7 million votes, Taiwan's Central Election Commission said around 8.30pm. Han had 5.2 million.

The president, whose Democratic Progressive Party advocates formal independence from China, has vowed that Taiwan will never be unified with China as long she is in power. Meanwhile Han, of the Kuomintang party, had struggled to find a consistent message on China after a meteoric rise that saw him become mayor of Kaohsiung - Taiwan's third-largest city - and a top contender to unseat Tsai.

Votes for Tsai surpassed the 6.9 million she reaped in 2016. Crowds of her supporters gathered for an evening victory celebration at her campaign's headquarters in downtown Taipei after hundreds of thousands rallied in city center the night before the vote. It was a stark contrast to the scene at Han's headquarters further south in Kaohsiung, where staffers cried as it became apparent Tsai was likely to win.

Tsai was bolstered by a resilient economy and stock market and protests against China's grip in neighbouring Hong Kong, which have confronted Taiwanese voters with the potential perils of closer ties with the mainland.

NEW DELHI: Delhi is likely to see a spell of drizzle during Lohri on January 13, as well as rain on January 15 and 16 – a period when both the maximum and minimum temperatures will rise in the region, Met officials said. Delhi’s minimum temperature on Saturday was 5.8 degrees Celsius two degrees below normal for this time of the season. However, IMD said this is likely to rise by 3-4 degrees Celsius in the next 48 hours.

“An active western disturbance will influence Delhi in the next 24 hours, which will cause a rise in both the maximum and minimum temperatures. We can expect a spell of light rain on Monday, with rain also likely to occur on Wednesday and Thursday,” said a senior Met official.

Delhi on Saturday recorded a maximum temperature of 19.9 degrees Celsius and is forecast to touch 22 degrees by Monday, IMD said. The minimum temperature, too, is likely to rise and may touch 9 degrees Celsius by Monday.

“As is seen with a western disturbance, there is a rise in temperature and it will only start falling after January 16. Some parts of Delhi may also see very light rain on January 17,” said the Met official.

Lodhi Road on Saturday recorded the lowest minimum temperature 5 degrees Celsius, followed by Jafarpur at 5.2 degrees. The lowest maximum temperature was, meanwhile, recorded at Mungeshpur — 17.5 degrees Celsius, followed by Pusa at 18 degrees. Delhi’s relative humidity oscillated between 45% and 97% in the last 24 hours.

Forecast for Sunday showed a rise in both maximum and minimum temperatures — 21 and 7 degrees Celsius respectively — with moderate fog likely to occur during the day.

Delhi’s air quality too remained in the ‘poor’ range with an overall AQI of 288 on CPCB’s index. On Friday, Delhi had recorded a reading of 255 (poor).

Members of the web series unit were asked if they had permissions

MUMBAI: Three locals from Colaba who impersonated members of a political party, threatened a web series shooting unit and demanded a sum of Rs 25,000 from them, were arrested by the Mumbai police on Saturday afternoon.

The Cuffe Parade police on Saturday arrested Yogesh Anil Palekar (30), Ujjwal Vasant Koli (32) and Ramesh Ravindra Kasare (46) from the scene of crime opposite Oberoi Hotel at Nariman Point .

Police said the location manager of a production house and his team, which is producing an upcoming web series, was shooting at the historic end of the Marine Drive promenade when a few men approached and stopped them from carrying on their work. “Three to four men who claimed to be affiliated to a political party stopped the shoot and asked the unit whether they had permission to shoot at the location,” said an officer from the Cuffe Parade police station.

When the location manager informed them he had all permissions, the men refused to allow them to shoot and stopped a taxi in between the shoot, police said. The men told the shooting unit that if they wanted to continue, they should pay them Rs 25,000. Just then, a police patrolling van was passing by, and members of the unit alerted the officers in the unit.

Seeing the police van, two of the accused managed to flee, but the police team detained the three others and brought them to the police station. Cuffe Parade police said the accused are not affiliated to any political party but used the party’s name to threaten and extract money.

Advocate Sunil Pandey, who appeared for the accused in court, said his clients were locals who had asked the shooting unit whether they had all the required permissions, but the crew instead alerted the police and got them arrested.

Kolkata: The Bangladesh deputy high commission is planning a documentary on the life of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujhibur Rahman during his stay in Kolkata. Bangladesh deputy high commissioner Toufique Hasan made the announcement on Friday, along with plans for a year-long celebration to commemorate the leader’s birth centenary.

The Bangladesh government has already approached author Sanjib Chattopadhyay to write a book on Bangabandhu’s life in Kolkata during his student years in the 1940s.

The neighbouring country will celebrate Mujib year from March 17, 2020 to March17, 2021. In Kolkata, the deputy high commission has planned a series of lectures in his memory.

Hasan will also host an art exhibition on Mujib’s life at the new Bangladesh gallery, which was inaugurated on Friday.

Bangladesh has already requested Calcutta University and Jadavpur University to set up a chair each in memory of Bangabandhu that it will fund.

At another event on Friday, Prof Atiur Rahman of Dhaka University recalled how Mujib was forced to visit Kolkata twice because of health issues. He was treated for beriberi in the city in 1934, and returned in 1934 due to eye problems.

“He was treated at Kolkata Medical College, but had to wear spectacles from then. His father shifted him to Gopalgunj school in 1937 and there, he first met Fazlul Haque and H S Suhrawardy in 1938 when he headed a volunteer group. He became close to Suhrawardy when he stayed in Kolkata while studying at Islamia College, now known as Maulana Azad College in the 1940s,” Rahman said.

PM Modi at Belur Math with senior RKM monks

HOWRAH: PM Narendra Modi reached Belur Math , the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission, by a ferry at 8.57 pm on Sat-urday and chose to stay back in a move redolent with symbolism, opting not to make the journey back to the Raj Bhavan where he was supposed to spend the night, a day ahead of Swami Vivekananda ’s birth anniversary on January 12.

CM Mamata Banerjee gave a political twist to the PM’s overnight stay at Belur Math. “Some have come from Delhi to bask in the glory of Swamiji. We are not like them. We stay connected with the people throughout the year. We have been observing Yuva Divas from January 10-12 to celebrate Swami Vivekananda’s birthday. Swamiji talked about world humanism. Do you know that there is a mazar inside Dakshineswar temple compound? Swamiji once went to a Muslim household, smoked from his hookah and asserted that he didn’t lose his religion by doing that,” the CM said.

At Belur Math, the PM was received by Swami Suviranandaji, general secretary of Ram-akrishna Mission, and other senior monks. He toured the Math — especially illuminated for the visit — in a battery-operated vehicle and paid his respects to RKM president Maharaj, Swami Smaranandaji. The PM also visited the main temple and paid homage to Ramakrishna Paramhansa and offered prayers. Thereafter, he briefly met senior monks and discussed ways in which Swami Vivekananada’s thoughts and ideas could be used to uplift the country’s youth.

With the PM choosing to stay the night, the Math authorities made arrangements to accommodate him at the guest house on the premises. Senior functionaries said the PM had requested them to make very simple arrangements, a request they honoured. At the guest house, Modi was served ‘prasad’ and ‘bhog’ before he retired for the night.

On Sunday, the PM will visit the main temple early in the morning for mangal aarti — a daily ritual — and then sit in meditation inside the main temple. He will also be served ‘bhog’ and ‘mahaprasad’ that is offered to Shri Ramakrishna. Modi is also scheduled to visit Swami Vivekananada’s room, where he will again meditate and perform yoga, the authorities said. Thereafter, the PM will be taken around for darshan of the different temples within Belur Math, including that of Sarada Ma.

“After darshan, the PM will participate in the birth anniversary celebrations of Swami Vivekananda within the Belur Math premises and will inaugurate a yuva festival on the occasion. The festival will be attended by students of different educational institutions of Ramakrishna Mission,” said Howrah district information officer Sampriti Dutta.

458,['12/01/2020'],Indian docu portraying songs of separation at Dhaka fest,"This story is from January 12, 2020

Kolkata: The 18th Dhaka International Film Festival will be hosting a unique documentary titled “In Search of Bidesia”.

Directed by Mumbai-based screenwriter and social development practitioner Simit Bhagat, the film emerged out of his solo bike journey across 1,200km through Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in 2017 to record various cultural expressions. Scripted on the go, “ISB” explores how actual events in history, including indentured migration and personal experiences, find artistic expressions in various art forms including music.

Speaking about the genesis of the film, the director went back in time to over a century ago when Calcutta was the British capital. “It was from this very place that millions of Indians — mostly from UP, Bihar and Bengal — set off on a long voyage across oceans to work as indentured labourers in British colonies. A few would die en route; most would never return to their families again,” said Bhagat, founder of The Bidesia Project, a not-for-profit initiative to conserve Bhojpuri folk music.

Most had never even stepped out of their hometowns and were illiterate. They readily signed Bidesia on legal documents, which bound them to serve as coolies for the rest of their lives. “Some of them hadn’t even heard the names of the countries they were being sent to. So, instead of mentioning the destination as Surinam, they would be told that they are going on a Sree Ram Ke Yatra. For Mauritius, the name used was Maritch Tapu (Tapu means island),” he added.

“After a hard day’s work, all they had as means of recreation were folk songs, which reminded them of their roots. Back home, similar songs of separation were being penned by those left behind. During my travels to UP and Bihar, I realised that the songs were gradually fading away,” added Bhagat, whose first short documentary film titled “My Disappearing Farms” was selected at the 9th CMS Vatavaran Environment and Wildlife International Film Festival and New Delhi’s Forum 2017.

CM Mamata Banerjee speaks at a protest meet immediately after her meeting with PM Narendra Modi at Raj Bhavan

KOLKATA: Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee met PM Narendra Modi at Raj Bhavan for about 20 minutes on Saturday afternoon, where she conveyed her “opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens”, before joining her party’s anti-citizenship law protests at Esplanade.

Banerjee walked to the protest venue, less than 100 metres from Raj Bhavan, after “meeting the Prime Minister of the country as the chief minister of the state”, as she sought to pull off a fine balancing act between her roles as one of the most strident opponents of the new citizenship law and the CM of a state.

“I have expressed our continued opposition to CAA-NRC and urged the PM to do a rethink on the issue,” she said, adding: “But it is also my constitutional obligation to meet the country’s PM and President when they come to Kolkata. My colleague, minister Firhad Hakim, received the PM at the airport. I have told the PM about the Rs 28,000 crore the Centre owes the state plus the Rs 7,000 crore we have spent on post-Bulbul (cyclone) rehabilitation.”

Banerjee, aware of the ground reality where a misstep may have unintended consequences, has been insisting on “sarba dharma samanway” and using traditional prayer symbols like conch shells and kansar-ghanta (gong-and-bell) in her anti-CAA-NRC campaign to deflect “the BJP’s unfounded criticism” of her “vote-bank politics”. She has also referred to Swami Vivekananda’s vision of India and reached out to Ganga Sagar pilgrims and temple authorities to preempt the BJP’s “misappropriation of religion”.

On Saturday, however, Banerjee also had to take guard against anti-CAA-NRC protesters’ apprehensions of her going “soft on the cause”. She went back to the Esplanade dharna site a second time in the evening and, after an intense face-off with non-Trinamool, anti-CAA-NRC protesters that lasted a few minutes, accused them of “trying to fish in troubled waters” and being “BJP stooges”. “I do not need any certificate about the sincerity of my cause from anyone,” she said.

“I have led the Singur stir and made the government give back land to farmers. I have championed the fight against custodial deaths,” she said, invoking “student power” and asking the Trinamool Chhatra Parishad to reach out to colleges and involve students in the anti-CAA-NRC stir. “I came to politics from the student movement. Let students take the lead. We will take the back seat,” Banerjee said.

Banerjee initially tried to reason with Jadavpur University students, who formed the bulk of the non-Trinamool protesters at Esplanade, that a showdown between anti-CAA-NRC forces would end up harming the larger cause. But, with the Trinamool “CAA-CAA chhi-chhi (shame-shame)” slogans being met with “azaadi” slogans, cops intervened to separate the Trinamool and non-Trinamool protesters’ blocs. Banerjee finally called off the dharna around 9.40 p.m.

Kolkata: Political differences should be set aside for the development of Bengal and the surrounding regions, Union minister for steel, petroleum and natural gas Dharmendra Pradhan said here on Saturday.

Pradhan launched Purvodaya for five eastern states to bolster manufacturing activity. These are Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and north Andhra Pradesh.

At two programmes organised by CII and Bharat Ch-amber of Commerce, Pradhan sought help from chief minister Mamata Banerjee for rapid development.

“I want to bring the much-sought-after gas pipeline to Kolkata within a year. There will be piped gas in households and all buses and autos will ply on CNG. The city will become cleaner and less polluted. But for this, I need the state government’s help,” he said during the annual general meeting of BCC.

“Didi, you may go to the dharna manch of Chhatra Parishad (TMCP). This a democracy, one can do that. But when it is about development of the state, we should work together,” said Pradhan, who hails from Odisha. The Centre is setting up a gas grid in the eastern region and the northeast, which are not yet connected by a pipeline.

The minister recalled that the British ruled a major portion of Asia from Kolkata, their capital for more than 140 years. “We can bring back the old glory of the city,” he said.

Pradhan added that the east is richly endowed with natural resources but lags behind other regions.

After all it is access to the ocean that China seeks. We shall then be in a position to gain in international trade and bilateral ties will improve. Discussions are required on this subject,” Swamy said while addressing a seminar on ‘Peace and Stability in the Indo-Pacific Region’ organised by Kolkata-based think tank CENERS-K.

GURUGRAM: A 35-year-old homemaker was allegedly beaten to death on Friday evening by a group of 13 men who had come looking for her brother following a spat with him a few days ago. Four persons have been arrested and police are on the lookout for nine more.

Some of the accused have been identified as Dinesh, Praveen, Rajesh, Gaurav and Rohit, all in their late 20s or early 30s. The alleged murder took place around 8pm when Rukmani was at her home in Shivaji Nagar area. The accused, led by Dinesh, had come to her house and asked to meet her brother Shravan.

“She told them her brother was not at home and they started beating her with iron rods and sticks which they carried with them,” ACP Prit Pal told a news conference on Saturday. He added that the accused who are on the run include Dinesh, the gang leader.

Rukmani was hit in the head and face. By the time Shravan reached home, the attackers had fled. Rukmani was declared dead on arrival at a government hospital. Shravan approached a police outpost on Pataudi Road and filed a complaint against Dinesh.

Sources said that earlier too, Dinesh had on several occasions threatened to kill Shravan because of enmity between the two families. Shravan and Dinesh had been involved in a fight a few days ago, and cops suspect the murder could be a fallout of that.

An FIR was registered at Shivaji Nagar police station under sections 302, 148, 149, 506 and 34 of the IPC, accounting to murder, rioting, armed with deadly weapon, every member of unlawful assembly guilty of the offence committed in prosecution of a common object, punishment for criminal intimidation and acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.

Four persons have been arrested so far. “They will be presented in court on Sunday,” said a police spokesperson. Police officers have blamed personal enmity as the reason for the alleged murder.

There was a 48-month period set for completion of the Mumbai coastal road

MUMBAI: Marine Drive, or Queen's Necklace, is set to change with BMC starting Mumbai coastal road work along it, almost a month after Supreme Court vacated a stay. A portion of the promenade close to Girgaum Chowpatty is now partially out of bounds to walkers and joggers, who use the 4.5km stretch daily, as part of their exercise routine.

Marine Drive resident Mahendra Hemdev, a regular walker, said many locals and tourists visit the space on weekends and public holidays, and BMC would have to ensure that the public do not walk along the road. ""With Marine Drive being an arterial road, vehicles move at high speed, so wardens could be placed there to monitor public movement,"" he said.

Senior BMC officials told TOI work on the promenade was to start several months back, but following the stay everything came to a halt. The total cost of constructing the nearly 10km road is over Rs 12,000 crore.

""We will build a similar promenade on a cantilever bridge along the new road, which will be open to the public. The promenade will move few metres into the sea,"" said the official, adding that the tunnel is expected to start along the same alignment and go below Chowpatty.

But residents said the ""shape and dynamics"" of the boulevard would eventually change.

""Infrastructure is needed, but Marine Drive promenade with this work, may only be a memory in books,"" said Atul Kumar of Nariman Point Churchgate Residents' Association.

Coastal road construction is going on simultaneously at various sites in south Mumbai.

BADLAPUR: An 18-year-old labourer died after a fire extinguisher cylinder exploded while he was filling it with nitrogen gas on Saturday. The incident took place around 11.30am at Woodpecker India Fire Services in Manjarli, Badlapur . The owner was arrested for negligence causing death, as he had not provided the labourers with proper training or safety equipment.

The deceased, Ganesh Mahaske, and another labourer, Bharat Koli (22), were filling nitrogen into a fire extinguisher. Due to the high pressure, the cylinder exploded and a portion of it hit Mahaske on the chest. Koli rushed him to a hospital nearby, where he was declared dead before arrival.

Gaurav Birade, the owner of Woodpecker, was booked based on Koli's statement. He was later arrested. ""Primary probe shows that the accused did not provide training or safety equipment like hand gloves, helmet, among others, which led to the fatal incident,"" said senior inspector L M Sariputra.

""The elderly woman has been detained on the complaint of the victims' families that she deliberately threw the bag towards the minor girl because of animosity with her family members. However, the accused has denied the allegation and claims it to be an accident. We are in the process of lodging an FIR,"" said ASP (East) Suresh Kumar Rawat.

All the three victims were rushed to the Balrampur hospital. The two women had minor injuries and were discharged after treatment. The girl, however, suffered acid burns on face and left hand. Dr Saurabh Singh in the emergency ward of the hospital said the girl is out of danger.

According to police, the accused woman had got her silver anklet cleaned by one Ramchandra Soni, who visits homes to offer services on demand, two months ago. However, she later noticed that the weight of the anklet after cleaning had reduced.

On Saturday, she caught hold of Soni and accused him of 'stealing' a layer of silver from her anklet by using acid. As Soni denied the charge, a scuffle broke out and the woman tried to check Soni's bag.

""The woman told us that she snatched the bag and upon finding the acid bottle, threw it on the ground. The three victims were standing nearby, watching the brawl. As the bottle shattered, the acid splashed on them,"" said Rawat.

However, the minor girl claimed the woman deliberately threw the bottle towards her. ""I felt a burning sensation as soon as the liquid splashed over my face. I was lucky that my eyes were not hurt,"" she told TOI.

The girl's mother said she had a spat with the accused woman a few days ago, but never expected that she will go to this level.

Green, green grass of home

Expanding their palette

Appetite for new experiences

Their numbers increasing because of tech jobs in NCR, Koreans in Gurugram have come together to craft a home away from home. The community’s presence has in turn enriched the city’s culture of diversity and expanded its palette, find Sakshi Virmani & Sharad Kohli Kim Jin Bum (39), the son of a diplomat, lived in Delhi for eight years and moved to Golf Course Road in Gurugram only recently. He likes how the Millennium City is shaping, and how it offers the best of urban conveniences and diversions. Still, he wants his kids — a son, 6, and a daughter, 4, both students of The British School — to remember their mother tongue. ""Problem is, they speak more English and Hindi than Korean. At home, I force them to speak Korean , because otherwise, they will forget the language!"" he says, half in jest.""My children are happy but my wife is still missing home.""According to latest Gurugram police data, Koreans make up the largest expat community in the city — 2,906 — ahead of the Japanese and Chinese. Employees of Samsung and other Korean MNCs based out of NCR make up a big chunk of these numbers.Kim has spent 13 years in India but his relationship with the country goes back to his student days at Ramjas College where he studied economics. ""At that time, India was an emerging market. So I thought, ‘Why don’t we stay here?’"" he told us in his restaurant, Gung, The Palace.At this Sector 29 eatery, which has played a big role in introducing Indians to Korean cuisine (it has three outlets in Delhi-NCR and one in Neemrana), one can enjoy classics like Bibimbap, Japchae and Bulgogi. Bibimbap isarguably Korea’s most populardish, a comfort food made up of white rice topped with vegetables, meat and a whole egg (fried or raw). Bulgogi consists of marinated strips of meat cooked on a barbecue, while Japchae is a meal of stir-fried glass noodles served alongside vegetables and/or meat.Every table comes with a barbecue (brought over from Korea) and Kim says that his Indians customers come because of this feature. ""They can see the ingredients being grilled, and they can also do a bit of grilling themselves,"" he explains.So, it’s not just Kim’s fellow Koreans who frequent Gung. ""In the Delhi branch, 60%-70% of our customers are Indian; here in Gurugram, we get more Japanese. In Neemrana, the clientele is 100% Japanese, and in Noida, because of the presence of Samsung, our customers are mainly Koreans.""Golf in Korea was just another sport before Se-Ri Pak’s breakout victory in the 1998 Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Championship — the first by any native of this East Asian nation, man or woman — heralded the start of a revolution. Today, the game’s an intrinsic part of the Korean identity.Kim also likes his golf, teeing it up on weekends at Classic Golf Resort or Golden Greens. ""We can play in 40 degrees C, Indians cannot!"" he laughs.But on a crisp afternoon in early winter, the sky an azure blue, there’s no better place to be than on a golf course. Yoo Jin, who moved to India only six months back with her husband and has lived in Gurugram all along, doesn’t play, only practises. But it won’t be too long before she tests her game around the layout at the pristine DLF Golf & Country Club. ""I come every day for a lesson and for practice,"" she says.Yoo recollects that it was scorching when she arrived, and she has not found enough time to make new friends. Yet, she’s already enamoured of her new home.Homemaker Young Mi Park — Jasmine to her Indian friends — has been here longer, some seven years all told, but split into a couple of stints, each in Gurugram. Compared to her earlier stay, there’s now more of Korea in the city, in the grocers — scattered across town, and run by Koreans — and in the restaurants, and, of course, in the golf.""My husband (a corporate professional) wanted me to start playing golf, and he introduced me to a good coach. Now, I enjoy golf more than he does!"" she chortled. Young gets out her bag every day (apart from the one day of the week when DLF is closed), and can often be seen playing more than 18 holes. Such dedication, allied to a desire to improve, saw her take part in the pro-am of a recent Asian event.""Sometimes I miss home when I’m sick; sometimes I miss my friends and family. But many people tell me I seem to enjoy Gurugram more than other Korean ladies!"" Golf, surely, can take credit for that.In November 2019, at the Korean Cultural Centre in Delhi, an art exhibition, ‘Here & Now’, showcased the stories of 13 Korean housewives, of their experiences in India. Thousands of miles away from home but eager to keep themselves occupied (after their husbands would leave for work), these women found solace in brushstrokes on canvas, alongside Gurugram-based art collective, Grillanda.And it was Cho Hye Ryung who got all her friends to join the group after she learned about the painting classes. ""I know I have to live in India so I try to enjoy my life here,"" admitted Cho, while sipping Jujube tea at the centre’s café. ""I am trying to learn English through a private tutor.""Being surrounded by the unfamiliar hasn’t come in the way of making sure that everyone feels as much at home as possible, through painting the city in their own colours, for example. In the work titled ‘My sweet city Gurugram’, Erica Jang portrays the paradoxes of Gurugram, with its malls and slums, bantering potbellied cops and street dogs.""In no way is it trying to depict the pitiable condition of the natives, but (depicting) the fun they have together — exactly how the Koreans lived a few decades ago,"" informs Kim Won-Hee, an art teacher and a resident of Gurugram for the past nine years.Won-Hee’s own creations take inspiration from Amrita Sher-Gil’s ‘Group of Three Girls’ (and elements from the pop artwork of David Hockney). ""When I visited the National Gallery of Modern Art here, I was impressed and inspired by Sher-Gil’s work; I could relate it to the lives of Korean housewives in India,"" shared Kim.""For these housewives, there is nothing much that they can do — groceries can be done by the servants, children and husband are away half the time leaving plenty of idle moments to kill,"" Kim observed.Gurugram has been home to Cho for the past two years. For her, and most of the city’s Korean women, South Point Mall on Golf Course Road is more than just a place to shop. With its bakeries, grocery stores and gastronomic memories of home — every possible spice, condiment and ingredient needed for a Korean dish is available here — it has become a community hub. ""We call it the South Korea mall,"" she chuckles, to the amusement of her friends, who nod in unison.Other Koreans, too, have found the warmth of home away from home here. ""Living in Gurugram is a little chaotic, but as far as I know, it is one of the best cities to live in, here in India. I have no choice but to be satisfied with my life here,"" stresses Choi Hoy Soon, an artist who painted a sketch of a dusky Indian girl holding a diya. Besides, they’ve readily embraced Bollywood, and some of the regional delicacies. ""We watch the Hindi movies of Sridevi, and try local Punjabi food every now and then,"" Choi adds.For Gung’s Kim, the best thing about India is the people. ""When I was a student, I was cheated by rickshaw drivers and shopkeepers — if an Indian goes to Korea, he would face the same too,"" he said. And Kim has had enough time to accustom himself to the bewilderingly varied Indian palate, his years in college aiding him in that regard. ""I used to go to the college canteen and would visit dhabas. Frankly, there was no option for me,"" he recalls.Chhole-bhature is a favourite of his but Kim also professes a fondness for mutton keema and butter chicken. ""Koreans are really keen to have naan , it’s very addictive,"" he reveals.Meanwhile, golf addict Young can’t get enough of butter chicken and dal makhani. And even the disappointment of finding no meats on the menu in a Jodhpur hotel was tempered by the ""very nice"" upma and poha she serendipitously got to taste.Converting the heart and mindWhile cultural signals can get crossed, humour is never far away, even in the most awkward of moments. ""One day I was entering a five-star hotel wearing jeans and T-shirt, and my driver was wearing a suit; the hotel guard stopped me but allowed my driver in. I think he mistook me for a Nepali!"" recalls Kim.Meanwhile, Young’s spell as a teacher, giving lessons in English to underprivileged kids in a Palam Vihar school, earned her the respect and admiration of her peers, besides an obvious fluency in the language. ""I taught children for one year as a volunteer after which I realised that the students feel very comfortable with my pronunciation, more so than with the other teachers!"" she says with pride. ""That made me confident in teaching them. It’s something I really enjoyed.""For all the assimilation, ties with the homeland remain strong. On occasions like Chuseok (the Korean Thanksgiving Day that falls on autumn’s eve), families gather to break bread. Chuseok features, among other preparations, Songpyeon, or rice cake, a variety of fritters, and Samsaek Namul, a side dish of vegetables (in three different colours). The community even has its own magazine, ‘Namaste India’, published in Korean, in which is carried news, events, updates, features (a 2019 issue had a piece on Gandhi), advice, recipes and a wrap of what’s been happening in and around Gurugram.""It took me a while getting used to life in a new city but I’ve settled down now. Everything in the city is amazing,"" said Yoo. Residents in her condo have made Yoo feel welcome, while the staff at DLF G&CC have helped her with her Hindi. ""I’m happy to be here!""It’s a sentiment that might be echoed by many Koreans for whom Gurugram has become a welcome chapter of experiences in their book of life.",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73209265,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58722,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/food-and-golf-bind-gurgaons-largest-expat-group/articleshow/73209268.cms

Representative image

LUCKNOW: A 20-year-old woman allegedly shot herself with her father's licensed revolver in her apartment in Gomtinagar Extension while her parents had gone out on Friday evening. At the time of the incident, there were four men in the house, including her elder brother.

Shubhangi Singh (20), a graduation student, was alone in her room while her elder brother and his friend were in another room when she killed herself, police said. Two servants-one in the kitchen and another watching television- were also present in the house.

Her father Suryabhadra Singh, a businessman, had gone to visit a doctor along with his wife. Around 8pm, when they returned home, Singh went to call his daughter but after repetitive knocks at the door, Shubhangi did not open it. Along with his domestic help, he broke open the door and found his daughter lying in a pool of blood.

Police said that Shubhangi had shot herself with the licensed revolver of her father on her temple and the revolver was lying close to her. The parents rushed Shubhangi to a private hospital in Gomtinagar from where she was referred to KGMU trauma centre, where she was declared brought dead. Around 11pm, KGMU staff informed Gomtinagar police about the incident, following which an inquiry began. According to police, one domestic help heard a cracker-like sound but didn't realize that it was a gunshot and was fired inside the house. All other rooms were locked and the sound was barely heard by anyone else.

Gomtinagar station house officer Amit Kumar Dubey said, ""We have not found any note from the room of the girl. The parents of the girl have not lodged any police complaint. There was only one bullet in the licensed revolver which is in our custody. Prima facie, it is a case of suicide. However, the motive is not clear. We will lodge an FIR if the family gives an application.""

The father of the deceased runs a petrol pump and LPG agency in Sultanpur. The family lives in an apartment on the fifth floor of the building.
