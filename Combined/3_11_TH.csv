The sixth seed and world number six Sindhu got the better of the American, ranked eight places below her, 21-14 21-17 in 42 minutes. The second game was a close affair with the two players locked at 16-16. Sindhu, however, won five points in a row after it became 17-all to clinch the issue.

It was the 10th meeting between the two players with Sindhu improving the head-to-head record to 6-4. The last time they met was at the Korea Open where the American won in three sets.

The lower-rated Stefanova (Elo 2453) outlasted the Indian no.2 (Elo rating 2518) in a 95-move game late on Tuesday to improve to 3.5 points. Kashlinskaya, who was the joint leader with compatriot Alexandra Goryachkina after the seventh round, lost to world champion Ju Wenjun to slip to joint second spot.

3,2020/03/11,Manish Kaushik wins intense box-off to make Olympic cut as Indian boxing records best qualifying show,"Kaushik defeated Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside 4-1 to make the cut for Tokyo 2020 after a draining showdown

World bronze-medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) on Wednesday became the ninth Indian boxer to book an Olympic berth after winning a brutal box-off at the Asian Qualifiers as the country recorded its best ever qualifying numbers for the quadrennial showpiece.

Kaushik defeated Commonwealth Games champion and second seed Harrison Garside 4-1 to make the cut for Tokyo 2020 after a draining showdown which left the Australian with a bloodied face and the Indian exhausted by painful hits to his ribs.

It was a repeat of the 2018 CWG final, only this time, Kaushik ended up on the winning side. The top six in the 63kg category were entitled to Olympic berths in the ongoing event. Both Kaushik and Garside had lost in the quarterfinals.

“It was my dream to play at the Olympics and today it has finally come true for me and my family. My coaches have made a huge contribution in this,” Kaushik, an Armyman, said after the win.

The other Indians to have qualified for Tokyo Olympics are MC Mary Kom (51kg), Simranjit Kaur (60kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg), Pooja Rani (75kg), Amit Panghal (52kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg).

Before this, India’s best qualifying number for an Olympic Games was eight for the 2012 edition in London. That too was achieved over more than one qualifying tournament.

Loss for Sachin Kumar

However, in a disappointing result, first-timer Sachin Kumar (81kg) was pummelled by Shabbos Negmatulloev of Tajikistan in his box-off final to bow out of contention for an Olympic place at this event.

Earlier, Olympic-bound Commonwealth Games champion Krishan signed off with a silver medal after an eye injury forced him to pull out of the final on Wednesday.

Krishan, a world and Asian medallist, was to take on Jordan’s Zeyad Eashash in the summit clash.

“He will not compete because of the cut. He has been told by the doctors to pull out,” a source close to the boxer told PTI.

Krishan had defeated second seed Ablaikhan Zhussupov of Kazakhstan, a two-time world bronze-medallist, in the semifinals on Tuesday.

4,2020/03/11,Coronavirus effect: No fans allowed in India Open,"“The India Open will be held as planned.”

The India Open Super 500 tournament, a crucial event for the Tokyo Olympic qualification, will be held without any spectators due to the global novel coronavirus outbreak, Badminton Association of India (BAI) said on Wednesday.

The USD 400,000 tournament was under threat in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has claimed over 4000 lives and infected more than 100,000 people globally.

However, BAI and the Badminton World Federation (BWF) on Wednesday issued a joint statement, making it clear that the event will go ahead as originally planned adding that precautionary measures will be taken for the smooth conduct of the tournament.

“The YONEX-SUNRISE India Open 2020 to be staged in New Delhi from 24-29 March will go ahead as planned,” the statement said.

“Enhanced precautionary measures will be in place to ensure the welfare and safety of players, their entourage and officials.”

One of the precautions taken by the organisers is to restrict the entry of people inside the stadium.

“The India Open will be held as planned at the KD Jadhav stadium in Indira Gandhi Indoor stadium but to ensure safety of everybody we have decided not to allow any spectator this time,” BAI General Secretary, Ajay K. Singhania told PTI.

“Fans can watch the matches on youtube for the initial days while Hotstar will show the matches from quarterfinal onwards,” he said.

The cornavirus outbreak has already forced the postponement of four Olympic qualifying badminton events so far — Lingshui China Masters (February 25 to March 1), Vietnam International Challenge (24-29 March 24-29), German Open (March 3 to 8) and Polish Open (March 26-29).

Given the health hazard, the Indian government has suspended all regular visas/e-visas granted on or before March 3 to nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan who have not yet entered India.

The government has also made a 14-day quarantine mandatory for the people coming from Republic of Korea, Iran and Italy to India.

According to the advisory, passengers arriving directly or indirectly from China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan must undergo medical screening at the port of entry.

The draw of the Indian Open includes shuttlers from most of these countries, including a number of top Chinese players such as He Bingjiao, Shi Yu Qi and Lin Dan, who were cleared to participate in upcoming BWF World Tour tournaments in Europe.

The BWF and BAI said it has reached the decision to host the event after “BAI consulted experts over the past few days regarding advisories issued by health authorities in India.”

“BWF accepts that all relevant health, safety and logistical risks have been considered in this process,” the statement read.

After India Open, the Malaysia Open World Tour Super 750 (March 31-April 5) and Singapore Open World Tour Super 500 (April 7-12) are the only two major events which fall inside the April 28 deadline for Olympic qualification.

Many top players such as two-time Olympic champion Lin Dan, London bronze medallist Saina Nehwal and Rio Olympics quarterfinalist Kidambi Srikanth are racing against time to book their ticket to Tokyo.

BWF reiterated that it “is continuing to monitor all official updates on COVID-19 with no change to the intention to stage other HSBC BWF World Tour or BWF-sanctioned tournaments at this time.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/trzm5x/article31039741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHUTTLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-effect-no-fans-allowed-in-india-open/article31039742.ece
5,2020/03/11,"Javelin thrower Shivpal qualifies for Tokyo Olympics, joins Neeraj Chopra","Says he will work on the ‘block’ issues after winning in a South African meet

He has been having issues with the ‘block’ while throwing the javelin for some time.

Still, Shivpal Singh produced an impressive 85.47m eﬀort in the Athletics Central North West League meet at Potchefstroom, South Africa, on Tuesday evening, a throw that helped the 24year-old to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.

He is the second Indian javelin thrower to make the cut. Neeraj Chopra, the World No. 4 and the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games champion, had qualiﬁed with an 87.86m effort in another ACNW League meet, also at Potchefstroom, in late January. The entry standard for Tokyo is 85m.

Shivpal Singh qualifies for #Olympics @Tokyo2020 with a performance of 85.47m in Men's Javelin in #SouthAfrica.



Annu Rani threw 61.15m in her first competition of the year, good start for. — Athletics Federation of India (@afiindia) March 10, 2020

“I was not surprised with this throw because I had

done a bigger one last year,” Shivpal, the World No. 16, told The Hindu shortly after winning the gold. “But my block is still not good, I still have issues with it, I’ve got to work on it.” Shivpal, who had won the Asian championship in Doha in April last year with a personal best 86.23m, has been very inconsistent after that. He could only manage a best of 78.97m in the qualiﬁcation round of the Doha World championships in October and failed to progress to the ﬁnal.

Surprisingly, he was in impressive form in smaller meets towards the end of last year with an 83.33m effort in the World Military Games in Wuhan in October and 84.16m in the South Asian Games in Kathmandu in December. Shivpal, coached by Germany’s former World record

holder Uwe Hohn, feels this year could be his best and surprised one when he spoke about his 91m goal for the year. Neeraj’s impressive performances in international meets have removed the mental barrier for javelin throwers in the country...a sort of Saina Nehwal eﬀect in badminton. And it looks like the javelin throwers now believe that nothing is impossible! But it will be wonderful if Shivpal’s big throw comes in abig meet.

Meanwhile, National record holder Annu Rani, also an Asian silver medallist who ﬁnished eighth in the Doha Worlds last year, won the women’s event in the meet with a 61.15m eﬀort.

BIC and Madras Motor Race Track (MMRT) hosted the league’s inaugural season last year. Mechanical issues were reported with the cars used last season.

“We’ve kind of dissected everything, and realised the first thing we need to change are the cars. We are speaking to multiple people in India and abroad.

7,2020/03/11,Squash | Ramachandran lauds ISA contribution,"Calls for sponsors to support infrastructure building

Squash Rackets Federation of India (SRFI) patron and former Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president N. Ramachandran attributed squash's emergence in India to the Indian Squash Academy (ISA), speaking in a panel discussion in the CII Tamil Nadu Fitness & Sports Summit 2020 at the Taj Coromandel here on Tuesday.

""Squash was hardly mentioned in the newspapers 20 years ago.

Catalyst

“The ISA proved to be the catalyst for its emergence in the last two decades. Indian squash today only awaits a World champion!"" he said.

He said a country like Malaysia could produce a World champion like Nicol David, who was World No. 1 for nine straight years, since it invests $5 million dollars in the sport every year. ""India invests around ₹1-1.5 crore,"" he said.

Referring to China's sports infrastructure, he said private firms could help realise it in India.

""This (infrastructure) is where private sector firms could infuse a sense of direction, perhaps some inspiration,"" he said.

National/State sports governing bodies should be held responsible if sportspersons don't perform. ""It might be controversial, but it's my view. If you (governing bodies) take money from sponsors, you should be held accountable,"" he stated.

""When I was IOA president, the maximum problems we faced were with the National sports federations that had leagues. They (the federation officials/members) fought among themselves,"" he said.

He added that ""the need of the hour is new thinking"".

8,2020/03/11,A big inspiration for everyone: Ankita,"Gives credit to entire team for the historic achievement

It took Indian women’s tennis 30 years to make the breakthrough and make the World Group play-off. It has taken Ankita Raina only eight years. “This should boost Indian women’s tennis. It is a big inspiration for everyone and should give the girls belief,” Ankita said, delighted to be part of the historic achievement.

Impressive wins

The 27-year-old Ankita has been playing well on the circuit — won the 2018 Asian Games bronze and has had impressive wins in the Fed Cup, like beating Nao Hibino of Japan in 2016 and Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan in 2018.

Summing up the experience, when she played eight matches in five days, won two singles and three decisive doubles with Sania Mirza, the 163rd-ranked Ankita was sharp.

“Winning Fed Cup matches is completely different from winning on the pro tour, because no matter how good you are, you cannot win if you are not good as a team. You can be top-50, but if you don’t have two or three more good players from your country, it is tough,” said Ankita, back home, after the unforgettable week in Dubai.

Originally, the tournament was scheduled to be played in China, and was postponed and shifted to Dubai, following the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Ankita has always pushed herself hard in the Fed Cup and while playing for the country.

“For me personally, it was a great example of pushing my limits much more than ever before, as I was playing two matches within half an hour. So playing a singles three-setter and then playing a doubles three-setter definitely showed how much you can challenge yourself physically,” she remarked.

Ankita played the most crucial singles rubber against Aldila Sutjiadi of Indonesia on the last day, when she had to rescue the team from 0-1 down, “play under pressure and make sure the tie goes into the deciding doubles”.

The best-ranked Indian woman in singles and doubles, Ankita gracefully shared the credit. “Our captain Vishaal Uppal did a phenomenal job of getting the team together and making sure we were supporting each other,” she said.

Also coach Ankita Bhambri and physio Anand Dubey were leading the cheering squad. Riya Bhatia and Sowjanya Bavisetti kept the atmosphere positive throughout and were always ready to help in practice, said Ankita.

While she was thankful for trainer Rutuja Patange being with her, Ankita was thrilled to accomplish the task with her fellow pro Rutuja Bhosale.

Significant presence

“It was great that Rutuja and me were part of this historic moment. We have played Fed Cup together and at different times. It was such a special moment that India qualified this time when we were together,” she said.

She also had a word of thanks for Hemant Bendrey who has trained them both. “Hats off to his dedication, sacrifice and perseverance for so many years.”

Having stopped looking for another Sania, Indian women’s tennis has started finding performers who inspire confidence of a bright tomorrow.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/pt4wcz/article31042836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11RAINA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/a-big-inspiration-for-everyone-ankita/article31042837.ece
9,2020/03/11,How BingeIt uses AI to help cinema-lovers decide what to watch next,"The multi-device app also doubles as a social platform to connect friends and family who share similar interests

When Sai Kiran Rathan used to browse streaming sites based on what to watch next, he did not realise how much time was getting wasted after a long day at work. One evening, last August , he saw a full 90 minutes go by in a flash, and called up his old friend Sai Kiran Alagundula to crib about his situation. The two had met in 2011 during the Microsoft Student Partner (MSP) programme, and kept in touch ever since so they became each other’s sounding boards for ideating.

“The [aforementioned] situation might seem mundane to many,” Rathan avers, “But time is precious and who wouldn’t want to watch something just right for them? So we came together to form AwesomeLabs and started brainstorming how to go about this problem, which we knew many people were experiencing.”

Behind the screens BingeIt founders Sai Kiran Rathan and Sai Kiran Alagundula special arrangement | Photo Credit: by arrangement

Now based in Hyderabad, Rathan and Alagundula came up with BingeIt, a multi-device app, which leverages Artificial Intelligence to help users discover aggregated OTT content, while also building peer-to-peer recommendations. BingeIt also doubles as a social platform to connect friends and family who share similar interests.

By September, they had the initial prototype. The next three months, however picked up more pace with a beta stage including a closed group of testers. According to Rathan, developing the app took a few weeks longer than the duo’s goal timeline. “We had aimed for a Deepavali launch date to coincide with the holiday season, but things didn’t work out. With some last-minute coding, we readied ourselves for a January 2 launch date with Apple and Android compatibility.”

Rathan undertakes the innovation and development side of BingeIt, while Alagundula oversees the business and marketing aspects.

Present and future

The app, like most entertainment apps as of late, has a minimal two-tone aesthetic with a clutter-free user experience. There are currently six main sections including a static home page where recommendations show up on an infinite scroll screen. A section titled ‘Top Recommendations’ is divided into ‘My Circle’ and ‘Global’, the former changing its content depending on who you have in your friends list and the latter updating when new content is released across various streaming platforms.

The ‘My Recommendations’ tab in BingeIt offers two schools of content, based on popularity and the user’s social circle on the app

So how is this different from, say, the ratings recommendations on Netflix? Rathan explains that these recommendations come from your friends, and people you may or may not know. It goes both ways; there is also the contrary situation where someone with ‘not so great’ taste in entertainment can prove something might not be to your liking. “The current user base for BingeIt is around 1,000 users, and 50 to 60 daily active users. We started seeing a lot of traction lately and adding new users every day. We haven't done any full scale activity yet, so the user base is purely organic and/or referred users.”

Rathan says that current users are spread across India and the US. “This was really helpful in testing. For example, we have Rick and Morty on Netflix in India, but the licensing model for Netflix USA does not have the show. So if I were to recommend this show to my friend there, it would not have the same streaming logo badges for them. That is one development I have been really particular about perfecting,” elaborates Rathan.

The landing page on BingeIt app offers recently-released recommendations

The social side of BingeIt allows users to create interest-based groups to organically (in some way) share movie or series picks. “This is still helping people stay in touch,” says Rathan, “and while we do have a strong AI, there’s nothing quite like having that trusted recommendation from someone you know, which is the core spirit of our app.” Each recommendation comes with the streaming logo badge (for Netflix, Hotstar and Amazon Prime) as per their availabilities. “We are looking forward to include more streaming platforms which the country keeps creating.”

There are quite a few features in the future of BingeIt, says Rathan. “We want to appeal to discerning cinema buffs, so we would like to have crew-specific projects come up; for example, films featuring cinematography by Roger Deakins. Right now, we can show recommendations by actor.”

It does not have in-app paid features yet, which Alagundula says could change in the near future. “Right now, we are focussed on user aggregation and seeing how people respond to our app.” Though the app is currently available on smartphones and iPads, AwesomeLabs want to bring a smart-TV compatibility to make streaming smoother. “We have so many other developments in the pipeline,” says Alagundula excitedly. “This is just the beginning.”

10,2020/03/11,Tech tools for working from home during the coronavirus epidemic,"While employees at large firms have robust IT infrastructure that provide tools for productivity, communication, storage and security, those in smaller firms can use some of these tools to work efficiently at home.

Many organisations and businesses are asking their employees to work from home as the number of coronavirus infections continues to surge globally.

Last week, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook advised their employees in some locations to work from home to reduce risks from COVID-19 outbreak. Cognizant closed its office in Hyderabad, and has asked its employees to work from home.

The shift to working at home option is not confined to large global corporations. PayTM, Zoho and many start-ups are asking their workers to work from home.

While employees at large firms have robust IT infrastructure that provide tools for productivity, communication, storage and security, those in smaller firms can use some of these tools to work efficiently at home.

Wi-Fi connection

First things first. With a patchy mobile network, it can get really hard to stay connected to the internet. As most work applications are accessed online, an uninterrupted broadband connection is an absolute must if you want to stay efficient at home.

If you have been using Slack for work-related correspondence, Sametime to chat with a colleagues or Outlook or Notes to exchange emails, not to mention various other work-related applications, then switch over from mobile hotspots to a stable broadband connection.

If you do not already have a broadband connection, it's time to get one now.

Messaging

While staying at home can give you that much-needed private space, it can also take away those mini check-ins on processes, timelines and products with colleagues. One of the easiest ways to keep these conversations alive is by creating a temporary WhatsApp group.

This group can be used to have short conversations, share brief insights and get feedback.

The web feature in WhatsApp can make it easier to type out messages and receive responses real-time. The app can also be used to transfer documents in a secure way as messages are encrypted end-to-end.

Video-conferencing

As in-person interaction is not possible, the closest one can get is via video call. Skype, Zoom and Google Hangouts offer free video-conferencing options.

Skype for business is free to use with up to 25 members, and the service provides several hours of calls.

Also Read Dell and Mindtree confirm one case each of COVID-19

Google Hangouts offers group chat and video calling option with up to 10 people.

Lastly, Zoom providers free video-conferencing solution for its users. It gives unlimited one-on-one video call facility and 40 min-capped group meetings.

Documents and storage

As employees collaborate with one another, it helps to have an efficient cloud storage and retrieval application.

Google Drive offers unlimited storage of Google Docs, Sheets, Slides and PDFs. Microsoft’s OneDrive provides 1GB folder to store documents that can be easily accessed anywhere. Dropbox provides similar amount of storage capacity for its users.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/qgophm/article31040268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THJXWFH,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/tech-tools-for-working-from-home-during-the-coronavirus-epidemic/article31040174.ece

As many as 22 Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh resigned from the Assembly on Tuesday, plunging the government into a crisis. As soon as Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from the primary membership of the party early in the morning after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 13 MLAs and six Ministers owing allegiance to him, sent-in their resignations to the Governor via email, Raj Bhavan sources confirmed.

The festering resentment of being spurned for the post of Chief Minister and the State Congress chief, coupled with the Lok Sabha election upset, nudged Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, the second-most popular leader after in Madhya Pradesh during Assembly election campaigning in 2018, to abandon the party.

British MP Nadine Dorries, a minister in the health department, has tested positive for coronavirus, she said in a statement on Tuesday. Health officials are now trying to trace where she contracted the virus and who she has been in contact with, she added.

Fourteen more people have tested positive for COVID-19 — eight in Kerala and three each in Karnataka and Maharashtra, State authorities said on Tuesday, as the total cases in the country went up to 61. Of the eight positive cases in Kerala, six belong to the COVID-19 cluster that originated in Pathanamthitta district, all of which are linked to the family that arrived from Italy on February 29.

With elections to four Rajya Sabha seats underway in Gujarat, political activity in the State is set to intensify as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appears determined to retain the three seats despite being short of numbers on its side. Out of the four seats, currently, the BJP holds three, while one is with the Opposition Congress. The arithmetic suggests both the BJP and the Congress can get two seats each in the absence of voting, based on the number of legislators on both sides.

Despite various State governments raising concerns about the COVID-19 threat to the Indian Premier League’s (IPL’s) 13th edition, scheduled to start on March 29, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to adopt a “wait and watch” approach before taking a final call on the money-spinning T20 tourney.

Italians braced for a second day of national lockdown on Wednesday after a sharp spike in coronavirus-related deaths, as New York deployed the National Guard to contain a disease that has sown worldwide panic.

Europe’s hardest-hit country said the death toll from COVID-19 had risen on Tuesday by a third to 631, with the surging epidemic playing havoc with global sporting, cultural and political events.

While authorities in China, where the outbreak began, have declared it “basically curbed”, cases are multiplying around the world, sparking panic buying in shops, and wild swings on financial markets.

Its seemingly relentless march has now claimed its first victim in Central America, with a 64-year-old man dying in Panama on Tuesday. Indonesia also reported its first death.

China remains the hardest-hit overall with more than 80,000 cases and 3,000 deaths, out of a global total of 1,17,339 cases and 4,251 fatalities in 107 countries and territories, according to an AFP tally.

Beijing reported an increase in imported cases Wednesday, fuelling concerns that infections from overseas could undermine its progress in halting the spread of the virus.

Nevertheless, some companies in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the virus emerged late last year, are to be allowed to return to work — a sign things are gradually returning to normal.

Coronavirus is infecting all walks of life, including politics, with U.S. Democratic presidential hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden both cancelling rallies.

And amid criticism of the U.S. authorities' response, New York deployed the National Guard for the first time during the crisis to help contain the spread of the disease from an infection-hit suburb.

“It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. This is literally a matter of life and death,” said State Governor Andrew Cuomo. At least 28 people have died in the U.S. with 1,025 infected— nearly double the 550 total confirmed cases the day before.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5iwffq/article31043349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-banner-Italy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/virus-toll-soars-in-italy-us-cases-double/article31043350.ece
14,2020/03/11,Parliament passes amendment allowing Putin to stay in power,"Nationwide vote on April 22; two activists stage lone pickets.

Constitutional changes allowing Vladimir Putin to run for President again in 2024 sailed through Russia’s lower house of Parliament on Wednesday, opening the way for him to potentially stay in power until 2036.

Mr. Putin, a former KGB officer, is currently required by the Constitution to step down in 2024 when his second sequential and fourth presidential term ends. But the amendment would formally reset his presidential term tally to zero.

The 450-seat State Duma, the lower house of Parliament, on Wednesday voted in favour of the change, along with other amendments to the Constitution, by 383 votes. Nobody voted against, but 43 lawmakers abstained. Twenty-four lawmakers were absent.

If, as Mr. Putin critics expect, the constitutional court now gives its blessing to the amendment and it is backed in a nationwide vote on April 22, Mr. Putin would have the option to run again for President in 2024.

Kremlin critic and opposition politician Alexei Navalny has said he believes Mr. Putin will now try to become President for life.

Sri Lanka on Wednesday urged the public to cooperate with the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the island nation, after a local tourist guide tested positive for the new coronavirus.

The 52-year-old tourist guide was on Tuesday found to be the first Sri Lankan to be infected by the virus, according to the Director General of Health Dr. Anil Jasinghe. The patient has been sent to the infectious diseases hospital, a press release from the President’s Media Division said.

16,2020/03/11,Myanmar Army blocks bid to limit their power base,"Suu Kyi’s path to presidency blocked.

Myanmar’s military on Tuesday quashed proposals in Parliament that would mean its MPs relinquish power, in a vote pitting the armed forces in open opposition against Aung San Suu Kyi as elections loom.

The vote was the climax of a year of fierce debates between MPs as the civilian government attempted to reform the Constitution and reduce the military’s stranglehold on Parliament.

The country is gearing up to polls likely to be held later this year, only the second since outright military rule came to an end.

But the military still wields considerable power, appointing three key Ministers — defence, border and home affairs.

Crucially, it holds a quarter of parliamentary seats, effectively giving it a veto over any legislation.

Ms. Suu Kyi’s ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) has been fighting for reforms of the military-scripted 2008 constitution.

The Parliament also rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the country’s de facto leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, to officially become President.

The Afghan government said on Wednesday it would free 1,500 Taliban prisoners, while delaying the release of another 3,500 that the militants say must be set free for talks to begin under a peace deal reached with the United States.

The Taliban promised to open talks with the Afghan government as part of the accord reached with the United States last month to end 18 years of U.S. involvement in war in Afghanistan.

The militants say the agreement requires the government to release 5,000 prisoners before talks begin. The government says the talks must begin and violence subside before it will free them all.

Sources have told Reuters the dispute arises in part because of different wording about the prisoner release in separate agreements the United States reached with the Taliban and the Afghan government.

President Ashraf Ghani has issued a decree ordering the release of an initial 1,500 prisoners, with the other 3,500 to be set free as conditions are met, Mr. Ghani's spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said.

“The Taliban want all 5,000 prisoners released at once, which is impossible,” Mr. Sediqqi told journalists at a news conference. The first prisoners would be freed on March 14, he said.

Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Taliban based in Doha, told Reuters the group had never agreed that there would be conditions attached to the release of the 5,000 prisoners.

“If someone claims this, it will be against the peace accord that we signed on February 29, Mr. Shaheen said. “It is properly explained in the peace accord that first 5,000 prisoners would be freed and then the Afghan dialogue would be initiated.”

Despite the accord between the United States and the Taliban, fighting has continued in various parts of the country.

“The Taliban will be responsible, not the Afghan government, if this process fails,” Mr. Sediqqi said.

Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy who was the key negotiator in talks with the Taliban, has urged both sides to sit down for talks.

Taliban leaders told Reuters that their leadership council has also rejected an Afghan government demand that they give written guarantees that the released prisoners will not take part in fighting the Afghan government in the future.

Meanwhile, the formation of a negotiating team that is to participate in the talks with the Taliban as part of the intra-Afghan dialogue has been delayed due to continuing political consultations, Mr. Sediqqi said.

The composition of the team has been a bone of contention between the Afghan President and his main rival Abduallah Abdullah, who has refused to recognise Mr. Ghani's re-election in last year's Presidential polls.

Mr. Abdullah, the runner-up who disputed the outcome in each of Afghanistan’s last three Presidential elections, served as chief executive of a unity government since 2014. He held a ceremony this week to declare himself president on the same day Mr. Ghani was sworn in for a second term elsewhere in the capital.

“President Ghani has told us he is consulting with Dr. Abdullah and other Afghan leaders and will announce an inclusive team in the coming few days,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, Mr. Ghani's spokesman announced that a decree had been issued to dissolve Abdullah's chief executive post.

Some residents along the Japanese northern coast on Wednesday stood on roadsides overlooking the sea, offering silent prayers for their loved ones lost in a massive earthquake and tsunami nine years ago. But in Tokyo and many other places around Japan, the day was being remembered without a main government ceremony due to the coronavirus outbreak.

On March 11, 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated large swaths of Japan’s northern coast and triggered a meltdown at a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, contaminating large areas and dislocating many residents.

For the past eight years, residents and officials have gathered at local town halls to pray, while in Tokyo, the government held a main memorial attended by the Imperial Family members, televised live nationwide.

This year, memorial events have been called off following Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s request to cancel, postpone or downsize gatherings as part of measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

In Tokyo, Mr. Abe and his ministers were to gather at the Prime Minister’s Office to offer a silent prayer at 2:46 p.m., the moment the offshore earthquake struck.

In disaster-hit towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima, desks were put out for visitors to sign messages and lay flowers.

Separately, several hundred people, including anti-nuclear activists, were to gather at Tokyo’s Hibiya Park to mark the anniversary with music and speeches.

The quake and tsunami left more than 18,000 people dead and destroyed many houses and businesses. The meltdown at the Fukushima plant sent more than 160,000 people fleeing the region. More than 40,000 are still unable to return home due to radiation contamination and concerns.

19,2020/03/11,Joe Biden widens lead over Bernie Sanders with wins,"Former Vice-President takes four States in primaries, appeals for unity in party.

If ‘Super Tuesday’ last week made former U.S. Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. the frontrunner in the Democratic primaries, then this Tuesday confirmed it in a big way with wins in four States, with support from African American, suburban and rural voters.

The biggest prize for the night was Mr. Biden’s decisive victory against his opponent, progressive candidate Senator Bernie Sanders, in Michigan – a State Donald Trump had flipped in 2016 from Democrats and which Mr Sanders himself had won in the primary that year against Hilary Clinton. Mr. Biden also won Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho . While there were questions on Tuesday night about Mr. Sanders’s continuation in the primaries, the Vermont Senator announced on Wednesday afternoon that he would stay in the race and debate Mr. Biden on Sunday.

Mr. Sanders won North Dakota and led in the second most delegate rich State for the night — Washington. With delegates still being counted, Mr. Sanders had won a total of 110 on Tuesday (684 cumulatively), but that was still not enough to keep up with Mr. Biden’s 176 ( 846 cumulatively).

Mr. Biden’s won by huge margins among African American voters across States — for instance, 87% in Mississippi versus Mr. Sanders’s 10% in that State, as per exit polls conducted by Edison Media Research and analysed by the Washington Post. However, he also won the white vote — by narrower margins — in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi.

In Michigan, Mr. Biden won the African American vote by 53% against Mr. Sanders’s 37%. Significantly, the very voters — rural and suburban whites — who had handed Mr. Sanders a victory against Hilary Clinton in the Michigan primary in 2016 were now part of the reason for Mr. Biden’s victory in the State. Mr. Sanders won among Latinos and younger people — those under 45, and he won strongly in the 18-29 age group.

Mr. Sanders’s campaign has banked on their ability to motivate a higher voter turnout (usually a result of younger people turning out to vote) but preliminary results from Tuesday suggest that they did not pull this off, as was the case in the earlier races.

On Tuesday night, Mr. Biden spoke of unity in Philadelphia . “I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion,” he said. “We share a common goal. Together, we will defeat Donald Trump. We will defeat him together.”

Mr. Sanders was the leading candidate at the end of February after coming second in Iowa in terms of delegates, first in Nevada by a large margin and tied for delegates with former candidate and Southbend Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mr. Biden’s crucial February 29 victory in South Carolina, which hinged on support from African Americans brought the former Vice-President back into the race and gave him the momentum to go into Super Tuesday (March 3). Also crucial to his performance last Tuesday was getting endorsed by former rivals, Mr. Buttigieg and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who dropped out of the race before Super Tuesday.

Progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren and billionaire Michael Bloomberg also dropped out of the race following Super Tuesday. The former New York Mayor, Mr. Bloomberg, endorsed Mr. Biden, while Ms Warren has not endorsed anyone so far.

”There's no sugar-coating it. Tonight is a tough night,” millennial congresswoman from New York, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, an important Sanders supporter, said on Tuesday via Instagram. Mr. Sanders did not deliver public comments on Tuesday night.

“Last night obviously was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,’’ Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday afternoon from Burlington, Vermont. However, his movement was winning “not just the ideological debate” but also the “generational debate”, Mr Sanders said. He also said that he was losing the debate over “electability”.

The road ahead however is expected to be challenging for Mr Sanders, with four states that Mr Sanders lost in 2016 - Ohio, Illinois, Florida and Arizona, going to the polls next Tuesday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/agpvya/article31036952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKELECTION2020JOEBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-wins-mississippi-and-missouri-in-early-blow-to-bernie-sanders/article31036953.ece

New York’s Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Tuesday he is sending the National Guard into a “containment area” in New York City suburb to help fight what is believed to be the nation’s biggest cluster of coronavirus cases — one of the most dramatic actions yet to control the outbreak in the U.S.

The move came as health authorities contended with alarming concentrations of the disease on both sides of the country and scattered cases in between.

Schools, houses of worship and large gathering places will be shuttered for two weeks in a “containment area” in New Rochelle, and the troops will scrub surfaces and deliver food to the zone, which extends a mile in all directions from a point near a synagogue connected to some of the cases, Mr. Cuomo said.

“It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster of cases in the country,” Cuomo said. “The numbers are going up unabated, and we do need a special public health strategy.”

The virus has infected over 700 people in the U.S. and killed at least 27, with one state after another recording its first infections in quick succession. New Jersey recorded its first COVID-19 death.

25,2020/03/11,UN appeals for funds to shield refugees from COVID-19,"The UN refugee agency said it was seeking an initial $33 million “to boost the preparedness, prevention and response activities”

The United Nations made an urgent appeal on Tuesday for tens of millions of dollars to help protect vulnerable refugees against the spread of the deadly new coronavirus.

The UN refugee agency said it was seeking an initial $33 million “to boost the preparedness, prevention and response activities to address the immediate public health needs of refugees prompted by COVID-19.”

So far, there have not been any reports of the virus, which has killed more than 4,000 people worldwide, spreading among communities of refugees and asylum seekers.

But UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi stressed the need to protect some of the world's most vulnerable against the disease, which shows mild symptoms in most cases but which often provokes severe illness and death in the weakest individuals.

“The virus can affect anyone and it is our collective responsibility to ensure that the global response includes all people,” Mr. Grandi said in a statement.

“Allowing full access to health services, including for the most marginalised members of the community, is the best way to protect us all,” he said.

“Everyone on this planet — including refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced people — should be able to access health facilities and services.”

More than 70 million people globally been forced by conflict, persecution, violence and abuses to flee their homes, including more than 20 million people living as refugees, according to UN data.

A full 84% of the world's refugees are meanwhile hosted in low or middle-income countries with weaker health, water and sanitation systems, the UNHCR pointed out.

26,2020/03/11,Russia meddling in MH17 probe,"Prosecutors say the defendants, three Russians and a Ukrainian, helped arrange the Russian missile system used to shoot down MH17, a civilian aircraft, killing all 298 passengers on board

Dutch prosecutors accused Russia on Tuesday of trying to sabotage the investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine in 2014, saying this cast “a dark shadow” over the impending trial of four suspects in the crash.

Pre-trial hearings began in Amsterdam on Monday. Prosecutors say the defendants, three Russians and a Ukrainian, helped arrange the Russian missile system used to shoot down MH17, a civilian aircraft, killing all 298 passengers, most of them Dutch, on board.

“The sum of all the facts casts a dark shadow over this investigation because there is strong indicative evidence that Russian government is keen to thwart the investigation,” prosecutor Thijs Berger said.

“Several witnesses in this investigation have said that they fear for their lives if their identities would come to light... The use of Russian security services to discover the identity of witnesses in the investigation is a very real scenario,” he said

MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014, when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Moscow rebels in eastern Ukraine. Russia has denied any involvement.

The defendants — Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko — held senior posts in the pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine in 2014, according to prosecutors.

The four face preliminary charges of the murder of 298 people and of causing the aircraft to crash. The suspects are believed to be in Russia and are not expected to attend. On Monday, judges decided the trial would continue with the suspects absent.

Only Pulatov has appointed a defence lawyer, who said on Monday that her client was not involved or responsible “in any way”. Girkin has said rebels were not responsible for the plane's downing.

Countries participating in the investigation - Ukraine, the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia and Belgium - agreed in 2017 to hold trials in the Netherlands under Dutch law after attempts to set up a U.N.-backed tribunal foundered over Russian opposition.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hlww73/article31033889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UKRAINE-CRISISMH17TRIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-meddling-in-mh17-probe/article31033890.ece

28,2020/03/11,"COVID-19: 168 die in Italy, highest single-day toll","The number of intensive care patients rose by 144 to 877 nationwide

Italy recorded 168 deaths on Tuesday from COVID-19, its highest single-day toll to date, pushing the number of fatalities outside China to more than 1,000.

Overall in Italy, 631 people have died from the disease and 10,149 have been infected in just over two weeks.

Tuesday’s toll raised the total number of deaths outside China to 1,115, according an AFP tally. The Italian government has imposed a nationwide ban on public gathering and travel restrictions until April 3.

It also puts Italy's health system under severe strain.

Health officials warned over the weekend that hospitals in the Lombardy region around Milan where three-fourths of the deaths have occurred were running out of beds.

The number of intensive care patients rose by 144 to 877 nationwide.

The overwhelming majority of the fatalities and infections were still being recorded in the north, with poorer southerns regions largely spared.

29,2020/03/11,"Coronavirus: Outbreak set to worsen, says top U.S. health official","A total of 755 confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed nationwide as of Tuesday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University

The COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. is likely to get worse, the country's top public health official said on Tuesday, and Americans should assess their personal circumstances when deciding whether to cancel travel plans or avoid public gatherings.

The virus has steadily spread in the U.S. this week, disrupting life and spooking investors who worry that a contraction in economic activity could trigger a recession.

“Not every community has an outbreak going on right now, but people should know that this is likely to get worse before it gets better,” U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said in an interview on ABC.

A total of 755 confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 were confirmed nationwide as of Tuesday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. There have been 26 coronavirus-related deaths in the country, most of them in Washington state.

The U.S. administration has been criticised for a slow response to the public health crisis and is under growing pressure to do more to help workers and companies hurt by the outbreak and to boost investors' confidence in the economy.

After U.S. stock indexes recorded their biggest one-day selloff since 2008 on Monday, President Donald Trump said his administration would take “major” steps to gird the economy and discuss a possible payroll tax cut with congressional Republicans on Tuesday.

He did not provide details but said a news briefing would be held on Tuesday.

A payroll tax cut could encourage consumer spending and help households that might otherwise struggle to make rent and mortgage payments on time or pay medical bills if family members' work hours are reduced during the coronavirus outbreak.

U.S. stock indexes opened higher on Tuesday.

Virtual classes

More than 113,000 people have contracted the coronavirus around the world and nearly 4,000 have died since it surfaced in China late last year. More than 100 nations have reported cases, with Italy bearing the brunt of the outbreak in Europe.

Italy's government on Monday took its most drastic steps yet to contain the outbreak, ordering the country's 60 million people not to move around other than for work or emergencies, banning public gatherings and suspending sporting events.

In the United States, 34 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia have reported infections of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Washington state has been the hardest hit, with a nursing home in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland accounting for the bulk of the state's 22 confirmed deaths.

In California, the Grand Princess cruise ship docked at the Port of Oakland on Monday and had begun offloading its 2,400 passengers. The vessel was barred from returning to San Francisco last week due to a coronavirus outbreak on board.

Most of the passengers will be quarantined at military bases in the United States, with those requiring immediate medical attention heading to hospitals. The crew of 1,100 will be quarantined and treated aboard the ship, unless they are in need of acute care off the vessel.

California and New York each have more than 140 confirmed coronavirus cases.

As the outbreak spreads, daily life in United States has been increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled, and universities urging students to stay home and take classes online.

U.S. health officials have urged older people, especially those with chronic medical concerns, to avoid big social gatherings, cruise ships and airline flights.

The public is advised to wash hands frequently and practice ”social distancing” - minimizing unnecessary contact with others in public settings. Several U.S. lawmakers have gone into self-quarantine after being in contact with a person at a conference who later tested positive for coronavirus.

30,2020/03/11,Michigan primary decisive for Sanders’ campaign,"Michigan and five other States already began voting early Tuesday morning in what will be a critical point in the Democratic race

Bernie Sanders proved his 2016 presidential bid was serious with an upset victory in Michigan powered by his opposition to free trade and appeal among working-class voters. Four years later, the State could either revive the Vermont Senator’s campaign or relegate him to the role of protest candidate.

Michigan and five other States already began voting early Tuesday morning in what will be a critical point in the Democratic race.

Former Vice-President Joe Biden is looking to quash Mr. Mr. Sanders’ hopes and cement his own front-runner status just a week after resurrecting his beleaguered White House bid with a delegate victory on Super Tuesday. He played up his underdog story on Monday as he campaigned across Michigan, reflecting on his stutter as a child and the deaths of his first wife and young daughter.

And Mr. Biden wasn’t alone. The former Vice-President courted the State’s influential African American voters alongside the two most prominent black candidates previously in the 2020 race, Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who endorsed Mr. Biden in recent days as part of a broader consolidation of support among party leaders.

They all appeared hand-in-hand at Mr. Biden’s final Michigan rally on Monday night, also joined by the state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who also endorsed the former vice president.

Mr. Sanders is in an urgent fight to turn things around as the primary calendar quickly shifts to other states that could favor Mr. Biden and narrow his path to the nomination. The senator countered the parade of Democratic firepower lining up behind Mr. Biden by securing the endorsement of the Rev. Jesse Jackson and deploying Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., on his behalf.

Dozens of Detroit residents voted before the sun came up at a polling place set up inside Greater Grace Temple, a mammoth church in the city that hosted funerals for Aretha Franklin and Rosa Parks.

Among the voters was Tahechia Franklin, a 50-year-old who works in property management.

Franklin, who voted for Bernie Sanders, said the most important issues to her are health care and “I want Trump out.”

Tuesday marks the first time voters will weigh in on the Democratic contest since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden. It will be another test of whether Mr. Sanders can broaden his appeal among African Americans. Mr. Biden, meanwhile, must show that he can keep momentum going after his surprise Super Tuesday turnaround.

""I like his chances,” Whitmer said of the former vice president in an interview.

""He knows Michigan,” the governor added. “When our back was up against the wall during the auto struggles of the past, it was Barack Obama and Joe Biden who had our backs.”

That’s a reference to the Obama administration overseeing federal bailouts that helped the auto industry - the lifeblood of Michigan’s economy - weather the 2009 financial crisis. Mr. Sanders counters that he, too, voted to save the auto industry. He also says that, unlike Mr. Biden, he opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he said prompted thousands of Michigan jobs to move to Mexico since taking effect in 1994.

Mr. Biden ticked off the names of six former presidential rivals who have endorsed him just in the past week during a Monday appearance with Booker in Flint, Michigan, a community that has seen auto industry jobs disappear- “They’ve all come out and endorsed at one time ... the candidate that they think can win.”

And later in Detroit, he stood on stage grasping hands with Whitmer, Booker and Harris, a powerful trio of potential vice presidential picks should Mr. Biden become the Democrats’ presidential nominee.

The large rally, however, was interrupted repeatedly by protesters, who railed against Mr. Biden’s support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and his reluctance to embrace sweeping environmental proposals outlined in the so-called Green New Deal.

In a scuffle with environmental protesters in the midst of Mr. Biden’s remarks, senior adviser Symone Sanders was knocked to the ground. She was not hurt. Less than a week ago she tackled a protester who rushed the stage as Mr. Biden spoke in California.

Other economic challenges emerged on Monday as fears about the spread of the new coronavirus shook financial markets, slicing 7.8% from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Mr. Sanders held a roundtable with health experts in Detroit, and Mr. Biden said he would defer to health experts about whether campaign events could continue, given concerns about the spread of the virus.

Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, stopped short of calling on candidates to put a pause on political rallies. Instead, he said he wouldn’t criticize someone seeking office for putting a pause on big gatherings.

""If you’re talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment,” Fauci said Monday at a White House briefing. “If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that’s a judgment call.”

Viral outbreaks and economic uncertainty aside, on Tuesday election-watchers had their eyes on potential problems at the polls. Early Tuesday morning, the mayor of Kansas City, Missouri, tweeted that he had been turned away from voting because “I wasn’t in the system even though I’ve voted there for 11 years.”

An outstanding question going into Tuesday was whether Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race last week, would endorse Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders. So far, she’s declined to back either, an especially frustrating development for Mr. Sanders, who could use Ms. Warren’s help in unifying progressives in much the same way Mr. Biden has been able to rally moderates.

Mr. Sanders has scoffed at suggestions he could drop out if he doesn’t win Michigan, but his travel schedule underscores its importance. He canceled a trip to Mississippi and instead made five campaign stops across Michigan since Friday.

Mr. Sanders won’t say if he’s personally lobbying Ms. Warren for her endorsement. He did manage to secure the backing of Jackson, who said it was no time for centrist compromise.

“In a general election, which candidate can generate the enthusiasm and the excitement and the voter turnout we need?” Mr. Sanders asked. “If you want to defeat Trump, which all Democrats do and the majority of independents do and some Republicans do, we are that campaign.”

One of Mr. Sanders’ highest-profile supporters, Ocasio-Cortez, struck a far more conciliatory tone the day before addressing 10,000-plus on the campus of the University of Michigan on Sunday night, saying, “In order for us to win, we have to grow.”

""We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement,” she said, urging Sanders supporters to shed “cynicism and exclusion” and “turn with an embracing posture, where all people are welcome in a people’s movement.”

Mr. Sanders is optimistic about Washington state on Tuesday, and Idaho and North Dakota, both states Mr. Sanders won in 2016, go to the polls Tuesday as well, though the lack of polling in both states has made them difficult to predict.

But the senator’s team acknowledges he will struggle in next week’s Florida primary, where the senator’s past defense of Fidel Castro looms large. He also could face long odds in Ohio and Illinois - especially if he underperforms in Michigan. Both of those states also vote March 17.

The wild card next week could be Arizona, where Mr. Sanders will be counting on strong Latino support, which lifted him to victory in California.

Sanders advisers are aware that Mr. Biden could build an insurmountable delegate lead if he runs up the score in the upcoming contests. They hope to continue doing well in the West before picking up momentum in places like delegate-rich New York, which holds its primary next month.

There’s no guarantee Mr. Sanders could last that long this time, however, given the higher expectations he now faces. Even some of those attending Sanders rallies are beginning to feel it, although his St. Louis audience was optimistic.

Alec McAulay, a 19-year-old college student from St. Louis County, said Mr. Sanders has proved that he’s a true alternative to the president.

""I think Biden agrees with Trump too much, more than any Democrat should,” Mr. McAulay said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/oy7l4v/article31033809.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONSANDERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/michigan-primary-decisive-for-sanders-campaign/article31033810.ece
31,2020/03/11,Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison,"More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused the former movie producer of sexual misconduct stretching back decades, fuelling the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and harassment.

Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to 23 years in prison on March 11 following his sexual assault and rape conviction in February in a case hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.

The sentence was handed down in Manhattan criminal court by Justice James Burke, who presided over Weinstein’s trial. A jury on February 24 found Weinstein, 67, guilty of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi and raping former aspiring actress Jessica Mann.

Once one of Hollywood’s most influential producers, Weinstein had faced the possibility of a maximum sentence of 29 years in prison.

During the sentencing hearing, prosecutor Joan Illuzzi asked judge Burke to impose 25 years or “near” 25 years in prison for his conviction on a charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree involving Ms. Haleyi and to impose a consecutive sentence for the third-degree rape conviction involving Ms. Mann. That charge called for up to four years in prison, but the prosecution made no specific request.

Weinstein, wearing a suit, and the six women who testified against Weinstein were in court for the proceedings.

In an emotional statement in court, Ms. Haleyi spoke of the trauma she had endured since the attack, saying, “It scarred me deeply, mentally and emotionally, perhaps irreparably, perhaps forever.”

Prosecutors in court filings last week said the sentence should reflect not only the crimes of which he was convicted, but a “lifetime of abuse towards others”.

More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades, fuelling the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse and harassment. Weinstein has denied the allegations and said that any sex was consensual.

The jury of seven men and five women acquitted Weinstein on the most serious charges, a single count of first-degree rape as well as two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a potential life sentence. Those charges relied on testimony by actress Annabella Sciorra, who said Weinstein raped her in the early 1990s.

Weinstein’s lawyers on March 9 urged judge Burke to impose the minimum possible sentence of five years, asking him to consider Weinstein’s charitable activities while saying a longer sentence would likely mean Weinstein would die in prison.

“His life story, his accomplishments, and struggles are simply remarkable and should not be disregarded in total because of the jury’s verdict,” they said.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/os5h88/article31042541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXSEXUALMISCONDUCTWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/harvey-weinstein-sentenced-to-23-years-in-prison/article31042543.ece

Actor Ben Affleck was on disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein’s ‘Red Flag List’, according to unsealed court documents.

Prior to the publication of the reports exposing Weinstein and igniting the #MeToo movement, the producer kept a list of names of people he was concerned could be talking to journalists in 2017 about his sexual conduct with women.

Affleck’s name appears on that document, known as the Red Flag List, which was reviewed by variety.com.

Also Read Harvey Weinstein sentenced to 23 years in prison

The list was part of about 1,000 pages of documents that were unsealed at the New York criminal courthouse, ahead of Weinstein’s sentencing on Wednesday.

The document was brought up during Weinstein’s seven-week trial, but only accuser Annabella Sciorra’s name was revealed to be on the list. The lead prosecutor requested that the list, which included both men and women, to be provided to the jury so they could see all of the names, but the judge denied that plea.

Around 70 names are on the list, including Affleck and Sciorra, in addition to accusers Rose McGowan, Zelda Perkins, Lysette Anthony and Rowena Chiu.

Also on the list are former Weinstein Company executive Irwin Reiter, Weinstein’s former assistant and Russian Doll creator Leslye Headland and producers Megan Ellison, Donna Gigliotti, Jason Blum and Jennifer Todd.

During the trial, a private investigator testified that he was approached directly by Weinstein to investigate the names on the list, specifically Sciorra.

On the stand, the private investigator said he received an email from Weinstein with an attachment that was referred to as the Red Flag List, which was a document with names and information about those people.

“The red flags are the first to call,” Weinstein wrote in the email to the private investigator.

The private investigator also said that he did not conduct the investigation, and was unsure if the investigation was ever completed by another detective.

Affleck rose to stardom with 1997’s Good Will Hunting — a film released by Weinstein’s former company, Miramax.

In a statement, organisers Goldenvoice released a statement on March 10, saying both the galas will be rescheduled for October.

“At the direction of the County of Riverside and local health authorities, we must sadly confirm the rescheduling of Coachella and Stagecoach due to COVID-19 concerns. “While this decision comes at a time of universal uncertainty, we take the safety and health of our guests, staff and community very seriously.

34,2020/03/11,"‘Baffled’ by RSS’ communal connotations, says Milind Soman in his memoir","The model-actor recalls going to the local ‘shakha’ at the Shivaji Park in Mumbai as a young boy

Model-actor Milind Soman, in his memoir Made In India, speaks about being part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a young boy.

Mr. Soman recalls going to the local ‘shakha’, or training centre, at the Shivaji Park in Mumbai. He writes that his father “was a great believer in the benefits that would accrue to a young boy, in terms of disciplined living, physical fitness and right thinking, from being part of the junior cadres of the RSS”, reports theprint.in.

Mr. Soman adds that being part of an RSS shakha was “a very Shivaji Park thing” for a young boy to do back then.

He writes how “baffled” he feels today when he reads of “all the subversive, communal propaganda the media attributes to RSS shakhas.” Adding that his memories “of what went on at the shakhas every evening are completely different,” Mr. Soman recalls how activities included marching in khaki shorts, yoga, games, camping trips, songs and chanting Sanskrit verses “that we did not understand.”

All activities, Mr. Soman recalls, were supervised by a “team of mostly well-meaning if not always inspirational adults who truly believed they were helping raise good ‘civilian soldiers’.”

According to theprint.in, Mr. Soman recalls that his father had been part of the RSS himself and was a proud Hindu. “I didn’t see what there was to be proud about, but on the other hand, I didn’t see that there was much to complain about either,” he writes in his memoir.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/dx0e2l/article31038322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/milindsoman,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/baffled-by-rss-communal-connotations-says-milind-soman-in-his-memoir/article31038323.ece
35,2020/03/11,Event planners across India now help you plan parties for any occasion,"Want to throw a break-up surprise party? Surprise proposals are passé. Event planners across India are providing everything from break-up surprises to golgappa eating competitions

You’ve heard of birthday surprises and dramatic wedding proposals but have you heard of a break-up surprise? Sounds a tad cruel but the intention is all good, or so we are told.

Honestly, surprise planners have seen it all. “A woman wanted me to plan a surprise where she could apologise to her former partner. For another client, we arranged a guitarist and a singer who sang his ex’s favourite songs for her,” says Sakthivel Pannerselvam who started The6.in, a surprise planning and gifting platform, in 2009.

A Mechanical Engineering graduate, and the first generation to get educated in his family, Sakthivel says it took him months of brainstorming before deciding to set up this business.

“I felt that this business needed less investment. I saw a few videos of surprises abroad and went ahead with the plan.” It started small with gifts such as personalised calendars and coffee mugs. “Being a new business model, I didn’t have anyone to follow. I didn’t know how much to price services. I learnt on the go,” he says. In the process mistakes were made and losses incurred. “I can now write a book on how not to surprise people,” he laughs.

A surprise event for MS Dhoni by Surprise Machi

Though based out of Chennai, today, The6.in’s services are available across the country, primarily in cities in Tamil Nadu such as Coimbatore, Namakkal and Tirunelveli. People in Namakkal have expensive taste, he observes. “Their surprises cost around 3 lakh,” he says narrating an elaborate one where a couple went up in a crane, 100 feet above the ground, and when the lady looked down she could see ‘I love you’ illuminated across the field below, and firecrackers that read ‘Marry Me’.

The entire episode lasted five minutes, had 65 people working on it and cost ₹2.5 lakh. Another had a space decorated with an archway of lights, based on a scene from the Tamil movie Remo. “The fiancée jumped in joy and cried. For the fiancé it was well worth 3.5 lakh,” says Sakthivel.

In the last 10 years Sakthivel has also noticed a pattern. “70% of women who are married organise surprises for their husbands. When it comes to men, 80% of single men plan surprises for their girlfriends,” he laughs. While there are a lot of fun events that he plans, those involving parents (70th birthday, retirement) almost always end up being emotional. From simple roses and a box of balloons to elaborate flash mobs and yacht adventures, The6.in receives around 80 to 100 orders in a month.

At your doorstep

Naadia Mirza Daga, who in 2009 started Bengaluru-based Dotted I that specialises in quirky gifts and ideas, says, “A decade ago, the demand for these things were less as people were not aware that you could gift an experience. Today, they want to give more than just materialistic gifts,” she says.

Which explains why, in 2017, she incorporated the surprise gifting concept into her brand. She receives 90 orders per month, averaging three surprises per day. Her range is diverse: from a golgappa vendor turning up at your doorstep and challenging you to 100 pani puris or scaring your friends at a designated spot, to a picnic in the park and a naughty 40th birthday party. “The most over-the-top one we planned so far was a 50th birthday where we got someone to dress up as an ostrich and hold the cake, flew in a standup comedian from Delhi and painted a wall depicting the birthday boy in different avatars,” says Naadia.

According to Shahul Hameed of city-based Surprise Machi that launched in 2016, a person booked a surprise which was to be delivered to himself. “And while placing the order the client said “Surprise nalla pannidunga,” laughs Shahul, who’s repertoire includes public pranks, cabanas by the bay, personalised song recordings, sailing and ATV Rides among others. With the increase in demand, his team too has grown to 17 people from having just one person last July. “With customers throwing novel challenges at us, we have meetings everyday to constantly keep coming up with new ideas,” he says.

37,2020/03/11,"RBL, KVB allay fears on financial health","Clarification follows Yes Bank saga

Private sector lenders RBL Bank and Karur Vysya Bank (KVB) have sought to ally concerns of investors and depositors in the wake of the Yes Bank saga.

The RBL Bank has clarified that the lender was well capitalised, with a strong governance set up in the aftermath of the Yes Bank crisis to address concerns over its financial health.

“The bank remains adequately capitalised with a capital adequacy ratio of 16.08% with tier-1 at 15.02%, significantly higher than the prescribed regulatory requirement of 11.5% and 9.5% respectively.” RBL said.

The bank has also said there has been no material adverse change in the asset quality since its the third quarter financial results which were announced on January 22, 2020 and its guidance remains consistent.

“Our Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is at 145% of statutory requirements as at the end of last week,” the bank said while adding all the business segments are doing well, it continue to expand presence across newer geographies by adding branches and also hiring more people as previously planned. The bank continues to attract additional deposits from retail, corporates and institutional segments, it said.

“We wish to re-emphasize that RBL Bank is a fundamentally strong institution. Rumours around financial health and stability of the institution especially in social media seem to be misplaced, motivated and not based on facts,” RBL Bank said.

The 104-year-old KVB is a profitable and well-capitalised bank with a strong commitment to protect customer interests, according to the bank’s MD and CEO P.R. Seshadri.

According to him, the bank’s Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio stands at 15.87% as of December 2019 against the regulatory requirement of 10.875%. It has a liquidity coverage ratio of 306.23% against a regulatory requirement of 100%. This indicates very high level of liquidity to meet any obligations, he said.

Reliance exposure

Meanwhle, the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group said it had no direct or indirect exposure to Rana Kapoor, former MD and CEO of Yes Bank, or his wife or daughters or any entities controlled by Mr. Kapoor or his family.

The Reliance Group said its entire exposure to Yes Bank was fully secured and transacted in ordinary course of business.

38,2020/03/11,Supply chain problems hamper auto production,"Sector exploring alternatives to China

Automobile production across all categories, including that of passenger vehicles and two-wheelers, is likely to be ‘critically’ hampered due to supply chain disruption as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, particularly in China, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).

Stating that many automakers in India import about 10% of their raw materials from China, Rajan Wadhera, president at SIAM, said that the disruption in availability of these parts is likely to critically hamper production across all segments including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, three-wheelers and two-wheelers. The disruption will ‘gravely’ affect electric vehicle production, Mr. Wadhera added.

The auto industry, he added, had maintained inventory at the beginning of the year in anticipation of the Chinese New Year.

However, with the current lock-down in China, supplies for BS-VI vehicles are likely to be impacted. “Manufacturers are exploring alternatives to fulfil their supply chain demands, but that would also take a substantial [period] of time to reach stable production scale as these components would need regulatory testing,” Mr. Wadhera added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/supply-chain-problems-hamper-auto-production/article31043311.ece
39,2020/03/11,Pesticide sector hit by input issues,"Local inventories sufficient for now but further disruptions may hurt, says govt.

The Indian pesticide industry is heavily dependent on Chinese imports for raw materials, and could be heavily impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, according to an analysis prepared by the Agriculture Ministry.

The Ministry estimates that domestic inventories may be sufficient for the kharif sowing season, but any further supply disruptions could hurt farmers. Industry insiders and analysts say that a good rabi or winter crop season and the possibility of a locust attack could deplete inventories sooner than expected, raising prices by about 15%.

“Pesticide industry in India heavily depends on import of around 15 technical insecticides from China,” says the analysis submitted to the Finance Ministry last week as part of an overall assessment of the impact of the virus outbreak on Indian industries. Technical insecticides are an intermediate product used in the manufacture of commercial pesticides.

“Out of the 15 pesticides, Acephate, Cartap, Buprofezin, Pretilachlor represent 80-90% trade from China whereas Imidacloprid, Azoxystrobinb, Imzathapyr, Acetamiprid represent 40-50% import from China. Few technical insecticides, which are manufactured in India, also involve the raw material, which is sourced from China,” says the analysis, accessed by The Hindu.

“There is a major supply gap, as no container has come from China in the last two months. In fact, it started in early January when factories were shut for their New Year festival, and then, there was the coronavirus,” says Rajesh Aggarwal, MD, Insecticides India.

“We understand they are now back up to about 40% production capacity, which has restarted in March. But there are still barriers on internal movement in China, plus [delays in] shipping out of China. So, the gap has built up, availability is very tight and now, prices have gone crazy.”

Increase in cost

He estimated that there had been a 10-25% increase in the cost of these inputs from China. According to the Ministry analysis, the impact on farmers may not be immediate. “Functioning of domestic pesticides industries may not be affected immediately by the disruption of supplies from China since the industry in India is having inventories for at least next six months. Hence, for the ongoing kharif season, there may not be any adverse effect on the availability of pesticides to the Indian farmers,” it said.

However, Mr. Aggarwal said inventories are lower than usual for this season because of excellent rains extending the rabi season in parts of the country.

He estimated a 15% rise in the wholesale price of pesticides. Ratings and research agency Crisil also raised some red flags, although it felt that the procurement season for the rabi season is largely over. “In case the manufacturing facilities do not operationalise by end of February, there could be some impact in procuring raw material for the upcoming kharif season,” said an early impact report.

Crisil Research director Hetal Gandhi added that the news of a locust attack in the region could increase demand and deplete stocks.

“May is peak season for stocking, and there may be a 15-20 day delay,” she said, noting that delays in dispatches was the major concern. “The first quarter of the year accounts for 35% of revenue for Indian pesticide companies, so, if the raw material does not reach in time, there could be significant impact.” As India imports only 10% of its urea from China, as well as value-added fertilisers, this could also have a moderate impact on Indian farmers, she said.

Mr. Aggarwal, who is also vice-chairman, Crop Care Federation of India, urged the Centre to issue faster clearances for imports and also facilitate manufacturing licences so that India can become self-sufficient here. “We need to use this opportunity to backward integrate and put up capacity, so that we are not dependent on imports,” he said.

Pesticides Manufacturers & Formulators Association of India president Pradip Dave agreed. “As manufacturing and logistics are paralysed in China, it’s a good time for India to increase its share in global markets. The government must help local manufacturing companies by granting registration from the Central Insecticide Board and manufacturing licences by States,” he said.

“They are being slow and lethargic and we may miss golden opportunities.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/uwbula/article31043300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBUFARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pesticide-sector-hit-by-input-issues/article31043301.ece

42,2020/03/11,RBI invites applications for Deputy Governor’s post,"Kanungo to complete term in April, may get an extension

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has invited applications from its Executive Directors for the Deputy Governor’s post as B.P. Kanungo, one of the four Deputy Governors, is scheduled to complete his three-year term in April.

There are 12 Executive Directors in the RBI at present. To be eligible for the Deputy Governor’s post, a candidate must be below 60 years.

RBI has four Deputy Governors, of which two are promoted from within the ranks of RBI. Mr. Kanungo’s replacement will come from the RBI. Of the other two, one is an economist and the other is a commercial banker. Mr. Kanungo took over as the Deputy Governor of RBI on April 3, 2017. He had a three-year term.

As Deputy Governor, he was looking after departments like currency management, payments and settlement, foreign exchange department, internal debt management, among others. Mr. Kanungo, a career central banker, joined the Reserve Bank of India in September 1982.

He has worked in several functional areas of the bank such as foreign exchange management, banking amd non-banking supervision, currency management, government and bank accounts and public debt.

Sources said while the RBI had started the process to find a successor for Mr. Kanungo, there was a possibility that he may be given an extension by the government. The Deputy Governors of RBI are appointed by the government. “He can get an extension though RBI had to start the process of finding a replacement,” said a source. Another Deputy Governor N.S.

43,2020/03/11,‘Allow temporary write-down of Yes Bank’s additional tier 1 bonds’,"AMFI plea to avoid huge hit to net asset value of schemes

The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI) has written to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to allow fund houses a temporary write down of additional tier 1 bonds of Yes Bank to avoid a huge hit on the net asset value of schemes that hold such bonds.

The industry body wrote to the banking regulator after the proposed restructuring scheme of the troubled private sector bank mentioned that such bonds would be permanently written off. “As an industry body, we have written to both RBI and SEBI,” said AMFI chief executive N.S. Venkatesh during a media call on Wednesday. “We have written before the cut-off date [for submitting comments] of the restructuring scheme of Yes Bank. Our comments have been given. Now they will examine it,” he added.

This assumes significance as many fund houses including, Nippon India Mutual Fund, Kotak Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton Mutual Fund, among others, stand to lose thousands of crores if the additional tier 1 bonds are completely written off. Such bonds, known as AT1 bonds in market parlance, are perpetual bonds issued by banks to meet their long-term capital requirements. Interestingly, such bonds typically do have a call option after five years and hence if the central bank allows a temporary write down, the fund houses may still be able to stem the potential losses if the valuation of the bank improves after restructuring.

Meanwhile, the total assets under management (AUM) of the industry registered a marginal dip in February with the assets falling to ₹27.23 lakh crore from ₹27.86 lakh crore in January.

Going ahead, industry players expect the ongoing volatility to affect mutual fund flows to a certain extent.

“We expect continued buoyancy in SIP flows in March too, though a few institutional investors may reassess their investment strategy, given the deep correction in markets,” said Mr. Venkatesh.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/65rb1y/article31043237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBUYESBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/allow-temporary-write-down-of-yes-banks-additional-tier-1-bonds/article31043238.ece
44,2020/03/11,IndiGo says its revenue may take a big hit due to COVID-19,"Airline cites fall in demand for travel, rupee depreciation

IndiGo, the country’s biggest airline by market size, informed the stock exchanges on Wednesday that the spread of COVID-19 is likely to severely impact its revenues because of a fall in demand for travel.

“Over the past few days... week-on-week, we have seen a 15-20% decline in our daily bookings. Please note that the numbers could change from here based on how the situation evolves. We expect our quarterly earnings to be materially impacted because of the above,” the airline said in its filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.

Since January, the airline has cancelled its operations to Chengdu, Guangzhuo and Hong Kong in China, as well as reduced its frequencies to several destinations in the southeast Asia.

The airline has told the BSE that while it was able to initially redeploy aircraft freed up to other destinations and protect its revenue from any material harm, it was unable to do so any more as the passenger demand itself had taken a hit in the past few days.

On March 9, Qatar barred entry for Indians as well as citizens from 13 other countries as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19.

Saudi ban

Before that, Saudi Arabia barred non-Saudis from entering the kingdom and suspended the tourist visa for the religious pilgrims to Mecca. This meant that the short-haul international market for Indian carriers to the country's west and east have both been impacted.

In what could be termed a double whammy, the airline also said that the sharp depreciation in rupee would hit the airline and its dollar denominated liabilities primarily because of the large number of planes it has on rent from foreign lessors.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/9ilr03/article31043211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBUINDIGO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indigo-says-its-revenue-may-take-a-big-hit-due-to-covid-19/article31043212.ece

At least 53 Indian nationals got stranded in Rome’s Fiumicino International Airport after authorities prevented them from boarding aircraft as they did not have medical certificates of being free of COVID-19. The government of India had issued a notification on March 6 urging all travellers from South Korea and Italy to get tested at certified laboratories in those countries before arriving in India.

The notification came into force on midnight of Tuesday prompting airlines to stop those without the certificates. This has caused hardship for the passengers who are claiming that they are not receiving any assistance. Writer Janice Pariat, who is among the stranded Indians in the Rome airport, complained that the embassy of India was not available for assistance to the passengers who were unaware of the notification.

“It has been harrowing. Hours of trying to make calls, being given multiple numbers, and conflicting information, and of course no compensation in sight. The Indian embassy has done little to make us feel safer, a little more reassured. Bureaucracy truly kills humanity,” Ms. Pariat said in a social media message.

Fijo of Kerala, who has been stranded with 39 passengers in the Rome airport since Tuesday, said they had been assured that a medical team from India would reach Rome to test them but had not received any details. The Italian medical department is stretched to deal with the emergency at home and are testing only those showing symptoms of the virus.

Indian officials have responded by showing the notification aimed at stopping passengers from Italy and South Korea where the cases triggered a public health emergency. Fijo said the Indians in the group consisted mainly of people employed in Rome, Naples and other cities. “We want to return home temporarily in view of the outbreak in Italy.”

49,2020/03/11,Supreme Court comes down on sexual harassment of women at workplace,"Court order comes on a complaint by a bank officer

Sexual harassment of women at workplace is an affront to their fundamental right to equality and a life with dignity, the Supreme Court has held in a judgment

“Sexual harassment at the workplace is an affront to the fundamental rights of a woman to equality under Articles 14 and 15 and her right to live with dignity under Article 21 of the Constitution as well as her right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business,” a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud observed in a February 25 verdict.

The verdict, authored by Justice Chandrachud, was based on a complaint made by a senior officer of the Punjab and Sind Bank that she was transferred out from Indore to Jabalpur because she had complained about irregularities and corruption. The woman, a chief manager and Scale IV officer, said she was also sexually harassed by her senior officer.

Though the apex court held that employees cannot have a “choice of postings” unless if the transfer was proved to be mala fide or without authority, it found that her transfer was an act of reprisal against her complaints about the irregularities in the branch.

“She was transferred out and sent to a branch which was expected to be occupied by a Scale I officer. This is symptomatic of a carrot and stick policy adopted to suborn the dignity of a woman who is aggrieved by unfair treatment at her workplace. The law cannot countenance this. The order of transfer was an act of unfair treatment and is vitiated by malafide”, the court concluded.

50,2020/03/11,Forcible dispossession of a person’s property a human right violation: Supreme Court,"Due process of law is must, says Supreme Court

The Supreme Court has reiterated that forcible dispossession of a person of his private property without due process of law is a human right violation.

In a recent judgment by a Bench led by Justice S.K. Kaul, the court stressed, quoting from its judgments, that right to property is both a human right and a constitutional right — the latter under Article 300A of the Constitution.

Also read|Private property is a human right: Supreme Court

“It is accepted in every jurisprudence and by different political thinkers that some amount of property right is an indispensable safeguard against tyranny and economic oppression of the government... Property itself is the seed bed which must be conserved if other constitutional values are to flourish,” the judgment quoted a precedent.

The verdict came on the acquisition of a few acres in Sikkim by the State’s Agriculture department in 1980 for building the Progeny Orchard Regional Centre.

The land was recorded in two names — 1.29 acres in the name of the Maharaja of Sikkim and 7.07 acres in the name of Man Bahadur Basnett, who was the father of the original appellant in this case.

The judgment found that “in this case, the appellant could not have been forcibly dispossessed of her property without any legal sanction, and without following due process of law, and depriving her payment of just compensation”.

Noting that the State was using the land and attempt at mediation had failed, the court finally gave the State three months’ time from the date of the judgment for it to “make up their mind as to what they want to do”.

“Would they still like to retain the land by issuing a proper notification, or would they like to surrender possession of the land. In either eventuality, the question of payment for use and occupation would still arise, which will have to be determined in accordance with law,” the judgment said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/obbqo/article31043718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/forcible-dispossession-of-a-persons-property-a-human-right-violation/article31043719.ece

Mr. Esper must have got a new risk appraisal of all the issues he has to deal with when he came to work on Monday morning (U.S. time), a diplomatic source said on the change in the schedule.

Staff and security are deployed well in advance of the visit and the last-minute cancellation is only a testament to how strongly our Secretary of Defense really wanted to make the trip happen, the source added.

The visit was lined up close after the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump early this month. Mr. Esper was to hold discussions with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh and review the decisions taken during Mr. Trump’s and other recent visits.

In a release, the association has noted that doctors and hospitals remain a silver lining in otherwise clueless situation for the common man and every doctor should function as a source of credible information in their locality and instil confidence and trust in the public.

WHO guidance

The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC), UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued new guidance to help protect children and schools from transmission of the coronavirus.

“The guidance provides critical considerations and practical checklists to keep schools safe. It also advises national and local authorities on how to adapt and implement emergency plans for educational facilities,” the release said.

The release noted that in the event of the school closures, the guidance includes recommendations to mitigate against the possible negative impacts on children’s learning and well being. “This means having solid plans in place to ensure the continuity of learning, including remote learning options such as online education strategies and radio broadcasts of academic content, and access to essential services for all children. These plans should also include necessary steps for the eventual safe reopening of schools.”

It added that where schools remain open, to make sure that children and their families remain protected and informed, the guidance includes — providing children with information about how to protect themselves, promoting best handwashing and hygiene practices and providing hygiene supplies, cleaning and disinfecting school buildings, especially water and sanitation facilities; and increasing airflow and ventilation.

The group added that the guidance, while specific to countries that have already confirmed the transmission of COVID-19, is still relevant in all other contexts.

“Education can encourage students to become advocates for disease prevention and control at home, in school, and in their community by talking to others about how to prevent the spread of viruses. Maintaining safe school operations or reopening schools after a closure, requires many considerations, but if done well, can promote public health,” the guidance said.

Tips for parents

The new guidance also offers helpful tips and checklists for parents and caregivers, as well as children and students themselves. These actions include monitoring children’s health and keeping them home from school if they are ill, encouraging children to ask questions and express their concerns and coughing or sneezing into a tissue or elbow and avoid touching face, eyes, mouth and nose.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a0kqao/article31043652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11JAIPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-states-to-be-asked-to-invoke-epidemic-disease-act-centre/article31043653.ece

Pawan Kumar Gupta, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, on Wednesday moved a Delhi court seeking registration of an FIR against two constables for allegedly physically assaulting him in Mandoli jail last year.

The court of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Karkardooma, has fixed Pawan’s complaint for hearing on Thursday at 2 p.m., said A.P. Singh, counsel for the condemned prisoner.

55,2020/03/11,"Oil prices crashed, Rahul reminds Prime Minister","Govt. yet to pass on the benefit to consumers, says Congress leader

In his only comment on the political developments in Madhya Pradesh, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi took a dig at the Narendra Modi government. While it was busy bringing an elected government down, it ignored the crash in the global oil prices and was yet to pass on the benefit to consumers, he wrote on Twitter.

He pointed out that the oil prices had come down by 35%. He demanded that the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG be brought down to the pre-2004 levels and petrol price be reduced to below ₹60 a litre.

The Congress also demanded that petrol and diesel be brought under the Goods and Services Tax.

“Hey @PMOIndia, while you were busy destabilising an elected Congress govt, you may have missed noticing the 35% crash in global oil prices. Could you please pass on the benefit to Indians by slashing #petrol prices to under 60₹ per litre? Will help boost the stalled economy,” Mr. Gandhi said.

Amplifying his comment, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the reduction of ₹2.69 and ₹2.33 was insignificant. “The Congress demands that petrol and diesel should be brought under the GST. The hike in excise duty/customs duty, effected by the Modi government since May 2014, on petroleum products should be withdrawn immediately until it is brought under the GST,” he said in a statement.

He said the fuel prices were at a 15-year low and the government must pass on the benefit to bring the economy back on track. “In dollar terms, the international crude oil prices are down to the level of November 2004, when petrol, diesel and LPG were available at ₹37.84, ₹26.28 and ₹281.60 per cylinder respectively, which were quite cheap in comparison with the present rates,” he said.

He said that in the past six years, the government and oil marketing companies had been making huge gains. “The BJP government has looted more than ₹16 lakh crore in the last five years by levying exorbitant taxes on petrol and diesel,” he said.

The BJP government’s “ill-directed anti-people policies” were responsible for the high prices of petrol, diesel and LPG, despite crude oil consistently remaining below 50% in the last six years, he said. The Congress leader said the central excise duty had been increased over a dozen times since the BJP came to power.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ud5zxt/article31043502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-RAGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oil-prices-crashed-rahul-reminds-prime-minister/article31043503.ece

57,2020/03/11,Rajya Sabha adjourned within five minutes of convening,"Opposition raises Delhi riots and 48-hour ban on two Malayalam news channels

The Rajya Sabha was adjourned within five minutes of convening this morning after the Opposition parties raised the Delhi riots and the 48-hour ban on two Malayalam news channels for their coverage of the riots.

The Opposition again heckled Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur when he got up to table government papers. For the last many days, the Opposition has been jeering Mr. Thakur, whenever he stood up in the House, repeating his “goli maaro” comment he made during the Delhi election campaign.

The Left parties had moved an adjournment motion demanding a discussion on the 48-hour ban imposed on Asianet News and Media One TV. The I&B Ministry revoked the ban within hours with Union Minister Prakash Javadekar conceding it as a mistake. CPI(M) leader Elamaram Kareem told reporters outside that it is not important that the ban was revoked. “The fact that they issued orders to ban the two channels show their fascistic intentions. The order was symptomatic of their behaviour where they will use administrative force to stop any kind of dissenting voice,” Mr. Kareem said.

58,2020/03/11,"Delhi violence | Opposition slams Home Minister, seeks judicial probe","The BJP hit back by alleging a well-orchestrated conspiracy behind the riots and blamed the anti-CAA protests for escalating the situation

Opposition leaders on Wednesday targeted Home Minister Amit Shah for the failure of the Delhi police to immediately control the riots , with several of them of asking for his resignation and many parties including the Congress demanding a judicial inquiry into the violence.

The BJP hit back by alleging a well-orchestrated conspiracy behind the riots and blamed the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests for escalating the situation.

Initiating the debate, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury wondered how violence could not be contained for three days in the capital when India could carry out an air strike across the border and blamed BJP leaders like Union Minister Anurag Thakur, Pravesh Verma and Kapil Mishra for spreading communal hatred.

Referring to the transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar, the Congress leader said the government carried out “midnight surgical strike” on the judiciary only because he had asked cases to be registered against BJP leaders.

“The Home Minister [Amit Shah] will have to explain where he was,” he said.

He said the fact that National Security Advisor Ajit Doval had to go to contain violence proved the Home Ministry’s failure. “Why could not the Home Minister go... NSA reports to the Prime Minister. Does this mean that the Prime Minister’s Office had lost faith in the Home Ministry,” Mr. Chowdhury asked.

Mr. Chowdhury’s demand for the Home Minister’s resignation was endorsed and repeated by Trimaool’s Saugata Roy, CPI(M)’s AM Ariff and RSP’s N.K. Premchandran.

Calling for an impartial probe, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi said there was a “tsunami of Hindutva hate” and that the minority community was targeted.

His remarks evoked sharp response from the Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Minister of State for Home Affairs Kishan Reddy who registered their protests.

Speaker Om Birla expunged certain remarks made by Mr. Owaisi on his own.

Also Read Amit Shah lauds police for controlling Delhi riots

Putting up a strong defence, BJP leader Meenakshi Lekhi called the violence a well-planned conspiracy that involved a well-known global investor who allegedly funded a civil society activist to end India’s nationalism and blamed an Aam Admi councillor for instigating violence and storing weapons.

Referring to the killing of IB officer Ankit Sharma during the riots, she said 400 wounds were found on his body.

“What kind of hatred was this... we should discuss that also,” she said and blamed the Congress for misleading minorities over the CAA.

However, TMC’s Saugata Roy criticised the remarks by Ms. Lekhi, who is a senior lawyer, calling her “Devil’s advocate”.

DMK’s TR Baalu said the riots and the law and order of the national capital were discussed in Parliaments of the U.K., Iran, Indonesia, Turkey and Malaysia.

Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday lauded the Delhi Police for “controlling the Delhi riots within 36 hours” and informed the Lok Sabha that the Centre plans to attach the properties of all those who indulged in arson and rioting.

Calling it a well-planned conspiracy, Mr. Shah in his reply to the debate on Delhi riots in the Lok Sabha said the government would take such strict actions against the rioters in Delhi “that they would serve as a lesson for future.” None will be spared, irrespective of religion, caste or party affiliation, he said.

Amidst a walkout by the Congress members, the Home Minister targeted the party, pointing out that anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests started in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh a day after a ‘provocative speech’ by the Congress president at Ram Lila Maidan. He, however, didn’t take Congress chief Sonia Gandhi’s name.

Recalling former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s statement, “when a big tree falls the earth beneath shakes,” the Home Minister attacked the Congress over the anti-Sikh riots and claimed that 76 per cent of the riot-related deaths had taken place under the Congress watch. “They have no moral right to talk about riots,” he told the Lok Sabha, even though the Congress members had left the House.

On BJP’s Kapil Mishra’s speech, he merely said the matter was under examination of the police.

Also read | Snuffed out by hatred: Here are 21 of the lives lost in the Delhi riots

Giving details of the action taken by the police, the Home Minister said that 700 First Information Reports (FIRs) had so far been registered, 2,647 people arrested and 1,100 people identified as those involved in riots with the help of a special face recognition software. “Face recognition software does not look at their religion or their clothes,” the Home Minister said.

Furthering the conspiracy theory, the Home Minister said 300 people had come in from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh during the riots and 62 social media accounts were active during that period. He informed the House that three persons had been arrested for allegedly funding the riots.

He said two Special Investigation Teams (SITs) had been formed to handle offences of a serious nature.

Dwelling on the reasons why the riots spread so fast, Mr. Shah said north-east Delhi, spread over 61 square kilometres, had the highest population density, with 20 lakh people living in mixed localities with very narrow lanes that made it difficult for the police and fire brigade vehicles to move in quickly. The area had a history of riots and was known for its criminal elements.

He claimed that the police received the first call on rioting on February 24 at 2.00 pm and the last call came at 11pm on February 25.

Mr. Shah said that the government had written to the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court to nominate a judge who could head a Claims Commission that would work on attaching the properties of all those who indulged in riots and damaged property.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2s1v0q/article31043195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-AMIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amit-shah-lauds-police-for-controlling-delhi-riots/article31043196.ece

The Supreme Court will hear on Thursday an appeal filed by the Uttar Pradesh government challenging an Allahabad High Court order to the district and police authorities in Lucknow to “forthwith” remove roadside banners displaying the personal details of select persons accused of “vandalism” during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in December 2019.

A Vacation Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose is scheduled to hear the State's special leave petition.

Also read | Anti-CAA protests: 28 in Lucknow told to pay ₹64 lakh for damage to property

The petition is against the finding of a Bench led by Allahabad High Court Chief Justice Govind Mathur that had suo motu taken cognisance of the issue. The High Court had summoned the Lucknow District Magistrate and police chief for an explanation and held that the wayside posters were a violation of individual privacy, a fundamental right which globally ""underpins human dignity and key values of a democracy"".

In a 14-page order on March 9, it said, “This fundamental right provides lungs to the edifice of our entire constitutional system... Slightest injury to it is impermissible as that may be fatal for our values designed and depicted in the Preamble of the Constitution”.

The State has argued that the High Court erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction, saying it was available only to address the problems plaguing the underprivileged lot. The persons whose personal details were displayed on the banners were “capable enough to agitate their grievance, if any, at their own”.

In its order, the High Court had addressed this line of argument, saying the “economic status of the persons directly affected in such matters is not material. The prime consideration before the Court is to prevent the assault on fundamental rights”.

The State has challenged the jurisdiction of the Allahabad Bench of the High Court to suo motu take cognisance of the banners in Lucknow. There is a separate Bench in Lucknow.

The State has argued that the object of displaying personal details of the individuals is to deter the mischief mongers from causing damage to public and private property. Courts should not interfere in bona fide action by invoking the public interest jurisdiction.

The High Court had justified its suo motu intervention, saying public display of the personal details of citizens on roadside banners is “undemocratic functioning of government agencies which are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values”.

Madhya Pradesh leader Jyotiraditya Scindia’s defection from the Congress to the BJP was a “shameless act”, said Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot. However, he would rather have opportunists and careerists who cannot face the agni pariksha — trial by fire — leave the party than betray it from within.

“Of the 18 years he was in the party, he held one position or the other for 17 years. MP, Union Minister, AICC general secretary... He could not win his own seat in 2019, and could not digest the fact that politics also involves setbacks and times without power,” the senior Congress leader told The Hindu.

The BJP was trying to topple a democratically elected government in Madhya Pradesh through horse-trading, Mr. Gehlot said.

“They did the same thing in Karnataka earlier, and now the model is being attempted in Madhya Pradesh,” he said. “They are spending huge amounts of money, and intimidating MLAs to take power by hook or crook. This is not an ideological fight, but a naked misuse of power and money.”

No threat in Rajasthan

The Chief Minister said his government in Rajasthan did not face such a threat, as he had comfortable numbers in the Assembly. “In M.P., our government has a narrow majority and the BJP is trying to exploit the situation.”

Congress has 107 MLAs and the BJP has 72 in the Rajasthan Assembly which has a strength of 200. Congress has the support of at least 10 independent MLAs and a few other smaller parties.

His deputy and State party chief Sachin Pilot is reportedly upset with Mr. Gehlot, but the Chief Minister did not directly answer a question on the topic. He said the younger generation must show patience and wait for their turn. “Many of us seniors in the party holding positions of power were Youth Congress, NSUI activists when Indira Gandhi lost the election in 1977. I became a PCC chief in 1984, and it took 14 more years before I became the CM in 1998,” he said, calling upon younger leaders to stay united behind the party in these difficult times. “Only the Congress ideology can save the country from the danger of divisive communalism. Young leaders must work hard to strengthen the high command. And take over the leadership of the party soon.”

No need for party poll

Opposing the demand from certain leaders of the party that the Congress should go for an organisational election to choose a new president, Mr. Gehlot said the last election had taken place only two years ago.

“Rahul Gandhi was elected president then. In a particular situation, Rahul-ji quit the post, and we should allow him the time he wants to think about it. We don’t need an election now. Soniaji is the president and she should continue the present arrangement in consultation with State leaders and others,” Mr. Gehlot said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pva2pd/article31042676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12GEHLOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jyotiraditya-scindias-defection-a-shameless-act-ashok-gehlot/article31042677.ece

Mr. Shivakumar replaces Dinesh Gundu Rao as the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee chief. This ends a long-drawn power tussle between him and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.

63,2020/03/11,Home Ministry constitutes two special committees to fasten CAPF works,"Officials said the first committee will be headed by the Home Secretary and the second will be headed by the Secretary (Border Management).

The Union Home Ministry has constituted two special committees to specifically deal with issues and approvals related to the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) that render a variety of internal security duties in the country, including border guarding, officials said on Wednesday.

They said while the first committee will be headed by the Home Secretary and will deal with issues that are to be decided between the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and these forces, the second will be headed by the Secretary (Border Management) and will only deal with procurement matters.

The CAPFs are also known as paramilitary forces and comprise the Central Reserve Police Force, Border Security Force, Central Industrial Security Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police and Sashastra Seema Bal.

Though the Assam Rifles is not a CAPF, issues related to the force will also be dealt with by these two committees, which were constituted last week.

According to the MHA’s directions, these committees are special and hence “routine matters” will not be taken up in their meetings.

Only the directors general of these forces along with joint secretaries of subjects such as police, Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, Naxal operations, northeast affairs and border management in the Home Ministry will be part of the meetings.

The committees, as per the Ministry directive accessed by PTI, will also take up sharing of best practices among each other and review decisions till successful resolution is found.

They will ensure effective coordination and monitoring of CAPF issues such as anti-Naxal operations, border security, procurement of modern assault weapons, surveillance technology and other gadgetry, anti-terrror preparedness, VIP security, among other issues that are dealt with by the Home Ministry as part of the security establishment, a senior officer said.

He said the committee heads will be empowered to obtain sanctions from Union Home Minister Amit Shah to implement important recommendations for these forces that are about 10 lakh-personnel strong.

Mr. Shah, during a CRPF event in December last year, had announced that the government is working to implement a number of measures for upgrading technology and welfare of the CAPF troops.

The Minister said he has a “firm determination” to change the existing situation on various issues confronting these forces, including housing.

“By August-September next year [2020], we will have a definite action plan for initiation of a number of welfare issues for all these forces. My government’s commitment is that while you protect us and the country, it is the duty of the government to ensure the well-being and protection of your families,” Mr. Shah had said.

The committees will also work to realise these goals set by the Minister, the officer said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/home-ministry-constitutes-two-special-committees-to-fasten-capf-works/article31041199.ece

The petitioners said Mr. Gogoi, leader of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, and many others had during the democratic anti-CAA protests were detained and sent to judicial custody after being slapped with various charges, including that of sedition.

Terming the decision of former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia as “huge blow” for the Congress, party MLA in Haryana Kuldeep Bishnoi on Tuesday said the organisation needs to empower young leaders who have the capacity to work hard and resonate with the masses.

Mr. Bishnoi (51), one of the party’s young leaders and son of former Chief Minister Bhajan Lal, on Wednesday took to Twitter to convey his feeling about nurturing leadership, saying: “Leadership is not about being in charge. Leadership is about looking after those in our charge...”

Mr. Bishoni, who had returned to the Congress after merging his party, the Haryana Janhit Congress, had in a series of tweets, alleged that there are several devoted Congress party leaders across the country who feel alienated and discontented.

“@JM_Scindia’s departure is a big blow to @INCIndia. He was a central pillar in the party & the leadership should’ve done more to convince him to stay. Like him, there are many other devoted INC leaders across the country who feel alienated, wasted & discontented,” he said.

In another tweet, he said: “India’s oldest party needs to empower young leaders who have the capacity to work hard & resonate with the masses.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4gsx3q/article29470189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HJCCHIEFKULDEEPBISHNOISEPARATESBJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/several-congress-leaders-feel-alienated-and-discontented-haryana-mla-kuldeep-bishnoi/article31040539.ece
66,2020/03/11,"Jyotiraditya Scindia joins BJP, lauds PM Modi's leadership","Terms Congress being in “denial” about reality

Former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia on Wednesday formally joined the BJP after resigning from the primary membership of the Congress on Tuesday and lauded the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. He termed the Congress being in “denial” about reality.

At a press conference at the BJP headquarters in New Delhi, Mr. Scindia joined the party in the presence of its president J.P. Nadda, Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, State unit chief Vishnu Datt Sharma, general secretaries Anil Jain and Arun Singh as well as spokespersons Jay Panda and Zafar Islam. Mr. Islam in fact is a personal friend of Mr. Scindia from the latter’s days as an investment banker and was involved in the latter crossing over to the BJP.

Read: Political vacuum in Congress after Scindia’s exit

While welcoming Mr. Scindia into the BJP, Mr. Nadda recalled the party’s founder and the former’s grandmother, the late Vijaya Raje Scindia, “He [Scindia] is joining his family and we welcome him.” he said.

Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan was absent at the induction but held a presser in Bhopal flanked by Mr. Scindia’s paternal aunt and BJP leader Yashodhara Raje. Mr. Chouhan said he welcomed Mr. Scindia into the party.

A senior source in the BJP said, “He has stayed in Bhopal as the situation is delicate with regard to the Kamal Nath government”.

Mr. Scindia spoke rather emotionally about his move. He said there were two dates that had a profound impact on his life - September 30, 2001, the day his father, the late Madhav Rao Scindia, passed away in a plane crash; and March 10, 2020, also the 75th birth anniversary of his father, when he decided to leave the Congress after facing a “crossroads”.

“I have always believed that our goal should be to serve the country while politics is only a road to that goal. Both my father and I have tried to serve Madhya Pradesh and India via the Indian National Congress but my heart is aggrieved, as it is not possible anymore to serve people through that party,” he said. “The Congress party is living in denial and is not the party it used to be.”

Hits out at Kamal Nath govt

Mr. Scindia launched a frontal attack on the Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government, stating that it had failed to implement its promised farm loan waiver, or the bonus for certain crops promised by the Congress before the polls. “What’s more, the agitation that I was involved in, that of the farmers in Mandsaur, there has been no move to remove any of the cases filed against those involved in the agitation,” he said.

Rahul Gandhi's response

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, after maintaining a stoic silence for much of the last 48 hours, told ANI that Mr. Scindia’s plaint that he hadn’t managed to get a hearing over his grievances within the party, retorted that “he was the only chap in the Congress who could walk into my house anytime” - Mr. Gandhi’s imputation being that Mr. Scindia had been a personal friend with unfettered access.

Mr. Scindia will, in all likelihood, file his nomination for the Rajya Sabha in Bhopal on Thursday, while 21 MLAs considered loyal to him are in Bengaluru.

In Bengaluru, Jaipur

Many of the MLAs supporting Mr. Scindhia are still in Bengaluru and released video testimoials of their loyalty to him amidst reports that a senior team from the Congress, including former Union Minister Mukul Wasnik and newly appointed Karnataka Congress president D K Shivakumar, was working hard to get back the MLAs. The BJP has flown out 104 of its MLAs to Delhi to be lodged in a five-star resort in Gurugram. The move, sources in the party said was to safeguard its own flock from any blandishments from the Congress. A set of Congress MLAs, more than 80, were flown to Jaipur for the same reason by the Congress.

Sources in the BJP told The Hindu that they do not expect the Kamal Nath government to “go quietly” or in a hurry. “This will take time which is why we are moving carefully,” said a senior source in the BJP.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nlgx2s/article31040140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SCINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-far-removed-from-reality-jyotiraditya-scindia-after-joining-bjp/article31040141.ece

71,2020/03/11,Sharing data of COVID-19 cases on daily basis has created panic in country: IMA,"The doctors’ body appeals to the government to “classify the data” of the disease and take appropriate action with “clinical precision“.

Amid rising cases of COVID-19 infections in the country, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has said sharing data of infected people on a daily basis with the public has created panic across the country.

It also appealed to the government to “classify the data” of the infection and take appropriate action with “clinical precision“.

“Doctors and hospitals remain a silver lining in otherwise clueless situation for the common man,” the doctors’ body said while appealing to every doctor to function as a source of credible information in their locality and instil confidence and trust in the public.

“It cannot be denied that the high handed top down response in China is part of the reason for this global panic. The nuanced and balanced approach of the Indian government is certainly better suited to handle the crisis in a country of 1.3 billion people,” the IMA said.

The association said public health systems in various states have withstood the pressure caused by the spread of the contagious viral disease and have to remain alert, and that contact tracing is the key public health function that will make a difference in controlling the situation.

Breaking his silence on the current political crisis in Madhya Pradesh with former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and 22 MLAs quitting the Congress, former Chief Minister and senior party leader Digvijaya Singh said the Kamal Nath government has the numbers. Excerpts from an interview he gave to The Hindu over phone.

Sir, should not Chief Minister Kamal Nath now resign because numbers don't seem to be with him after the resignation of the MLAs?

But where are the numbers with 20 or so MLAs resigning?

You leave that to us. When the floor test happens, you will see a surprise.

So when will the floor test happen?

First a process has to take place. The Speaker will verify the resignations of all the 22 MLAs and then order a floor test.

But why did it come to this that Mr. Scindia had to resign? Why did this happen?

First of all, he was very disappointed and frustrated after his defeat in the Lok Sabha election from his Guna seat. He never expected it. What I have been told is that he has been in touch with top BJP leaders like Amit Shah for a few months now. On many other occasions he had supported the BJP like their decision on Article 370 [removing special status to Jammu and Kashmir], he never took a firm stand against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and didn’t speak against the National Register of Citizens or the National Population Register.

But there was some opposition from State BJP leaders and these leaders felt that they can break the Congress government without Scindia joining. They told Amit Shah that they can do this on their own but it didn’t materialise because we thwarted their attempt.

It is only after they failed that Amit Shah decided on Scindiaji and his supporters. So 17 Congress MLAs, who were Scindiaji’s supporters, were helped by BJP leaders Arvind Bhadoria and Ashutosh Tiwari to go to Bengaluru.

Read: Political vacuum in Congress after Scindia’s exit

If you were aware of all this, why didn't you reach out to Mr. Scindia?

Of course, we did. Soon after the abortive attempt to take away our MLAs took place, I told him that such a thing is happening. Thereafter Scindiaji was here for a wedding. I wanted to meet him but he said he was out. He had stopped taking my calls.

Last Sunday, Kamal Nathji was to meet him in Delhi but his phone was switched off. We were told that he had fever and had got swine flu and therefore cannot speak. I then texted him to wish speedy recovery.

But the charge is that Congress leadership, Sonia Gandhi as well Rahul, ignored his claim to head Madhya Pradesh Congress. And you and Kamal Nath got together to ignore him and his supporters!

That's rubbish. There was no question of not offering Rajya Sabha seat. We were also ready to make him the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee chief or Deputy Chief Minister. But he seem to have made up his mind.

78,2020/03/11,Government to bring back students stuck in Kuala Lumpur: MEA official,"Students from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana were asked to leave the Philippines

The Indian government is planning to bring back 343 Indian students stranded in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Delhi and Visakhapatnam in two Air Asia flights, an official at the Ministry of External Affairs, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said.

The flights might take off on Wednesday, the official added.

The students are stranded in Kuala Lumpur in the wake of the Indian government’s decision to impose a temporary ban on international arrivals from several countries, including Malaysia, affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Several students hailing from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, who spoke to The Hindu on Tuesday evening, said they had been asked to leave Manila in the Philippines as the number of COVID-19 cases had been steadily increasing there.

Harshina, who hails from Anantapur and is studying medicine in Manila, is among the 343 students trying to get on to a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Chennai.

“We do not have any medical support in Manila and it is very costly there, so When the Philippines government gave us 72 hours time to move out of the country. We landed in Kuala Lumpur on Tuesday and were scheduled to leave for Chennai by 9 p.m. flight,” Ms. Harshina said.

Another student, Chetan Adury from Hyderabad, said that they had contacted the Indian embassy and had been pleading with the consular officials to allow them to board flights to India. “Our documents are being verified in batches of 10 by the Kuala Lumpur immigration authorities and we hope they get a positive response from the Indian government,” said Mr. Adury.

The students have been sending video messages asking the Indian government to allow them to return to the country.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e6p6q/article31095543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KUALALUMPURSTUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-planning-to-bring-back-students-stuck-in-kuala-lumpur-mea-official/article31095544.ece
79,2020/03/11,"India, Bangladesh have created a golden chapter of mutual relations: PM Modi","PM delivers video message to mark the birth centenary celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 17 said India and Bangladesh have scripted a golden chapter of bilateral ties and given new dimension and direction to their partnership due to increasing trust between the two nations.

In his video message to mark the birth centenary celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the Prime Minister said ‘Bangabandhu’ devoted every moment of his life towards bringing Bangladesh out of the phase of devastation and genocide.

In an oblique reference to Pakistan, he said, “We are all witnessing that how making terror and violence weapons of politics and diplomacy destroys a society and a nation. The world is also watching where the supporters of terror and violence are currently placed and in what state they are, while Bangladesh is scaling new heights.”

He said the life of Mujibur Rahman, popularly called ‘Bangabandhu’, gives a great message to the world of the 21st century.

“We all are well aware, how a repressive and cruel regime, disregarding all democratic values, unleashed a reign of injustice on ‘Bangla Bhumi’ and devastated its people,” Mr. Modi said in an apparent reference to the role of the Pakistan Army in then East Pakistan.

“Mujib turned Bangladesh into a positive and progressive society. He was absolutely clear that hatred and negativity can never be the foundation of any country’s development,” Mr. Modi said.

Bangladesh, Mr. Modi said, is moving ahead, inspired by ‘Bangabandhu’, and under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina with inclusive and development oriented policies. “And this is really commendable,” he said.

Be it economy, other social indices or sports, today Bangladesh is setting new benchmarks.

It has made unprecedented progress in many fields like skill, education, health, women empowerment, micro finance, the prime minister said.

“I am also happy to mention that in last five-six years, India and Bangladesh have scripted a golden chapter of bilateral ties and given new dimension and direction to our partnership. This is because of increasing trust between the two countries that we have been able to amicably resolve complex issues such as land Boundary and maritime boundary,” Mr. Modi said.

He said that today, Bangladesh is not only India’s biggest trading partner in South Asia but also development partner.

“Electricity generated in India is lighting up lakhs of houses and factories in Bangladesh. A new dimension has been added to our relations through friendship pipeline,” he said.

Be it road, rail, air, waterway or internet, our cooperation in several sectors is connecting people of our two countries even more, Mr. Modi said.

The year-long celebrations were scheduled to open amid massive festivities at the National Parade Ground in Dhaka on Wednesday and was expected to be attended by several foreign dignitaries, including Modi.

But the celebrations were curtailed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The Prime Minister said next year will be 50 years of Bangladesh’s liberation, and year 2022 will be the 75th anniversary of India’s independence.

“I am confident that both these milestones will not only take development of India and Bangladesh to a new height, but will also strengthen the bond of friendship between the two countries,” he said.

The shared heritage of the two nations comes from intellectuals like Rabindranath Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Ustad Alauddin Khan, Lalon Shah, Jibanananda Das and Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, he said.

“Legacy and inspiration of Bangabandhu has made our heritage more comprehensive. India has always been attached to his ideals and values. Deep rooted relations between India and Bangladesh have been laid on the foundation of this shared heritage,” Mr. Modi said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1c5u21/article31094388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI-BANGLADESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-bangladesh-have-created-a-golden-chapter-of-mutual-relations-pm-modi/article31094389.ece
80,2020/03/11,Holi celebrations subdued in India amid COVID-19 concerns,"While many chose to skip the celebrations altogether, some preferred small gatherings but without colours

Holi was celebrated in several states across the country on Tuesday amid the coronavirus scare as people exercised caution and avoided mass gatherings.

However, the celebrations turned tragic as at least 27 people, including 13 in Odisha, were killed in Holi-related incidents.

President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and a number of other leaders had earlier announced that they would not attend any Holi Milan function in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

An ‘effigy’ of coronavirus was burnt during the festivities in Mumbai on Monday night.

Delhi witnessed subdued celebrations due to the coronavirus threat, while in parts of riot-affected northeast Delhi, most people played Holi inside their houses amid heavy presence of security forces on the streets.

While many chose to skip the celebrations altogether, some preferred small gatherings but without colours. Some played Holi only with ‘gulal’

President Kovind, Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu and PM Modi greeted people on the occasion.

Sombre mood prevailed in parts of Punjab and Haryana as people stayed away from big gatherings.

However, a large number of people paid obeisance at Gurdwara Kesgarh Sahib in Anandpur Sahib on the occasion of Hola Mohalla, a Sikh festival, amid heightened vigil.

Chandigarh-based Aditya (16) said his parents had advised him not to join a large group while celebrating the festival.

“I used to celebrate Holi with my friends until late afternoon, but this time the celebrations were over by noon,” he added.

With an Italian couple testing positive for coronavirus in Rajasthan last week, people were alert and preferred to stay safe.

The coronavirus scare played spoilsport in Jaipur, with people mostly restricting themselves to small groups.

Even as the political crisis has gripped the Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh, workers of the opposition BJP broke into the celebrations at the party office in Bhopal.

Scores of BJP workers, including women, danced and played Holi.

A woman activist, however, said they are elated because of Holi and in view of the early onset of “Diwali”, hinting at uncertainty prevailing over survival of the Kamal Nath government.

Mumbai and most parts of Maharashtra had a subdued Holi due to the coronavirus threat amid appeals to revellers from authorities to participate in the festival after taking necessary precautions.

Residents of Worli in south Mumbai on Monday night burnt an ‘effigy’ of coronavirus, dubbing it “Corona-sur’” (corona-demon).

In Bihar’s capital Patna, residents were reminded of the boisterous Holi celebrations organised by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad, as his elder son Tej Pratap Yadav pedalled down the streets with hordes of supporters who broke into ‘Phagwa’ songs and smeared each other with ‘gulal’

Yadav seemed intent on stepping into the shoes of his father when he sat with a ‘dholak’ (drum) in his lap at his Strand Road residence and bellowed traditional Holi songs amid cheers from loyalists.

Revellers in Gujarat ensured adequate precautions by keeping off ‘rain dances’ amid the coronavirus threat.

One of the organisers even deployed hand-held thermal detectors to scan the guests for potential fevers.

In Goa, the main celebrations organised by the Panaji Shigmotsav Samiti took place at the historic Azaad Maidan, which was attended by hundreds of people.

Due to the coronavirus threat, the celebrations were held in an open ground and not inside a pandal (tent) as was the case in previous years, one of the organisers said.

Two people were killed and seven injured in a clash between two families while performing ‘Holika Dahan’ at Bawani Khera in Haryana’s Bhiwani district on Monday night.

Clashes in U.P.

One person was killed and 11 were injured in a clash over a trivial issue during the Holi celebrations in Kadipur village in UP’s Azamgarh district.

At least 10 people drowned while bathing and three were killed in a road accident after Holi celebrations in Odisha.

Four children drowned in a pond in Nadia district while taking a bath after celebrating ‘Dol Jatra’, the festival of colours in West Bengal. Four people reportedly drowned in Gujarat while bathing in water bodies after celebrating Holi.

A 32-year-old construction worker from Kalyan in Maharashtra’s Thane district drowned in a creek while celebrating Holi.

Two boys drowned while bathing in a river, on the outskirts of Odisha’s Cuttack city, following Holi celebrations.

Kovind, Naidu, Modi and several other leaders greeted people on the occasion of Holi.

“Wishing everyone a #HappyHoli! The festival of colours, Holi is a celebration of spring and fraternity in our society. May it bring peace, joy and prosperity to everyone’s life,” the President tweeted.

“This Holi, let us strive to strengthen the bonds of friendship and amity that hold our society together,” Naidu tweeted.

Modi hoped that Holi brings happiness in the lives of all people of the country.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal stayed away from the celebrations this year. He had earlier said he would not play Holi due to the coronavirus threat and last month’s riots in northeast Delhi that claimed 53 lives.

“Happy Holi. Please take care of yourself while playing Holi. Please protect yourself from coronavirus,” he said in a tweet.

Goa CM Pramod Sawant did not play Holi and those close to him claimed he was busy in his constituency Sanquelim, campaigning for the March 22 zila parishad polls.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fl2a37/article31035437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDHOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/holi-celebrations-subdued-in-india-amid-coronavirus-concerns/article31035438.ece
81,2020/03/11,On a long quest to rediscover Mhatre’s frozen art,"A Mumbai surgeon is on a mission to locate the noted sculptor’s work

A Mumbai-based surgeon is on a quest to trace all 372 sculptures made by his great grandfather, the iconic sculptor Ganpatrao Mhatre, who took the art world by storm in the 19th century with ‘Mandirpathagamini’ (To the Temple). The life-size statue shows a Maharashtrian woman in a nine yard sari, on her way to a temple.

Dr. Hemant Pathare has located 280 figures so far. Among the ones he is still looking for are a Saraswati standing on a peacock that went missing from a Sangli museum, a marble statue of Lord Ram, a bust of King George V that disappeared from a Gujarat college and another of Sir William Dring of the East Indian Railway Company that once stood at Howrah station.

Life-size statues

“There was also a full-size marble bust of Zarathustra made for Parsi philanthropist Bomanji Dhinshaw Petit, and a seated Ganesha for Sir Hurkisondas Narrotamdas. No one knows their current location,” said Dr. Pathare. At least 50 of the yet-to-be-traced sculptures are life-size statues and busts. Mhatre’s preserved records are his main references, but articles, books and relatives have also helped. In 1896, Mandirpathagamini won the best sculpture prize and a medal from the Bombay Art Society. “Till then, all memorial sculptures, bronze or marble, were done by Europeans. Indian royalty did not entrust such tasks to Indian sculptors,” said Dr. Pathare.

“It is easy to identify his work. The eyes, face, features, everything is true to life,” he said.

The doctor’s search has taken him across the country. He traced some figures in the State Bank of India, Central Bank of India and the Masina Hospital in Mumbai and some across the border at the Karachi Parsi Institute. “The royal family in Mewar graciously allowed me access to their collections,” he said.

Dr. Pathare, who is attached to the Jaslok Hospital, plans to publish his work as a coffee-table book. His entire path, tracking the 280 sculptures was recorded by photographer Gauri Shetye. Historian Sandeep Dahisarkar also helped with the research.

During his endeavour, he was struck by the neglect of the artwork. “Many British statues were damaged after independence. A 1905 statue of Queen Victoria in Ahmedabad has a broken nose,” he said. “In 2012, I traced the statue of philanthropist Sir Chinubhai Ranchhodlal in Ahmedabad and by the time I sent a photographer in 2017, some miscreants had broken his hands and nose”. He had also traced a statue of King George V in a shed near the Elphinstone College. The 9 ft bronze statue was kept at the Gateway of India till 1965 and later replaced by a statue of Shivaji Maharaj. “For the sake of art, our government has to step in to preserve such work,” he said.

Mhatre’s sculptures include 267 busts, 64 full size statues and seven equestrian statues, said to be the most difficult ones to sculpt. He signed his name on the pedestal or at the back of the sculpture, except for statues of gods and goddesses, as he did not want his name carved on to divinity.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9djujk/article31034655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THRDHEMANT1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/on-a-long-quest-to-rediscover-mhatres-frozen-art/article31034657.ece
82,2020/03/11,HC orders CBI probe into Viveka murder case,"‘SIT had enough time, but the outcome has been insignificant’

The High Court on Wednesday ordered that the State government should hand over the Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy murder case to the Central Bureau of Investigation keeping the tardy pace of the investigation by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) since the incident took place on March 15, 2019, in mind.

Justice U. Durga Prasad Rao said inter-State criminals could be involved in the murder and the investigation could not be dragged further as SIT had enough time to dig out the facts but the outcome had been insignificant.

He also suggested that a detailed probe be conducted, including how the local (Pulivendula) police handled the sensational case. Justice Prasad Rao directed the CBI to complete the investigation at the earliest while pointing out that a lot of time has been wasted so far.

It may be noted that the SIT has examined multiple witnesses, conducted narco-analysis of some suspects and arrested three persons for allegedly tampering with the evidence at the murder scene (Vivekananda Reddy’s house in Pulivendula).

Withdrawal of plea

The HC recently permitted the withdrawal of the writ petition which Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had filed when he was the Leader of the Opposition seeking entrustment of Vivekananda Reddy murder case to the CBI. The court scrutinised the case and general diary files and the post-mortem report.

Further, Vivekananda Reddy’s wife Sowbhagya had filed a petition in the HC praying for the declaration of the actions of SIT arbitrary and unconstitutional and raised several doubts on the circumstances under which the former MP was done to death and the persons involved in it.

The State government contended that the petitioners have not satisfied the tests laid down by the Supreme Court for transfer of investigation to the CBI and vague pleadings and unsubstantiated contentions cannot form the basis of the petition.

Ms. Sowbhagya, TDP MLC Mareddy Ravindranatha Reddy (B.Tech Ravi) and C. Adinarayana Reddy, BJP leader and former minister in the TDP government, sought the CBI probe.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hc-orders-cbi-probe-into-viveka-murder-case/article31043853.ece
83,2020/03/11,Masula harbour expansion in limbo,"Absence of fishing activity has affected fisherfolk’s livelihood in the region

A delay in execution of the ₹252 crore Sagar Mala project has paralysed marine fishing on the Masula coast, affecting the livelihood of fisherfolk as well as economic activity.

The expansion of the Gilakaladindi harbour in Machilipatnam is in a limbo. The Fisheries Department has proposed expansion of the harbour with a fish handling capacity of 23,500 tonnes per annum, facilitating the operation of 550 vessels.

However, the project did not move forward despite getting clearance from the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change in May 2019.

The MoEF&CC, however, had stipulated that ecologically sensitive areas such as mangroves should not be damaged in the construction or operation of the project.

The proposed harbour is surrounded by mangroves and is classified as ‘adavi’ (forest), which means the State government should obtain permission from the State or National Board for Wildlife to proceed with construction activity. However, the mangrove cover falls in the Bandar Reserve Forest (BRF) with a thriving population of endangered Fishing Cats.

""The harbour expansion project requires permissions under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The consent for establishment will only be given after the project meets the guidelines of the Act, given the ecological importance of the proposed site,"" sources fighting for BRF protection told The Hindu.

The Department of Fisheries is yet to come out with feasibility reports and engineering estimations, which are being prepared by WAPCOS, a public consultancy firm.

""The engineering estimation report is still being prepared by WAPCOS. We have started the exercise to obtain Coastal Regulatory Zone clearance. Tenders for the Sagar Mala project will be invited after completing all the above tasks,"" Department of Fisheries Joint Director (Krishna district) Sheik Lal Mohammed told The Hindu.

The harbour expansion project includes dredging of an area spread over 10.48 lakh m3 at the entry point from the harbour to the sea. Nearly 120 boats that operate from the Gilakaladindi harbour have abandoned the harbour, owing to blocking of the sea route due to deposition of sand over the years. All the boats continue to depend on the neighboring harbours at Kakinada or Nizampatnam for fish landing.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/masula-harbour-expansion-in-limbo/article31043847.ece
84,2020/03/11,A peek into the rich architecture of the Nolamba kings,"Museum exhibiting the heritage they left behind in the Rayalaseema region is ready at Hemavathi

People in Rayalaseema remember only Vijayanagara king Sri Krishnadevaraya, the third ruler of the Tuluva Dynasty (1509 to 1529).

But, 700 years before him, the Nolamba Pallava kings ruled the southern parts of present Anantapur district, Kolar and Chitradurg districts in Karnataka and south-western parts of Chittoor district, and there is a rich architectural heritage left behind by them.

This treasure is now ready for display with authentic information from Archaeological Survey of India at a swanky museum with six galleries at Hemavathi in Amarapuram mandal of Anantapur district.

At Hemavathi, the Siddeswara temple complex, a popular destination for the devout, has a unique Siva idol in black stone in human form, unlike a Linga akara in majority of the temples.

The ASI had taken over the Siddeswara (Henjerappa) and Doddeswara temples built by the Nolamba kings in the 9th century, at Hemavathi long ago.

A small museum, which had been built three decades ago in the temple complex, has now been expanded and tastefully painted and exhibits displayed on pedestals with information.

Valuable sculptures

The renovated museum will be open to public in a fortnight, according to ASI conservator Krishna Chaitanya.

Several valuable sculptures were collected by the ASI from the remnants of temple ceilings, pillars and idols found in the agriculture fields, and during excavation for house-building in the surrounding villages over the years and dumped in the Doddeswara Temple. These exhibits have now got a decent place for people to see and appreciate their beauty.

While these Nolamba dynasty kings flourished from the early 9th century during the regime of Rashtrakutas (whose rule spread from the Ganges to Kanyakumari), their downfall began when Ganga dynasty king Marasimha overpowered them in the late 10th century. These Nolambas were Kannada kings and got several temples constructed with architectural finesse that can be seen even today in the black-stone idols of several Hindu and Jain deities.

As you enter the museum, pillars with inscriptions on them welcome you and the most striking exhibits are the half-broken Chamundeswari black polished-stone idol.

The second gallery on the left is dedicated to Lord Siva and remnants from the Vedagallu temple with an ornate arch, small Vinayaka idol are on display.

Lord Vishnu idols in five different avatars, including Vamana and Venkateswara, give an insight into the sculpting skills of artisans of those times. The fourth gallery, one of the largest ones, has a collection of all female deities with ‘Saptamatrikas’ stealing the attention. These seven idols are displayed individually in addition to the combined panel of the Saptamatrikas, a group of seven mother-goddesses, each of whom is a shakti, or female counterpart of a god, and revered by the people in those days.

Fifth gallery has a collection of seven broken temple ceiling panels and the sixth one has a Jain Teerthankar’s idol as Nolambas were influenced by Jainism too, explains caretaker K. Mahesh Babu. Horizontal bars of temples and other small objects have been displayed in a cupboard. About 132 km. from Anantapur and 170 km from Bengaluru, a day’s trip to Hemavathi will be a walk/peek into the history of the region.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pgwvb3/article31043839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-VJ-MUSEUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a-peek-into-the-rich-architecture-of-the-nolamba-kings/article31043840.ece
85,2020/03/11,Coronavirus scare no deterrent for these devotees,"Thousands attend festivities at Lord Ranganatha temple

COVID-19 scare was no deterrent for tens of thousands of the devotees who took part in Brahmotsavam at Lord Ranganatha temple here on Wednesday.

However, they made it a point to cover their mouths and noses while taking part in the festivities. Police personnel and priests performing the elaborate rituals to the processional deity of Talpagiri Rangantha swami also were seen wearing masks.

Those who did not have masks covered their faces with hand kerchiefs after the news of a Italy returnee being admitted to the isolation ward of the Government General Hospital here with suspected novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection reached them.

The district administration had initially toyed with the idea of banning the festivities, but went ahead nonetheless keeping in mind the mood and wishes of the general public. The grand procession, however, was allowed to be carried out for a shorter distance around the temple on the banks of Penna river.

Meanwhile, masks went out of stock in most of the medical shops in the city as a majority of people opted to wear them before stepping out. “Masks were available for just ₹50 each earlier. Now, the price has reached 150,” complained customers.

Meanwhile, health officials advised people to clean hands with soap and also provided guidelines for wearing a mask.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kqih65/article31043776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJPAGECOVIDEFFECT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-scare-no-deterrent-for-these-devotees/article31043777.ece

90,2020/03/11,Demand for tank fish soars as COVID-19 hits chicken sales,"Poultry firms feel the heat as prices crash by 75%

People are swearing off chicken in Chittoor, worried that they might contract the dreaded coronavirus (COVID-19), leading to a sharp decline in sales of chicken at poultry markets.

Officials of the Animal Husbandry Department have repeatedly given assurances that eating chicken is absolutely safe, while restaurants have held ‘biryani melas’ in an effort to woo back their customers. However, these seem to have had little effect.

Foodies have now shifted to eating tank fish, which is selling like hot cakes for the last one week.

On Tuesday, chicken prices plummeted to ₹80 a kg (as against ₹190 in January) in several parts of Chittoor, while the price of tank fish stood at ₹150 a kg. The ‘king of fish’ – the Korameen variety – is commanding a whopping ₹350 a kg. The fish markets which generally see crowds only on Sundays are witnessing a full house almost on all week days. According to latest trends, around 40% of the chicken shops in the district are remaining closed on on week days, while only managing to sell a low quantity on the weekends.

The consumption of tank fish has peaked in eastern mandals compared to the western side of the district. Though local traders have kept sea fish on display, tank fish is the preferred choice. A seasoned sea fish supplier to Chittoor market said that the stocks have come down by more than 70% during the last fortnight, with the onslaught of tank fish. “Supply of small stocks would only bring us further loss. We want to wait till the first week of April, and also hope the coronavirus threat would have subsided by then,” he said.

Despite the depressing developments on the poultry front, the traders hope that thanks to the local body elections, sales would pick up in a couple of days. They are expecting a sudden boom in chicken prices with demand from roadside restaurants, particularly in rural areas.

In Nagari and Puttur municipalities, the chicken shop operators have been holding festivals with a variety of chicken dishes. Nagari TDP in-charge Gali Bhanuprakash Reddy joined their efforts to alleviate public fears against eating chicken. Interestingly, the focus of the poultry front unions is to involve the public figures in their campaign to dispel the public apprehensions about chicken consumption. It is estimated that the poultry industry with more than 150 farms, has suffered a huge loss of over ₹10 crore in the last one week in Chittoor district.

Meanwhile, fish markets are gearing up to make a quick buck and to tap the business potential before the COVID-19 fear dissipates.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2x407g/article31035354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJPAGEFISHMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/demand-for-tank-fish-soars-as-covid-19-hits-chicken-sales/article31035355.ece
91,2020/03/11,Stolen jewellery recovered from murder suspect in Anantapur,"Anantapur police while interrogating an accused in a murder case, solved the mystery of three other theft cases in the district and confiscated about 470 grams (46 tolas) of gold valued at ₹18 lakh, a two-wheeler and ₹50,000 cash.

The DSP said from July last year, he had resorted to three theft cases in the marriage halls. The modus operandi was to get acquainted with people present in the hall on day One and then keep a watch on where the costly jewellery and other material were stored at the end of the day. While all the relatives are fast asleep, he would go round all the rooms and make his way out of the venue with the valuables,

One case was registered in the Guntakal Railway Institute theft incident in July 2019, another case of theft was registered in T. Gate Function Hall in November 2019, and the third incident of theft was registered in the III Town police station in the city related to the incident in TTD Kalyana Mandapam.

94,2020/03/11,Swami Paripoornananda decries political churn in Simhachalam temple trust board,"‘Someone who has done so much for the region does not deserve to be disrespected’

Swami Paripoornananda of Sri Peetham, Kakinada, on Tuesday deplored the sacking of Pusapati Ashok Gajapathi Raju as chairperson of the Simhachalam Temple Trust Board and replacing him with Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju, daughter of late Pusapati Ananda Gajapathi Raju.

The State Government had recently issued a Government Order appointing Ms. Sanchaita as chairperson of the Simhachalam Temple Trust Board.

Ms. Sanchaita’s appointment evoked resentment in the three north Andhra districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam. Public opinion was in favour of Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju as the Pusapati family enjoyed a lot of goodwill, having donated thousands of acres of land to 101 temples in the region as well as to four temples in East Godavari district, Swami Paripoornananda told a press conference here on Tuesday.

“My friends and followers from the three districts have expressed their anguish to me over the injustice done to Mr. Raju, the hereditary trustee of the temple. A member of the royal family who has done so much for the region deserves to be honoured, not disrespected,” the Swami said.

Swami Paripoornanda recalled that during TDP rule, Mr. Raju, as chairman of the trust, had refused to give Simhachalam temple lands to the State Government despite being a senior TDP member himself. “It was a reflection of his integrity. He had said that a notice could be served a probe conducted into allegations being levelled against him. The Government should allow him to continue as chairman, pending completion of the inquiry,” Swami Paripoornananda said.

The Swami said that he would participate in the annual ‘Giri Pradakshina’ (circumambulation) of the Simhachalam temple this year to collect first-hand information on the temple lands, reportedly encroached upon by people of other faiths, and submit a report to the State Government.

White Paper sought

Alleging meddling in the affairs of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) by successive governments, the Swami said that the Common Good Fund (CGF) of the TTD was increased from ₹2.5 crore to ₹50 crore recently by the State Government. Such a move was also attempted by the TDP government in the past, he said, adding that he wondered for whose ‘common good’ the funds would be utilised, and sought a White Paper on the issue.

Vishnu Kumar Raju were present.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mp2d5h/article31035286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11ONG5SWAMIPARIPOORNANDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/swami-paripoornananda-decries-political-churn-in-simhachalam-temple-trust-board/article31035287.ece

Devotees who have booked darshan tickets and accommodation at Tirumala will be refunded if they wish to cancel their journey to the temple town in view of the coronavirus threat, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Executive Officer A.V. Dharma Reddy said on Tuesday.

The TTD has also appealed to devotees to come equipped with masks and hand sanitisers to Tirumala in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Summer plans

Temporary sheds will be erected in the vicinity of the main temple and at areas where devotees congregate in large numbers, in order to shade them from the heat.

Roads and trekking routes will be given a white coat of paint once a week to give devotees relief from the summer sun. Emphasis will be laid on providing accommodation to those reaching the town without any recommendation letters, officials said.

The caution deposit system will be re-introduced to usher in more transparency in the allotment of cottages and guesthouses, it was decided at a review meeting held on Tuesday.

Senior citizens and visitors who come with children aged below five will be allowed into the temple on a normal basis. However, special courtesies extended to them twice a month shall be temporarily withdrawn in May and June.

While around one crore devotees visited the temple between April and July last year, the laddu sales soared to a high of 4.60 crore during this period. Efforts are on to better last year’s performance, Mr. Dharma Reddy said.

Barbers shall work in three shifts at the massive Kalyanakatta (tonsuring center) and the services of additional barbers will be roped in subject to the demand. About 3,500 Srivari Seva volunteers along with 1,500 scouts and guides will be pressed into service during the summer season.

98,2020/03/11,20% of revenue records are falling apart: Ashok,"‘Efforts are on to reconstruct these documents’

A whopping 20% of revenue documents in the State are in a brittle condition. Acknowledging the status of the revenue records, Revenue Minister R. Ashok on Wednesday said efforts were being made to reconstruct these documents.

“About 20% of the documents are falling apart. They are all over 150 years old. We are trying to reconstruct the files and scanning of such documents in both Revenue and Land Survey Departments will be completed in six months,” said Mr. Ashok responding to a question in the Council.

He said the government was scanning land records since 2010, and nine types of documents were being scanned. “Over three crore documents have been scanned so far.” The Minister said that the scanned documents such as sketches and maps will be made available online for the public.

Earlier, Congress member S. Ravi raised the issue of the condition of land records and absence of a resurvey. “The indexing and cataloguing of files in the Revenue Department has not happened so far. These are very important documents. If they are lost and a land dispute arises, it will be difficult to end the dispute,” he said.

Further, Mr. Ravi said that though land survey has to be conducted once in 30 years, resurvey has not been done for over 100 years. “The last survey was done in 1860,” he said. Responding to this, Mr. Ashok said that currently drones are being used to survey, and that the government has taken a decision to conduct resurvey.

CCTV to monitor village accountants

To ensure accessibility of village accountants to the public, the State government will monitor their work through CCTV cameras. “Every village accountant has to be available to the public between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. Their work will be monitored through the Deputy Commissioner’s office,” said Revenue Minister R. Ashok in response to members complaining about village accountants not being available to the public.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lj1agk/article31043458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGCOUNCILEMPTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/20-of-revenue-records-are-falling-apart-ashok/article31043459.ece
99,2020/03/11,Day’s session gets washed out as stalemate continues,"Both BJP and Congress seek to move privilege motion against Ramesh Kumar and K. Sudhakar, respectively

The entire day’s session of the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday got washed out as the stalemate over Tuesday evening’s verbal duel between former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar continued.

Tuesday had seen a major war of words between the Treasury and the Opposition benches after Mr. Kumar took serious objection to Mr. Sudhakar reading out the Supreme Court order on disqualification of 17 Congress and JD(S) legislators who moved over to the BJP to bring down the coalition government. A heated exchange, with alleged use of abusive words, had ensued.

On Wednesday, both the BJP and the Opposition Congress members served separate notices to Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri seeking to move privilege motion against Mr. Ramesh Kumar and Dr. Sudhakar, respectively. As soon as the House met, both the BJP and the Congress members stood up and demanded first preference to speak on the motion. The Speaker had to adjourn the House twice before lunch break. A similar situation prevailed when the House reassembled after lunch break.

Amidst the din, the Speaker asked Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah to go ahead with the submission on privilege motion sought to be moved against Dr. Sudhakar for his alleged derogatory references, which attributed motives behind Mr. Ramesh Kumar disqualifying 17 MLAs, including himself, as the then Speaker.

But, Dr. Sudhakar intervened and appealed to the Speaker to allow him to complete his overnight speech regarding Constitution. When Mr. Siddaramaiah objected to this, Dr. Sudkahar said the BJP members had submitted a letter to the Speaker under Section 363 of the legislature proceedings seeking suspension of Mr. Ramesh Kumar from the House till the completion of the ongoing session.

In the letter, the BJP members had contented that Mr. Ramesh Kumar’s abuses against him as a Minister had tantamount to not only insulting the House, but also breaching its privileges. He argued that at least this letter should get precedence over Mr. Siddaramaiah’s privilege motion as it was a matter related to breach of privilege of the entire House.

However, Mr. Siddaramaiah insisted that he should be allowed to make his submission first as the Speaker had permitted him to speak.

Despite the Speaker’s appeals, the din increased when Mr. Siddaramaiah refused to yield, leading to adjournment of the House for sometime by the Speaker. When the situation did not change after the House reassembled, the Speaker adjourned the House for the day.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/days-session-gets-washed-out-as-stalemate-continues/article31043439.ece
100,2020/03/11,M.P. MLAs will return to party: DKS,"Newly appointed Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar has said that some leaders were in touch with the rebel MLAs from Madhya Pradesh who are in Bengaluru, and that most of them will return to the party in a few days.

Speaking to mediapersons here on Wednesday, Mr. Shivakumar said 19 MLAs were under “police custody” in Karnataka. “Because of some compulsion, the MLAs have come to Bengaluru. They have been misled by Jyotiraditya Scindia, who joined the BJP in the national capital on Wednesday,” he claimed.

Maintaining that some of the rebel MLAs will return, the State Congress troubleshooter said he would not reveal the strategy adopted to counter the moves of the BJP. However, sources in the Karnataka Congress said senior leaders had distanced themselves from the M.P.

101,2020/03/11,Congress strikes caste and regional balance,"High command decides not to split posts of Leader of Opposition and Congress Legislature Party leader

In a catch-all strategy, the Congress has maintained caste and regional balances by appointing former Minister D.K. Shivakumar as the president of the the State Congress and three working presidents from three different regions and three different communities.

Since the party’s future prospects in the State largely depend on the Congress president and its top office-bearers, the AICC has weighed all options, particularly caste combination, in the selection of candidates. This team was largely formed to take on the State BJP government and chalk out strategies to win the 2023 State Assembly elections.

While Mr. Shivakumar belongs to the dominant Vokkaliga community, his three deputies — Eshwar Khandre, Satish Jarkiholi, and Saleem Ahammed — belong to the dominant Lingayat-Veerashaiva, Scheduled Tribes, and Muslim communities, respectively. The Lingayat-Veerashaivas, STs, and Muslims are spread across the State.

While Mr. Shivakumar hails from the Bengaluru division, Mr. Khandre is from Kalaburagi region and Mr. Jarkiholi from Belagavi. Mr. Ahammed, who contested the Lok Sabha elections from Haveri twice and lost, belongs to Bengaluru division too.

Served as Ministers

Except Mr. Ahammed, all three (Mr. Shivakumar, Mr. Khandre, and Mr. Jarkiholi) have served as Ministers in the previous Congress governments. While Mr. Shivakumar and Mr. Khandre run educational institutions, Mr. Jarkiholi owns sugar business. Mr. Ahammed has served as MLC.

The Vokkaligas have some reason to cheer this time. In fact, S.M. Krishna, former Chief Minister, was the only and the last Vokkaliga to head the KPCC since 1970. Mr. Krishna, who was the KPCC president during 1999-2000, campaigned against the then J.H. Patel government and brought the party to power in 1999 and ruled till 2004.

Placating Siddaramaiah

By retaining Siddaramaiah, who hails from Mysuru region, as the Leader of Opposition and Congress Legislature Party leader, the Congress made its attempt to woo the third dominant caste — the Kurubas. Among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Kurubas constitute a significant chunk of the State’s population. Overall, the OBCs make up approximately 20% of the State’s population. The party high command has respected the wishes of the former Chief Minister by not splitting the two posts. This would enable Mr. Siddaramaiah to have a say in party affairs.

M. Narayanaswamy, MLC, has been appointed as the chief of Congress in the Legislative Council. He too belongs to the Vokkaliga community. He contested in the bypolls to K.R. Puram constituency in Bengaluru City against BJP’s B.A. Basavaraj, now Minister, and lost.

Two-time MLA Ajay Singh, son of former Chief Minister the late N. Dharam Singh, has been appointed as the party’s chief whip in the Legislative Assembly. He holds an MMBS degree and represents Jewargi constituency in Kalaburagi district. He belongs to the Rajput community.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aqjotp/article31043408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGMarchShivakumarcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-strikes-caste-and-regional-balance/article31043409.ece
102,2020/03/11,Congress picks ‘troubleshooter’ for top post,"DKS is facing cases of money laundering, but Congress calls it ‘vendetta’ by BJP

The Congress high command’s choice of D.K. Shivakumar for the post of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president seems to be based on his diverse experience and reputation as an organiser and “troubleshooter”, who comes to the party’s aid whenever it finds itself in a tough situation.

Mr. Shivakumar was in the forefront of the party’s attempt to woo back Congress and JD(S) MLAs, who were holed up in Mumbai before joining the BJP. Though the efforts failed, he was seen as leading from the front. In fact, the leader, who has been under the scanner of the Income Tax Department on money laundering charges, has attributed cases against him to these efforts and called it “vendetta politics.”

Mr. Shivakumar served as the working president of the party when former Minister R.V. Deshpande was the KPCC chief (2008-10).

Elected to the Assembly from Kanakapura in Ramanagaram district, he served as Minister in the S.M. Krishna, Siddaramaiah, and the coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy and held various portfolios.

Mr. Shivakumar kick-started his political career when he defeated former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda in 1989 from the then Sathanur constituency. In 1999, he defeated Mr. Kumaraswamy from Sathanur. He also defeated JD(S) heavyweight P.G.R. Sindhia in the latter’s bastion of Kanakapura when he won from here in the 2013 Assembly election.

Mr. Shivakumar, who also runs educational institutions, is considered as a master strategist and credited to playing a major role in the installation of the coalition government in 2018 and victory of Ahmed Patel in the Rajya Sabha elections in 2017 by providing accommodation to Gujarat Congress legislators at a private resort on the outskirts of Bengaluru.

He also ensured his brother’s (D.K. Suresh) victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections despite Congress being wiped out in the entire State. Mr. Suresh was the lone party MP from the State. Mr. Shivakumar had played a critical role in the victory of a few candidates in the past.

He is among the richest politicians in the State and is also a close confidante of party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi.

I-T cases

The Income Tax Department had raided his residence in connection with the alleged tax irregularities.

After the collapse of the coalition government, On September 3, 2019, he was arrested on charges of money laundering and income tax evasion. He was in Tihar jail for 50 days before being released on October 24, following the Delhi High Court order granting him bail.

Mr. Shivakumar has called the charges against him “baseless and politically motivated” and blamed the Narendra Modi-led government for framing him on “false charges.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6ut52f/article31043362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGDKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-picks-troubleshooter-for-top-post/article31043363.ece
103,2020/03/11,Cocoon production looks poised to pick up,"Cocoon production in the State, which had been hit by a mulberry disease, appears poised to pick up just in time to meet the growing demand for indigenous silk.

The leaf roller insect, which eats the shoots of mulberry plants, had affected cocoon production in the State. With the climate change in the last few days and the use of pesticides bringing the disease under control, most cocoon markets across the State have reported an increase in arrivals. The prices of cocoon, which had remained high for the last three months, had begun to ease in the last one week, said Deputy Director of Sericulture in Ramanagaram district Munishi Basaiah.

The cocoon market in Ramanagaram, one of the largest in the State, was trading 25 to 30 tonnes of cocoons daily during the last three to four months when the production was low. But, in the last one week, the arrivals had crossed 50 tonnes a day, consequently bringing down the price, the officials said.

The average price of cocoons, which used to between ₹480 and ₹495 for the crossbreed and between ₹630 and ₹670 for the superior quality bivoltine during this January and February, has eased to an average of ₹400 for the former and ₹492 for the latter in the last one week. “Several reeling units in the region were functioning to almost half the capacity because of the cocoon prices,” said Mr. Basaiah. With the price of cocoons easing and the demand for raw silk expected to increase owing to COVID-19 disrupting the import of silk from China, the production of indigenous raw silk is likely to increase. Meanwhile, the available stocks of Chinese silk are fast exhausting. With no consignment of silk from China for almost two months now, the indigenous silk is expected to bridge the gap.

Ashok Karbawala, a silk trader from Bengaluru, said they had to cancel many orders for imported Chinese silk. “One consignment of 10,000 of fabric is unable to leave the port in China owing to COVID-19,” he said.

But according to a Central Silk Board (CSB) source: “Indian silk weaving industry caters primarily to the domestic market. Exports play a limited role”. Meanwhile, the silk goods manufacturers catering to the local market are unperturbed. “We use only home-grown silk to weave our Mysore Silk saris,” said Krishnappa, General Manager of Karnataka Silk Industries Corporation (KSIC) in Mysuru. President of the Karnataka Weavers’ Federation T.V. Maruthi said that most sari manufacturers do not depend on Chinese silk like earlier. “It is business as usual for us. We can get superior quality indigenous silk,” he said. Over the last couple of years, silk production in India rose in quality, with an increase in the output of bivoltine cocoons, and in quantity, bringing down the dependence on imported Chinese silk.

Silk production in India, which was 15,742 tonnes in 2003-04, rose to 20,410 tonnes in 2010-11 and was 35,468 tonnes during 2018-19, according to statistics from CSB.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/k9hfo1/article31043095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGSILK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cocoon-production-looks-poised-to-pick-up/article31043096.ece

Several times, commuters throw morsels of food out of train windows. This creates a habit among wild animals to look for food near the tracks. They are not accustomed to fast trains and often get killed, a forest officer said.

He recalled that a bison was run over by a train on the Karnataka-Goa boarder last month.

105,2020/03/11,App to keep a check on forest fires this summer,"Forest Dept. app can save 30 to 90 minutes between detection and alert compared to FSI app

Last year, a five-day fire raged through the Bandipur Tiger Reserve, leaving more than 15,400 acres of forests burnt. This has prompted the Karnataka Forest Department to come up with a slew of measures this year to help prevent and contain forest fires. Along with developing an SOP, the Forest Department has also come up with an app to keep forest fires in check.

Punati Sridhar, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF), told The Hindu that recently, the Forest Department operationalised its own fire alert app, which has been developed along with the Karnataka State Remote Sensing Application Centre (KSRSAC). The biggest advantage is the time saved between the detection of fire and the alert received.

The new app is said to be an improvisation over the Forest Survey of India (FSI) fire alert. The FSI alert system, which started in 2004, is based on inputs from two collaborative arrangements — NASA-ISRO and ISRO-FSI. The fire hotspots detected by sensors are received at the Shadnagar Earth Station of the National Remote Sensing Centre. The hotspots are then transmitted to the FSI electronically, which processes them, generates alerts, and disseminates them to registered end users.

“The FSI alert takes around four hours between detection and alert. Our app can save about 30 minutes to 90 minutes as we get alerts between 2.5 hours and three hours of detection as it is from KSRSAC to us. It can clearly indicate whether the fire is in the forest area. If it is, it is indicated in green. If the fire is within 500 metres of forest area, it is indicated in orange. In critical areas or if a fire is not doused and continues, it is shown as critical,” Mr. Sridhar explained.

The app can also indicate the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and wind direction in the fire area, which, officials said, will help them know how to approach the fire and from which direction.

Officials said the app will keep a record of frequent fires, which will help the department deploy people in such areas. Other than this, the app is also capable of reflecting changes in vegetation in forest areas and encroachments.

“We have also issued an SOP in the beginning of this year to deal with forest fires. Procedures prescribed to be followed include having better rapport with people, creating awareness through departments and volunteers, etc. The fire lines have been digitised and from February 15, all watches are in place in strategically-placed areas,” said Mr. Sridhar.

But the recent rains, especially in Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks, have helped tide over the peak fire season, he said. “Luckily, it rained in many areas. The peak fire season is over. We are fully prepared for the summer,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/app-to-keep-a-check-on-forest-fires-this-summer/article31042847.ece
106,2020/03/11,T.N. police nab suspected Maoist from Karnataka,"The ‘Q’ Branch of the Tamil Nadu police detained suspected Maoist Srimathi, hailing from Sringeri in Chikkamagaluru district, and another woman from a check-post near Anaikatti at the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border on Wednesday morning.

Sources with the Q Branch said the women were picked up from a Coimbatore-bound TNSTC bus at 5.30 a.m. This was the first bus service to the city in the morning.

As per records with the Q Branch and the Special Task Force (STF), Srimathi, 27, was among several suspected Maoists attached to the Kabani and Bhavani Dalams of CPI (Maoist), who are on the watchlist of anti-Naxal agencies in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka.

A source in the know of the development said that Q Branch officials were questioning the two women in Coimbatore.

Kerala’s anti-Naxal squad ‘Thunderbolt’ had claimed that Srimathi was present in Agali forests near Attappadi in Palakkad when its commandos killed four Maoists in separate encounters on October 28 and 29 last year. She was alleged to be among a few Maoists, including top leader Deepak, part of the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee of CPI (Maoist), who managed to escape from the Thunderbolt action.

Srimathi, a native of Belagodu-Kudige in Sringeri taluk, has been facing nine cases registered in Sringeri and other police stations in Chikkamagaluru district. Born into an agriculture family, Srimathi studied up to ninth standard. According to sources close to her family, she left the family around 2008 and got involved in the activities of the suspected Maoists. She has a sister and two brothers.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tn-police-nab-suspected-maoist-from-karnataka/article31042752.ece
107,2020/03/11,‘Survey of out-of-school children not done as per law’,"The survey of out-of-school children carried out using teachers in January this year and its results are “ unacceptable” as it was not conducted as per the provisions of the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012, the Karnataka High Court was informed on Wednesday.

Senior Counsel K.N. Phanindra, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae in a PIL petition, initiated by the High Court in 2013 on the issue of out-of-school children, said in his report that the survey was conducted contrary to Rule 6 of the Karnataka RTE Rules, 2012. The survey conducted between January 6 and 13, 2020, had identified that 994 children had never enrolled to a school and 3,562 children had “ permanently” left school as on January 18.

‘Maintain record’

The amicus curiae pointed out to a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi that it was the duty of the local authority to maintain a record of all children in its jurisdiction through a household survey, from their birth till they attain 14 years.

Pointing out that though the government has agreed to conduct a fresh survey, Mr. Phanindra said it has used the word survey of children who are out of schools when the RTE Act and the Rules contemplate survey of each household to identify and maintain record of every child up to the age of 14 years.

The amicus curiae also said that the government must come out with a specific period for conducting and completing the household survey, preparing and finalising the data of children for maintaining records of these children by the respective local authorities, like municipal corporations, municipalities, and panchayats as per the Karnataka RTE Rules.

The Bench adjourned further hearing till March 12 saying that it will issue exhaustive directions.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/survey-of-out-of-school-children-not-done-as-per-law/article31042740.ece
108,2020/03/11,Rumour-mongering about COVID-19 is a punishable offence now,"State issues ‘Karnataka Epidemic Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations, 2020’

Any efforts by individuals or organisations to spread misinformation or rumours about COVID-19 will now be treated as a punishable offence under the “Karnataka Epidemic Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations, 2020” issued by the State government on Wednesday.

“No person, institution or organisation should use any print or electronic media for misinformation regarding COVID-19 without prior permission of the Department of Health and Family Welfare. This is to avoid spread of any rumour or unauthenticated information regarding COVID-19. In case anyone is found indulging in such activity, it will be treated as a punishable offence under these regulations,” said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Medical Education and Health and Family Welfare).

Addressing presspersons on Wednesday, he said these regulations have been issued under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 (Central Act 3 of 1897). “They have to be mandatorily observed by the public to prevent an outbreak of COVID-19 in the State. These regulations are necessary as ordinary provisions of the law that are in force currently are insufficient to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the State,” he said.

The temporary regulations will come into force immediately and remain valid for one year.

Flu corners

According to the notification, all hospitals in the State, including private facilities should mandatorily have flu corners for screening of suspected cases of COVID-19. Besides, all hospitals, during screening of such cases, should record the history of travel of the person if he/she has travelled to any country or area where COVID-19 has been reported. Apart from this, the hospitals should also record the person’s history of coming in contact with a suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19.

“In case a person has any history of coming in contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the last 14 days and the person is asymptomatic, then the person must be kept in home quarantine for 28 days from the day of exposure. If the person (with a history of coming in contact with suspected or confirmed case) is symptomatic, the person must be isolated in a hospital as per protocol and tested for COVID-19,” stated the notification.

Asymptomatic persons should use masks and take precautions to avoid contact with any person including family members for a period of 14 days from the date of arrival. Hospitals should provide information about screened suspected cases to the Office of the jurisdictional District Health and Family Welfare without any delay.

No testing in private labs

No private laboratory has been authorised to collect or test samples for COVID-19 in the State. All such samples have to be collected as per guidelines issued by Government of India and have to be sent to the jurisdictional government designated laboratory by the District nodal officer.

Besides, any person with a history of travel in the last 14 days to COVID-19 affected countries must report to the nearest government hospital or call the toll-free helpline 104 so that necessary measures, if required, can be initiated by the Health Department.

Forceful isolation of suspected cases

If a suspected case of COVID-19 refuses admission or isolation, the authorised officials can forcefully admit and isolate such cases for a period of 14 days from the onset of symptoms or till the laboratory reports are received.

If cases are reported from a defined geographic area such as a village, town, city, ward, colony or settlement, the district administration has been empowered to seal the area, bar entry and exit of the population from and into the area, order closure of schools, offices and ban public gatherings, ban vehicular movement, initiate passive and active surveillance and isolate suspected cases in hospitals, the notification said.

In such a situation, the staff of all government departments will be at the disposal of the district administration and can be deployed for taking up containment measures. The District Disaster Management Committee headed by Deputy Commissioner has been authorised to prepare a planning strategy.

“Anyone who violates these regulations can be punished under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860),” the notification added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yylcr/article31042701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGCORONONORMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rumour-mongering-about-covid-19-is-a-punishable-offence-now/article31042702.ece

114,2020/03/11,‘State’s contribution to creation and spread of Buddhist literature better’,"It stands third in the field after Hindi and Marathi, says Mallepuram G. Venkatesh

The former Vice-Chancellor of Sanskrit University Mallepuram G. Venkatesh on Wednesday said that Karnataka had better contributed to the creation and spread of Buddhist literature as compared to the other South Indian States.

“Kannada stands third after Hindi and Marathi in terms of creating and encouraging Buddhist literature. With many writers such as G.P. Rajaratnam, Govinda Pai and S.K. Ramachandra Rao taking up the translation of Buddhist literature from Pali to Kannada in the early years of the 20th Century, Buddhist literature began to spread in Kannada. Not just the translation, we can also see creative literature on Buddhism such as poetry in Kannada. In the pan-Indian context, scholars like D.D. Kosambi and Rahul Sankrityayan did the job of disseminating Buddhist literature,” he said after inaugurating a national-level Bouddha Literary Conference at the Mahatma Gandhi auditorium of Gulbarga University here.

He held that G.P. Rajaratnam and S.K. Ramachandra Rao were the only two people in the State who intellectually studied the Buddhist literature and practically adopted it in their lives.

He commended Pali and Bouddha Study Centre and Kannada Study Centre, Gulbarga University, for organising the national-level Bouddha Literary Conference which, he held, would be an inspiration to younger scholars to enthusiastically take up Buddhist studies.

Buddhist sites

Stressing on the importance of Buddhist sites in the State, Prof. Venkatesh said that Pali and Bouddha Study Centre and Kannada Study Centre, Gulbarga University, were jointly working on preparing the history of all the 22 Buddhist sites in the State, including Sannati in Kalaburagi district. The huge volume would be released shortly, he said.

Director of Pali and Bouddha Study Centre and the Head of Kannada Department in Gulbarga University H.T. Pote said that the event was the first of its kind in the State.

116,2020/03/11,COVID-19: Medical stores told not to hoard masks,"The COVID-19 scare has triggered a big demand for surgical masks, hand sanitizers and gloves. But they are in short supply and there are also complaints of masks being hoarded and sold at four to five times the cost.

Taking note of the complaints, the Health Committee of the Mysuru City Corporation on Wednesday visited some medical stores to take stock of the situation. Though the masks in most stores were not in stock, the stores had been asked to put up a board on the availability of masks and the MRP. If masks are not available, ‘no stock’ board should be displayed, they were advised.

MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj told The Hindu that the masks should not be sold more than its MRP and action can be taken if such instances are reported. Of course, there has been short supply with the scare gripping the entire country with more cases being reported in the recent times. However, nobody was supposed to exploit the situation, he added.

The hotels and restaurants here had also been issued an advisory. The committee has asked them to supply hot water and hot food to the customers besides taking all necessary precautions, including screening the health of the staff and the cooks.

Passengers arriving at the Mysuru airport will undergo thermal screening for the detection of COVID-19. A team of doctors and nursing staff will be deployed for the purpose. Six thermal scanners had been procured for the purpose.

Though thermal screening was essential for passengers returning from abroad, the authorities here were extra-vigilant and procured the scanners to identify if anybody was having high temperature, one of the symptoms of COVID-19. Domestic passengers’ travel history on whether they had been to any COVID-19 affected country would also be examined during the screening.

Though screening was underway since many days after the scare surfaced, the health teams used to do it with the conventional methods using thermometers. Besides the team from the Health Department, a health team from the airport has also been deployed for the screening of passengers.

Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI) Director and Dean C.P. Nanjaraj said any suspected case with symptoms of COVID-19 would be referred to the isolation ward for further tests at the K.R. Hospital. The thermal screening will commence from Thursday.

Dr. Nanjaraj said six more thermal scanners had been sought under the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM).

Meanwhile, there has been a short supply of masks in hospitals, including the State-run hospitals, and a request had been sent to the authorities in Bengaluru for the supply of masks and other protective gear.

K.R. Hospital has around 100 N-95 masks and sufficient stock of surgical masks. These masks are required for those handling the isolation ward and the people quarantined with symptoms. So far, there have been no suspected cases referred to the ward here.

The MMCRI Dean said masks are being stitched for the staff looking after the cleaning and hygiene of the hospital. The stitched masks with three layers are being given to these staff and the nursing and paramedics are using the surgical masks.

121,2020/03/11,D.K. Shivakumar is new KPCC president,"For the first time, Congress had appointed three working presidents for the State

Ending a couple of months of speculation surrounding the appointment of new president for the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), the All India Congress Committee (AICC) on Wednesday named seven-time MLA and former Minister D.K. Shivakumar for the post.

For the first time, it had appointed three working presidents — Eshwar Khandre, Satish Jarkiholi, and Saleem Ahmmed.

Mr. Shivakumar, 57, is said to be the choice of AICC interim president Sonia Gandhi. His appointment is seen as a resolve to galvanise the Congress from the village-level to the State-level.

He succeeds Dinesh Gundu Rao, who resigned following the party’s poor show in byelections to 15 Legislative Assembly constituencies and Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

While the party high command continued with Eshwar Khandre as the working president, it appointed two more persons for the same post.

M. Narayanaswamy and Ajay Singh are the chief whip of the party in the Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly respectively. Mr. Ajay Singh is the son of former Chief Minister late N. Dharam Singh.

Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will continue as the Congress Legislature Party leader and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, the AICC said in a press release.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ruo001/article31040104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGDKSHIVAKUMARADDRESSINGTHEMEDIAATTHEMEETTHEPRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dk-shivakumar-is-new-kpcc-president/article31040005.ece

The 76-year-old man who showed symptoms of COVID-19 after his return from Saudi Arabia died on Tuesday. However, the authorities, in an emergency press conference, clarified that it was not a confirmed case of COVID-19, as the medical investigation report was still awaited.

“It is not a confirmed case of COVID-19 death. The patient was admitted to a private hospital in Kalaburagi on Monday after he developed acute respiratory illness, along with cough, cold and fever. The hospital informed our health department which immediately quarantined the patient in the same hospital,” Deputy Commissioner B. Sharat said.

“The throat swab was collected and sent to National Institute of Virology, Bengaluru on the same day and quarantined around 30 people, including his family members, who were in his close contact, at their respective houses. Meanwhile, the patient was shifted to another private hospital in Hyderabad against medical advice on the same day. Since the respiratory illness was at the advanced stage, the family members lost hope and got the patient discharged from there also.

“The patient died on his way back to Kalaburagi on Wednesday night. We are awaiting the throat swab culture report without which we cannot conclusively say that it is a COVID-19 death.”

District Health and Family Welfare Officer M.A. Jabbar said that the throat swab culture report of the patient was expected on Thursday.

As per Mr. Jabbar, the patient had travelled to Saudi Arabia on January 29 and returned to India on February 29. He was screened in Hyderabad Airport and allowed to move on as he did not show any symptoms of COVID-19.

“He was alright till last Friday when he developed cough, fever, cold and respiratory illness. He went home after primary medication. He was admitted on Monday when he began suffering from acute respiratory illness. The patient had a history of pneumonia and asthma-related comorbidities,” Mr Jabbar said.

“We have home-quarantined and begun monitoring all those who were in close contact with the patient. As of now, none of them has shown any symptoms of COVID-19. The body of the patient reached Kalaburagi at 11 p.m. on Tuesday and was sanitised,” he said.

He added that the body was deep-buried on Wednesday as per the protocol.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7wd25r/article31041500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KALABURAGICOMMISSIONERjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-mans-death-not-confirmed-as-due-to-covid-19-say-officials/article31039932.ece
123,2020/03/11,Shettyhalli: Nod for redrawing boundary brings great relief,"Areas where human intervention is high to be excluded from sanctuary limits

With the Karnataka State Wildlife Board giving its consent to redraw the boundary of Shettyhalli Wildlife Sanctuary by excluding forest areas where human intervention is high and by bringing undisturbed forest that acts as wildlife corridor into its purview, the long-standing demand for rationalisation of the sanctuary’s boundary is likely to be fulfilled shortly.

The sanctuary that came into existence in 1976 has a total area of 396 sq.km. Its boundary description, however, stretches till Shivamogga city, covering an area of around 700 sq.km.

More than 300-sq.km area was included inadvertently within the purview of the sanctuary and denotification of this area was a long-standing demand. The sanctuary comprises human habitations such as Shettyhalli, Chitra Shettyhalli, and Puradal, where families that were displaced owing to Sharavati hydel power projects were accommodated. The boundary of the sanctuary extends up to the north-eastern part of Shivamogga city, comprising the office of the Superintendent of Police, the bus terminal, many educational institutions, and planned residential areas.

After the sanctuary came into existence, restrictions were imposed on works related to upgrading of civic amenities in human habitations in its limits, including at Shettyhalli, Chitra Shettyhalli, and Puradal. There was a delay in conferring title deeds to the displaced families for the land on which they were rehabilitated.

According to the existing laws, any exclusion from the sanctuary will be allowed if an equal area of land is included in it. In the proposal to redraw the boundary for which the wildlife board has given its approval, it has been decided to exclude Puradal and Kudi State forests, the total area of which is around 50 sq.km. In return, 50 sq.km of Umblebylu State forest, a crucial corridor for the movement of wildlife, including tigers and elephants, from Shettyhalli to Bhadra Tiger Reserve will be brought within the ambit of Shettyhalli sanctuary.

Srinivasulu, Chief Conservator of Forest of Shivamogga Circle, told The Hindu that though Puradal and Kudi forests have thick green cover, they also have large tracts of disturbed areas. Bringing Umblebylu within the ambit of Shettyhalli sanctuary would secure the crucial wildlife corridor and step up conservative endeavours there. The redrawing of the boundary would facilitate conservation endeavours and proper rehabilitation of families displaced owing to the Sharavati projects, he said. The proposal would now be submitted to the National Board for Wildlife and after its approval, a notification would be issued on the redrawn boundary, he said.

Shashi Sampalli, writer and environment activist, said that the Department of Forest and Wildlife should put in place proper measures to avoid any encroachment in Puradal and Kudi forests that are rich in biodiversity.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/urr5v0/article31035390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGSHETTYHALLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shettyhalli-nod-for-redrawing-boundary-brings-great-relief/article31035391.ece

The Bill — titled Karnataka State Civil Services (Regulation of Transfer of Teachers) Bill, 2020 — also seeks to bring about transparency and provide equal opportunities in transfer to teachers. It seeks to adopt a teacher-friendly approach in transfers, prescribing a minimum period of service of three years in a school for teachers to seek transfer.

It also provides for zonal transfers to achieve rotation of teachers from across zones. However, it seeks to provide exemption from zonal transfer to women aged 50 and above and to men aged 55 and above.

Similarly, exemptions are sought to be provided to physically challenged teachers.

The proposed legislation also provides for rationalisation of posts and re-deployment process at regular intervals to ensure availability of teachers at all schools as per the prescribed student-teacher ratio.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bill-tabled-in-karnataka-assembly-for-regulation-of-teacher-transfer/article31034930.ece
125,2020/03/11,Karnataka government urged to pass resolution against NPR and NRC,"Former Minister and Congress MLC S. Jaimala on Tuesday urged the State government to follow the nine other States in the country that have so far rejected the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

“Nine States have not agreed to NPR and NRC, and this includes Bihar where the BJP is in the ruling coalition with the JD(U). I urge the Karnataka government to have similar thoughts on the issue,” she said during a discussion on the Constitution in the Legislative Council. “Like in other States, Karnataka can remove questions in the questionnaire that allows the marking of doubtful persons. We should not go in the path of Assam NRC.”

Taking her own example, Ms. Jayamala said, “I do not have a birth certificate. Our family moved to Chikkamagaluru after being displaced from Panambur. When I went to school, my father wrote my date of birth on a piece of paper.” Citing another example, she said 33 irrigation projects had displaced hundreds of people. “Where will they bring birth certificates from?” she asked.

Ms. Jaimala also said discriminating against one out of seven religions does not augur well for the country. “After the 1857 war of independence and the JP movement, the country is witnessing s third most important movement [against CAA and NRC]. More than COVID-19, people are worried about NPR and NRC.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-government-urged-to-pass-resolution-against-npr-and-nrc/article31034921.ece
126,2020/03/11,Height of stupidity to tinker with country’s diversity: Krishna Byre Gowda,"Saying that diversity has held India together against all odds, Congress MLA and former Minister Krishna Byre Gowda on Tuesday argued that any effort to enforce uniformity in the country was the “height of stupidity” which citizens would not accept.

“It is a matter of concern that there has been a threat to freedom and democracy in the country of late. Any effort to curb them by enforcing uniformity in place of diversity goes against the principles of the Constitution,” Mr. Gowda said, while participating in a debate on the Constitution in the Assembly.

“The only way to ensure the survival of the country is to celebrate its diversity. The country will remain united as long as its diversity is protected,” he said. He added that perhaps the Indian Constitution was the only Constitution that had become a guiding light for other countries in celebrating diversity.

Referring to the complex nature of the country’s diversity, he pointed out that India had a population of nearly 132 crore, as against 75 crore of all 52 European countries put together. “The country has 1,600 languages and over 2,000 ethnic groups, apart from innumerable castes,” he said. “When the diversity is so complex, is it possible to enforce uniformity?”

He appealed against tinkering with the edifice on which the country’s character is built.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/height-of-stupidity-to-tinker-with-countrys-diversity-krishna-byre-gowda/article31034912.ece
127,2020/03/11,Commotion after Karnataka Assembly Minister reads out SC order,"Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Tuesday read out the Supreme Court order on the disqualification of 17 Congress and JD(S) legislators by the then Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar last year, sparking off a heated verbal exchange between the Treasury and Opposition benches in the Legislative Assembly.

When Mr. Sudhakar read out the SC order, Mr. Kumar (Congress), who was in the lounge, rushed to the House and took strong exception to it. When the Minister continued to read the order, Mr. Kumar rushed to the well of the House and protested the Minister’s remarks against the Speaker’s chair.

Speaking on the debate on the Indian Constitution, Mr. Sudhakar said injustice was meted out to the 17 legislators from the chair. He said the Speaker’s chair had indulged in a “conspiracy against legislators” who crossed over to the BJP from the Congress and the JD(S). “We were insulted before the people of the State by disqualification,” said Mr. Sudhakar, who was one of the legislators who quit the Congress and joined the saffron party last year.

Mr. Kumar, who got furious with this, asked Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy, “Do you approve of the reading of the Supreme Court order here?” When Mr. Madhuswamy declined to intervene, Mr. Kumar shouted at Mr. Sudhakar, allegedly using unparliamentary words.

Within no time, chaos prevailed and Congress member Shivanand Patil, who was in the chair in the absence of Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri, adjourned the House for five minutes.

The ruckus continued when the House met again after Mr. Kageri discussed the issue with the ruling and Opposition members. While BJP members demanded that Mr. Kumar be suspended from the House, the Congress gave a notice to the Speaker to move a privilege motion against Mr. Sudhakar.

The Minister said “abusive” language was used in the House by the former Speaking. The ruling party members all shouted slogans condemning the use of such words.

‘Not features of a democracy’

Referring to the conduct of ruling party, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah said, “These are not the features of a democracy. Please allow me to speak.” As the members continued shouting against each other, despite several appeals to remain calm, the Speaker adjourned the House for the day.

Mr. Siddaramaiah said Mr. Sudhakar’s move was “uncalled for.”

After the Assembly was adjourned, he said the Minister’s statements amounted to breach of privilege of member Mr. Kumar and the entire House. He said the party had given a notice to the Speaker under House Rules 191 and 192 for moving a privilege motion against the Minister. He termed the conduct of BJP members “goonda culture” and “anti-Constitution, anti-democracy, and anti-parliamentary.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/commotion-after-karnataka-assembly-minister-reads-out-sc-order/article31034888.ece
128,2020/03/11,KSRTC premier services see 20% dip in bookings since March 3,"Inter-State services take a hit; officials predict similar trend within State

With people altering travel plans as a precautionary measure against COVID-19, the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has taken a hit primarily on its inter-State services. It has seen a reduction of 20% in booking in premier bus services, which are air-conditioned.

According to KSRTC officials, the drop in passengers and rise in cancellations began from March 3. With four people testing positive for the virus in Bengaluru since March 9, officials predict that bus services within the State may also see reduction in passengers.

A KSRTC official said that operations to cities in Kerala such as Kottayam, Ernakulam, Calicut and Thiruvananthapuram were among the worst hit, apart from Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Pune and Mumbai. “Since most of the premier buses running inter-State services are long journey, they are generally pre-booked. So we are seeing a 20% drop in passenger traffic,” he said.

People who had made plans to travel to other States are putting them on hold. “I was planning to go to Thrissur to be with my family for the Holi weekend, but I decided to postpone my trip. I don’t want to take unnecessary risks as my children and parents are in Thrissur,” said Sebastian Anthony, a frequent traveller.

Cancellations increase

The official also said that cancellations in premier services have risen. “On an average, the cancellation rate around this time of the year is around 8%. However, in the past week, it has shot up to 12-14%,” he said.

Shivayogi C. Kalasad, Managing Director, KSRTC, said that though all the cancellations cannot be attributed to COVID-19 alone, most of it could be because of the fear of its spread. “Keeping in mind the safety of our employees and the travelling public, KSRTC has taken various precautionary measures, including fumigating buses using anti-bacterial solution and disinfectant liquids,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ksrtc-premier-services-see-20-dip-in-bookings-since-march-3/article31034765.ece
129,2020/03/11,"Drug menace: 1,652 cases were registered in Karnataka in 2019","The drug menace appears to be growing in Karnataka as 1,652 cases were booked in 2019 under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. In 2017, there were over 600 cases. These statistics were furnished to the Legislative Assembly by Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai while replying to Congress MLA K.J. George during Question Hour.

The Minister said drugs were being obtained through the dark web, but the State police had managed to break the backbone of the drug network. He added that the police had “declared a war” on the drug menace.

“The Police Department is set to launch a mega campaign against the drug menace in April to create awareness,” the Minister said, while declaring that the State had “zero tolerance” on the matter. He called upon parents, teachers and owners of educational institutions to take a keen interest in the campaign.

He also expressed concern about the growing trend of getting drugs through the postal department. There have been instances of drugs being obtained through ordinary posts from foreign countries, he said, while pointing out that four postal department staff were arrested in this connection recently.

Mr. Bommai also said synthetic drugs have become a cause for concern of late as biscuits and chocolates were being laced with them. He said he has directed the police to maintain a strict vigil against drug menace, especially near educational institutions and roadside shops.

Keeping vigil

In addition to CCB sleuths, Pink Hoysala teams are also being used to curb the menace. Every district has one police station to exclusively deal with the drug menace, he said, adding that as many as eight such stations were set up recently in Bengaluru. The cargo section in the international airport in Devanahalli is being checked every day by dog squads to detect drug arrivals, the Minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/emfjzj/article31034707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGBOMMAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/drug-menace-1652-cases-were-registered-in-karnataka-in-2019/article31034708.ece

The higher rank police officers, including in the cadre of superintendent of police, deputy superintendent of police, and assistant superintendent of police, will soon undergo an orientation programme at the Karnataka Judicial Academy for understanding of law, Director-General and Inspector-General of Police Praveen Sood told the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday.

Also, workshops would be conducted to create awareness among all station house officers (SHOs) and the investigation officers (IOs) on the procedures for registration of the first information reports (FIRs) laid down by the Supreme Court in Lalitha Kumar vs. U.P. and other judgments, and on the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

The State police chief has filed an affidavit in this regard before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi during the hearing of PIL petitions related to implementation of the provisions of the POCSO Act and the JJ Act.

Orientation programme for the higher rank police officers and the investigating officers are being proposed after the court pulled up a few superintendents of police for submitting reports that there were no instances of child pornography in any the homes for children as mentioned in a report of the Ministry of Women and Child Development without registering FIRs though child pornography is a congnisable offence. It has also been stated in the affidavit that a new circular was issued on March 3, 2020 directing the SHOs to register FIRs when the cognisable offences are made out in the complaints failing which criminal action would be initiated against them under Section 166 (for disobeying law) or 166A (disobeying direction under law) of the Indian Penal Code.

131,2020/03/11,Opposition accuses CPI(M) of embezzling flood relief,"UDF says relief denied to thousands whose lives were disrupted by two back-to-back floods

The Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) on Wednesday accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] of organised embezzlement of flood relief funds.

It staged a walkout in the Assembly stating that the government denied relief to thousands of persons whose lives were disrupted by two back-to-back floods in 2018 and 2019. At the same time, it allowed its political apparatchiks to “misappropriate” financial assistance meant for them.

Suicide of beneficiary

Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator N. Shamshudeen sought the leave of the House to adjourn routine business to discuss the suicide of Sanal, 38, of Meppadi in Wayanad allegedly due to denial of flood relief. He also drew the attention of the House to the alleged theft of governmental aid by CPI(M) leaders in Ernakulam through the accounts of a service cooperative bank at Ayyanadu at Thrikkakara.

Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan said the government had sanctioned ₹1.99 lakh as flood aid to Sanal. However, the bank rejected the treasury payment because not more than ₹50,000 could be deposited in his Janapriya account. He said the State had resolved the issue.

Moreover, the police had arrested six persons for embezzlement of flood relief funds by tweaking the bill information management system. He said the accused had used fictitious identities to draw ₹16 lakh as flood aid from the treasury.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the theft of flood aid reported from Ernakulam was not a one-off incident. He demanded a probe by the Cental Bureau of Investigation to unearth similar such incidents reported from other districts. Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan rejected the adjournment motion stating he was satisfied with the government’s reply.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/oppn-accuses-cpim-of-embezzling-flood-relief/article31043882.ece
132,2020/03/11,HC reserves verdict on church issue,"Takeover of Kothamangalam church

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday reserved its verdict on the State government’s appeal filed against a single judge’s order directing the Ernakulam District Collector to take over the Kothamangalam Mathoman Cheriyapally, its precincts, and all its movable properties and hand them over to the vicar of the Orthodox faction after removing the protesters from the church premises.

The order was reserved by the Bench comprising Justice A.M. Shaffique and Justice P. Gopinath after hearing the arguments of counsels of the Orthodox and Jacobite factions and the State government.

During the hearing, the court orally observed that those who did not win the case were trying to take the law into their own hands. In such a situation, if the government did not step in, the rule of law would be affected.

The single judge had intervened in the matter in such a situation and issued the directive as the court could not have remained a mute spectator.

In fact, the government was bound to enforce the law, as otherwise the court would have to step in. The court noted that the High Court was bound by the Supreme Court order in the Church case. The court added that it was not inclined to accept anything which went against the Supreme Court verdict.

Govt.’s contention

The State government argued that the single judge’s order was erroneous. In fact, an execution petition should have been filed before a civil court for getting the Supreme Court verdict implemented as the Supreme Court judgment was only a declaration in favour of the Orthodox faction.

In its appeal, the government contended that it was not possible to remove the parishioners from the church and cemetery before identifying them.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-reserves-verdict-on-church-issue/article31043854.ece

134,2020/03/11,Bird flu has not affected human beings so far,"Infection has not spread to other areas as well, says official

There is no indication that the bird flu reported from Vengeri and Kodiyathur in Kozhikode district has affected human beings so far, M.K. Shoukathali, joint director, National Centre for Disease Control, has said.

He was talking to media after inspecting the infected areas on Wednesday. “Human infection is not that easy,” Mr. Shoukathali said. The infection has not spread to other areas as well and there has not been any death of birds in any of these places subsequently. Preventive measures are going on well within one-km radius of the infected areas and a 10-km radius area has been put under surveillance.

Asked about the recent death of bats at Karassery, Mr. Shoukathali said it might have happened owing to electrocution. However, samples have been sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, and the results are awaited.

On Wednesday, police officers accompanied members of a rapid response team that was culling pet birds in infected areas at Vengeri. This follows the reluctance of certain local residents to hand over their birds. All such birds were collected to be culled and destroyed at designated places later.

Meanwhile, poultry farmers have claimed that a section of officials are insisting on culling pet birds beyond the one-km radius as stipulated by the Kozhikode district administration. There are restrictions on the movement of chicken to other areas. However, some officials are asking poultry farmers to completely remove chicken that are only 15 days old. Since no fresh cases are reported, the farmers could be allowed to transport chicken, they added.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday told the Assembly that the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) raided the office of Chandrika, the newspaper published by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), based on a specific complaint that the accused in the Palarivattom flyover case had channelled unaccounted money, estimated at ₹10 crore, to the accounts of the 80-year-old institution.

IUML legislator and former Public Works Department (PWD) Minister V. K. Ebrahim Kunju is an accused in the case along with six others, including his former secretary T.O. Sooraj.

Mr. Vijayan said VACB investigators who inspected the office on Tuesday did not disrupt its functioning or the publication of the newspaper.

He said the complainant had alleged that Mr. Kunju had used the accounts of Chandrika to launder the money he had “exacted” from the builder of the now decommissioned flyover.

Mr. Vijayan said the investigators were armed with a court warrant to search the office. The VACB seized 34 documents, two compact discs, and one hard disc from the newspaper office.

Mr. Kunju told the Assembly that the cash found in Chandrika’s accounts was the fee and contribution the management had collected from subscriptions. He tabled documents which he said proved his claim. He said income tax officials had inspected the records and found it to be true. He said the case against him was politically motivated and flimsy.

The crisis triggered by the spread of COVID-19 is threatening to derail the State government’s plans to shore up its revenue and tide over the resource from the next financial year.

Tourism and allied sectors have already started feeling the heat and a further dip in trade, commerce and industry sectors would prove to be quite deleterious for the State that is already battling a grave fiscal crisis.

Finance Minister T.M.Thomas Isaac told The Hindu that the new financial year is fraught with uncertainty. The current financial year posted only a marginal increase in tax revenue returns. The crisis may deepen in 20-21 unless the virus spread is contained immediately.

The dwindling job opportunities in the Gulf countries and job loss are likely to reflect on the remittances. A situation that would force the shutdown of small and medium industries forcing a return of migrant labour to their home States would deepen the intensity of the crisis.

The Cabinet decision for a partial closedown was made to pre-empt such a crisis. The government is making an all-out bid to source funds for sustaining the tempo of the infrastructure development projects taken up at the behest of the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, Dr. Isaac says.

Earlier, the government had laid out a plan for mopping up resources mainly by plugging revenue leak and stepping up tax collection.

The alleged indifference of the Centre in addressing the financial concerns of the State and also expediting steps for boosting rural spending by allocating more funds for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and such others are feared to compound the financial woes further.

“The Centre does not seem to be keen on making policy corrections and putting the economy back on rails,” says Dr.Isaac.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-may-derail-keralas-revenue-mobilisation-plans/article31043790.ece
138,2020/03/11,HC questions audio systems in buses,"Says safety of passengers and road users at peril

The Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the Transport Commissioner to file a statement explaining the circumstances in which buses with open-door shutters and contract vehicles with high-power audio systems are allowed to operate, endangering the safety of passengers and road users.

Justice Anil K. Narendran observed that stage carriages were being operated with open-door shutters in violation of statutory requirements and High Court directives.

Besides, contract carriages and buses fitted with high-power audio systems were also permitted on the road.

The court noted that Rule 289 of the Kerala Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 deals with prohibition of installation of audio-visual or radio or tape recorder type devices inside stage carriages.

The court made the observations when a batch of writ petitions filed by private bus operators seeking to restrain authorities from taking coercive action against them for not fitting vehicle location tracking devices and panic buttons on their vehicles came up for hearing.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-questions-audio-systems-in-buses/article31043779.ece

140,2020/03/11,Green tribunal cracks the whip on legacy waste,"Adverse remarks in confidential reports of officials likely

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has recommended making adverse entries in the annual confidential reports of the chief executive officer (CEO) of local bodies and senior functionaries in the Department of Urban Development for their failure to carry out remediation of legacy waste (old waste).

Continued failure of every local body on the subject of commencing the work of remediation of the legacy waste sites from April 1 this year till compliance will result in liability to pay compensation at the rate of ₹10 lakh per month per local body (for population of above 10 lakh), ₹5 lakh per month (population between 5 lakh and 10 lakh), and ₹1 lakh per month for other local bodies, says an order issued by a Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel.

If the local bodies are unable to bear the financial burden, the liability will be of the State government with liberty to take remedial action against the erring local bodies. Apart from compensation, adverse entries must be made in the annual confidential reports of the CEO of the local bodies and other senior functionaries in the Department of Urban Development who are responsible for compliance with orders of this tribunal, it says.

Monitoring cell

The Bench suggests setting up an ‘Environment Monitoring Cell’ at the office of Chief Secretaries of all States/Union Territories for coordination and compliance with the directives issued by the tribunal.

At present, processing of waste generated and collected is not taking place regularly.

148,2020/03/11,Case registered against doctor,"For allegedly demeaning Health Department

The police have registered a case against Shinu Shyamalan for creating panic in society about COVID-19 and for demeaning the Health Department by spreading false news. The Vadanappilly police on Wednesday registered a case under Section 505 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 120 (O) of the Kerala Police Act against the doctor.

In a report submitted to the District Collector, the District Medical Officer (DMO) said the doctor’s remarks in media demeaned the Health Department, which has been making sincere efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The doctor tried to mislead people, the report said.

Dr. Shyamalan, practising at a private clinic in Thalikulam, alleged that the management of the clinic dismissed her for reporting to the Health Department on a patient who came to the clinic with suspected COVID-19 symptoms. According to her, a patient who had come from Qatar two months ago and later travelled to Delhi and Agra, reached her clinic a few days ago with fever. He wanted medication for fever as he wanted to go back to Qatar in two days. “Since I suspected COVID-19 symptoms in him, I asked the patient to report with the Health Department. But he refused and left for Qatar after two days,” she said.

She also alleged that the health officials failed to follow up the case though she had informed them of the incident. “As I did not have his phone number, I gave them the number of his motorcycle. But he went to Qatar as the Health Department failed to initiate swift action,” the doctor alleged.

But Thrissur DMO said the patient reached the district from Qatar on January 31. He completed the mandated incubation period on February 14 and 28 days of quarantine on February 28. The youth reached Dr. Shymalan’s clinic 10 days after the quarantine period.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/case-registered-against-doctor/article31043625.ece

150,2020/03/11,No new COVID-19 positive cases in Kerala on March 11,"Concern over condition of two elderly patients at ICU in Kottayam

Anxiety levels over COVID-19 went down a notch in the State on Wednesday as no new positive cases were reported.

The condition of all 14 COVID-19 cases remained stable, even though doctors were quite concerned about the condition of the two elderly patients who are in intensive care units (ICU) at Kottayam Government Medical College Hospital.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, briefing media, said the Pathanamthitta district health administration had received about 70 phone calls after the spatiotemporal maps of the movement of the family from Italy had been published, which resulted in gaining more information on the possible contacts with the family.

The Minister said a contact list of 969 persons had been drawn up and that 129 persons, categorised as high risk, were being observed closely. About 13% of the high risk contacts were above 60 years of age, which called for greater caution when putting them under surveillance.

In Kottayam, 60 persons had come in the contact list, including 24 primary and 36 secondary contacts. In Ernakulam, a list of 131 persons had been drawn up as the possible contacts of the couple with the three-year-old child who had landed in Kochi from Italy. Among them, 33 persons, who could have had direct contact with the family, had been classified as high risk.

As on Wednesday, 3,313 persons are under surveillance in the State, of whom, 293 persons are in isolation in hospitals, while the rest are on monitored self-quarantine in homes.

Ms. Shylaja said the arrival of persons from COVID-19-affected nations had suddenly gone up in Kerala and that airport-based screening and surveillance by the health desk had been strengthened. All were being put on strict 28-day quarantine.

A good number of the travellers were voluntarily reporting at the health desk and announcements were being made over the public system at airports, railway and bus stations about the need for travellers to report to the authorities.

Grassroots-level surveillance of arrivals from foreign countries in each ward have also been initiated with the help of local bodies. Ms. Shylaja said the health system had managed well so far even as those being put under isolation in hospitals were going up steadily. But the department does have a Plan B in place to meet any exigencies which may arise due to the increased need for isolation facilities and external facilities are being arranged.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f2m4mr/article31053336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TVTVCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-new-covid-19-positive-cases-in-state/article31042929.ece
151,2020/03/11,Pathanamthitta group didn’t say they came from Italy: CIAL,"60-member team, 10 ambulances at CIAL to meet Covid-19 threat

Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) authorities have said that the three people, who arrived in Kochi on February 29 via Doha and proceeded to Pathanamithitta, did not reveal that they had arrived from Italy.

They “skipped the health counter” and directly proceeded to the immigration counter, said a communication from the CIAL authorities here on Wednesday. They also hid the fact that they had started their journey in Italy and got out of the airport. The facts had been verified in the wake of the allegations made by these travellers against those in the immigration counter, the press release said.

Meanwhile, the airport authorities had deployed a 60-member medical team and 10 ambulances as it fights to stave off the spread of the epidemic reaching Indian shores via international travel.

The airport authority was screening around 12,000 people daily taking the help of 30 medical doctors on duty, said a press release here. The airport authorities had also readied 10 sterilized ambulances to transport anyone suspected to be infected. The ambulances were on the ready on a 24-hour basis.

Universal screening of passengers had begun on March 3 on advise from the Union government. Prior to this, the screening included only those passengers from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and South Korea. It was also made mandatory that those arriving from Iran and Italy declared the origin of their journey. Since these countries did not have direct flight to India, travellers were asked to inform the authorities about their journey.

The airport authorities denied allegations that the needs of about 52 passengers who arrived from Italy early hours of Wednesday were not met. Those arriving from South Korea and Italy were expected to produce a certificate that they were not infected. This rule was effective from March 10 and it was on this ground that these passengers were shifted to the Aluva Taluk Hospital isolation ward, the authorities said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pathanamthitta-group-didnt-say-they-came-from-italy-cial/article31042481.ece

Revenue Secretary V. Venu has gone on leave reportedly expressing his displeasure over the Cabinet decision to ease out Survey Director V.R. Premkumar and appoint V. Girija without taking him into confidence.

The Cabinet decision comes at a time when resurvey has recorded significant progress and modernisation of the Survey Department was in its conceptional stage.

Revenue Department sources told The Hindu that the decision to ease out the incumbent was made without holding any consultation with Mr. Venu. Mr. Premkumar had been reporting to Mr. Venu and the decision to move out the former is feared to slacken the modernisation and other similar initiatives that were being managed by them.

153,2020/03/11,Francis George moves to KC(M),"Major realignment of allegiance within Kerala Congress groups

In yet another realignment of allegiance within the Kerala Congress factions, the Janadhipathya Kerala Congress, a Left Democratic Front (LDF) ally, is set to join the Kerala Congress (M) led by veteran leader P.J. Joseph.

A formal announcement to this effect is expected to be made during a State committee meeting of the party to be convened by its chairman Francis George at Muvattupuzha on March 13. The merger move, initiated by Mr. Joseph, has already received endorsement from a major section of the party leadership, including the youth wing of the organisation.

A State secretariat meeting of the Janadhipathya Kerala Youth Front, which was held here on Wednesday, sought to uphold the party’s plan to merge with the Kerala Congress (M) led by Mr. Joseph and C.F. Thomas. The meeting, convened by Michael James, State president of the organisation, was attended by several State executive members.

According to sources, Mr. George is expected to be followed by a battery of senior leaders, including former MP Vakkachan Mattathil, general secretary (office charge), M.P. Poly and Thomas Kunnappally, among others. The two other key leaders of the regional outfit, Antony Raju and K.C. Joseph, however, will stay back.

Mr. George, who has been in consultation with Mr. Joseph, will be the second major Kerala Congress leader after Johny Nelloor to join the KC(M) led by Mr. Joseph. He had walked out of the KC(M) four years ago following a factional war with party leader K.M. Mani and his son Jose K. Mani.

“The dynamics of Kerala Congress has been undergoing a sea change ever since the KC(M) underwent a vertical split. The strategy adopted by the Joseph group to expand by bringing in new members and shifting old alliances, intends to give it an upper hand over the rival group within the UDF,’’ said a senior leader.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/francis-george-moves-to-kcm/article31042169.ece
154,2020/03/11,24-hour ordeal for 40 Malayalis at Rome,"Young children, pregnant women among those stranded at Fiumicino airport

It was more than 24 hours that Jolly Philip had been languishing at the Fiumicino international airport in Rome with her three-year-old child and there was no clarity yet on when she would be able to board a flight back home in Kochi.

She was among 40-odd Kochi-bound Malayalis who were booked on a flight scheduled to depart at Italian time 3.10 p.m. on Tuesday, but were allegedly turned down by the airline concerned at the last minute on failing to produce medical certificate vouching that they were not infected by COVID-19 as required by the Indian government.

Hardships

“Our hardships are beyond description and the Indian government will have to intervene for our safe exit without delay. We have been at the airport for more than 24 hours and some among us are beginning to lose hope and are thinking of returning from the airport,” Ms. Philip, a resident of Arayankavu and working at an old age home in Rome, told The Hindu over phone.

Martin Cherumadathil, an electrician in Italy for the last nine years, warned that the young children, including a two-month-old infant, and pregnant women among the stranded passengers were in danger of getting infected after spending long hours in the airport.

“Protective gears such as masks and gloves are not available, though none of us have any symptoms right now. It is not possible to get a medical certificate like the one demanded by the Indian government in a country where even a routine appointment with a dentist takes months,” said Mr. Cherumadathil, who was eager to meet his 13-year-old son studying in Angamaly.

Abhijit K.S. had even checked in and was on the verge of boarding when he was turned away by the airline. “Since then there was no decision on our fate and we have been left to do without food and water as nothing was available in the airport,” said the dejected youngster who had gone on a student visa in 2014.

Medical team from India

Liji Martin, who had been in Italy for the last nine years, said though there were reports of a medical team from India being sent to Italy, they were still to hear from the Indian embassy.

Denny Cherpanath, working as a social assistant in Rome, said there was no scope for getting a medical certificate as demanded since hospitals, already stretched attending the infected, were unlikely to spare time conducting tests on people with no immediate symptoms and issue certificates.

“The inexperience of the Italian health machinery in dealing with similar contagions and the lifestyle of Italian society are what turned it into a pandemic,” said Mr. Cherpanath, whose social media post about the plight of Italian Malayalis stranded in the airport had gone viral.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/i1v924/article31053346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200311-WA0040,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/malayalis-stranded-in-rome-airport-face-ordeal/article31042081.ece
155,2020/03/11,Neyyabhishekom ticket counters to remain closed at Sabarimala,"Amid the tight vigil in the district against the backdrop of the second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in the State, the Lord Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala will be opened on March 13 afternoon for the five-day monthly rituals in the Malayalam month of Meenom that begins on March 14.

The Travancore Devaswom Board has appealed to Ayyappa devotees not to visit the holy hillock during the period as part of the governmental efforts to check the spread of the virus.

Talking to The Hindu, Devaswom executive officer Rajendraprasad said the functioning of the temple would be restricted to routine rituals. Only a skeleton staff will be deployed at Sabarimala and there will be no accommodation or annadanam during the period. Neither the temple administration nor any government agencies will provide any pilgrim facility at the holy hillock and Pampa.

Prasadom counters

Mr. Rajendraprasad said prasadom counters, including appam-aravana sales counters, will remain closed. The neyyabhisehkom ticket counter too would remain closed. However, the board would perform the customary neyyabhishekom to the deity in the morning.

Chief priest (Tantri) Kandararu Maheswararu Mohanararu told The Hindu that Ganapati homom, ushapuja, utchapuja, deeparadhana, and athazhapuja will be performed. Padipja, pushpabhishekom, sahasrakalasabhishekom and other special rituals will not be performed. He urged the devotees to abide by the government directions.

The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will not operate services to Pampa and chain services from Nilackal to Pampa when the Ayyappa temple in Sabarimala opens from March 13 to 18 for the monthly pujas.

KSRTC Chairman and Managing Director M.P. Dinesh said this was in view of the alert sounded by the government in the wake of COVID-19 scare.

Already, the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has urged devotees to abstain from visiting the hill shrine temple. The TDB has said the monthly pujas and rituals will be performed by Melsanthi and other priests residing in the temple.

158,2020/03/11,HC calls for Munnar action taken report,"Land grab in the hill resort and bogus title deeds

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court has directed the State government to file a statement indicating the suggestions/recommendations made by it on various reports, including the one by former Additional Chief Secretary (Revenue and Land Management) Nivedita P Haran, on the illegal land grab in Munnar and also the action taken by the Idukki District Collector or the police on the issue of bogus title deeds.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P.Chali directed the government to state the actions in a tabular form to enable the court to ascertain whether the steps taken by the government were proper.

The order was passed on a petition filed by One Earth One Life and the Paristhithi Samrakshna Samiti of Thodupuzha. They alleged that large-scale encroachments on revenue and forestland had taken place in Munnar, Devikulam, and Kannan Devan Hill villages. The encroachers created forged titles for the land.

The petitioners pointed out that those who encroached on the land included political parties, religious organisations and government employees. Some of them had taken loans using the forged titles.

Forged title deeds

Former Additional Director General of Police(Intelligence) Rajan Madhekar in 2004 reported that around 3,000 forged title deeds were issued by officials. He reported that registers with details of original titles and tax collection had been destroyed by some of the officials. The report also said that various agents were involved in the forgery of the titles. An expert committee constituted on the recommendation of the Additional DGP had found various kinds of irregularities on the issue of titles in KDH villages. It also suggested civil and criminal action against those possessing bogus pattayams and the officials involved in forgery.

The government had assured the court that a special investigation team probe would be held into the illegal grant of titles besides a Vigilance probe.

The former Additional Chief Secretary had also recommended action against the encroachers and their eviction apart from criminal and civil action against persons having bogus possession and tax certificates.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-calls-for-munnar-action-taken-report/article31035299.ece
159,2020/03/11,Olive ridley turtles’ nesting sites in Kasaragod dwindling,"Environmentalists call for better community conservation efforts

The serene and clean coast of North Malabar attracts a large number of olive ridley turtles to its shores during nesting period every year. However, the turtles skipping the sandy shores this season have left conservationists worried.

The changing climatic conditions and large-scale fishing are posing huge threats to the turtles. Their numbers have drastically reduced as the nesting season ends this month. The turtles lay eggs on Kerala’s sandy shores during the November-March season.

The district of Kasaragod had witnessed the largest number of nesting sites of the turtles in the past several years. As many as 45 nesting sites were identified in the district in the past. However, over the last few years, the numbers have seen a change.

While 12 nesting sites were found in Kasaragod last year, the numbers have dwindled to just four this year. Conservationists like C. Sudheer Kumar, a member of Naithal, which is involved in the conservation of turtles here, said it was alarming and reflected the bad health of the coastal ecosystem. In addition to changing climate conditions and the presence of sea walls, a large number of fishing boats, especially those arriving from Mangalore, are also threatening the turtles.

The turtles were either moving to other areas or were getting caught in fishing nets, said Mr. Sudheer Kumar, adding that they found at least 35 turtles which were badly injured after getting caught in abandoned nets. At least 15 of those turtles died despite being given treatment, he added.

In recent years, development activities adjoining the shores have also affected nesting. The turtles move away if there is light or too many activities going on near the shore area. Immediate measures had to be taken to protect the areas if the number of nesting sites had to be increased, he said.

Dead turtles found

Pareparambil Murukan, coordinator, Marine Turtle Conservation, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), said several cases of dead turtles being found were reported from the State. He said community conservation would help protect the turtles reaching the shores.

The turtles had their nesting sites annually at places such as Thottappally in Alappuzha, Chavakkad in Thirssur, certain pockets of Malapuram and Kozhikode, Kannur and Kasaragod.

At Chavakkad

Mr. Murukan said Chavakkad had the highest number of nesting sites in the State. This season, 64 nesting sites have been identified there and it was made possible due to the conservation efforts taken by the community adjoining the area.

Fisherman and local groups have joined hands to conserve the turtles. Night patrolling and safeguarding the eggs had helped conserve the turtles, he added.

Each nesting site had an average of 100 eggs and about 5,000 turtles hatched at Chavakkad due to constant conservation efforts there, he said. Kasaragod had the second largest number of nesting sites in the State and efforts by the local community could play a major role in conservation, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/oe5qyd/article31034799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10KIOLIVERIDLEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/olive-ridley-turtles-nesting-sites-in-kasaragod-dwindling/article31034800.ece
160,2020/03/11,Radhika Madan on playing Tarika in 'Angrezi Medium': 'We both can't stop dreaming',"The actress and director Homi Adajania on living different lives, stepping out of the comfort zone and working on the upcoming film

Actor Radhika Madan asked for the question to be repeated. This time around, she peeled her eyes off of the recorder – “it’s so old-school!” – to return to our tête-à-tête. But as director Homi Adajania kicked off his interview, he mischievously chuckled and eerily predicted its malfunctioning. During their chats with The Hindu at the Santa Cruz West Maddock Films office, the actor and director discussed their upcoming film Angrezi Medium (AM), being storytellers, and their peculiar career trajectories.

After playing a badass martial artist in Vasan Bala’s Mard Ko Dard Nahi Hota and one half of the warring Rajasthani sisters in Vishal Bhardwaj’s Pataakha, the 24-year-old Madan will be portraying a 17-year-old Tarika Bansal, the daughter of an Udaipuri mithaiwala (Irrfan Khan) who wants to study in London.

While there were whispers of Madan replacing a star kid for the role, Adajania shared he happened to chance upon her audition for Pataakha, “I had no clue who this girl was, but I was blown away by it.” As they discussed it, Madan asked to audition for AM, but Adajania seemed rather blasé having decided he was looking for a 16 or 17-year-old. “I saw her audition and there was no way I could say no,” he said, admitting that she didn’t stick out amongst a group of younger teenagers.

Out of character

Madan felt that playing Tarika has been her toughest role yet. She rolled her eyes, knowing that people would likely disagree, “But I can’t relate to Tarika at all. I think the one thing that’s common between us, is that we can’t stop dreaming.”

In her endeavour to get into the schoolgirl’s shoes, the actor travelled to Udaipur, and spent time with teenagers who were giving their exams. “They would pick me up in their Scooty and go to their hangout spots – [near] Fateh Sagar [Lake] we would have kulhad-wali chai (tea in clay cups).” They spoke about boyfriends and travelling abroad, and Madan picked up the nuances and twangs in the English they spoke. But the actor shakes her head defeated while laughing and added, “All people are going to say is, ‘she looked cute and sweet!’”

With her two-year-old career in Hindi films, Madan’s filmography has almost caught up with Adajania’s – whose presence in the industry was marked with his 2006 debut, the Saif Ali Khan-starrer Being Cyrus. But the director is unbothered by the gaps between his releases – his last being the 2014 Finding Fanny. He shared that he takes on projects instinctively, “I make a film if I know it’s going to be a new and great experience [that will] put me out of my comfort zone. I made my first film because I didn’t know how to make a film. I made Cocktail (2012) because it was just not [of] my sensibilities and I thought ‘let me try this’. I made Finding Fanny because I wanted to make a picture book on love, loneliness and longing, and I wanted each frame to be edible.” On him why he chose to helm AM he said, “Because I’m looking at the world around me and I feel we need to make people laugh. [Not through] gags or slapstick, [but the film] needed to have a soul.”

An adventurous life

Adajania also admitted that inevitably, experiences from his travels – whether the people he meets, or the bizarre experiences he survives – bleed into his films. When asked for a list of the craziest situations he has experienced, the effort to shortlist was evident. He mentioned being on a boat for a shark expedition that hit rocks and sank at 3 a.m., doing a diving course in Mauritius when he ran out of air at a depth of 120 feet, and going snowboarding – when he didn’t know how – before he had his first child, but landing up with a ripped collarbone and snow blindness. But he left it that, flustered that the 20 minutes allotted for the chat wouldn’t allow him to dive into detail of each story.

Director Homi Adajania

While Adajania decided to create Being Cyrus on a whim – just another thing to check off his bucket list, Madan’s beginnings in the industry were also rather accidental. After being discovered on Facebook, Madan took a leap of faith and moved to Mumbai to act in the television show Meri Aashiqui Tum Se Hi and it was after four months of its shooting through long hours that Madan discovered a love for acting. Despite the condescension small screen actors often face, Madan sees her background and its rigorous schedules as the place she learnt to hone her craft. Two separate accidental injuries with her dog – a burn and a bite – didn’t stop the show’s shooting. “They came home and took my close-up. Once I was bitten by my dog [around] my eye and they changed the script – the next day I had a kidnapping scene and got hit, so I shot with a bruised eye,” she shared.

Madan will next be seen as a swimmer in Shiddat opposite Sunny Kaushal while Adajania is working on his first web series Saas, Bahu Aur Cocaine about women who run the biggest cocaine cartel in South Asia from a crumbing haveli in Kutch. Both are focused on steeping themselves in new experiences. As Madan succinctly concludes, “I don’t want to get bored. I want to live different lives.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/20onok/article31042767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bm-pg5-Angrezi-Medium-stills-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/radhika-madan-on-playing-tarika-in-angrezi-medium-we-both-cant-stop-dreaming/article31042769.ece
161,2020/03/11,‘I don’t play the best friend role any more’: Sumukhi Suresh on 'Pushpavalli',"The actor and stand-up comedian's much-loved character is back on Amazon Prime Video for a second season

Sumukhi Suresh greets me like an old friend on the phone. “We always speak during the highlight moments of my life,” she says. And there have been quite a few of those, including a stand-up special, judging a reality show for upcoming comics and, now, the second season of her Amazon Prime Video show, Pushpavalli.

Released in December 2017, the titular character is an introverted girl from Bhopal who moves all the way to Bengaluru to pursue (read stalk) a man she thinks is romantically interested in her. Written and played by 32-year-old Suresh, the show’s eight binge-worthy episodes had us rooting for Pushpavalli, even when the things she said or did were clearly not acceptable. “I wrote her as someone who is reserved, so viewers felt more sympathetic. At the end of season one, she is left embarrassed and treated badly by everyone around her. So she is in an irrational, vengeful place,” says Suresh.

Quirks to the fore

The core cast remains the same, with Manish Anand (Nikhil Rao), Naveen Richard (Pankaj) and Ashok Pathak (T-Boi) reprising their roles. Actor Vidyuth Gargi is a new addition — a social media teaser shows him seated next to Pushpavalli in what looks like an engagement. “We wrote the script and character around [Gargi’s] quirks, so it felt more natural,” says Suresh. While she helms the writers’ room, Ayesha Nair (Adulting, What the Folks) and Sumaira Shaik (Son of Abish) are also part of the team, with Richard and director Debbie Rao giving inputs.

Ask what the show has done for her career at large, and she says, “Immediately, it didn’t do a lot for me. But over the past one year, I have noticed that a lot of people have discovered it, and come for my live events because of it.” She adds that people also now see her as someone who is able to play a lead, who can hold a scene by herself. “I don’t play the best friend role any more.”

No to the gender card

On several instances, Suresh has mentioned that she doesn’t like being pigeonholed into the “woman comic” slot. Her aim is to be great at whatever she does, irrespective of gender. Being part of a reality show for stand-ups like Comicstaan, she is glad to see more women making their presence felt. “We should learn from men. Even when they fail, they move on. We tend to obsess. And on shows like this, a woman failing can seem like they have let down the entire gender. We need to move away from that mindset and focus on individual achievements,” she says. Suresh calls on women to fangirl more about other women, the way men do about practically anyone they admire, be it film stars or influencers. “Support them vocally, and even if you don’t like their work, make sure you give them feedback. That way, we know there is an audience that wants to listen to a female perspective.” All the feedback for her comedy (good or bad) started coming in only after she was in Pushpavalli.

Working with a largely female team for her début web series on a major platform such as Prime Video, Suresh admits that her intention was to tell a story for women. “I don’t mean to sound repetitive, but it’s a fact that we don’t give big girls such roles. There are no non-stereotypical traits on screen [in recent years]. No Nandita Das, Shabana Azmi or Smita Patil. When I got the chance to put out a face that is not typical, I took it, and it worked,” she explains. So when asked what happens if the second season doesn’t do as well as the first, she is prepared for it. “If it fails, it fails. I cannot do anything about it. I’ll just have to move on to the next project with lessons learnt.”

With experience in different forms of creative entertainment, which aspect does she enjoy the most? “Writing and acting, because it doesn’t feel like a chore,” she says. This explains why Suresh is currently working on three different scripts for web series, which will hopefully find producers soon. As for stand-up, she says, “I know somewhere I do it to prove a point. Not as much as before, but 20% of it is for this reason.”

Improv, which is where she started her career, is just a way of life now. “I apply it in every situation, even when we have a conflict in the writers’ room. It is also how I deal with the pressure to get married. What if I don’t find someone? Then I’ll just have to live by myself, which is not so bad,” she says. However, she warns against trying the ‘Yes, and’ method when you are on the edge of a cliff — “That will not end well,” she concludes with a laugh.

Season two of Pushpavalli is available on Amazon Prime Video from March 13.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/brkgs/article31041437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MG5336,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-dont-play-the-best-friend-role-any-more-sumukhi-suresh-on-pushpavalli/article31041438.ece

The shooting of the upcoming Falcon And Winter Soldier series has been shut down in Prague due to concerns over coronavirus.

The move comes after the Czech government placed a ban on movie screenings, elementary and high school classes, sports matches, and cultural events. The Prague Film Festival has also been cancelled, reports variety.com.

Falcon and Winter Soldier began filming in Prague last week, but the cast and crew have now been recalled to Atlanta.

This is the second time filming on the series has been interrupted. In January, the show was due to shoot in Puerto Rico, but was forced to postpone shooting after the commonwealth was hit by a series of powerful earthquakes.

Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan are set to reprise their roles from the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the series, with Daniel Bruhl, Emily VanCamp, and Wyatt Russell also starring. The series will consist of six episodes and is due to be released on Disney+ in August.

163,2020/03/11,Scarlett Johansson feels the ‘Black Widow’ movie wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago,"The movie, which is a prequel set before the events of ‘Avengers: Endgame’, will hit screens on April 30

Hollywood star Scarlett Johansson believes time is right for her stand-alone Black Widow film as she believes the movie wouldn’t have been as “substantial” if it released a decade ago.

After 10 years and seven films of playing the Russian super-spy Avenger Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow, Johansson is set to star in a solo film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

The film, directed by Cate Shortland, is a prequel set before the events of 2019 tentpole, Avengers: Endgame.

Black Widow was the only female in the original Avengers. Johansson made her debut as the character in 2010’s Iron Man 2.

“For anyone who said to me, ‘Oh, this should’ve happened five or 10 years ago,’ I’m like, it would not have been as substantial. We just would not have been able to do it. This film is happening now as a result of what’s going on in the zeitgeist, and I think it’s pretty cool,” Johansson told Entertainment Weekly.

After Captain Marvel, the film is the second female superhero-led project in the MCU.

Johansson said the world was ready for Black Widow while she was filming a fight scene alongside fellow female actors Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), Danai Gurira (Okoye) and Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), among others in Endgame.

“I hope that this film continues pushing that boundary, so that we can actually have more female superheroes who are inherently female, and aren’t just Batman in heels or whatever,” she added.

Actor-producer Mark Wahlberg is once again set to give a sneak peek into his life, this time through docuseries Wahl Street.

Wahl Street, a pun on American financial epicentre Wall Street, the HBO Max series will trace Wahlberg’s journey as a rapper-turned-actor who straddles his acting job with many other business ventures.

The eight-episode docuseries is executive produced by Wahlberg, Stephen Levinson, Archie Gips, and Liz Bronstein, reported Entertainment Weekly.

According to the WarnerMedia streaming service, each episode “will follow Wahlberg as he navigates his expansive business portfolio, spanning all sectors of commerce ranging from a line of activewear, all-natural, high-performance sports nutrition supplements, television and film production companies, and even a Chevrolet dealership.”

The show will also feature entrepreneurs pitching ideas to Wahlberg.

“We’re documenting the ups, the downs, the hits and the misses. It’s all the real stuff that’s happening while I’m growing my businesses. We’re pulling back the curtain and hopefully it’s an opportunity to inspire other entrepreneurs,” said Wahlberg.

165,2020/03/11,How is Kollywood dealing with the coronavirus outbreak in India?,"As the COVID-19 scare begins to stall movie businesses across the country, let's take a look at the situation in the Tamil film industry

Is the film industry equipped to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak? Because, there seems to be a decline in terms of collection during weekdays. Tiger Shroff’s action-packed Baaghi 3 opened well across the country and has grossed ₹53.83 crore in its opening weekend. However, the trade feels that the movie could have performed much better if not for the Coronavirus fear. Closer home, the Tamil romantic-drama Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal grossed over ₹9 cr in 10 days, which is huge by any yardstick.

Market pressure

Hollywood took a hit because of the Coronavirus threat in countries like North America, South Korea, Japan, Europe and China. In fact, the much-awaited James Bond movie No Time To Die, which was scheduled for release on April 2, has been pushed to November. Peter Rabbit 2 is another movie to be postponed. Marvel’s Black Widow, however, will release as per its original plan on April 30. Meanwhile, the Malayalam industry has locked down theatres till March 31 as per the State Government’s request.

Reports suggest that some Hindi films might get postponed, as tweeted by well-known trade analyst Taran Adarsh.

He wrote, “Rescheduling release dates of some forthcoming Hindi films is on the cards. With Coronavirus spreading far and wide, not just India theatrical business, the overseas theatrical business is also gradually turning cold.” The coming days are going to be crucial for the movie industry’s business. Speaking about this issue, Kamal Gianchandani, CEO of PVR Pictures, says, “We have been watching the box office trend for Baaghi 3 and other films. So far, there has not been a noticeable impact as box-office figures are concerned. It’s understandable that the producers would want to reassess their release strategy. However, the fact remains that not a single Indian film has been delayed.”

In Kollywood, meanwhile, four big ‘summer’ films are scheduled for release starting from Easter-Tamil New Year (April 9 weekend) to May Day (May 1 weekend). These movies are Vijay’s Master, Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru, Dhanush’s Jagame Thandhiram and Jayam Ravi’s Bhoomi. As per trade sources, all four movies are likely to release as per plan, though there are concerns of its release, in the overseas markets and neighbouring states. At the same time, the producers of Master have shifted the venue for the audio launch, which was supposed to be held at Nehru Stadium. The function will now be held at a star hotel with select guests on March 15. Master is slated for release on April 9, but the producers will finalise the release date after the censor process.

What’s the scene?

The overseas market will pose a challenge for Tamil cinema’s business, especially in key markets like Singapore, West Asia, Europe and the US. Filmmakers have largely avoided shooting abroad, except Vikram’s Cobra, which is currently being shot in Russia’s Baltic region. Ajith Kumar’s Valimai, which had planned to can a high-octane action scene in Spain in April, has postponed the shoot. Kollywood’s ‘location guru’, Ramji, who arranges film shootings in foreign locations, says, “Today, nobody wants to travel by flights. Coronavirus has crippled the industry and the budget has gone awry considering the various expenses for shoots abroad. I hope the situation improves as summer is the best season to shoot.”

What are some of the precautionary measures taken by Tamil filmmakers? Currently shooting for his next movie with Arivazhagan in Agra, actor Arun Vijay says, “We are shooting an intense action scene in and around Taj Mahal. We are taking all measures to ensure that the crew is wearing masks and using hand sanitisers. We cannot cancel the shoot since it’s very difficult to get permission to shoot in Agra.”

Producer G Dhananjayan, on the other hand, feels it is better to stick to Chennai, in such times. He says, “Coronavirus is certainly creating a panic in Tamil cinema. The industry hopes that the virus does not spread in the State, as it might affect footfalls.”

Distributors are monitoring the scenario on a daily basis, hoping that the situation does not get any worse.

166,2020/03/11,Kasturi Shankar to actor Ajith Kumar: ‘How long will you remain silent?’,"The Tamil actress, most recently seen in season three of ‘Bigg Boss’, wants the ‘Valimai’ star to address the harrassment she faces online from his fans

Kasturi Shankar is known for her outspoken opinions online, and of late, the ‘Bigg Boss’ star has run into a lot of online arguments with actor Ajith’s fans on social media.

Fans of big Tamil actors are notorious for trolling anyone who speaks against their matinee idol, and over the last few weeks, Kasthuri has had to constantly battle them on a daily basis. Things have taken an ugly turn since, and comments have turned abusive and indecent, feels the actress.

Taking to Twitter recently, Kasthuri posted a few screenshots from the profiles of Ajith’s fans, asking the actor to stop being silent and take some action against this online harrassment.

Come on guys, you have to act. Do the people at twitter actually endorse such harassment? @TwitterIndia

The Amaidhi Padai actress also tagged Ajith’s official PRO in the post, demanding an explanation.

Kasturi has also reportedly appealed to the Tamil Nadu police to take appropriate action on the social media profiles and the people behind them.

167,2020/03/11,Kumail Nanjiani: I wanted to look like Hrithik Roshan in ‘The Eternals’,"The ‘Silicon Valley’ star also addresses getting body dysmorphia, a mental health condition, during his transformation for the Marvel movie character

Pakistani-American actor Kumail Nanjiani had one-line brief for his trainer on The Eternals: he wanted to look like Bollywood superstar Hrithik Roshan.

Nanjiani is essaying the role of Kingo, a buff Eternal who is a cosmic-powered being who lives in the present day as a Bollywood star in the Marvel Studios film.

The Silicon Valley star had his own ideas about just how beefed up Kingo should be.

“I wanted Kumail to have the freedom to interpret his character, especially his physicality,” director Chloe Zhao added.

For that, Nanjiani turned to Bollywood and invoked Roshan, the Indian actor who has played the superhero Krrish in a film series.

“I went to my trainer and said, ‘I want to look like this guy (Roshan)’,” Nanjiani told Men’s Health magazine.

But the actor had another hurdle to cross after his physical transformation was complete: he started getting body dysmorphia, a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance.

“I don’t want to discount people who genuinely have debilitating body issues. I don’t have that. But I did start getting some body dysmorphia. I’d look in the mirror and I’d see my abs — and when I looked again, they would fade. I would just see the flaws,” he added.

In December, the actor shared a few of his shirtless photos flaunting his abs.

Nanjiani said though the photos on Instagram helped, he wants to be “easy” on himself.

“When I saw that reaction was when I was like, ‘Okay, I clearly don’t see what’s actually there.’ It’s something that I’m trying to be aware of and be better at, because that’s not a good way to be. You want to be easy on yourself,” he added.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/2dvuol/article31040117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kumail,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kumail-nanjiani-i-wanted-to-look-like-hrithik-roshan-in-the-eternals/article31040118.ece
168,2020/03/11,Coronavirus: ‘Harry Potter’ star Daniel Radcliffe denies testing positive for COVID-19,"The British actor has become the first celebrity to be caught up in a coronavirus hoax

Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has become the first star to be caught up in a coronavirus hoax.

A tweet from a fake BBC account, which has since gone viral, suggested the “Harry Potter” star had been diagnosed with COVID-19, but representatives of the star says the story is “not true”, reports aceshowbiz.com.

The tweet read, “BREAKING: Daniel Radcliffe tests positive for coronavirus. The actor is said to be the first famous person to be publicly confirmed.”

The tweet has since been deleted. Twitter announced last week that different measures are being taken regarding misinformation on coronavirus, and that it is continuously monitoring conversation on the coronavirus, working to make verified information available to users.

169,2020/03/11,Vishal responds to Mysskin on ‘Thupparivaalan 2’ rift: ‘No producer should go through such an ordeal’,"The actor likens the director’s decision to leave the big-budget project to ‘abandoning a baby at an orphanage’

Following the rift between actor-producer Vishal and filmmaker Mysskin, which led to the former replacing the latter as director for Thupparivaalan 2, Vishal has now come forward with a statement clearing the air on what went wrong.

The actor also shared the first look of the upcoming film, posting, ""#KaniyanPoonkundran & #Mano back in action again, this time, ""Hunting in London.""

The Ayogya star’s statement comes in the wake of a letter that was leaked online, purportedly written by Mysskin to Vishal, which lists out, among others, demands such as Rs 5 crore payment for Mysskin to direct the film.

The letter also details various other demands from Mysskin namely, among others, rights to remake the film in Hindi language, transfer of intellectual property rights over the film’s title and character names to the director, a non-exclusivity clause that permits Mysskin to start work on other projects should shooting fail to happen or does not complete within 90 days of the start of second schedule, and an infringement clause which states that in the event of interference to Mysskin’s creative calls or if he or his staff be “insulted, abused threatened, ill-treated or anything that might disturb director’s psychology”, then he would “abandon” the project at that instance of said events occurring.

The letter further carries the disclaimer that disagreement to any of the 15-point demand it states will result in Mysskin “forcing his services” to Vishal Film Factory, the film’s producer, with respect to Thupparivaalan 2.

On Wednesday, Vishal, in a statement, opted to answer in the figurative to the leaked letter.

The sole purpose of the statement is not to tarnish one's image but is only to make sure that nobody falls prey to such people especially Producers



Seeking your blessings & wishes for my directorial debut & hoping to do the best as a Director#Thupparivaalan2 #VishalDirection1 pic.twitter.com/5CnGYlmsrD — Vishal (@VishalKOfficial) March 11, 2020

“What are the reasons for a director to opt out of a film midway?” his note begins, before the actor goes on to express his bewilderment at the turn of events. “I still wonder why does a director, who specifically wanted to write the script in Canada and UK and spent the producer’s money to the tune of close to 35 lakhs for the above expenses including travel, accommodation etc... after having started shoot without proper planning of location hunting, after having spent close to 13 crores... why would a director opt out of a movie midway?”

“Is it because I didn’t have the money to complete the film? No. Is it wrong if a producer pin points the mistakes of a director during production for its betterment especially when close to 15 lakhs per day was spent for a 3 to 4 hours of shoot in UK? No. Is it wrong if a producer requests whether we can shoot 2 scenes a day, or shoot day and night to bring down the cost of the shoot? No,” says Vishal, adding, “I still wonder because it’s as bad as you abandon your own kid in an orphanage.”

Tamil films are primarily funded by private financiers who lend money at exorbitant interest rates, a practice that, at times, has snuffed out lives of people. Vishal makes it a point to draw attention to this in his statement. “Does the director even remotely know the interest incurred and the troubles the producer goes through to make ends meet during the process of film making?” the actor says.

Asserting that the purpose of releasing the statement was because he did not want another producer to “go through such an ordeal”, Vishal, who has assisted actor-filmmaker Arjun Sarja earlier before his own claim to fame as a leading man, adds that since he knew the “nuances of film making”, he decided not to abandon Thupparivaalan 2 and went ahead directing the film himself.

“The sole purpose of the statement is not to tarnish [Mysskin’s] image but it is only to make sure that nobody else falls prey to such people, especially producers. It might be a public outcry but it’s time as the industry bleeds with all its shortcomings, I expect all producers, new and old, to know what a reputed production house like Vishal Film Factory did go through during the shoot of Thupparivaalan 2,” the statement adds.

170,2020/03/11,25 years of ‘Bombay’: The story behind the iconic theme that lingers on from Mani Ratnam’s classic,"Flautist Naveen Kumar explains how A.R. Rahman executed the ‘musical storyboard’ idea that he had visualised for the 1995 film starring Arvind Swami and Manisha Koirala

“Yes, I’m in Mumbai,” flautist Naveen Kumar tells me over a patchy telephone call.

He calls it ‘Mumbai’ now, just like most of us are used to, but 25 years ago, it was a film titled Bombay that gave Naveen Kumar a national platform. “I remember it so vividly,” he says.

Back then, the Vishakapatnam-born musician was part of Ilaiyaraaja’s troupe in Madras, and playing the flute for various film songs. AR Rahman was part of the group as well, and the two became friends then. “We (ARR and I) also used to regularly work for Ramesh Naidu back then,” recalls Naveen. The two worked on Yodha, Roja and multiple advertisement jingles, before their piece-de-resistance would be conceptualised... for a Mani Ratnam film titled Bombay.

Naveen Kumar with A.R.Rahman

Naveen remembers the recording of Bombay theme at Kodambakkam’s Panchathan Record Inn like it was yesterday. “It was unusual because ARR called me to his studio in the afternoon, which he never does,” laughs Naveen. People aware of the Oscar-winning composer’s work schedule know that he always works at night, something that he continues till date. “Nevertheless, I went, and he wanted me to play a tune that he had composed.”

That recording session was uneventful, but the “magic” happened a few days later, when both Rahman and Mani Ratnam were present at the studio premises. They had chalked out something that Naveen was very unfamiliar with: a ‘musical storyboard.’ “Most recording sessions follow the same pattern: I play what the music director had composed, and wrap up. But this was different. Very different,” he says.

The ‘musical storyboard’ that Naveen heard that day had a descriptive brief: Imagine a time when a downpour has subsided, and the last of the rain drops are falling on the ground. Now, imagine the sound that a solitary rain drop would make if it were to fall on a leaf. “I closed my eyes, tried visualising that and started playing,” he says. Over the next hour or so was recorded the now-iconic ‘Bombay theme’, which starts off like an almost-hesitant whisper and turns into a lilting melody before allowing the grand violins to take over.

Naveen and AR Rahman might have got international acclaim with that theme they conceptualised that day — the composer even played it in the continuum fingerboard at Berklee College of Music in 2014 — but there’s another person who warrants equal praise: late sound engineer H Sridhar. “He was a genius. He created magic out of our sounds. There can be no replacement for Sridhar saab,” rues Naveen, whose personal favourites include his flute interludes in Evano Oruvan (Alaipayuthe) and the Cyclist’s Rhythm track from Hindi film Meenaxi.

Naveen Kumar during a performance

25 years on, Naveen has worked on multiple film assignments, with leading music composers. He remains one of the most sought-after flautists in the country, often conceptualises musical shows of his own and is currently collaborating with American composer Wayne Sharpe and Brooklyn-based record producer Joel Hamilton on international projects. He has about 500 flutes (“There are 5 boxes full of them”) and has invented nine flutes, in pursuit of different sounds. “I’m also doing covers of late, of Anirudh’s Darbar and GV Prakash’s Asuran songs,” he says. Naveen has not been approached by Kollywood for any music composition projects, but has worked on a few Telugu films in the 90s. “I’m still open to offers, but playing the flute gives me most happiness.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ac0sb0/article31039331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bombay,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/25-years-of-bombay-the-story-behind-the-iconic-theme-that-lingers-on-from-mani-ratnams-classic/article31039332.ece

172,2020/03/11,"From Kamal Haasan to Ajith Kumar, meet the bouncers who guard your favourite actors","Follow The Expendables Bouncers as they watch over South India’s biggest stars, protecting them with quick reflexes and billowing biceps

“Are you guys out of your mind? Didn’t we brief you about this well in advance? Where is your boss?...” The event organiser is clearly livid.

I am at a low-key award show, where the organiser is giving a dressing down to a group of visibly mortified bouncers. Their fault? Wearing trainers when the instruction was to wear black shoes, coinciding with their ‘Men in Black’ costume.

As it turns out, such episodes are an occupational hazard. “There can never be an event without errors. Hiccups are bound to happen in our profession,” says S Sathya with a faint smile to imply that the situation is under control.

Towering men in tight T-shirts, condescendingly flexing their muscles, bouncers often seem intimidating to the general public. However, there is more to these men than bulging biceps and that stereotypical menacing gaze. “You can flaunt your physique. But that alone won’t guarantee opportunities. What matters, in this profession, is smart work and the ability to think on your feet,” he says, dispelling the notion that a chiselled body is all that it takes to break into this world.

A wistful watchdog

Sathya is the proprietor of The Expendables Bouncers, which was established in 2011 with the singular intention of providing security to film stars.

Bouncers are enlisted on the basis of three categories of service: nightclub bouncers, personal bodyguards and protocol team. The latter is an expansive service usually reserved for VVIP stars. He cites the example of Hrithik Roshan’s recent trip to Chennai, where his team trailed the actor through the day. “We received him at the airport and took him to a mall in the city. It was quite challenging since over 40,000 people had gathered at the venue.”

Today, his clients include Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth, Vijay, Ajith Kumar, Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, amongst others. “Wherever the celebrity goes, I follow,” he laughs. His company is responsible for the safety and security of stars, irrespective of the scale of the event — be it an award show, private party or corporate event. So, Sathya is invariably on the lookout for more hires, although he has a “loyal” team of 20. “Staff keep rotating, depending on the event. None of them is a full-time employee and they work for multiple companies at any given time,” he says, adding that they earn anywhere between ₹1,500 to ₹2,500 per person, per event.

After graduating with a diploma in Mechanical Engineering in 2009, Sathya was looking for a way to make easy money to meet household expenses. Like many fitness enthusiast, he was primed to take part in bodybuilding championships. But his quick fix was a part-time job as a bodyguard — a term interchangably used with ‘bouncer’ in the city.

“I still remember my first event, a private party on New Year’s Eve. That was when bouncers first started wearing black T-shirts and track pants,” he recalls, discussing Chennai in the early 2000s. He says he was overwhelmed for the initial few years. For one, there wasn’t much scope for physical work, since they were stationed at one place for up to seven hours. “Nobody briefed us about what was expected; all of us were new. We were paid around ₹150 to ₹200 for an event,” he says.

Sathya adds that the decision to start a full-fledged security service was actually an afterthought, when he had gone to watch The Expendables (2010). “There is a scene where all actors come together in a slow-motion sequence. That made me name my company after the movie,” he says, “Our first event ended with us posing like the iconic still from TheExpendables.”

Sathya with Ajith Kumar | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Each time Sathya gets an offer from a client, he devises a plan keeping in mind entry and exit points, as well as logistical challenges. There is a mandatory briefing session before the event, on the team’s role. “No foul language, no intimidating looks and never get physical... these I insist on,” says Sathya. But, he adds, “It all boils down to the kind of crowd you’re dealing with.”

The hard way

There is one particular memory about a fan, which he describes as “harrowing”. It involved a leading Tamil star, so naturally, it invited eyeballs and shutterbugs. Sathya and his team were occupied with their usual ‘push and nudge’ technique — an approach that blocks the crowd from getting close to actors.

Everything went smoothly until a fan launched himself at the celebrity from the podium, landing just a few feet from him. He says, “We swung into action and formed a human chain. But the star intervened and was gracious enough to pose for a picture with the fan.”

A bouncer’s diary Sathya works out two hours every day at C3 Fitness in Royapuram. His diet chart for muscle gain is as follows:

Breakfast: Oats and juice.

Lunch: Brown rice with chicken and four egg whites.

Snacks: White bread and fruits.

Dinner: Roti with chicken or beef or tuna.

Vijay and Nayanthara are two stars who have a massive fan following, according to Sathya.

The Expendables Bouncers’ next big event is Master audio launch, scheduled to take place on March 15.

He adds, “People, especially fans, don’t understand our job and tend to get personal. There have been times where I have been abused and hit,” he says.

In his rulebook, the priority is to ensure a safe environment. “You need to gauge the celebrity’s mood and act accordingly,” says Sathya, “ If they are impressed with your work, your name spreads like wildfire in the industry.”

Sathya says he is rarely starstruck. Except for the time when he met his idol Arnold Schwarzenegger. The actor had flown to Chennai for the audio launch of Shankar’s I in 2014.

“From receiving him at the airport to watching him work out at the gym, everything was surreal for me. It’s a feeling only fitness enthusiasts would get,” he says, adding that it was one of the biggest shows he handled, with over 200 bouncers at his disposal.

Other popular bodyguards Iron Man Bouncers

Men in Black Bouncers

Jaguars Security Services

Another silver lining was a chance to meet Kai Greene when he arrived in the city for a gym launch. “He is like God to me. I couldn’t get time with Arnold, but I spoke to Kai Greene and took a picture with him. I had goosebumps that day.”

Sathya says he cannot afford to skip a gym session and has to pump some iron for at least two hours a day. “The day you gain fat is when you become unfit for this profession. It’s your body that earns you bread and butter.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nscshj/article31039029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09MPBOUNCER,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/from-kamal-haasan-to-ajith-kumar-meet-the-bouncers-who-guard-your-favourite-actors/article31039035.ece
173,2020/03/11,"‘Agnisikha’: a documentary on Eashwari Bai, one of Independent India’s first female politicians","The 35-minute long documentary, mostly shot in and around Hyderabad, has so far won four awards on the film festival circuit

A politician, a changemaker and an active member of the Republican Party of India, Eashwari Bai fought for her beliefs all her life. A documentary film made on her life was screened at the 4th Indian World Film festival in Hyderabad and brought to life, the thoughts and ideals of a politician who fought for the underprivileged.

Eashwari Bai was the epitome of woman’s empowerment during the 1950s and 60s and an active participant in the Telangana movement of 1969 for which she was even jailed and sent to the Chanchalguda Central Jail. A municipal counsellor and an MLA for two terms, she used her voice to bring about positive change in society — whether it was in or outside the Assembly.

The 35-minute long documentary, Agnisikha (which means firebrand in Telugu) was a crisp and concise retelling of her political journey. It showcased her major successes in policy making, whether it was bringing about change in the uniform of the Police department (from shorts to trousers), taking up the issues of livelihoods of the fisher folk or batting for women’s education. The short film succeeded in introducing the work of the leader who actively fought for her beliefs to the younger generation. It was also successful in recreating a vintage era, by the thoughtful montages of rocks in the backdrop, costumes (and the style of the drapes) as well as the dialect of the actors.

The film mostly shot in and around Hyderabad, was completed last year and has been doing the rounds of film festivals (Crownwood and Beyond Earth film festivals amongst others) where it was feted and won four awards. Politico Geeta Reddy, Eashwari Bai’s daughter and the producer of the documentary calls her mother an unusual personality. “She was a single leader who soldered on without financial or organizational support. She took on the pertinent issues of the day and as the chairperson for women and child welfare, was instrumental in ensuring free education to young girls. Her faith in the ideals of Babasaheb Ambedkar made her work towards a value-based system.”

‘A firebrand leader’

Geetha Reddy says, that her mother’s story is as relevant today as it was half a century ago. “I wanted to share her story as it is an inspiration. From a teacher to a politician she always moved ahead with confidence and courage.” The documentary movie also marks the debut of its director, Sathyacama Jabali who worked on it almost for a year interviewing around 150 people from Eashwari Bai’s old constituency of Yellareddy and poring over the archives of Telangana department and the Assembly. “I got a lot of inputs, but the challenge was to showcase the conflict of an individual both within herself and with the surroundings. We understood the sociology and conditions of the time she lived in and documented her journey.”

Shanti Rao with Geetha Reddy at the festival

Shanti Rao who worked in short films in Telugu and Tamil pulled off a confident portrayal of the firebrand leader which included getting the body language and confidence of a politician correctly. The young actress says the workshops held and videos of women politicians helped her in getting the tone and tenor of the leader right. “I was nervous as I was re-living the life of a dynamic person, but it was a learning experience as I had to add my own imagination to the character. Also, it was difficult to enact the part of someone older to me, but it was a blessing to get it right.”

Screened on Women’s Day, the documentary brought to fore the life and times of one of Independent India’s first female politicians not only documenting her stellar journey but also inspiring countless other women in the process.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/d8a20u/article31037649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym11docu3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/agnisikha-a-documentary-on-eashwari-bai-one-of-independent-indias-first-female-politicians/article31037655.ece
174,2020/03/11,Analysis | Edappadi Palaniswami seeks to build a pro-farmer image,"At Tiruvarur last week, sections of farmers of the Cauvery delta presented the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister the title of ‘custodian of the Cauvery’

The recent sights of Chief Minister and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)’s co-coordinator, Edappadi K. Palaniswami entering a field to plant paddy as well as arriving at an event on a bullock cart in Tiruvarur district appears to give the impression of his keenness on donning the role of a “farmer.”

Also read | Palaniswami launches a slew of projects

While giving an interview to a Tamil television channel in mid-January, he drove a tractor on a paddy field in his home district of Salem and this was to reinforce the image of being an agriculturist. Vice President Venkaiah Naidu too praised him for not forgetting his roots. In February, he got organised a mega event on agriculture and agri-marketing in Salem and used the occasion of the event’s organisation to announce that his government would bring in a law to declare the Cauvery delta a protected zone. In no time, he deputed a delegation of his Ministers , officials and other representatives to New Delhi and secured the approval of the Central government. Shortly thereafter, the Assembly too had adopted the legislation banning any new hazardous projects in select regions of the delta.

At Tiruvarur last week, sections of farmers of the Cauvery delta presented the title of “custodian of the Cauvery” to him where he announced around ₹170-crore schemes to be implemented through the Agriculture Department and ₹6,650-crore schemes to be carried out by the Public Works Department (PWD).

“There is no reason to see any political motive behind his actions,” asserts S. Semmalai, Mettur legislator from the Chief Minister’s district and former Minister. “All along, he has been an agriculturist. He is only reflecting the real picture of his personality, not an imagery,” he points out.

P.R. Pandian, president of the Tamil Nadu Federation of All Farmers’ Associations, which was also part of the Tiruvarur event to felicitate the Chief Minister, feels that unlike his predecessors such as M.G. Ramachandran, M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, Mr Palaniswami has been a “practising farmer” and there is nothing wrong in exhibiting his background. “He is not showing off as a farmer,” he points out. A senior official, who is observing him in close quarters, says the Chief Minister's knowledge of matters concerning the dairy sector, is ""amazing.""

However, there are critics even among the farming community. K.V. Ilankeeran, president of the federation of farmers’ organisations in the delta, is not impressed with Mr Palaniswami’s attempts to reach out to the community. “If he is genuinely interested about our welfare, he would have gone for loan waiver of all farmers, regardless of landholding size, as directed by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. But, his government had got the High Court order stayed by the Supreme Court,” he says.

S.Venkatesan, general secretary of the Federation of Tamil Nadu and Pondy State Private Sugarmill Cane Growers’ Associations, wants the Chief Minister to ensure that farmers are paid minimum statutory price for paddy at regulated markets being operated by the Commissionerate of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business and sugar mills pay their arrears of ₹500 crore to cane farmers, besides announcing an incentive price for sugarcane farmers this year. “It is not enough for him to make symbolic gestures. He should come out with substantive actions too,” Mr Venkatesan adds.

Even though it is too early to say whether Mr. Palaniswami will be able to reap any political dividend out of his outreach initiative, his steps in recent weeks have created an impression that he is assiduously seeking to gain the support of the agriculturists, who, in the last three years, took part in a number of agitations on a variety of issues.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/t9nvzl/article31042036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MGRCELEARI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/analysis-edapaddi-palaniswami-seeks-to-build-a-pro-farmer-image/article31042037.ece
175,2020/03/11,Tamil Nadu government says it will not pass resolution against CAA in Assembly,"Opposing the AIADMK’s stand, the main Opposition party DMK and its allies staged a walkout from the House on Wednesday

Maintaining its stand on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the State government said it could not pass a resolution in the Legislative Assembly against the Central legislation passed by the Parliament.

Opposing the AIADMK’s stand, the main opposition DMK and its allies staged a walkout from the House on Wednesday.

The DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin raised the issue in the Zero Hour in the House and urged the AIADMK government to pass a resolution against the CAA and given an assurance that the State government would not implement the National Population Register (NPR) in its present form. He also pointed out that Janata Dal (United), Y.S.R. Congress and Telangana Rashtra Samiti governments in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana respectively -- all BJP allies have changed their positions to oppose CAA 2019.

However, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar wondered how the House could pass a resolution against a legislation enacted by the Parliament in Delhi and whether it would hold good under the Constitution. “The State Legislative Assembly has to comply with legislations enacted by the Parliament,” Mr. Udayakumar contended.

Mr. Stalin sought to know why the government was sending a letter seeking clarifications, if that was the case. He went on to urge the AIADMK government multiple times to pass a resolution against the CAA but in vain.

Though Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was present in the House during the debate, he chose not to speak but was seen actively helping Mr. Udhayakumar in his replies to the Opposition leaders.

To Mr. Stalin’s query on whether the BJP government in the Centre has replied to the clarifications sought for on the NPR, Mr. Udhayakumar said the State government was yet to receive any reply from the Centre in this regard.

Mr. Udhayakumar recalled that clarifications have been sought over three specific questions in the NPR: updation manual over the mother tongue, details of the parents and spouse of the resident. He said that documents need not be produced by residents to support their claims and added that no schedule has been notified as yet for the updation of the NPR. The Minister also pointed out that representatives of those protesting against the CAA, NPR and the NRC met the Chief Minister in his camp office and the latter allayed their apprehensions.

When Mr. Udhayakumar said the changes in the Citizenship Act was earlier initiated by the Union government in which the DMK was an ally in 2003, Mr. Stalin pointed out there was a difference then and now over the issue. When Opposition members raised objections when the Minister was replying to the issue, Leader of the House and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam intervened to say his party has been protecting the interests of minorities for the past 45 years.

Dissatisfied by the AIADMK government’s response, the DMK MLAs, led by Mr. Stalin, staged a walkout. DMK’s allies - Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) also followed suit.

Meanwhile, AIADMK MLA M. Thamimun Ansari (Nagapattinam) also staged a walk out. Later in the day, Mr. Ansari staged a dharna outside the House.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/r8p04f/article31040624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MARTH-CAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-government-says-it-will-not-pass-resolution-against-caa-in-assembly/article31040625.ece
176,2020/03/11,Man-animal conflict debated in House,"The issue of elephants and wild boars causing loss of human lives and destroying crops, came up for debate in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Wednesday

The increasing incidence of wildlife, especially elephants and wild boars, straying out of forest areas and causing loss of human lives and destroying crops, came up for debate yet again in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on Wednesday. Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan said elephants from neighbouring States kept visiting.

When DMK legislator T.M. Anbarasan (Alandur) raised the issue in the House and claimed that wild animals were destroying crops in several areas, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami intervened to say Forest Department officials have been instructed to control the menace if there were any complaints in this regard.

DMK whip R. Sakkarapani (Oddanchatram) joined the debate to claim man-animal conflict was a major issue in his constituency adjoining the Western Ghats and urged the State government to remove the elephants to sanctuaries. Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan said steps were on to “chase” those elephants into other States.

DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan (Katpadi) narrated a personal experience about 15 elephants from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh visiting his farm in his constituency and destroying plantations. “On the first day, they destroyed some plants and I overlooked it and it continued on the second day too. On the third day, they destroyed a lemon tree, which I have been growing for few years,” pointed out the DMK leader.

Mr. Sreenivasan said in a light vein that only because Mr. Duraimurugan has been growing tasty fodder for elephant that they kept coming to his farm. “However, we are taking steps to stop the elephants,” the Minister said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/man-animal-conflict-debated-in-house/article31040058.ece
177,2020/03/11,"Plastic Ban: Cooperation needed from public and traders, says Tamil Nadu Chief Minister","Edappadi K. Palaniswami said officials from the Revenue, Environment and Forest Departments have been conducting raids at various places and have been confiscating banned plastic items

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said in the State Legislative Assembly on Wednesday that the general public and traders have to extend their cooperation in the implementation of the ban against single-use disposable plastic across the State.

The State government has been implementing the ban against 14 specific plastic products since January 2019 and it was “not easy”, he said, while replying to DMK legislator T.M. Anbarasan (Alandur), who raised the issue in the House.

The CM said that officials from the Revenue, Environment and Forest Departments have been conducting raids at various places and have been confiscating banned plastic from their premises. Environment Minister K.C. Karuppanan said about 1,339 tonnes of banned plastic have been recovered from traders during inspections and fines to the tune of ₹6.06 crore had been imposed on them within a year.

When Mr. Anbarasan claimed there was a shortage of staff to clear garbage and that forced some people to burn garbage illegally and dump them in water bodies in the vicinity, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani said clearance of garbage was a massive exercise as about 19,000 tonnes garbage was generated across the State every day.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jcx2rk/article31039979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MARTH-EDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plastic-ban-cooperation-needed-from-public-and-traders-says-tamil-nadu-chief-minister/article31039980.ece

In view of the threat posed by COVID-19, DMK president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday announced the postponement of the party’s general council meeting to elect the general secretary and the treasurer.

The meeting had originally been slated for March 29.

Mr. Stalin told the Assembly that his party had cancelled all programmes till March 31, and urged the Tamil Nadu government to take all necessary measures to tackle the threat posed by the coronavirus disease.

Calling upon the government to set up quarantine facilities near airports, he stressed the need for involving private hospitals and laboratories in the testing of patients with symptoms of the disease.

“The government should fix the rates for testing for the benefit of the poor. We should set up quarantine facilities in suburban areas and near the district headquarters hospitals on a war-footing,” he said.

Mr. Stalin also requested the government to provide masks and hand sanitisers to government doctors and nurses who, he said, were risking their lives to treat patients. “Precautionary measures should be taken in prisons and police stations. The traffic police should be provided with adequate protective gear,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/coronavirus-dmk-general-council-meet-postponed/article31095932.ece
179,2020/03/11,LPG delivery men admit to overcharging by agencies,"The PIL petitioner alleged that some of the delivery men intimidated consumers and take away additional money forcibly.

An association of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinder delivery men has approached the Madras High Court conceding that its members do charge more than the bill amount from consumers because agencies which employ them do not part with delivery charges added to the total bill amount.

When a public interest litigation petition filed against overcharging of consumers by the delivery men came up for hearing before a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy, a lawyer representing Tamil Nadu LPG Delivery Men’s Association told the court that it wanted to get itself impleaded.

The advocate said both consumers as well as delivery men were “actually victims” and that it was the LPG agencies which swindle the delivery charge collected from every consumer along with the price of the gas by including it in the bill. He said oil companies must make sure that the charges were paid promptly to the delivery men.

He alleged that most of the LPG agencies, spread across the State, do not even pay monthly salary or daily wages or any kind of wages for that matter to the delivery men and expect the latter to fend for themselves by charging over and above the bill amount from every consumer to whom the cylinders were delivered.

On the other hand, counsel appearing for the oil companies said the contracts entered between them and the agencies clearly state that the delivery men should be paid wages as per the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act of 1948.

They also said a mechanism was in place to lodge complaints regarding overcharging from consumers. The judges directed the oil companies to come up with a concrete solution to the problem within two weeks. The judges said a mechanism should be in place to ensure that charges were paid to delivery men.

In his affidavit, the PIL petitioner M. Logarangan, a doctor from Annanur in Avadi had claimed that the delivery men fleece from anywhere between ₹20 and ₹100 more than the bill amount from each consumer by citing the physical strain they undergo to transport the cylinders from the agencies and then carry them from their vehicles to the residence of consumers.

He also alleged that some of the delivery men intimidated consumers and take away additional money forcibly. “They abuse the customer and most of the time, the women and the elderly at home bear the brunt,” he said and accused them of even going to the extent of removing the washer from the cylinders, leading to gas leak, if the consumers refuse to pay more.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lpg-delivery-men-admit-to-overcharging-by-agencies/article31035475.ece

181,2020/03/11,High Court allows anti-Citizenship Amendment Act meeting in Thoothukudi,"Taking cognisance of the fact that the petitioner was implicated in a false case after he sought permission to conduct the event, the court said the rejection of permission was in violation of his fundamental rights.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday granted permission for a public meeting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Thoothukudi on March 13.

The court was hearing a petition filed by A. Kidar Bisme, Thoothukudi district secretary of the Tamilaga Valvurimai Katchi, who sought permission to hold the meeting after the police refused to grant it.

Justice G.R. Swaminathan imposed a set of conditions. The court allowed the petitioner to conduct the meeting at V.V.D. Signal from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. with a maximum of 750 people. The organiser would ensure traffic was not affected. The court allowed a stage to be erected and said the volume of the amplifiers should be kept within the permissible limit. The speakers at the event should not say anything that could incite violence.

During the course of the hearing, the State government did not object to the holding of the event. Taking cognisance of the fact that the petitioner was implicated in a false case after he sought permission to conduct the event, the court said the rejection of permission was in violation of his fundamental rights.

The State government’s contention — that holding the meeting in the said location would create problems — did not hold water, the court said, adding that certain conditions could be set out instead.

It was said that the petitioner had organised six such meetings so far.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-allows-anti-citizenship-amendment-act-meeting-in-thoothukudi/article31035429.ece
182,2020/03/11,HC restrains recording company from commercially exploiting songs by ‘Mahanadhi’ Shobana,"The Madras High Court has restrained Symphony Recording Company from commercially exploiting the Tamil devotional songs and English nursery rhymes sung by Carnatic musician K. Shobana alias ‘Mahanadhi’ Shobana, now 39, when she was just an 14-year-old in 1996.

Justice M.S. Ramesh granted the interim injunction after being prima facie satisfied with submissions of her counsel G. Harihara Arun that a document of declaration, termed as agreement, was signed when his client was a minor and hence it would be invalid in the eye of law.

Though the recording company had claimed it to be an agreement, a reading of the document showed that it was actually a declaration by a minor girl giving a right to the company to record and commercially exploit about five devotional songs and 37 English nursery rhymes, the judge said.

Since the document also does not mention any time period for assignment of the copyright, such a right reportedly accrued by the company would get extinguished automatically after the expiry of five years as per Section 19(5) of the Copyright Act, the judge added.

In her affidavit, the singer stated that she was trained by accomplished Carnatic musicians since she was five years of age and became famous at the age of 11 when she acted as a child artist in a national award winning Tamil movie Mahanidhi.

It was thereafter, the recording approached her for recording devotional songs such as Kandhashashthi Kavasam, Kandha Mugangal, Ninaikadha Neramillai, Azhagaana Pazhani and the popular English nursery rhymes in her voice and got two documents signed in 1995 and 1996.

Using those documents, the company was still making money from the albums by unauthorisedly downloading her latest photographs from her Facebook page and was refusing to disclose true accounts of the money made by the company so far using her songs, the plaintiff claimed.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-restrains-recording-company-from-commercially-exploiting-songs-by-mahanadhi-shobana/article31035216.ece
183,2020/03/11,Judge upholds election of DMK MLA from Tindivanam,"High Court dismisses first election petition filed after 2016 Assembly polls

The Madras High Court on Tuesday dismissed the first election petition that was filed in the court immediately after the 2016 Assembly polls in the State.

It rejected a plea by AIADMK candidate S.P. Rajendran to set aside the victory of DMK MLA P. Seethapathy in the Tindivanam (reserved) constituency by a margin of 101 votes on May 19, 2016.

Justice V. Bharathidasan agreed with senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the MLA, that an election could not be set aside purely on the basis of the oral testimonies of the election petitioner and his witnesses, unless there was clear and strong evidence compelling the court to accept the contention of the defeated candidate. In the present case, the litigant had failed to satisfy the court about the existence of any such strong circumstance, he said.

In his complaint, the AIADMK candidate claimed that on the day of counting, the MLA’s son, Senthil Murugan, handed over a bunch of postal ballot papers to the Returning Officer who, in turn, mixed them with the postal votes polled by the government servants. He claimed that the illegality was committed despite the objections raised by the counting agents of the petitioner as well as other candidates who had contested in the constituency.

His other claim was that an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) in a booth at Tagore Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Jayapuram had malfunctioned at the time of the counting of the votes. Yet, the officials went ahead and took it up for counting. Elaborating his claim, the litigant said that a total of 729 votes got polled in that booth as per the records, but at the time of counting, the figure displayed by the EVM was only 722 votes.

Answering both the contentions, Mr. Wilson said the allegation that the MLA’s son handed over additional ballot papers to the RO was an imaginary claim not backed by evidence. Though the petitioner had claimed to have raised objections, no such document was filed in court, he pointed out. He also stated that the entire process of the counting of postal ballots was carried out in the presence of the counting agents of all candidates, and their signatures were also obtained.

Discrepancy in figures

As regards the discrepancy in the total number of votes polled in a particular EVM, the senior counsel said it was common to have negligible differences between the number of votes recorded on paper and in the EVMs because some aged and ignorant people in rural areas may not have pressed the button on the EVMs properly at the time of registering their votes.

Even otherwise, a difference of just seven votes would not benefit the petitioner, he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/judge-upholds-election-of-dmk-mla-from-tindivanam/article31035182.ece
184,2020/03/11,Old-age pension norms relaxed,"Move means more people can get financial aid of ₹1,000

The Tamil Nadu government recently relaxed the guidelines for the grant of old-age pension (OAP) to eligible persons, in a move that is expected to allow more people to avail themselves of the monthly financial assistance of ₹1,000.

According to a communication from Commissioner for Revenue Administration J. Radhakrishnan to District Collectors across the State, amendments have been made to the Tamil Nadu Old Age Pension Rules.

With the amended guidelines, persons having fixed assets valued at less than ₹1 lakh are eligible to get the OAP. Earlier, the slab was ₹50,000.

The official communication defined a ‘destitute’ as a person without any income or source of income and owning fixed assets of less than ₹1 lakh in value, and who has no relatives of 20 years of age. The government has also decided to relax the guidelines further to make persons who have been assigned a free house eligible for OAP.

Rigid guidelines

A senior officer explained that certain rigid guidelines had prevented several genuine persons from getting OAP. “During our field trips to several areas, we realised that many genuine persons were not able to get OAP due to some restrictions,” he said. For instance, in some cases, elderly persons had an acre of barren land but earned no income from it, and were struggling to make ends meet.

“We realised that OAP was not being granted to them even though they are truly the needy,” he said. Even in cities like Chennai, those evicted from riverbanks, who were once allotted a house in slum board tenements, were not able to get OAP.

Currently, around 31 lakh people benefit from OAP granted by the Tamil Nadu government.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/old-age-pension-norms-relaxed/article31035163.ece
185,2020/03/11,Activists allege attempt to fix TNPCB appointment,"Group flags ‘problematic’ criteria favouring ‘a specific officer’

In a letter to the Chief Secretary and the Director of the DVAC, a group of civil society representatives has alleged irregularities and ‘match-fixing’ in the appointment of the member secretary of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.

They said the TNPCB had invited applications for the post of member secretary, and a perusal of the notification revealed that it contained several irregular and suspicious criteria that were not prescribed under the Water Act.

“We have reliably learnt from well-placed sources that the criteria have been introduced with high-level collusion, including from within the top bureaucracy in TNPCB and in the Government of Tamil Nadu, in order to favour a specific officer in TNPCB,” the group said.

They said complaints of corruption had been made out against the said officer, including during his tenure as District Environmental Engineer. “We have cross-verified both the suggestion that this notification has been drafted to specifically favour this individual and the allegations against the officer’s integrity with several sources,” they said in the letter.

They said several irregularities in the notification issued by the government stood out, such as the age limit of 55, which was not prescribed under the Water Act. A G.O. dated May 13, 2019, concerning the appointment, by nomination, of the chairperson and the member secretary, revealed that no such age limit had been prescribed, they added.

They also took issue with the criterion of 25 years of field experience to be nominated to the post of member secretary, pointing out that when read with the age-limit, even within the Board, it was meant to eliminate senior and more experienced engineers and all persons who had not served in the pollution control board.

The representatives — M.G. Devasahayam, I.A.S (Retd); S. Nagalsamy, I.A.A.S (Retd) and president, Makkal Paathai; Thomas Franco, advisor, All India Public Sector and Central Government Officers’ Confederation; G. Sundarrajan of Poovulagin Nanbargal; Jayaram Venkatesan, convenor, Arappor Iyakkam; and Nityanand Jayaraman of Chennai Solidarity Group — requested the officials to strike down the notification.

They requested the Chief Secretary to issue a fresh notification, excluding the two ‘problematic’ criteria, and to verify the complaints about the alleged conspiracy involving high-level officers to ‘match-fix’ the appointment process at TNPCB and take corrective action.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/activists-allege-attempt-to-fix-tnpcb-appointment/article31035143.ece

187,2020/03/11,‘Anna University Syndicate ignored Anandakumar Committee report’,"Panel was tasked with probing recruitment irregularities

The Anna University Syndicate, which favoured retaining the services of 135 teaching and non-teaching staff, who were appointed in gross violation of norms, ignored the recommendations of the Committee headed by IAS officer Anandakumar.

The committee was the last to be set up by the Higher Education Department to probe irregularities in the recruitment made in the erstwhile five Anna Universities of Technology, which were established during the DMK regime.

The Syndicate had based its decision on the recommendations of two other panels — the Priya Balakrishnan Committee and the Muthusamy Committee, which had submitted their findings prior to the constitution of the Anandakumar Committee, sources in the university said on Tuesday.

The sources said that at a meeting last year, Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa had placed before the Syndicate the findings of all the committees. However, the Syndicate selectively chose to go by the recommendations of the Priya Balakrishnan Committee and the Muthusamy Committee and recommend that the 135 persons be retained.

While all the committee reports were official, not all of them came up with the correct findings.

The CCS and Jangaon Police on Tuesday arrested a 35-year-old woman thief and seized gold jewellery worth around ₹44 lakh from her.

The accused was identified as Karreddula Lalitha alias Padma of Vaikuntapuram under Kavali mandal in Nellore. After her husband’s death, Lalitha started working as a daily wage labourer to make a living. But soon she got used to a lavish lifestyle and wanted to make a quick buck. She started robbing people since 2007, police said.

194,2020/03/11,Piped gas supply in old Medak soon,"Torrent Gas entrusted with responsibility to supply CNG, PNG in Sangareddy, Medak and Siddipet

House-to-house piped gas supply will be a reality soon at the district headquarters.

To cover 68 mandals

Torrent Gas Private Limited has been authorised by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) for establishing and operating City Gas Distribution (CGD) network, including providing Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Piped Natural Gas (PNG), in the geographical area of Sangareddy, Medak and Siddipet districts covering 68 mandals spread across an area of 10,821 square kilometres.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao had announced that piped gas supply would start soon.

2-BHK houses first

Initially, gas would be supplied to the yet-to-be inaugurated 2,500 double bedroom houses coming up in the outskirts of the district headquarters in addition to two colonies. A pipeline is being laid for about 11 kilometres for this purpose. Gas would be supplied through the cascade filling system till the pipeline laying from Shamirpet to Siddipet covering about 80 kilometres was completed. So far, only about 20 kilometres have been completed.

More CNG stations

“Torrent has committed more than ₹1,300 crore in the next 10 years for the project and is working to connect more than 3,00,000 households, set up more than 54 CNG stations and connect various industries and commercial establishments across the geographical area. The first two CNG stations; one in Siddipet and another in Vantimamidi, have commenced and another 10 CNG stations in Siddipet, Sangareddy and Medak, are expected to be commissioned by March,” Torrent Gas vice-president D. Madhukar Rao said.

“Torrent Gas is committed to making CNG and PNG widely available at an affordable price to the citizens of Siddipet, Sangareddy and Medak. The widespread availability of natural gas and CNG will reduce pollution. It will also act as a catalyst and provide major boost to the socio-economic development in the region,” said director of Torrent Gas Deepak Dalal, during the inauguration of CNG stations at Siddipet.

“Piped Natural Gas is widely considered a clean and green fuel. When compared to LPG, PNG brings many distinct advantages to the consumers such as no burden of storage space for cylinders, no headache of advance bookings, dry-outs and replacement, reasonably priced, offered on pay after use basis with safe and reliable supply. These advantages make PNG a compelling choice, which is highly convenient, economical and efficient,” said Mr. Madhukar Rao.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/k4uqax/article31035027.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-PIPED-GAS-SIDDIPET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/piped-gas-supply-in-old-medak-soon/article31035011.ece

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has decided to organise door-to-door campaign explaining people about the ‘ill effects’ of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed census relating to the National Population Register.

The campaign will be taken up between March 16 and 23 and it forms part of the CPI (M)’s nationwide protests against the proposed moves of the Central government to introduce NPR data collection across the country soon. The party had been demanding that the Centre withdraw its decision to club the NPR data collection with the data of Census 2020-21.

Addressing a preparatory meeting about the party’s course of action on the issue, CPI (M) polit bureau member B. V. Raghavulu said the CAA, NPR and NRC exercise started by the Centre was an attack on the Constitution and the secular fabric of the country. It was a first step towards usurping the rights of the people guaranteed in the Constitution.

The government’s move in bringing the Citizenship related issues to the fore at a time when the Supreme Court was yet to deliver its verdict on the petitions relating to reservations exposed it’s intentions. There was already a steep decline in the budgetary allocations for welfare sectors and the government was bent on giving doles to corporate sector going by the concessions proposed to be given to them, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/u59hzm/article31034907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11BVRAGHAVULU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cpi-m-door-to-door-campaign-on-caa/article31034908.ece
197,2020/03/11,"Kari, an exhibition of photographs by Praveen Mohandas in Thiruvananthapuram, zooms in on elephants","The snaps, taken at Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, celebrates elephants in the wild even as it ponders on the future of these creatures

Huge trees with leafy branches stretching towards the sky form an arch-like canopy resembling a cathedral while a herd of elephants, minuscule in comparison with the grand matriarchal trees, seem to be nestling under its protective cover, a symbol of the deep symbiotic existence in a jungle.

One of the standout exhibits of ‘Kari’, an exhibition of 15 black-and-white photographs on the elephant by architect-photographer Praveen Mohandas, is an artistic interpretation of the life of elephants and “its past, present and future”.

Kari, an exhibition of photographs on wild elephants by Praveen P Mohandas | Photo Credit: S Mahinsha

Heavy, deep tyre markings on a riverbed seem to define the margins for a pug mark next to the large footprint of an elephant in another photograph that hints at the grim future of wildlife on our planet.

Praveen’s frames play up the elephant’s size and strength and its intelligence even as it mourns the fate of elephants shackled by man. His pictures are not of caparisoned elephants or those at work but of the jumbos in the wild: playing, feeding, striding and resting.

Story of survival

Shot in the Jim Corbett National Park, Uttarakhand, the photographs have been divided into three based on “the elephant’s size, memory and destiny”. “Kari in Malayalam can also mean elephant. It also refers to the colour of the animal. Will future generations be able to see this magnificent creature in the wild? Man’s intrusion into its homelands has put its life in peril,” says Praveen. The first section highlights the dimension of the largest mammal on land, its unique physical features and its life in the grasslands of the Park. “The elephant’s trunk, which is used for feeding and as a tool of communication, is merely one of its special features. So, I have highlighted that in a couple of snaps,” says Thrissur-based Praveen.

A photograph depicting a trunk of an adult elephant resting on a calf is an eloquent one that pays tribute to its maternal instincts while another photograph shows a mighty tusker with only one tusk. Stained and chipped with age, it is a magnificent tusk that evokes questions about the missing tusk. “Was it broken in a duel or stolen by poachers? Is it a struggle for him to live with one tusk? Or was it broken in a man-animal encounter?” wonders Praveen.

Over the years, Praveen has seen the effects of man’s intervention on the natural habitat of the animal. Showing a stark photograph of a reflection of a herd walking beside a shrinking river with its exposed river bed, he says that he recalls a time when the river was in spate before a dam on its upper course curbed its vitality. “And it is their search for fodder and water that forces them to come close to settlements on the fringe of forests. Immediately, it is termed as man-animal conflicts and, as we know, it is always the four-legged creatures that get the raw deal,” says Praveen.

The section termed ‘memory’ zooms into the elephant’s ability to live together in the herd and fend for each other. Calves gambol while adults walk together companionably with the herd. In the last section, which Praveen calls ‘destiny, concerns on existence’, is the only installation of the show. Clanking of chains, chatter and barked instructions signify the majestic animal’s life in captivity. “The viewers’ reflection on the glass-framed visuals symbolises the human contribution to the destiny of an animal no less important than us”, states a printed leaflet put up by Praveen to explain the gist of his snaps.

The exhibition is on till March 16 at Longtime Art Gallery, Thiruvananthapuram.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/q99hwi/article31040804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVFPHOTOEXHIBITION1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/kari-an-exhibition-of-photographs-zooms-in-on-the-elephants/article31040806.ece

The Mizoram government said there was enough supply of essential commodities to last three months. The State government had in order to prevent the entry of people infected with COVID-19, sealed its borders, barring a few entry-exit points, on Monday, triggering panic-buying.

Explained | How is India containing COVID-19?

This has allayed fears of scarcity of essential commoditiesafter the sealing of its borders due to the panic-buying triggered by the COVID-19 scare.The government also initiated a probe against a social media post that accentuated the panic. The post — the day the sealing of the international and inter-State borders was announced — claimed that a COVID-19-infected man had entered the State from Assam.

“They (people) have been made to realise that sealing of borders does not mean stopping the transportation of goods,” said Lalhriatzuali Ralte, Mizoram’s Director of Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs told The Hindu from State capital Aizawl.

Mizoram shares borders with Assam, Manipur and Tripura, and with Bangladesh and Myanmar. The State government had, in order to prevent the entry of people infected with COVID-19, sealed the borders barring a few entry-exit points.

Temporary scarcity

But the announcement, coupled with the social media post, led to panic buying and temporary scarcity of commodities from local markets as people stocked up on rice, salt, cooking oil and other essentials.

“Things are returning to normal after our officials held meetings in the districts and convinced the people that we have enough food grains, fuel, cooking gas and other essentials to last three months. They have also been made to realise that sealing of borders does not mean stopping the transportation of goods,” Lalhriatzuali Ralte, Mizoram’s Director of Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs told The Hindu from State capital Aizawl.

Aizawl district’s Superintendent of Police C. Lalruaia said the police filed a first information report against the social media post that caused more panic than the sealing of borders. “Our IT cell is trying to find the person responsible for creating this fake scare about an infected man having come to Mizoram to spread the virus,” he said.

Health authorities in Mizoram have so far placed 67 persons who returned from foreign countries on home-quarantine.

199,2020/03/11,241 deaths in Haryana over 2 years involved cattle,"Fatehabad district tops the list with 40 deaths, followed by Ambala with 38: RTI

As many as 241 people have lost their lives in accidents involving stray cattle in Haryana over the past two years, a reply to a RTI application has revealed.

According to the information furnished by Public Information Officer, Office of Director General of Police, Haryana, 241 people across the State have lost their lives in accidents involving stray cattle from January 1, 2018 to March 2, 2020.

Among the 23 districts, Fatehabad tops the list with 40 deaths followed by Ambala (38), Kaithal (23) and Sirsa (23). However, Gurugram, Rohtak, Narnaul, Nuh and Jind did not witness a single case of accident pertaining to stray animals.

Panipat-based RTI activist P.P. Kapoor said 241 deaths in accidents due to stray animals were as per the police records, but the actual figure could be much larger. He said there could also be a large number of people injured and maimed in accidents involving stray animals.

He criticised the Haryana government, saying the budget of Gau Seva Aayog had increased manifold from ₹45 lakh to ₹30 crore during the BJP rule, and 332 police personnel, including 18 inspectors, were part of the cow protection squad, but the cows were dying in gaushals in large numbers and the people were losing their lives on the roads due to accidents involving the stray animals.

Demanding to know as to who was responsible for the death of innocent people on the roads due to stray animals, Mr. Kapoor said the government must compensate the families of the deceased. He said the stray animals were also responsible for destroying the crops of the farmers.

‘Failed campaign’

Mr. Kapoor said the State government had set two deadlines — August 15, 2018 and January 26, 2019 — to make Haryana stray cattle free, but the campaign failed miserably due to lack of political will and failure of the officials to fulfil their duty.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/qnfwer/article24606668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DelhiCITYRegiGJA4FP5UI2jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/241-deaths-in-haryana-over-2-years-involved-cattle/article31043553.ece

However, Mr. Akhilesh Yadav signalled the supporters to stop the sloganeering during the programme attended by party patriarch Mulayam Singh, Ram Gopal Yadav, Dharmendra Yadav and Tejpratap Singh Yadav on Tuesday.

Mr. Shivpal Yadav had ended his 26-year-old association with the Samajwadi Party after falling out with Akhilesh and cousin Ram Gopal Yadav in 2018. He had formed his own outfit the Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia).

‘Understanding with SP’

“There can be an understanding with the Samajwadi Party about seats for the 2022 State polls. The election symbol will, however, be ours,” he had told reporters.

Speaking on this occasion, Akhilesh Yadav said BJP leaders had changed their (Holi) programmes due to coronavirus but SP workers did not fear any virus and the crowd present there indicated this.

201,2020/03/11,Dismantling of Sheikh’s legacy questioned,"Throwing out stalwarts of Kashmir’s political history is unacceptable: Drabu

Former Jammu & Kashmir Finance Minister and J&K Bank chairman Haseeb Drabu on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on the BJP for dropping the name of National Conference founder Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah from local awards and buildings. All the regional parties, including the NC, the Peoples Democratic Party ) and the CPI(M), have also questioned the move.

“It is epochalism being expressed through place-names to reflect the new Indian politics in its political ideology, behavioural values and, of course, historical figures. While restoring “their” great men in the new narratives of India, throwing the stalwarts of Kashmir’s political history down Orwell’s memory hole is unacceptable.

‘Larger agenda’

“Such changes have a much larger agenda: snap the every day’s historical connection so as to erase the memory of the past. The toponymic changes are used as a tool to disrupt the ethno-cultural continuity of Kashmiris which is the core of a historical identity. In reality, it is an assault that will, in the long run, prove to be more debilitating and damaging than abolishing the compromised constitutional provisions,” warned Mr. Drabu, who drafted the basis of an alliance of the PDP with the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2015 to rule J&K, in a column written in a local daily.

202,2020/03/11,Petition for ban on pellet guns dismissed,"Security forces have to necessarily use force in self-defence: J&K High Court

Dismissing a public interest litigation seeking a ban on use of pellet shotguns on protesters in J&K, the High Court on Wednesday observed that security forces “have to necessarily use force in their self-defence”.

Dismissing the PIL, Justices Dhiraj Singh Thakur and Ali Mohammad Magrey observed: “Almost every day, in the guise of protests, security personnel, their camps and police stations were targeted by unruly crowds. If the protest is not peaceful and security persons are attacked by huge and violent mobs, they have to necessarily use force in their self-defence and for protecting public property.”

The two judges underlined that it was not a case where compensation was being sought or claimed for wrong doing of any security force personnel or for violating any fundamental right of any citizen. “...But for discharge of public duty by such security force personnel who were being attacked by violent mobs during that period. Since the government has discharged its obligation, nothing more needs to be done in this PIL,” they observed.

‘Misuse of guns’

The PIL was filed by the J&K High Court Bar Association in 2016, when around 4,000 protesters suffered pellet injuries and around 100 persons were blinded and seven deaths were reported due to the pellet shotgun. It called for filing cases against those who misused the pellet guns “for causing unlawful bodily injury and deprivation of eye sight”.

Having considered the matter, the court said it was of the opinion that so far as constitutional tort was concerned, the State had fulfilled its obligation in as much as they have made ex-gratia payments to most of the injured persons.

“Having regard to the ground situation prevailing, the Ministry of Home Affairs has already constituted a committee of experts for exploring other alternative to pellet guns... We are not inclined to prohibit the use of pellet guns in rare and extreme situations,” the court observed.

The court decision has come as a shock to the Kashmir-based Pellet Victim’s Association (PVA), which has been holding a campaign for banning the shotguns.

“Many youths can’t see. There was need to take strong note on the use of pellet guns. Pellet and other deadly weapons are used against unarmed civilians, including students,” a PVA spokesman said.

Talking to The Hindu, on condition of anonymity, a pellet victim from Pulwama said: “The court has failed to create any deterrence or even question the wanton use of pellet guns in Kashmir in the past. Blinding people and doling out compensation is not justice. The least the court could have done was make the security forces accountable for the large-scale injuries and fixing responsibility.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sfabnd/article31043517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11-PELLET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/petition-for-ban-on-pellet-guns-dismissed/article31043518.ece

Pankaj Chaturvedi, spokesman of Mr. Scindia, said the 22 MLAs would vote for the BJP in case of a floor test. “The number of such MLAs will reach 40,” he said.

The Congress office bustled with activity, as leaders flew the MLAs to Jaipur in the morning. Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza said 96 MLAs, including four Independents, were flown out, but party sources kept the number down. Two BSP MLAs and an SP MLA, who had earlier backed the government, were not seen boarding the flight.

Former Urban Development and Housing Minister Jaivardhan Singh said, “When the Congress takes the floor test, we will prove our majority. It is unfortunate Mr. Scindia has left the party despite appeals for his return.”

Former Forest Minister Umang Singhar said the MLAs had been huddled together to “contain the situation”. “The way the BJP has tried to lure our MLAs, they won’t be able to repeat that ever again in Madhya Pradesh. Just wait and watch. Moreover, our MLAs in Bengaluru are still with the Congress, their hearts are still with us.”

Congress MLA Sajjan Singh Verma, who has been asked, along with MLA Govind Singh, to reach out to the rebel MLAs in Bengaluru, returned to Bhopal in the morning. He said, “They are discontent with Mr. Scindia for giving precedence to his own political ambitions... They said they were brought to Bengaluru under duress. We are in touch with them.”

Refuting the claim, Mr. Chaturvedi in the evening released the video testimonial of 20 MLAs, reportedly camped in Bengaluru, reiterating their support for Mr. Scindia.

Revenue and Transport Minister Govind Singh Rajput said the MLAs had reached Bengaluru of their own accord and not under duress. “A misconception is being spread by Congress leaders that they are in touch with them. All are with Mr. Scindia and are happy with his decision taken in national interest. In fact, those who have gone to Jaipur are in touch with us...,” he said.

Women and Child Development Minister Imarti Devi said Mr. Scindia had taken a wise decision to move the MLAs out of Bhopal. She alleged that the Congress had disrespected Mr. Scindia to such an extent that even the BJP did not go. “Mr. Nath [Chief Minister Kamal Nath] has never listened to us, and no work has been done in my region. We are fed up with the party.”

Health Minister Tulsiram Silawat said all the 22 rebel MLAs backed every move of Mr. Scindia. “We were with him, are with him and will be with him.”

Congress media coordinator Narendra Saluja said it was clear from the sullen faces in the videos that the MLAs were speaking under duress.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yjz32y/article31042988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12CHOUHAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-crisis-scindias-entry-will-strengthen-bjp-says-chouhan/article31042989.ece
207,2020/03/11,Madhya Pradesh crisis | Congress lodges M.P. MLAs in Rajasthan resorts,"Over 90 legislators arrived in Jaipur in a chartered flight; they were received by Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot

Amid the political crisis in the aftermath of Jyotiraditya Scindia's exit from the Congress, over 90 MLAs of the party from Madhya Pradesh arrived by a chartered flight at the Sanganer airport here on Wednesday.

The legislators were then ferried to two luxury resorts near Jaipur, where they are likely to stay put for the next few days.

Two senior leaders — Mukul Wasnik and Harish Rawat — also arrived here to protect them from horse-trading attempts. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, accompanied by government chief whip Mahesh Joshi, received the guests at the airport.

The MLAs were taken in three buses, escorted by police vehicles, to the private resorts about 20 km away from the city on the Jaipur-Delhi national highway. Mr. Gehlot and other leaders interacted with the legislators at one of the resorts. Both the resorts were out of bounds for the public.

'Murder of democracy'

Talking to presspersons at the airport, Mr. Gehlot said the entire nation was watching how democracy was murdered in the neighbouring State. “In which direction is the BJP taking the nation?” he said.

Mr. Gehlot alleged that the BJP was using the worst kinds of tactics, including threats and intimidation, to destabilise democratically elected governments. “They have amassed huge amounts of money...

208,2020/03/11,"Jammu and Kashmir High Court not for ban on use of pellet guns, dismisses PIL plea","‘If the protest is not peaceful, security persons are attacked by violent mobs, they have to use force in self defence’

Dismissing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition seeking a ban on use of pellet shotguns on protesters, the Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Wednesday said the security forces “have to necessarily use force in their self defence.”

Justices Dhiraj Singh Thakur and Ali Mohammad Magrey said: “Almost every day, in the guise of protests, the security personnel, their camps and police stations were targeted by unruly crowds. If the protest is not peaceful and the security persons are attacked by huge and violent mobs, they have to necessarily use force in their self defence and for protecting public property.”

The judges underlined that it is not a case where compensation is being sought or claimed for wrongdoing of any security force personnel or for violating any fundamental right of any citizen. “... but for discharge of public duty by such security force personnel who were being attacked by violent mobs during that period. Since the government has discharged its obligation, nothing more needs to be done in this PIL,” the Bench observed.

100 blinded

The PIL plea was filed by the J&K High Court Bar Association in 2016, when around 4,000 protesters suffered pellet injuries and around 100 persons were blinded and seven deaths were reported due to the use of pellet shotgun. It called for filing cases against those who misused the pellet guns “for causing unlawful bodily injury and deprivation of eyesight.”

The court said it was of the opinion that regarding the constitutional tort, the state had fulfilled its obligation, inasmuch as it had made ex gratia payments to most of the injured persons.

“Having regard to the ground situation prevailing, the Ministry of Home Affairs has already constituted a Committee of Experts for exploring other alternative to pellet guns... We are not inclined to prohibit the use of pellet guns in rare and extreme situations,” the court observed.

PVA shocked

The court decision has come as a shock for the Kashmir-based Pellet Victims’ Association (PVA), which has been holding a campaign for banning shotguns. “Many youths can’t see. There was a need to take a strong note on the use of pellet guns. Pellet and other deadliest weapons are used against unarmed civilians, including students,” a PVA spokesman said.

Talking to The Hindu, a pellet victim from Pulwama said, “The court has failed to create any deterrence or even question the wanton use of pellet guns in Kashmir in the past. Blinding people and doling out compensation is not justice. The least the court could have done was making the security forces accountable for the large scale injuries and fixing the responsibility. The judgment has dashed our hopes to see an end to use of pellet guns in J&K,” said the victim.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hvcz94/article31041564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11IN-PELLET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jammu-and-kashmir-high-court-dismisses-plea-seeking-ban-on-use-of-pellet-guns-by-security-forces/article31041482.ece
209,2020/03/11,"Go for peace deal with or without NSCN-IM, Naga groups tell Centre","‘Working Committee of the Naga National Political Groups and the Centre can sign the agreement any day because it is the desire of the Nagas’

A conglomerate of seven Naga extremist groups have asked the Indian government to sign the prolonged peace deal at the earliest, with or without the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN), also known as the Isak-Muivah faction of NSCN.

Several rounds of talks between the Centre and the NSCN-IM since the latter declared truce in 1997 have proved inconclusive despite the signing of the nebulous Framework Agreement in August 2015. The ambit of the “Naga political issue” was expanded two years later to include the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) comprising outfits that have been rivals of the NSCN-IM.

The Hindu explains | Why have the Naga peace talks stumbled?

After three days of discussions with Nagaland Governor R. N. Ravi, the NNPGs on Tuesday evening advised going for the final agreement even if the NSCN-IM refuses to come on board. The NSCN-IM has been adamant about getting a separate flag and constitution as part of the peace deal.

“The Working Committee of the NNPGs and the Centre can sign the agreement any day because it is the desire of the Nagas. We have distributed the status paper among our people, which is acceptable to them,” a leader of the NNPGs said.

Common ground

The Centre reportedly wants all the Naga stakeholder groups to find common ground before the final agreement is signed. In a statement on February 27, the NSCN-IN reiterated its demand for a separate flag and constitution, but the NNPGs have favoured working on these aspects after signing the peace deal.

A few days ago, Mr. Ravi had accused the NSCN-IM of delaying the signing of the accord with their demand.

One of the goals of the NSCN-IM has been the creation of “Greater Nagalim”, a homeland comprising all Naga-inhabited areas in the northeast. The Centre has assured Nagaland’s neighbours — Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur — that their territorial integrity would be protected.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mv0l55/article30769344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DECRAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/go-for-peace-deal-with-or-without-nscn-im-advise-other-naga-groups/article31041132.ece

218,2020/03/11,Maharashtra Cabinet may discuss IPL today,"With confirmed cases of COVID-19 rising, the Maharashtra Cabinet is likely to discuss the postponement of Indian Premier League (IPL) matches scheduled to be played in the State.

While Health Minister Rajesh Tope said in Nagpur that “events like IPL can always be organised later,” the issue is likely to figure in Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting.

The State government is understood to be contemplating writing to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the parent body of IPL, regarding the same. Mumbai is scheduled to host at least eight matches, including the season-opener on March 29 and the final on May 24, during the T20 cricket league’s 13th edition.

While the government is pondering over the possibility of postponement of the IPL, Mumbai is already witnessing another cricket tournament, which is attracting large turnouts. Legends of the game, including the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Brett Lee and Jonty Rhodes have been participating in the Road Safety World Series. The five-nation veterans’ T20 league, being played in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Pune, is incidentally an initiative of the State transport department.

“The issue is important and we are monitoring it. The Assembly is in session and in case of any decision, the House will be informed first,” said a senior Health Department official.

A senior minister of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, said certain sanctions are inevitable to curb the spread of COVID-19. “We have to ensure the safety of people, and impose some restrictions to avoid the spread. The issue might be discussed in the Cabinet meeting and we will come to a decision,” he said.

The Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) however is continuing with preparations for the marquee clash between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings on March 29.

“As of now, we have received no directive either from the State government or the BCCI,” said Sanjay Naik, MCA secretary. “We have continued with our preparation and are confident of a good show come IPL.”

219,2020/03/11,"People from north eastern States face racism, ‘Chinese’ slur in Pune","Punekars point to north-easterners as carriers of coronavirus, taunt them in public places

The fears surrounding COVID-19 have fuelled an old prejudice against people from the north eastern States who are living and working in Pune. The label ‘Chinese’ attached to them now comes with added xenophobia, insensitivity and verbal attacks in public places.

Last week, Hmingtei Chhangte, a working professional from Mizoram, was subjected to humiliation in Reliance Mart after a shopper in the same aisle created a ruckus, saying she could be a carrier of COVID-19.

Narrating the ordeal in a Facebook post, Ms. Chhangte said the woman covered her face each time she passed by her and when Ms. Chhangte asked her what the matter was, the woman began to scream and shout, gesticulating that Ms. Chhangte had been ‘infected’.

While the staff intervened to calm the woman down, Ms. Chhangte, who has been living and working in Pune city for a decade, left the store feeling insecure and disheartened.

“We have received at least 10 reports of racist or xenophobic incidents from people from north eastern States, because of their features. Women, especially, are very uncomfortable venturing out of home. They face ‘coronavirus’ taunts while going out to buy groceries or even taking children to a park,” said S.K. Souriio, former president of the North East Community of Pune. At times, those creating a ruckus do not even have the courtesy to listen to the explanations and protestations of people from the north east who say they are not Chinese citizens, but Indians, he said.

In another case, a woman, who did not wish to be named, said she was startled to hear cries of ‘Coronavirus aa gaya’ (coronavirus has come) when she went to purchase a protective face mask in the city’s Sanghvi area.

“It is our humble request to Pune’s citizens to desist from passing such racist comments or taunts, which hurt members from the north eastern States. This is a virus that is afflicting people of all races and communities. North, South, East or West, no part of the globe is secure from its scourge,” Mr. Souriio said.

Mr. Souriio also said they had met the Pune Police Commissioner and the Deputy Collector to apprise them of such incidents.

K. Pritam Singh, who hails from Manipur and is general secretary of Association of Manipuri Diaspora said there were cases of students from the north-eastern States being branded as ‘coronavirus’ in jest. “At times, even so-called ‘educated’ people take potshots at us while there have been incidents where shopkeepers or other people call us ‘Chinese’ in public places like trains and bus stations. While we do not want to accuse anyone, we just demand a little sensitivity in these grave times,” he said.

Another professional, who works at a multinational company, said people from the North East faced prejudice at the best of times, making them feel alienated from the mainstream even though they were Indian citizens.

221,2020/03/11,"Albie Morkel, Jonty Rhodes deliver for South Africa","Albie Morkel (54 not out off 30 balls) and Jonty Rhodes (53 not out off 40) helped South Africa defeat West Indies by six wickets with nine balls to spare in the UnAcademy Road Safety World Series match at the D.Y. Patil stadium on Wednesday.

West Indies scored a modest 143 for eight in 20 overs, with Paul Harris taking three wickets for SA. The Proteas chased down the target with ease to start on a winning note in the five-nation series.

Pune games called off

Four league games at Pune have been called off while two matches, scheduled to be held in Navi Mumbai will be held behind closed doors.

According to information from sources, this is in accordance with the Maharashtra government’s decision to cancel all public gatherings to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Fans have the option of keeping track of the action via live telecast.

The public attraction for this T20 event is the presence of crowd-pullers Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara, Jonty Rhodes, Virender Sehwag, Chaminda Vaas and Lance Klusener, to name a few.

India, captained by Tendulkar, played in front of packed stands at the Wankhede stadium (against West Indies) and the D.Y. Patil stadium (versus Sri Lanka), winning both games.

The scores: West Indies 143/8 in 20 overs (Darren Ganga 31, Ricardo Powell 30, Paul Harris 3/21) lost to South Africa 146/4 in 18.3 overs (Albie Morkel 54 n.o., Jonty Rhodes 53 n.o.).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/egrr4j/article31043638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12MORLEL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/albie-morkel-jonty-rhodes-deliver-for-south-africa/article31043639.ece
222,2020/03/11,"Rolling back the years, Irfan Pathan style","Irfan Pathan rolled back the years on Tuesday evening, with his quick-fire 57 off 31 deliveries to guide India Legends home in a rather close UnAcademy Road Satefy World Series fixture against Sri Lanka Legends.

Coming in at a time, when India Legends was five wickets down, chasing 139, Pathan had a challenging job on hand. But the former India pace ace — known for his big-hitting, coming lower down the order — held his nerve and crafted his innings with six boundaries and three sixes.

And as he walked back to pavilion, the first thing Pathan asked his team-mates was, “Is Sachin (Tendulkar) paaji happy?”

After all, having played with Tendulkar for long, Pathan knows how particular Tendulkar is about every aspect of the game. “When you play with a legend like Tendulkar, he ensures that every match is played seriously. We have to respect whatever paaji says and we follow that. He wants us give our best,” Pathan said.

Being the captain of India Legends, Tendulkar, obviously, was happy with the way his team fought back. “After the game, I had a word with paaji, and he was very happy. That was a very special moment for me,” Pathan said. A seasoned campaigner, Pathan retired from all forms of the game in January this year. But he returned to action after quite a while, and admitted that it was a bit challenging to get into the shape.

“We had very little time for training. There were hardly four sessions before the first game,” Pathan said. “I was in Russia before coming for the tournament, so in that extreme conditions, I tried bowling a couple of overs. It was snowing, but I wanted to get going. When you haven’t bowled for a year, it gets challenging.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5o8zds/article31043190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12PATHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rolling-back-the-years-irfan-pathan-style/article31043191.ece
223,2020/03/11,"Rahane backs shadow tours, but with a rider","‘It will be better if we can get similar conditions as in internationals’

At a time when shadow tours ahead of India’s overseas trips clashing with the domestic cricket season have been severely criticised by legendary cricketers, Ajinkya Rahane, the Test vice-captain, has supported the initiative, albeit with a rider.

Important

“I feel it is important to have a shadow tour because you get to know the conditions really well.

“The only thing I feel is the wickets that we get in shadow games are completely different than what we get in international games,” Rahane said, on the sidelines of an event to announce his investment in MeraKisan, an organic farming initiative of Mahindra Group.

“That’s an area but you cannot control that when you go overseas. But I feel if we can get similar conditions that we get in international matches, that will be better (for shadow tours).

“The game that I played for India-A in New Zealand, that was a complete flat wicket. We lost three or four wickets in two days, so that’s an area to improve.”

Need for balance

With the BCCI having started organising shadow tours ahead of major overseas assignments for the last two years, it has resulted in the Ranji Trophy being depleted, let alone internationals.

Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has expressed his disapproval of the shadow tour idea.

However, Rahane said there has to be a “balance” between shadow tours and domestic cricket.

“You have got to balance it out. Yes, domestic cricket is really important. As a Test player, if you get time to play domestic cricket, you should play domestic cricket but I still feel, it’s important to have a shadow tour ahead of an overseas Test series. You get used to the conditions. Jet lag is also a factor. Seven and a half hour difference (with New Zealand time zone),” he said.

“Those small small things, getting used to weather, it’s also important. I think the BCCI has done a really good job by starting shadow tours. But whenever I can, I always give importance to Ranji Trophy cricket. I think players should play (Ranji) whenever possible.”

Despite playing three Ranji games, then having a training stint at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru followed by an appearance for India-A in New Zealand, Rahane could garner only 91 runs in four innings in New Zealand.

Unperturbed

But the seasoned pro stressed he was neither worried for lack of runs nor about succumbing to short-ball ploy used by the Kiwi pacers. He admitted that the Kiwi pacers “used breeze very well” in the series in which India was whitewashed 2-0.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jpf4vo/article31043165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12RAHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rahane-backs-shadow-tours-but-with-a-rider/article31043166.ece
224,2020/03/11,SCA curator rejects Arun Lal’s opinion,"The Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) head curator, Mahendra Rajdev, on Wednesday rejected Bengal coach Arun Lal’s opinion that the SCA Stadium pitch was poor.

“I was surprised to see the critical statement of Arun Lal, the Bengal team coach and mentor, after the first day’s play (of the Ranji Trophy final between Bengal and Saurashtra) when Bengal had the upper hand,” said Rajdev in statement.

“The pitch may not have had extra bounce which Bengal bowlers were looking for, but that does not make the wicket poor.

“It is a rather hasty and poor judgement by the Bengal coach and it may not be beneficial for their own players when the coach makes a statement like this.

225,2020/03/11,Passion for the game drives her,"Veteran women scorer Himali Desai on a journey spanning 25 years

For Himali Desai, the seniormost female scorer in the country, spending quarter of a century in a profession dominated by men was the best possible way to stay connected with the game she loved the most.

Forty-four-year old Himali, a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) panel scorer who is employed as a statistician by the Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA), has performed duty in two Tests, 11 ODIs, three T20Is, some IPL matches and numerous Ranji and other domestic matches. She is the only woman Duckworth-Lewis manager in the country.

The seniormost among a handful of female scorers, Himali — who played inter-university cricket as a wicketkeeper-batsman — says the passion for the game was paramount for her.

“I wanted to stay connected with cricket, so I chose this,” Himali, posted in the press box for the Ranji Trophy final between Saurashtra and Bengal here, told The Hindu on Wednesday.

“In 1994, I passed the State panel exam and in 1997 the BCCI exam. We were just two girls and the other girl left scoring due to some personal problems.

“I did not come to this profession for money. I was passionate about cricket. Later, I came to know that scorers were also paid. My first earning was from the Cooch Behar Trophy match between Saurashtra and Baroda in 1994. I got ₹100 per day.

All matches are equal

“From a concentration point of view, all matches are equal to me. There is no extra pressure in international matches. One has to remain more alert though, as it goes live on TV.”

Himali thanked SCA for its support and felt proud to be associated with the association’s effort to create a huge database of statistics.

“I doubt if any other association has Ranji data since 1950. We have database of women's (all formats) and C.K. Nayudu Trophy for Saurashtra and are working on Vijay Merchant and Cooch Behar stats.”

Looking back at her journey, Himali said, “Everybody, including players, respects me. I have never felt out of place. It’s like a family,” said Himali.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/njini7/article31043128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12HIMALI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/passion-for-the-game-drives-her/article31043129.ece
226,2020/03/11,Chatterjee keeps Bengal afloat in tall pursuit,"Saurashtra’s last-wicket pair collects some useful runs to swell total to 425

A resolute Sudip Chatterjee’s fighting, unbeaten 47 kept Bengal in a challenging quest for the first-innings lead in the Ranji Trophy final against Saurashtra here on Wednesday.

In reply to the host’s formidable 425 in the first innings, Bengal relied on Chatterjee’s knock to reach 134 for three at stumps on day three at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

Akash Deep claimed his fourth wicket by dismissing Chirag Jani in the second over after Saurashtra resumed at 384 for eight. The last pair, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja (33 not out, 52b, 5x4) and Jaydev Unadkat (20, 35b, 3x4), added 38 of the 41 runs collected by Saurashtra in the morning. Shahbaz Ahmed bowled Unadkat to end the host’s innings.

Bengal had a decent start, thanks to debutant Sudip Gharami’s positive approach. The right-hander’s timing and placement fetched him four boundaries, including two consecutive ones off Unadkat.

Saurashtra exerted pressure to get two vital wickets and reduced Bengal to 35 for two at lunch. Dharmendra had Gharami caught at forward short-leg and Prerak Mankad removed Abhimanyu Easwaran, who was adjudged lbw off a delivery that hit him high. The ‘limited’ DRS could not help the Bengal captain.

The experienced Bengal duo of Chatterjee (47 not out, 145b, 5x4) and Manoj Tiwary (35, 116b, 2x4) adopted workman-like approach on a slow track offering low bounce on several instances.

They gathered only 59 runs in the middle session but brought some relief by rotating the strike and getting a few boundaries.

Tiwary, who played on off a Jani no-ball when on 18, accompanied Chatterjee well in an 89-run association off 226 deliveries. He eventually fell to Jani’s trap in the final session.

Chatterjee’s temperament helped him against the disciplined Saurashtra bowlers. He was conscious not to make too many mistakes. The left-hander played some handsome shots, including two fours off a Dharmendrasinh over on the off-side.

227,2020/03/11,It was a team hat-trick: Harbhajan,"Veteran off-spinner recalls Ramesh’s ‘incredible catch’ that fetched him the feat

Who celebrated the Harbhajan Singh hat-trick the most on the opening day of the iconic India-Australia Test at the Eden Gardens on March11, 2001. “Not me,” revealed the off-spinner. Then? “Rahul (Dravid) and (Sadogopan) Ramesh. The hat-trick wicket (the first by an Indian) was because of the incredible catch by Ramesh,” recalled Harbhajan, who claimed 13 wickets in that Test.

Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne were Harbhajan’s victims in that glorious last session when Australia lost seven wickets. “To tell you the truth I was apprehensive if I would justify my selection. Australia had lost just one wicket in the first two sessions. They were just belting us. (Matthew) Hayden’s wicket gave us the breakthrough,” said the off-spinner.

One wicket led to another. “I was happy to get Mark Waugh. And then three in a row.” What was a “gloomy” start transformed into a “beautiful” day for Harbhajan. “Ponting was a prize wicket because he can be unsparing. There was not much turn and I just looked to bowl wicket-to-wicket. I was lucky in the sense that the ball went straight, did not turn,” remembered Harbhajan.

Also read|Hurts more than 2001 Kolkata loss, says Ponting

When Gilchrist took guard, Harbhajan, playing his 10th Test, told himself not to drift the ball. “It was simple. I had to bowl within the stumps. Line was important. I knew he loves to sweep and I had to deny him. Once again the ball stayed flat and Gilly had no chance. He was trapped plumb.”

The hat-trick ball had Harbhajan thinking a lot. “I was aware that Warne likes to be aggressive. I just had to keep the ball straight. I aimed at hitting the pad. It was an incredible catch by Ramesh that got me the hat-trick. You don’t bowl to take a hat-trick. It happens. It was a team hat-trick.”

Vivid memory

Ramesh has vivid memory of the catch. “I was aware that Warne shuffles a lot. I obviously kept my eyes on the bat, just in case an edge came my way. It did. I saw it in a flash and put out my right hand. It was a firm flick really and I hung on. At that moment I couldn’t remember how Bhajju celebrated because Rahul had jumped to hug me,” said Ramesh.

Looking back on that feat, Harbhajan — who took 417 wickets from 103 Tests — noted, “I learnt how one ball, one wicket, can change things. It was the most important day of my career. It taught me never to lose hope.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a8pkx4/article31043069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BHAJJI1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/it-was-a-team-hat-trick-harbhajan/article31043070.ece
228,2020/03/11,COVID-19 — IPL GC meeting on Saturday,"To discuss how to handle the coronavirus threat to the forthcoming competition

The Governing Council of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will meet here on Saturday to discuss the imminent threat of COVID-19 that’s set to affect the T20 league’s 13th edition. The decision came on a day when the Maharashtra government had a discussion to propose that the IPL games in the State, including the season-opener and the final, be staged behind closed doors.

The Maharashtra government’s proposal comes a day after the Karnataka government wrote to the Union Government to disallow matches to be staged in Karnataka.

Business interest

With two of the nine States, where 60 IPL games are scheduled to be played from March 29, voicing their concern, the IPL authorities will have to act swiftly to ensure the business interest of the league is taken care of without compromising safety of players.

The GC meeting, to be chaired by Brijesh Patel, is set to be attended by BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah. With the secretary’s father being the Union Home Minister, a possible solution is likely to be tabled before the GC.

With Karnataka and Maharashtra — two States with positive COVID-19 cases on the rise — having initiated action despite the Maharashtra government supporting a veterans’ cricket league now, other State governments are likely to step in and oppose IPL, which invariably finds itself in some controversy ahead of every edition.

While GC members are tightlipped, The Hindu understands that the IPL may well be forced to follow the present global trend of staging matches in front of empty stands. The IPL revenue model is such that the gate receipts don’t account for a major revenue factor, even for the franchises who retain a major chunk of the income through sale of tickets.

Also read: Coronavirus | Sports events hit worldwide by outbreak of COVID-19

A franchise official, citing anonymity, admitted that “playing in front of empty stands, although a last resort, is better than not playing at all”. But with franchises having little say in the organisation of the IPL, the next few days will decide the fate of the 2020 edition.

Rahane’s views

Meanwhile, Ajinkya Rahane, who will be a part of the Delhi Capitals this year, hoped that the BCCI and IPL GC find an amicable solution in consultation with the franchises.

“BCCI and IPL governing council will take a decision. I cannot comment on it because I feel they are the best judges and they will take a call on this. I am sure BCCI and governing council will discuss it with the teams and come up with a solution. I am sure they will have the best answers,” said Rahane at a promotional event.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u62ilk/article31043048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BRIJ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/covid-19-ipl-gc-meeting-on-saturday/article31043049.ece

230,2020/03/11,Bowlers lack experience: de kock,"Bhuvneshwar eyes return on a winning note

With coronavirus in the news and the rain clouds in attendance, cricketers from India and South Africa chose to take it easy on the eve of the first ODI here.

Ahead of Thursday’s clash Indians had an “optional session” on the ground and the South Africans opted for a brief feel of the “nets” in the stadium complex before it rained heavily.

Skipper Quinton de Kock underlined the importance of the presence of his predecessor Faf de Plesis, back in the team after a break against the visiting Australians.

“He plays a big, big role for us from a leadership point of view. I think he is here to help a lot of the younger guys in our team. And he also knows that he has a lot of value to give in this team. So it’s still great to him around,” said de Kock.

Also Read 1st ODI preview | India far from an obvious favourite

Acknowledging the team’s bowling lacked experience, the skipper said, “Obviously we understand that we have come here with quite an inexperienced (bowling) side in these conditions but obviously it’s important for guys like Faf, me, David Miller to help out these guys around.”

Describing India as an “unbelievable team” de Kock said, “they got great bowlers, great batsman. But I’m sure we’ve also come in here with a lot of confidence and I’m sure we’ll have a good series, anyway.”

Bhuvneshwar Kumar, back after undergoing a sports hernia surgery in London in January, was quick to underline the importance of winning this series for the host.

“Every international match is important and we (players) know how people react when we lose, like we saw against New Zealand. Individually, too, triumphs impact the self-belief of the performers” said the soft-spoken medium pacer.

Saliva on ball

Both de Kock and Bhuvneshwar were asked about the pacers using saliva on the ball in these days of coronavirus.

In response, de Kock said, “Our team doctors and management have made sure all are fit and don’t have coronavirus. So we’ll attend to that to still keep the ball shining.”

Bhuvneshwar wasn’t as sure. “Right now, I can’t say. But if we don’t use saliva and get hit, then you people (from the media) will say you didn’t bowl well. In any case, we’ll follow our doctor’s advice in dealing with coronavirus.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yb4cgz/article31043033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12FAF1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bowlers-lack-experience-de-kock/article31043034.ece
231,2020/03/11,Chappell-Hadlee Trophy | Australia bank on top four against buoyant New Zealand,"The first of three ODIs begins in Sydney on Thursday

Australia will be banking on their top order as they seek to end their five-match winless streak in one-day internationals against a buoyant New Zealand in the three-match series beginning in Sydney on Friday.

Aaron Finch's men are smarting from a 3-0 whitewash in South Africa earlier this month, which followed their 2-1 series defeat in India, and their top order looks exhausted after 12 months of relentless cricket.

In New Zealand, they meet a side brimming with confidence having just whitewashed India both in the ODI and Test series.

Opener David Warner agreed the onus was on the frontline batsmen to fuel Australia's bid to reclaim the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy.

“The only thing I can put it (Australia's losing streak) down to is the top four not scoring the bulk of the runs,” Warner told reporters on Wednesday.

“You can't do it all the time but at least one of us (has to) go on and be there at the end.

“It is disappointing but at the end of the day we've got to keep trying to get better at that, try to find a balance with our batting through the middle as well.”

Team mate Matthew Wade agreed with Warner's diagnosis and said they need to do better against a New Zealand side renowned for their discipline in all aspects of the game.

“We've got to make sure one of the top four really bats through and makes a big hundred and in Australia we back our power towards the end on pretty true wickets,” said Wade.

“It'll be nice to see if one of the top order can go through and bat the whole innings, that would be very helpful.”

New Zealand have welcomed their fit-again pace trio of Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson, who powered their run to the final of the World Cup last year.

Coach Gary Stead said his team considered Australia a “benchmark” but will carry the confidence from their excellent performance against India.

“They are a great team, we respect them a lot for the way they play their cricket... They set a benchmark for us to aspire to,” Stead said.

“I think we have played some really good ODI cricket in the last three or four years and hopefully we can continue that.”

232,2020/03/11,1st ODI preview | India far from an obvious favourite,"Rain threat looms large over ODI series-opener against South Africa

Following a harsh reality check in New Zealand, Virat Kohli and his men are back in familiar environs. Backed by vociferous crowds, favourable conditions and pitches, the recently-battered team will look to redeem itself against an in-form South Africa in the three-match ODI series beginning here on Thursday.

Looking to break the five-match losing streak - all three ODIs and both Tests - to New Zealand, India could well turn to its time-tested “spin-to-win” mantra. But that alone is not going to do the trick. The batsmen need to fire to restore confidence in the dressing room.

Indeed, three ODIs in a week will test India’s top-order in the continued absence of an injured Rohit Sharma. The Law of Averages seems to have finally caught up with Kohli. Returning from injury, Shikhar Dhawan is expected to take time to get back to the groove. An impetuous and inexperienced Prithvi Shaw is still a 'work-in-progress'.

The Pant question

The rays of hope come from K. L. Rahul, Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey, who look increasingly hungry to cement their spots in the playing XI. Among these, Rahul now finds himself saddled with the job of keeping wicket, something that his name-sake and fellow Karnataka cricketer Rahul Dravid once did so reluctantly.

Also Read Bowlers lack experience: de kock

With the team management going back to the idea of a specialist batsman-turned-makeshift keeper in search of the “right balance” or add to the options of playing an additional batsman or a bowler, one cannot help sparing a thought for young Rishabh Pant.

Reduced to a bench-warmer during the three ODIs in New Zealand recently, Pant is going through a crisis of form, and with it, confidence. His understandable lack of self-belief has reflected in his job behind the stumps in the two Tests that followed.

With Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri keen to wipe out the recent unpleasant memories, Pant could still find himself out of favour, probably like Shubman Gill. If the think-tank continues to opt for Rahul as the first-choice keeper, Pant should read the writing on the wall.

Like Pant, Jasprit Bumrah is learning how it feels to become a victim of expectations. Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Hardik Pandya are back from injuries. The spin-duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal are looking to strike in tandem. Navdeep Saini is aiming to resume his run on home-turf.

SA upbeat

In short, this team does not look like an obvious favourite against South Africa, currently riding a high. Not many realise that South Africa is here after maintaining its domination over Australia by winning 11 out of the last 12 ODIs.

The side, that recently whipped Australia 3-0 at home, stands reinforced with the return of former captain Faf du Plessis. Under Quinton de Kock, South Africa is looking to repeat its series-success of 2015 when it last visited India for ODIs and won 3-2.The team looks to du Plessis, de Kock and David Miller for experience in batting. Some exciting talents, bearing unusual names like Jaaneman Malan and Jon-Jon Smuts, will be keen to reinforce the impressions they made against Australia. Fit-again Temba Bavuma, Rassie van der Dussen, Heinrich Klassen are others who can be expected to come good.

In the absence of an injured Kagiso Rabada, the pace attack consists of Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Beuran Hendricks and recent debutant Lutho Sipamla, not to forget seam-bowling all-rounder Andile Phehlukwayo. Test spinner Keshav Maharaj and Smuts provide the slower options. Interestingly, it will be a first for these bowlers to play an ODI in India.

Last September, when the two teams reached this picturesque destination for the opener of the three-match T20 series, heavy rain ensured no play. On Thursday, too, there is forecast for rain. Having learnt from experience, the groundsmen covered every inch of the ground before it started raining around 3 p.m.

233,2020/03/11,Women’s 2021 ODI World Cup to have reserve day for semis and final,"The recently concluded Women’s T20 World Cup did not have reserve days for the semi-finals, and as a result England were knocked out after their match was washed out

A harsh lesson learnt after England women bowed out of the T20 World Cup without actually playing the semi-final against India, the ICC has now allocated a reserve day each for the two semi-finals and final of the 2021 ODI edition in New Zealand.

The ICC released the 31-match schedule for the tournament, starting February 6 to March 7 in New Zealand with reserve days scheduled for all three knockout matches a day later.

Last week, England were forced to make an exit from the T20 Women’s World Cup after their semifinal clash was washed out, resulting in India, the higher ranked side in the group stage, progressing to the final. The ICC had faced a lot of flak for not keeping a reserve day.

Schedule announced

The Women’s ODI World Cup will be played at six venues, including Eden Park (Auckland), Bay Oval (Tauranga), Seddon Park(Hamilton), University Oval(Dunedin), Basin Reserve (Wellington) and Hagley Oval (Christchurch).

The iconic Basin Reserve will stage the highly anticipated Trans-Tasman showdown between New Zealand and Australia on February 13.

Auckland will host the opening game between the hosts and a qualifying team, the semifinals will be played in Tauranga and Hamilton on February March 3 and 4 respectively with the summit clash scheduled to take place in Christchurch on March 7.

“It’s a match we absolutely fizz about as players — taking on the Aussies is always a huge thrill. Cricket fans who come along to the Basin Reserve on Saturday the 13th of February will no doubt see a lot of passion from both teams,” New Zealand captain, Sophie Devine said.

New Zealand, Australia, England and South Africa have already qualified for the World Cup. The remaining four teams will be established following the completion of the ICC Women’s Championship and a subsequent qualifying tournament in Sri Lanka in July.

The eight-team round robin format will see all teams play each other, with the top four teams qualifying for semi-finals.

Prize money for the showpiece of women’s international cricket will total NZD 5.5million, and all matches will be broadcast live to a huge global audience.

“The ICC has made a long-term commitment to to elevating women’s cricket as part of our strategy to grow and develop the global game,” ICC CEO, Manu Sawhney said.

“We are extremely proud of the significant progress we have made in increasing prize money for ICC events over the last few years, with the Women’s Cricket World Cup 2021 in New Zealand having NZD5.5 million dollars available in prize money compared to NZD 3.1m in 2017 and NZD 316,000 in 2013,” he added.

With the 30-day, 31-match schedule now locked in, ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup CEO Andrea Nelson is excited to see the country get behind the event.

“Our team is proud to be delivering a tournament where Kiwis across the whole country, in each of our six host cities, can really get involved in what is a truly special event. We can’t wait to see the excitement build around New Zealand as we prepare to roll out the welcome mat for the rest of the world,” Nelson said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pchdbu/article30484073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HAGLEYKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-2021-odi-world-cup-to-have-reserve-day-for-semis-and-final/article31038455.ece
234,2020/03/11,"Dhoni rocks, even in practice","For the Chepauk crowd, nothing else can match the pleasure of watching him

The afternoon sun was biting; soon it would be brutal. One hour before the scheduled start of practice at 4.30 p.m., the stands at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium were empty. As the time approached, the ground staff rolled the pitch and the sprinklers watered the outfield.

The stumps were erected and 15 minutes before 5 p.m., the gates opened. There were hundreds of fans, lining up despite the sultry heat.

Dhoni led a small group of players, including Ambati Rayudu, M. Vijay, Karn Sharma, Piyush Chawla, Suresh Raina and R. Sai Kishore.

Quite a sight

For the crowd at Chepauk, nothing else can quite match the pleasure of watching Dhoni: the sense of anticipation, so drawn out, and ultimately so rewarding. In between overs, he would roll his shoulders, flex his neck, chat with the fielders.

Every time Dhoni juggled the ball in his hands, the crowd cheered.

Every time he turned around, hundreds of arms waved at him.

The debates about the fading of skills and the timing of retirement were lost amid this din.

The fans had begun to build the noise and it reached a crescendo when Dhoni walked out to bat.

He pulled a short ball away to the fine-leg boundary before clearing the front leg and launching a half-volley over long-on for six. But the biggest roar was reserved for a straight six and a fierce cut shot off Harbhajan’s bowling.

Two-hour stint

He added: “While the DMK continued its verbal assault on all, its leader M.K. Stalin had remained a mere spectator without condemning such speech.”

The Minister also wanted the DMK’s IT Wing to stop spreading canards on social media to mislead people. I have reasons to believe that the IT Wing is going to target me, as I am Mr. Stalin’s first target. But I am least bothered about such canards.”

Incidents of cattle and livestock kills were reported in Soosaipuram and Doddagajanur villages near the border in Talavadi for the last three months. Field inspection by forest officials revealed that leopards from forests in Karnataka use the forest stream to enter the State and hunt prey in the villages. Since there are large boulders and bushes in the quarries that remain non-functional for last five months, leopards use them as hideouts.

Though the personnel had set up two cages in Soosaipuram village and on a farm land and installed camera traps, no leopard was caught in the last one month. Footage from a camera trap revealed that a leopard had come near the cage, but did not enter it.

A team led by Talavadi Forest Ranger S.

The Forest Department is planning to step up awareness among the public to stop feeding animals along Yercaud Ghat Road, to prevent roadkill.

With summer holidays just a month away, tourists in large numbers are expected to visit Yercaud this year and the forest department is planning to educate and create awareness among the tourists about the harms of feeding animals along the ghat road.

While feeding animals along ghat road is often seen as a compassionate act, the main side-effect is roadkill, forest officials said. According to officials, some food items could also endanger the wild animals.

District Forest Officer A. Periasamy said, “public must realise that it is wrong to feed wild animals. The animals, expecting food, run behind moving vehicles and get killed by oncoming vehicles. Recently, a monkey died in a roadkill on Yercaud Ghat Road. If the animals get used to feeding, it will affect their basic instinct of going in search of food. It has come to our notice that some animal lovers indulged in giving food to animals along Ghat Road and we have advised them against doing it. If the animal gets acquainted with the persons, it might move towards the road on sighting them and it could lead to roadkill,” he said.

241,2020/03/11,Govt. school teacher employs puppets to engage students in learning,"Trains six students in shadow puppetry and makes them perform during annual day

In an effort to improve the involvement of students in learning, a teacher at the Panchayat Union Middle School in Chinnamettupalayam, here, is employing various types of puppetry in classrooms and school events.

B. Jeyanthi, a Class IV teacher, said that she trained six of her students in shadow puppetry and made them stage a play during the annual day celebrations on February 29. “The show turned out to be better than what we expected and received positive response from the audience,” she said .

Ms. Jeyanthi was one of the eight government school teachers from the State who attended a workshop on puppetry organised by the Centre for Cultural Resources and Training (CCRT) in Hyderabad. Titled ‘Role of Puppetry in Education’, the workshop was held for teachers handling primary classes across India from January 21 to February 6, she said.

On her return, Ms. Jeyanthi said that she started using different types of puppetry such as glove, rod and string puppets in her class to explain topics such as child rights and good touch/bad touch. “Instead of giving long explanations, if we make it into a dialogue between two puppets, the children tend to understand it better,” Ms. Jeyanthi said.

As part of these efforts, she decided to train the students for a shadow puppetry show for the annual day celebration. With only four days of training, the Class IV students managed to execute the show, which was about animals attempting to start a school in the jungle. While one student was tasked with handling the light, the other five students manipulated the shadow puppets of characters such as fox, elephant, bear, lion, crow, peacock and crocodile, Ms. Jeyanthi recalled. “I liked the fox very much,” said P. Divyabharathi, a Class IV student, who participated in the shadow puppetry show. She also said that she would like all the classes to have puppetry every day.

Headmaster D. Kanakaraju said that the school was expecting sponsors to conduct more puppet shows across all classes in the school. “This [puppetry] will help the children to remember better,” he said. As many as 250 students from kindergarten till Class VIII are studying in the government school, Mr. Kanakaraju said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/6yygof/article31043892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12PUPPETSHOW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/govt-school-teacher-employs-puppets-to-engage-students-in-learning/article31043893.ece

Similarly, the Department has advised TNSTC and operators of private buses plying in Coimbatore and those plying between Coimbatore and other districts in Tamil Nadu to sanitise the vehicles using disinfectant solution at the end of trips at night.

G. Ramesh Kumar, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore, said that the Department staff also conducted awareness sessions for the crew and passengers of buses coming from Kerala.

They demonstrated hand washing techniques and use of hand sanitisers on Wednesday for the crew and passengers of buses that arrived Coimbatore from various places in Kerala.

The cleaning of the buses was to disinfect surfaces such as seats, handrails and door handle that are touched by passengers and crew.

Small droplets released from a COVID-19 infected person while sneezing or coughing can land on surfaces like these and the virus can spread to others when they touch such surfaces and then touch their their eyes, nose or mouth.

Coimbatore is having direct bus services to various destinations in Kerala including Ernakulam, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts where the 14 persons were tested positive for COVID-19.

Dr. Kumar said that Coimbatore did not have anyone with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 as on Wednesday.

Already, the Department has issued advisory to the management of malls, theatres, shopping centres, supermarkets, auditoriums and offices to clean floors and surfaces like railings with disinfectant solution.

The 60-cent reserved site at Marudha Nagar in Ward 06 – Kavundampalayam – will soon be a park.

The Coimbatore Corporation had joined hands with the Marudha Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association and German technical agency GIZ to develop the site.

Sources familiar with the development said the GIZ would come up with technical inputs and detailed plan for developing the site. Based on the plan, the Corporation would arrive at the cost and then consider taking up the work.

The residents had been involved in the development exercise as they gave their requirements and inputs to the GIZ team and Corporation officials when they visited the site a few days ago.

The GIZ’s cooperation was a fall out of the cooperation between the Indian and German governments. The objective was to develop urban green spaces and Coimbatore was one among the three Indian cities chosen for the project, Kochi and Bhubaneswar being the other two.

They said the Corporation and German teams had chosen the Marudha Nagar reserved site because it fit the bill – the project should benefit as many people as possible or that the site chosen should be in a densely populated area, the availability of land to work should be sufficient and should not have any green cover.

After visiting a few sites, when the teams zeroed in on the Marudha Nagar it interacted with the residents, who said they wanted a walkers' path, children's play area and green cover.

Based on the inputs, three teams worked with the residents and came with three different plans – to use the land to recycle grey water and use the treated water to water saplings to develop green cover; house models to educate students on various aspects of urban planning, rainwater harvest and other environment-friendly, farming, and, raise a bio-fence on the periphery of the reserved site and earmark a portion of the site to develop a green zone.

The sources said the German team had taken all the three inputs to develop a comprehensive plan incorporating all the elements, including those that the residents had wanted.

As and when developed, the site would turn into a model park for not only the area but the rest of the city as well, they added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/7mac90/article31043880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB12PARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-to-develop-reserved-site-with-german-technical-assistance/article31043881.ece

The protesters also demanded basic amenities at the work site that included drinking water, first aid kits and shelter.

253,2020/03/11,COVID-19: caution stepped up in Coimbatore,"Kancheepuram native and 12 persons in Kerala test positive

The Health Department and the district administration have stepped up caution in Coimbatore after a Kancheepuram native and 12 persons in the neighbouring Kerala tested positive for COVID-19.

According to G. Ramesh Kumar, Deputy Director of Health Services, Coimbatore, there was no room for fear but people have to be cautious.

A. Nirmala, Dean of Government Medical College and ESI Hospital, said that the isolation ward in the hospital was equipped to quarantine persons who come up with symptoms of the viral infection.

The hospital’s medical superintendent Ravikumar said that the staff were demonstrating hand washing techniques to patients and their attendants every day since the virus spread was reported in the country.

The office of the Deputy Director of Health Services was maintaining adequate stock of masks, gloves and disinfectant solution to be distributed to healthcare facilities.

The Department has issued advisory to the management of malls, theatres, shopping centres, supermarkets, marriage halls, auditoriums, schools, offices and other places witnessing movement of people in large numbers to clean floors and surfaces like railings with disinfectant solution.

According to K. Kolandasamy, Director of Public Health -Tamil Nadu, frequent washing of hands with soap, covering mouth with handkerchief while coughing or sneezing, avoiding contact with people having fever or related symptoms of COVID-19, avoiding handshakes while greeting others, and avoiding touching eyes or nose or mouth with unwashed hands were the utmost personal hygiene practices to be followed as precaution.

Health Department officials said that identifying persons who are coming to the district from COVID-19 affected places was their prime focus. The Department staff were also creating awareness in buses that ply between various points in Tamil Nadu and Kerala through Coimbatore.

At the Coimbatore International Airport, Health officials are checking passengers who come from foreign countries. Coimbatore has international flight connectivity to Sharjah, Singapore and Sri Lanka.

Passengers who arrive from these countries are being checked with thermal scanners. Boards have been kept at the airport asking passengers to inform health officials if they have travelled in COVID-19 affected countries.

“The checking at airport should be intensified to identify persons who come from foreign countries to other cities in India and then take domestic connecting flight to Coimbatore. Thermal scanner can only detect if a passenger has fever. An infected person who is also asymptomatic may go undetected,” a security official at the airport said.

256,2020/03/11,"No irregularity in appointment, clarifies Corporation","The Coimbatore Corporation had done no wrong in appointing 321 persons for conservancy worker posts, Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath told the workers.

The appointment of the 321 persons was through a direct recruitment process, based on Government Order 549.

Here, the Government had said the minimum qualification was the ability to read and write Tamil and prescribed following the roster system (communal reservation system). This was in variance with what the contract conservancy workers demanded – regularisation of their employment.

“How can you compare the two. The Government Order-based direct recruitment process ensured a level playing field. The regularisation process, however, is restricted to contract conservancy workers and is based on their years of experience.”

Mr. Jatavath later clarified to The Hindu that the Corporation did not have the qualification or other details of the recruited candidates because it simply did not ask for those. And, asking for those either during the certification process or later during the interview would be a violation of the Government Order and open the door for allegations later.

The Corporation had simply recruited the candidates based on the replies the candidates gave during interviews and the discretion of the appointing officer. This was the case with recruitment to other posts that the Government carried out – where the interview and the marks given to the replies mattered.

If the contract conservancy workers were to demand regularisation of employment, the Corporation would support their move as it had vacancies to fill.

He also explained to the workers and their leaders that the ratio of number of applicants to the number of posts was very high and pointed out that for four posts reserved for SC women, the Corporation had received 2,200 applications and for eight posts earmarked for SC Arundathiyar, it had received over 1,600 applications.

And, in recruiting the candidates, the Corporation had clearly followed the roster system, leaving no room for allegations, he reiterated.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/no-irregularity-in-appointment-clarifies-corporation/article31034603.ece
257,2020/03/11,Contract conservancy workers allege bias in recruitment,"Over 500 workers stage protest at the civic body's head office

Around 500 conservancy workers, engaged on contract for the Coimbatore Corporation, staged a protest at the civic body’s head office in Town Hall on Tuesday morning.

The protesting workers, including a large number of women, were protesting against the Corporation recruiting 321 persons for conservancy worker posts, which they alleged was biased, illegal and wanted cancelled. They also demanded that they be given preference in appointment to the posts.

The Tuesday’s protest followed the a brief protest they held in front of the District Collectorate on Monday, during the conduct of the weekly grievance meeting.

The presence of over 500 workers at the Corporation office also saw the police post its personnel there to prevent untoward incidents and prevent the protesting workers from blocking the Big Bazaar Street, which they threatened to do every now and then.

The workers were led by leaders of trade unions that included the CITU, Tamilnadu Annal Ambedkar Scavengers and General Employees Union, Janashakti Labour Union and AITUC.

As the leaders took turns to address the workers, Singanallur MLA N. Karthik reached the protest venue to address the workers.

Later, the leaders along with a few workers met the Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath. A few zonal assistant commissioners and sanitary officers were also present.

The leaders wanted the Corporation to pass a resolution for the regularisation of the contract conservancy workers. They also wanted to know why Corporation delayed making an appearance before the Labour Deputy Commissioner, where the trade unions had flagged a dispute for not regularising the contract workers' services.

E.R. Selvam of the Annal Ambedkar Union also wanted to know what was the Corporation's urgency in recruiting persons for 543 vacant positions when the relevant State Government order was three years old.

He also alleged that the Corporation had not only recruited candidates overlooking experienced contract conservancy workers it had also opened service records register against the recruited candidates’ names.

The norms for opening the service records register was 90 days and the urgency itself pointed out irregularity in recruitment.

Mr. Karthik said the Corporation recruiting 321 persons with majority of them being close to ruling party and they being from areas that fell in Minister for Municipal Administration S.P. Velumani’s constituency raised suspicion.

He added that experience had shown that over qualified persons recruited as conservancy workers had used their influence to work as office assistants or clerks or drivers and not for the job they were recruited for.

The trade union leaders said they were dissatisfied with Mr. Jatavath’s explanations and that they would intensify their protest in the days to come.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/contract-conservancy-workers-allege-bias-in-recruitment/article31034573.ece

The opposition to the HPCL’s pipeline project that is set to acquire lands in Sivadi village intensified with the residents led by the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam staging a day-long sit-in protest on the Collectorate campus on Tuesday.

The protesters led by the P. Shanmugam, State secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivsayigal Sangal and Dilli Babu, CPI(M)’s ex-MLA of Harur sat on a day long sit-in calling upon the government to reverse the land acquisition proposed in Sivadi village for a storage terminal of a pipeline project of HPCL.

The HPCL project envisions a 697 km pipeline from Vijayawada to Dharmapuri, where it culminates into a storage terminal in Sivadi village at Nallampalli block of Dharmapuri. The project proposes to acquire 123 acres in Sivadi village, which is predominantly a Scheduled Caste village and marginal landholdings by the people.

Speaking at the protest, Mr. Shanmugam said the farmers’ association met Industries Secretary Muruganandam recently and insisted on an alternative site for the project. According to Mr. Shanmugam, the Secretary of Industries had indicated that there were lands available in SIPCOT industrial estate and those lands could be used for the project. “The project affected residents were Scheduled Castes with marginal holdings of half acre and 1 acre. Their lands cannot be taken away,” Mr. Shanmugam said. The farmers’ association has also called for a written undertaking from the administration that no further activity will be undertaken towards acquisition of lands.

The project had run into opposition last year, soon after the farmers started receiving notices of the proposed acquisition of their lands. Multiple protests and representations by the project affected public and organised by the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sagam has taken place in sporadic intervals.

The farmers’ association also called for a change of site within Dharmapuri, stating that there were adequate government porombokke lands and those lands that were kept idle after acquisition for a SIPCOT industrial estate that was yet to see fruition.

261,2020/03/11,The names of Vishnu,"The 59th name of Lord Mahavishnu in the Vishnu Sahasranama is LohitAksha. Parasara Bhatta, who wrote a commentary for the Vishnu Sahasranama, says the Lord is always happy because of His many leelas. And because of this joy, His eyes are red like lotuses. Hence the name LohitAskha (lohita - red in colour; aksha - eyes). Singing of the beauty of Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam, Thirupannazhvar talks of the beautiful red lines in Ranganatha’s eyes.

The Lord is joyful, because He showers His devotees with His daya. This leads us to name number 138 in Parasara Bhatta’s classification. The 138th name is krtAkrtah. This means that He is the giver of everything. He gives worldly joys and moksha, explained V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse. Worldly joys are artificial (krta). It is in the nature of the atma to seek proximity to the Supreme One. So, to seek moksha is natural (akrta). But since we crave worldly joys, He gives us these too. Since He gives us krta and akrta, He is krtAkrtah. Doing a japa of this name will bring us moksha.

Vishnu is also called ajah. It means He is not born like us. While we cannot choose our parents, the time of our birth or the form we will take, the Lord decides the place, time and manner of His birth. Particularly interesting is His Narasimha avatara. The name ajah occurs twice in the Vishnu Sahasranama. Name 206 - ajah - is explained by Parasara Bhatta with reference to the Narasimha avatara. He says that since Narasimha was born from a pillar, His arrival was most unusual! The 737th name is ‘tat.’ This is explained by Parasara Bhatta as ‘He who expands, or magnifies.’ What does He magnify? If we take one step towards Him, He multiplies that a hundredfold, and counts that one little step as hundred steps towards Him.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/the-names-of-vishnu/article31043135.ece
262,2020/03/11,"The Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University preserves the history, heritage and cultural legacy of Kerala","The University in Tirur, Malappuram district, which promotes the cause of Malayalam language

As you walk into the Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University in Tirur in Malappuram, the campus, with its green foliage and fragrant pathways, welcomes you warmly. The architecture is clearly reminiscent of the traditional culture and heritage of Kerala.

The Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, established on November 1, 2012, aims at promoting Malayalam language by offering post-graduate programmes in diverse disciplines in Malayalam, apart from research programmes.

I had visited the campus as part of a motivational tour organised for students of the Walk with Scholar programme at the Government College for Women, initiated by the Department of Collegiate Education.

The Heritage Museum at the university was established under the Museum Project. The museum presents a plethora of objects, pictures and materials that hold the fingerprints of a yesteryear culture. The museum features local history and artefacts. However, university sources say that the present one is only a prelude to a more elaborate museum.

The moment you step across the threshold of the museum, it’s like going back into another age. The antiquity of our heritage, the beginning of Malayalam, the evolution of communities, the depth of the social fabric interwoven with culture and art... all is fascinating for a visitor. The anthropological significance is immense, considering the research value of the collection of artefacts and tools. Some of the tools were used in agriculture, while long ladles and antique spice boxes belong to kitchens of another era.

An exhibit at the Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

The artefacts also throw light on the commerce and industries that thrived along our shores centuries ago and changed the course of our future. It is indeed a surreal feeling to be able to experience our heritage thus and understand the lifestyle of people thriving on agricultural produce and spice trade, the diverse cultures spread across the State, the dialects they spoke and the kind of food they ate.

Evolution of Malayalam

The heritage museum also traces the history of the Malayalam language by giving a detailed evolution of its script. Almost half of the space has been dedicated to the path-breaking revolutions within local histories. One such history that is preserved is that of ‘Vettathu Naadu’. ‘Vettam’, which means light, is interpreted as the light of knowledge. It was thereby known as ‘Prakasabhoomi’ owing to the way knowledge was propagated and shared there. This place has much significance with regard to its topography, being surrounded by water on all borders.

History points out that Vettathu Naadu has been a crucial hub for all sorts of trade and commerce that thrived. Vettam Grama Panchayath (presently in Tirur) was earlier a part of the Kingdom of Tanur. It is inferred that its history dates back to the Chera period, before the arrival of the Portuguese armadas. The rulers of Vettathu Naadu being noted patrons of art and culture, its history is a treasure trove of information. It is said that Vettathu Naadu Raja (1630-1640) is said to have introduced innovative changes in Kathakali, which later came to be known as the ‘Veṭṭathu tradition.’

The museum also showcases the life history and contributions of icons such as Vallathol Narayana Menon, Veluthattu Narayana Namboothiri, Melpathoor Narayana Bhattathiri, Thrikkandiyoor Achyutha Pisharadi, Thunchathezhuthachan and Sayyid Sanaullah Makti Thangal who brought about significant changes in society and culture through their contributions to art, music, literature, education and so on.

263,2020/03/11,Three Project 560 grantees present their work on areas in Bengaluru,"Bengaluru through your eyes

Does Jayanagar 3rd Block have an Egyptian connection? What is the story behind Bride Street? How did the stories and experiences of the children living at MGR Colony in Banashankari translate into art?

These were some of the questions asked and answered at the Unravelling Neighbourhood Stories presentation by three Project 560 grantees – Gayatri Chandrashekar, Sharanya Iyer and Pallavi Chander – organised by India Foundation for the Arts recently.

The idea behind the grant is to allow ordinary citizens to tell stories of their neighbourhood and the people themselves.

Creative arts therapy

Pallavi Chander, a creative arts therapist, worked with adolescent children of MGR Colony in Banashankari on an arts-based therapy intervention programme at Buguri Library that is still ongoing.

“I spent about four months at the library in 2017 and realised that the children were listening to stories and internalising them. As that happened, they wanted to talk about how these stories related to their own lives and how they were processing the issues that were coming up. That is when we felt that a therapeutic space would really benefit them. The creative arts therapy programme was set up in 2018.”

She added that it took time to establish certain things like confidentiality and being non-judgemental. The girls and boys had separate sessions. “For the girls, some of the things we looked at was gender, sexuality, personal histories. How do you deal with fear, how do you build strength through vulnerability?”

Pallavi said that one of the sessions with the girls that was a highlight was on menstruation.

“Most of them got their first period during our sessions and there is a ritual that they go through. The girls had a lot of questions like why do they give us all these things to eat, what is it about?”

With the boys, she said they looked at questions like what does it mean to be a boy, what does it mean to have power, and what are their aspirations? A session that stood out was one where they wanted to learn to cook. “This was something that really brought the boys together.”

At the end of nine months, both groups wanted to share their experiences with the community. The girls put up a performance on the story of Baba Yaga. a Russian folktale, and also came out with a book. The boys came out with a recipe book, Oota Aiyitha? Pallavi said, “This is an ongoing project. In year two, we took the performance into the community and it had a lot more involvement from them. The older children had a tuck shop with pani puri and rose milk and then they shared stories that had moved them for which they made puppets.”

Balochistan connection

Gayatri, a singer and journalist, peppered her presentation with her recollections of the city. It was after hearing about an Egyptian block in Jayanagar 3rd Block that she set out to find more. On talking to many people, she discovered that while there was no Egyptian Block, there was a Tareen Block, which had a connection to Balochistan.

Gayatri found out that one Ghouse Khan Tareen, who was employed in the Imperial Police Force, was transferred from Quetta to serve as a police officer under the Maharaja in Mysore State. She came to know that his grandson, Zaferulla Khan Tareen, is still practising as a doctor in nearby Basavangudi. And his daughters still live in Jayanagar. “After Ghose Khan passed away in his 40s, his son, Obeidulla, was given a job in the police on compassionate grounds. He, however, didn’t like it and resigned. His good friend was Shafi Mekhri, who was a well-known ophthalmologist in Bengaluru, who advised him to do an optometrist course and open a spectacle shop in City Market area. He made money and bought land in Jayanagar, Srirangapatna and Hoskote taluk and grew crops.”

Last September, Gayatri decided to do a musical presentation with the aid of some of her music students. “With that, I told the story through the mouths of others.”

Richmond Town Diaries

Sharanya’s project, Richmond Town Diaries, which involved 10 children and their mothers, began with the children wondering what were the stories behind names such as Curly Street and Alexandria Street.

Sharanya, who is an architect, said she began with asking questions such as how to get people to really experience and connect with a neighbourhood. “Of course, the idea was to see if the children could see what was around them, not as something they read in a history book but as something that they observed and responded to.” She added that this resulted in an art show and a walk, both of which were mostly driven by the children.

“We started with the interesting street names but we quickly reached a dead end as most of them were names of people. Some had stories such as Bride Street where brides came to find their prospective grooms.

We also thought that there should be diversity in terms of choosing street names that represented all the diverse cultures of Richmond Town and we were thinking of walkability for the children. So, we looked at the streets, maps, what changed or didn’t, and what could have been historic streets or landmarks and then we came up with a map, identifying five locations and in between spaces.”

The children went around with diaries noting down information and their observations. This was the basis for their artworks. “We chose a different medium for each of the artworks based on the location and what was relevant to it. For example, because the mosque had a lot of mirror mosaic, it was chosen for Johnson Market.”

Sharanya said it culminated with an exhibition day where they displayed the artworks.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/9h496z/article31039568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09bgmpallavijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/bengaluru-through-your-eyes/article31039570.ece
264,2020/03/11,655 State-cadre employees allotted back to TS power utilities,"The SC-appointed Dharmadhikari Committee issues supplementary to its “final report”

In yet another twist to the ongoing issue of division of the State-cadre employees between the power utilities of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, the Supreme Court appointed one-man Dharmadhikari Committee has allotted 655 employees from the AP utilities to Telangana, the same number it had allocated from Telangana to AP in its “final report” on December 26 last year.

In its supplementary report to the “final report” issued on Wednesday, Justice D.M. Dharmadhikari allocated 655 employees other than those relieved by Telangana utilities following the final report from AP utilities to Telangana with a direction to AP utilities to allow the 655 employees relieved by Telangana to join the duties in AP without break in their service.

The Dharmadhikari Committee has already identified and allocated 71 employees from AP utilities to Telangana – 30 from AP Transco to TS Transco, 26 from AP Genco to TS Genco and 15 from APSPDCL to TSSPDCL. It has asked the AP utilities to identify the remaining 584 employees and allocate them to Telangana by March 30.

“It is nothing but stirring up the hornet’s nest again as the supplementary orders are likely to create more confusion in the issue settled by the committee in December last. It will again cause a lot of heartburn among the employees in Telangana utilities who already feel discriminated even after the formation of Telangana since the supplementary orders practically amount to all 1,157 (AP-native) employees bing allotted back to Telangana”, said a senior official of Telangana.

The Dharmadhikari Committee held a meeting in New Delhi on February 23 with the sub-committee comprising the senior executives of the AP and Telangana utilities. The meeting was held following the Supreme Court direction to look into the plea of AP utilities and employees’ plea again as they had approached it in January complaining that the “final allocation” was not made in full accordance with the modalities finalised.

“It’s a huge injustice to Telangana employees again as the utilities here have to bear all the 1,157 AP-native employees, denying Telangana employees their due share in promotions and senior positions. In addition, Telangana utilities have already voluntarily taken 229 native employees then working in AP. We are planning to move the Supreme Court seeking justice,” president of Telangana State Power Engineers Association P. Ratnakar Rao told The Hindu.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/655-sstate-cadre-employees-allotted-back-to-telangana-power-utilities/article31043890.ece
265,2020/03/11,Take decision on school fees committee report by April 8: HC,"What was the State government doing for over two years on the report of the committee on school fees, the Telangana High Court sought to know on Wednesday.

Expressing dissatisfaction over the government not acting on the report of Osmania University former vice-chancellor Thirupathi Rao on school fees, the HC directed the government to take a decision on the committee’s recommendations by April 8. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy directed Advocate-General B.S. Prasad to file a report on the matter.

The bench was hearing a batch of PIL petitions on school fees. The government had constituted a committee headed by Thirupathi Rao on March 21, 2017. The committee presented its report on December 30, 2017. As the matter came up for hearing on Wednesday, the bench asked the AG about the status of the committee report.

“The report is under active consideration of the government,” the AG said. Three academic years had passed since the report was submitted and was the government still examining the report, the bench asked. When the CJ asked what the committee’s recommendations were, the AG replied the report was not readily available.

Unless the court learnt what the committee suggested on school fees structure, no direction could be passed on it, the Chief Justice said. The AG sought one month to convey the government’s stand on the matter. The bench, however, said that would be too late and instructed the government to convey to the court by April 8 its stand on the committee’s recommendations.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/take-decision-on-school-fees-committee-report-by-april-8-hc/article31043621.ece
266,2020/03/11,HC orders closure of polluting industries in Shastripuram,"Government directed to file report by April 7

The Telangana High Court on Wednesday directed the State government to close down over 200 polluting industrial units in Shastripuram of Katedan near Rajendranagar.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy instructed the GHMC and the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) to ensure all those industries were evacuated and power supply to them was stopped. The bench passed the direction after hearing a PIL plea filed by Vinay Palnitkar and M.A. Rasheed challenging the inaction of officials despite the plastic industrial unit in Shastripuram damaging environment. They stated that the official machinery of GHMC and Electricity department had remained mute spectators even as illegal industrial units mushroomed in the area.

The bench instructed the government to file a report before it by April 7 on the action initiated against officials of GHMC, PCB and Electricity department who had failed to check operation of such industrial units damaging the environment. The bench also directed the lower courts not to entertain any pleas filed by owners of polluting industries challenging the eviction orders.

GHMC Commissioner Lokesh Kumar and Deputy Commissioner Pradeep Kumar personally appeared before the court. While hearing the arguments, the bench sought to know from Mr Pradeep Kumar why he mentioned in his earlier affidavit that there were only three industries in Shastripuram area. The Commissioner’s affidavit stated that notices were issued to nearly 300 industrial units causing pollution there, the bench remarked.

“Your affidavit is a blatant lie. Let the GHMC Commissioner defend you,” the Chief Justice said. The bench asked Mr. Lokesh Kumar what was GHMC doing from 2012 to 2020 when the industrial units were being run and observed the civic body had kept quiet for eight years and washed of its hands by simply serving notices on those industries.

Mr. Lokesh Kumar admitted that no action was taken against the industrial units causing pollution for the past years and assured that stern action would be launched against them. Already, notices had been issued to them and all units would be evacuated after a month, he told the court.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-orders-closure-of-polluting-industries-in-shastripuram/article31043595.ece

268,2020/03/11,SCCL hands over ₹200 crore to SCR for Bhandrachalam-Sattupalli new line,"The Singareni Collieries Limited (SCCL) handed over a cheque for ₹200 crore to the South Central Railway (SCR) towards completion of the 54.10-km Bhadrachalam Road-Sattupalli new rail line project towards the year-end. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between both organisations at the Rail Nilayam on Wednesday.

SCR general manager Gajajan Mallya and SCCL chairman and managing director N. Sridhar signed the pact in the presence of top officials from the organisations. The SCCl has so far paid up to ₹365 crore of the ₹618.55 crore revised cost estimates for additional works, taking the total project cost to ₹927.94 crore, up from ₹704 crore. The railways’ share is ₹309.39 crore for the line which will be used for environment-friendly transport of coal from open cast mines around Sattupalli.

The project was cleared by the Railway Board in March, 2017, and the SCCL had then deposited ₹156.38 crore as per the initial cost estimate. About 90% of the 353 hectares of land acquisition for the project has already been completed with the support of the State government, said railway officers. There are about 10 major bridges along the route covering the Bhadradri-Kothagudem and Khammam districts, of which seven bridges are under progress.

Another 40 minor bridges, eight road-overbridges, 34 road-underbridges and three crossing stations have to be constructed. Once completed, the railway line would help in moving up to nine million tonnes of coal to Bhadrachalam for feeding power plants like Kothagudem thermal power station and Kondapalli thermal power station, they explained.

The railways would get a revenue of about ₹160 crore per annum and help in socio-economic growth of the districts concerned with rail connectivity and pollution control due to reduced dependence on road transport, said Mr. Mallya. The SCCL would extend total support towards early completion, said Mr. Sridhar.

269,2020/03/11,Godavari water released to Annapurna reservoir,"Farmers and officials offer flowers to the river

After a long wait, the Godavari water has reached Siddipet district, the native of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Finance Minister T. Harish Rao.

Godavari water from Kaleshwaram, which has reached Midmaniar, was released to Annapurna (Anantagiri) reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. This was located at the borders of both Sircilla and Siddipet districts.

A large number of farmers and officials gathered at the Anantagiri reservoir site and offered prayers and flowers to river Godavari. It was a celebration mood among the farmers who witnessed flow of water in huge quantity. Water gushed with heavy force bringing smiles on the faces of those who were present there.

About 2,800 cusecs of water was released on trail basis from one pump. The remaining pumps would be operated in the next 24 hours, depending on the situation. It was stated that about .85 tmcft water would be released now and the remaining water would be released within one week. As much as 2.5 tmcft water would be released into this reservoir.

“Some of the oustees are yet to vacate their houses at Anantagiri side and all the payments were made to them. As now water is gushing, we are sure that they would vacate shortly. Remaining water would be released in the next one week,” said an official involved in the process.

270,2020/03/11,Land acquisition for MGBS-Falaknuma metro stretch soon: KTR,"The State government will shortly commence the process for acquiring land for completion of the 5-km stretch of metro rail between MGBS and Falaknuma.

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao told the Legislative Assembly that 93 religious and sensitive structures fall within the 5-km metro route in Old City of which 18 were likely to be affected because of road widening and metro alignment. These structures were, however, proposed to be saved using engineering solutions.

The Minister was replying to a query by Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen member Syed Ahmed Pasha Quadri during Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly. Mr. Pasha Quadri said people in Old City were eagerly waiting for the commencement of metro rail works in the area.

Stressing the need to protect the religious and sensitive structures that were likely to be affected by the project, he wanted the government to communicate a specific time frame by which the works would commence. Mr. Rama Rao said the government was serious about ensuring effective public transport system and had, therefore, allocated huge funds for taking up infrastructure works in the GHMC area.

The MLAs representing the constituencies in Old City should coordinate with the officials concerned in ensuring acquisition of the land required for the project and the government was committed to start the works on a war footing. To another question, the Minister said the L&T, which was entrusted the metro rail project, the largest in the PPP mode, had been asked to provide monthly passes to metro passengers, and the government would also consider the request to extend timings of metro trains beyond 10 p.m.

Asked about the Centre’s contribution to the project, he said it had sanctioned ₹1,450 crore as its contribution towards viability gap funding. Of this, ₹1,200 crore had been released so far.

To a question by TRS member K.P. Vivekananda about the scope for extending metro rail project between JNTU and Hi-Tec City, Mr. Rama Rao said the government was considering an elevated BRTS corridor on the route while introducing tram was also being examined to ease the traffic congestion in the area. Launch of works on setting up of bike stations received an enthusiastic response from a majority of the passengers and works for setting up of around 20 multi-level parking complexes would also be taken up soon.

On the metro works connecting the airport, he said the detailed project report of airport metro express corridor was under examination and a decision regarding its implementation would be taken soon.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/land-acquisition-for-mgbs-falaknuma-metro-stretch-soon-ktr/article31042001.ece
271,2020/03/11,Startup rolls out eco-friendly tractor,"Expected to benefit farmers and the agriculture segment

City-based startup Cellestial E-Mobility has rolled out its first prototype electric tractor, which is not only eco-friendly and cost-effective but also gives the same power as that of its diesel counterpart besides selling cheaper by at least ₹1 lakh.

The e-tractor is equipped with features like battery swapping, regenerative braking and also helps power an UPS. The charging mechanism of the Lithium ion battery is through any normal AC outlet with six hours for single phase 16 Amps outlet and can also be charged double quick in two hours with an industrial infrastructure set up.

Talking to the media at the launch on Wednesday, founders Siddhartha Durairajan and Syed Mubasheer said the product, which was under trials for the past four months, will benefit farmers and the agriculture segment in general.

“E-tractor is zero-emission with its 6HP engine equivalent to 21HP diesel tractor and can be used for horticultural and greenhouse works or for moving goods within factories, warehouses and hauling baggage in airports. It can cover 75 km on a single charge, has maximum power of 18 HP, 53 NM peak torque and can reach a speed of up to 20 kmph,” they said.

The founders claimed that if the average cost of a diesel tractor is about ₹6 lakh, this e-tractor costs ₹5 lakh. Running cost, too, is significantly lower — a conventional 21HP diesel tractor costs about ₹150 per hour whereas the Cellestial E-Mobility tractor will cost ₹20-₹35 an hour. Battery can be swapped after five to eight years.

“We want to bust this myth that electric vehicles are expensive to buy and maintain. We are in a position to make 100 tractors every month and that can be scaled to 200 units. Our target is to build 8,000 tractors in the next three years,” said director-marketing Midhun Kumar.

About 8.78 lakh tractors overall were sold in 2019 and market has sufficient potential for e-tractors with the policy makers too eager to give a fillip to the industry. The firm began operations in May last year with an investment of $200,000 from a Singapore based angel investor and is in talks to raise $6 million to $8 million in the next six months with plans for a light commercial vehicle and an eight-seater on the same platform, they added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/7xrotz/article31041950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11TRACTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/startup-rolls-out-eco-friendly-tractor/article31041927.ece
272,2020/03/11,Indian Oil begins pumping out BS-VI fuels in Telangana,"Most outlets have been dispensing them for over a month now, rest by April 1 deadline, says Executive Director R.S.S. Rao

National oil marketing company (OMC) Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has begun supplying automobile fuels conforming to the cleaner, BS-VI emission standards at almost all its 1,100-odd retail outlets in Telangana.

“For the past one-and-a-half months we have been supplying BS-VI fuels. Most of the retail outlets today are dispensing BS-VI,” R.Sravan S.Rao, Executive Director and State Head, IOC, for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, who took charge recently, said on Wednesday.

A multi-layered process

The remaining outlets will also start dispensing BS-VI fuels by the April 1 national deadline, he said, seeking to explain how it is a multi-layered process, from production at the refineries to shipping products to the bulk storage terminals for onward supply to retail outlets. “It takes time for the underground tanks at the retail outlets to be prepared to receive the BS-VI fuels,” he added.

The oil industry in Telangana, including the private oil companies such as Essar, registered sales of 1,192 thousand metric tonnes of petrol and 3,854 TMT of diesel in 2018-19. In the current fiscal, comparatively, petrol sales had increased, while there has been a small degrowth in diesel, Mr. Rao pointed out.

Not just in Telangana, but in many other parts of the country too Indian Oil has started dispensing BS-VI fuels ahead of the April 1 deadline, for all oil companies, to move away from the BS-IV standard petrol and diesel, he told the media here. The BS-IV norms were implemented in the country in 2017.

A marginal price hike

On the likely increase in the pump prices, Mr.Rao said there would be a marginal increase, “which would not burden the customer”.

Conceived and implemented by the government on a mission mode, the shift to BSVI, by skipping the BSV stage, came amid deteriorating ambient air quality levels in several parts of the country, especially the National Capital Region (NCR), where BS VI fuels are being dispensed since April 2018.

According to Mr.Rao, BS-VI fuels are ultra-clean and adhere to stringent global standards of fuel quality parameters. Primarily, in BS-VI, the sulphur content has been reduced to 10 PPM (parts per million) from 50 PPM in BS-IV. This also leads to reduction in other harmful exhaust emissions like NOx, CO, HC and particulate matter. Under standard test conditions, the emission norms of BS-VI diesel is as good or even superior to that of compressed natural gas (CNG), he added.

A ₹ 28k-crore investment

Together, the national oil marketing companies – Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) being the other two – have invested ₹ 28,000 crore on upgrading facilities at their refineries for producing BSVI standard fuels. Indian Oil alone invested ₹ 17,000 crore, Mr. Rao said.

The projects to make the cleaner fuel at its refineries included installation of new units like Diesel Hydrotreater, Hydro De-sulphurization, Gasoline Isomerisation and revamp of existing process and utility facilities across all refineries. In doing so, the company used technologies developed in-house in tune with the Make in India Initiative.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ioc-begins-pumping-out-bs-vi-fuels-in-telangana/article31040716.ece

HMWS&SB is keen on enhancing the operational efficiency by leveraging new technologies.

From that context, the event is expected to serve as a platform providing a peek into solutions that either are cost-effective or novel and efficient for as many as 10 problems the Board has identified for the hackathon.

With the advent of IoT and LORAWAn, the thinking in HMWS&SB is that a lot of manual operation can be made smart and efficient, T-Hub said in the call for applications for the hackathon. Pipeline leakage detection; water quality monitoring; STP monitoring; smart water meters; smart valves for water supply; and meter reading without entering the premises figure in the list of 10 problems.

Technology solutions to curb encroachments of water bodies and assess damage to manholes and convey information on the water level and gas composition inside the manhole are other problems. The Board also wants a technology solution to address the issue of unauthorised opening of septic tanks.

Private agencies, which have been outsourced with maintenance of major road stretches in the city, are yet to take over the responsibility of their cleaning and upkeep.

As part of the agreement between GHMC and the selected agencies, the latter are also responsible for daily sweeping of roads that they would maintain, and footpath upkeep.

Though all the stretches totalling up to 709 kilometres have been already handed over, the agencies are yet to take up daily sweeping. They had sought time up to March 10 for planning logistics, till when GHMC was to take care of the sanitation on these stretches.

This led to some confusion in a few zones, as GHMC sanitation teams had been diverted from these road stretches to other areas.

“The agencies were to merely bring in sweeping machines, and clean the roads. Sanitation on these stretches is not their job as per the agreement. It will remain with GHMC,” an official said on condition of anonymity. Now, officials are in the rethinking mode, as sweeping machines alone cannot account for sanitation. If GHMC sanitation teams are to remain in same locations despite mechanical sweeping, the clause pertaining to road cleanliness may be removed from the agreement altogether, officials say. Till a decision is taken, the GHMC will handle sanitation.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/private-agencies-yet-to-begin-sweeping-roads/article31035206.ece
279,2020/03/11,Expect water tankers in 48 hours,"Water Board to deploy 230 additional tankers to meet extra demand in summer

The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) is making efforts to ensure delivery of drinking water tankers within 48 hours after receiving the booking.

HMWS&SB Managing Director M. Dana Kishore issued necessary instructions towards speedy delivery of tankers at a review meeting on summer action plan here on Tuesday. The implementation of the summer action plan will cost ₹50 crore.

Reassuring about availability of sufficient water in reservoirs to see the summer through, Mr. Dana Kishore said that a total of 230 additional tankers would be deployed to meet the extra demand in summer.

Further, 23 more filling stations and 110 filling points would be arranged so that tankers are not delayed unduly.

Mr. Dana Kishore has asked officials to identify locations experiencing power cuts and keep extra mini power generators available at the respective filling stations.

Ten special officers are being deployed to monitor the supply and see that no locality experiences drinking water problems during summer. These officers will tour their respective areas every morning, and locate issues pertaining to drinking water supply network, so that alternative supply through tankers may be arranged.

Third party inspection teams too will be constituted with 100 members to visit the areas already facing drinking water issues, and take necessary action.

Already, tail end areas and localities with low water pressure have been identified, Mr. Dana Kishore said, and asked the officials to examine the working condition of bore wells and get them repaired.

“Repairs should also be carried out on static tanks in problematic locations, and establish new tanks wherever needed.

280,2020/03/11,Hyderabad boy scales highest Oz peak,"Expedition was to garner support for Australian bushfire victims

Amgoth Tukaram has scaled new heights. The 22-year-old from the city conquered Mt. Kosciuszko, the highest peak in Australia, on Tuesday.

Like always, he did so with a message for a social cause — appealing to support the victims of the forest fire which swept across Australia, in collaboration with the JET Helping Hands, a registered charity organisation of Chinna Jeeyar Swami of Hyderabad.

“It was a conscious effort to scale the peak on Holi to spread the message of joy, peace and harmony, and to inspire youth,” Tukaram said.

“I am grateful to Swamiji for his support and also to JET Australia Foundation and JET Helping Hands teams for making this trip successful,” he added.

Significantly, Mr. Tukaram will attend the opening ceremony of the spiritual leader’s JET Centre in Melbourne on March 12 as chief guest.

For the record, Tukaram is the youngest mountaineer from India who has scaled five of the seven toughest and highest peaks in the world — Mt. Killimanjaro (19,308 ft) in Africa on July 4, 2018; Mt. Everest (29,029 ft) in Nepal on May 22, 2019; Mt. Elbrus (18,510 ft) in Russia on July 27, 2019; Mt. Aconcagua (22,837 ft) in South America on January 26, 2020 and Mt Kosciusko on Tuesday.

“It is my dream to scale all the highest mountain peaks in the world,” says Tukaram, who hails from Thakkalapally tanda of Yacharam mandal in Rangareddy district.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hgohpj/article31035020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10Tukaram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-boy-scales-highest-oz-peak/article31034998.ece

282,2020/03/11,"Amid COVID-19 scare, UoH steps up precautionary measures on campus","Pamphlets pasted across campus; NoC mandatory for faculty and students travelling abroad

The COVID-19 scare seems to have gripped University of Hyderabad (UoH).

Apart from developing communication material such as pamphlets and posters and public service announcement (PSAs) on precautions to be taken, the varsity administration is also trying to identify faculty members and students with a travel history to coronavirus-affected countries or are showing symptoms of the infectious disease.

Students, too, are helping spread awareness by designing posters on the precautionary steps.

The measures are important as nearly 500 faculty members, 5,500 students pursuing PhD, masters and integrated courses, 1,000 non-teaching staff and their family members live in hostels and quarters spread across the 1,700-acre campus in Gachibowli.

“We are looking at a community of over 10,000 population, including a floating population of contract workers,” said Vinod Pavarala, official spokesperson of UoH. The students live in 23 hostels, use common bathrooms and sinks. They have three meals a day at the mess and canteens.

While faculty members travel to other countries on teaching assignment or for research work, students go abroad to attend conferences or as part of student exchange programmes.

If any faculty member has to travel abroad for official or academic purpose, they have to seek a no-objection certificate (NoC) from the university administration. If students are to go out of the country, clearance from their course supervisors has been made mandatory

After COVID cases were detected in India, a committee comprising four officials from the UoH administration and health centre was formed on March 3 to focus on precautionary measures. The committee members are getting the list of NoCs and clearance certificates, which will help them identify those who visited any of the affected countries, and have any symptoms.

Committee member Vasuki Belavad said they have recorded PSAs in Telugu and Hindi to disseminate information among non-faculty members living on campus.

“The PSAs will be broadcast on campus community radio. Besides, the audio files will be circulated on WhatsApp and other social media platforms,” Mr Vasuki said, adding that a special page which has information on coronavirus is part of the UoH’s web page.

Other measures includes directing food handlers at the mess and canteens to wear masks while at work. The UoH health centre is in contact with Gandhi Hospital’s administration.

Second lab at OGH

The Central government has approved a second laboratory in Telangana to test samples for coronavirus, announced Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Tuesday. The existing lab at Osmania General Hospital will be used for the purpose.

Currently, samples collected in State are tested at Venereal Disease Research Laboratory lab in Gandhi Hospital. Reagents will be procured from National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Report submitted

The 12-member Telangana team, which returned from Kerala on Sunday after studying how COVID-19 was contained and managed there, has submitted its report. They had visited General Hospital and Medical College in Trivandrum and spoke to Kerala Health Minister K.K. Shailaja. The team noted 15 committees were formed at State and district levels to contain the virus.

Key teams among them were that of surveillance, call centre management, infrastructure (isolation and facilities) and documentation. Isolation wards were established in Primary Health Centres (PHC) in Kerala.

Mr Rajender said since the virus has not spread here, isolation wards at PHCs are not required, but they have been arranged at district hospitals.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/8e9bcj/article31034946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10-UOHCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/amid-covid-19-scare-uoh-steps-up-precautionary-measures-on-campus/article31034928.ece
283,2020/03/11,"Yoga can have positive effect on sperm quality, shows CCMB-AIIMS study","Men enrolled for pilot study practised asanas, breathing techniques and meditation daily for 21 days

Traditional practice of yoga has positive effects on sperm quality, and its benefits can be correlated with physical and chemical changes in the DNA, without changing the sequencing, in the sperm, according to a pilot study by Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.

While an unhealthy lifestyle and social habits are known to have adverse effects on the sperm, resulting in a decline in male reproductive health in recent years, collaborative effort from scientists and doctors in these institutions has shown that Yoga Based Lifestyle Interventions (YBLI) improves sperm motility.

The study published in ‘Andrologia’ journal, offers a first-of-its-kind analysis of the effect of YBLI in infertile men and shows reduction in seminal oxidative stress and increases fertilising potential of sperm following practice of yoga.

YBLI, in this study, included physical movements and postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama) and meditation (dhyana) practised for an hour each day for 21 days. This led to improved sperm quality in the patients enrolled in the study. Using state-of-the-art DNA sequencing analysis, the study has demonstrated a resetting of the sperm ‘methylome’ -pattern of chemical changes called DNA methylation, in the yoga practitioners.

Methylome, known to directly control the expression of genes, in this case is found to be associated with changes in nearly 400 genes, including several genes known to play a role in male fertility, spermatogenesis and embryo implantation.

It is because unlike DNA sequence, which an individual is born with, genetic systems can have changes influenced by environmental factors and these are reversible as shown here. “Since this pilot study was carried out on a small number of individuals, a larger scale investigation and further research on the effects of YBLI on male infertility will be necessary. The genes identified in this study will be useful for such focused investigations,” said CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yoga-can-have-positive-effect-on-sperm-quality-shows-ccmb-aiims-study/article31034902.ece

285,2020/03/11,Restoring lost glory of Premamati’s tomb,"Dome of Qutb Shahi-era danseuse’s tomb rid of grime, musty odour

On Tuesday, as visitors walked past the freshly laid lawn and stepped inside the dome of Premamati, the morning sunlight bounced off the floor and lit up the insides. The accumulated grime over the years was gone, it was no longer dark; also gone was the musty damp odour. Only a few roosting pigeons bobbed about from the ledges above the sarcophagus on which the lines about Premamati were etched in Nastaliq, a style of Arabic calligraphy.

“From eternity Premamati was a rose of paradise. A rose of Paradise was from eternity, Premamati”.

According to historians, Premamati was a companion of Abdullah Qutb Shah, the seventh king of the Qutb Shahi dynasty who ruled between 1626 and 1672. She was fabled to be a danseuse and was powerful enough to build a mosque just outside the Golconda fort.

Unfinished mosque

The stone mosque remains unfinished as Premamati died in 1662 when Abdullah Qutb Shah was at the height of his power.

“Much of it is original lime stucco work. Wherever it was damaged, we restored. The dark lines etched in the recesses of the mortar set off against the white just got a clean-up,” says Ratish Nanda of Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC) about the conservation effort on the two tombs.

Women who held sway

The tombs of two women who retained their identities were honoured with a space inside the royal necropolis of the dynasty. Photographs taken before the conservation work began show domes that are covered with moss and big peepal trees.

“The trees led to seepage damaging the inside of the dome. The plinth was in a dilapidated condition. Stones in the plinth were missing both the vertical as well as edging stones. Even the finial of Taramati’s dome was tilting as the wooden support inside it had rotted,” informed Prashant Banerjee of AKTC. A freshly laid walking path matching the old contours takes visitors to the tombs.

Interestingly, while Premamati’s dome is 1.5 times bigger that of Taramati’s, both of them look equal due to the different sizes of the finials. Taramati, whose sarcophagus has no inscription, is fabled to be a companion of Sultan Muhammad Qutb Shah. A dancing pavilion built in her honour outside the Golconda Fort still exists in the location and has been turned into a convention centre. “At places, the concrete plaster was two inches thick. On the ceiling, it was three to four inches thick. The slopes have also been corrected and now there will be no ingress or water stagnation for at least a century,” said Mr. Banerjee.

‘Delighted’ at efforts

US Ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster visited the Qutb Shahi tombs complex to mark the completion of year-long conservation efforts by the AKTC on the twin mausoleums of Taramati and Premamati. The conservation effort was aided by the US under its Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation.

“This is my third visit to the Qutb Shahi tombs. It looks so beautiful today. It has progressed tremendously. I am delighted,” he said, posing against the backdrop of the twin mausoleums of the two courtesans of Qutb Shahi rulers. “It is so important to the US to help restore the cultural heritage of India. We had three ambassadors fund grants over the years,” said Mr. Juster. He was referring to the grant that helped excavation to the north of Qutb Shahi Hammam and another that led to conservation of Maha Laqa Bai Chanda’s tomb near Moula Ali.

“We got a grant of $1,00,000 (about ₹70 lakh) and the two mausoleums have been restored using the fund,” said Mr. Nanda.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/zclonw/article31034597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KRAQUTB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/restoring-lost-glory-of-premamatis-tomb/article31034575.ece

290,2020/03/11,Kochi Corporation’s failure to keep road repair deadline annoys Kerala High Court,"Civic body says government is not giving sufficient funds

The Kerala High Court on Tuesday expressed its displeasure over the failure of the Kochi Corporation to repair the roads in the city within the deadline set by the government.

Justice Devan Ramachandran said that it was assured that the repair of the roads would be completed by January 31. But the roads were still in bad shape.

Counsel for the Corporation submitted that lack of funds had affected the road repair works. The government was not providing sufficient funds for the works, he alleged.

The Executive Engineer and four assistant executive engineers of the Corporation informed the court that only a Plan fund of ₹18 crore was available with the Corporation to carry out repair works.

The Corporation did not have its own funds even as it needed ₹54 crore for the works. As result of the financial crunch, they were not able to complete the repair works in time. Besides, it did not have any contingency fund. The contractors did not come forward to take up the works as the Corporation owed them arrears.

The court pointed out that the condition of the footpaths in the city was pathetic. In fact, there had been no footpath from Kaloor to Kacherippady junction. The footpath on the Kaloor-Elamakkara road at Kaloor junction had been converted into an autorikshaw stand, it pointed out.

The government pleader submitted that the Corporation had not made any request for additional funds from the government. A project was being planned to improve the footpaths.

The amicus curiae in the case submitted that the Corporation should set up a contingency fund as otherwise it would not be able to undertake immediate repair works of roads.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/necnmj/article31037014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11KIROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-corporations-failure-to-keep-road-repair-deadline-annoys-kerala-high-court/article31037016.ece

Church authorities are keeping their options open with what appeared to be a spurt in the number of people afflicted by the dreaded fever in the State this week.

“We will follow the instructions from the health authorities,” said Father Varghese Manavalan, vicar of the Malayattoor church, which is at the centre of visit by an estimated six million people a year.

The visits peak during the month-long Lenten season and Easter celebrations.

Father Antony Thachara, rector of the pilgrim shrine in Kannamaly, said that the church leaders were in touch with the district administration. “We are watching the situation and will follow instructions in the greater interest of public health,” said Fr. Thachara.

He said preparations for the feast of St. Joseph had begun in January as usual much before the coronavirus threat spread across the world.

Fr. Varghese said that the church was in communication with the district administration.

More than six million people visit the Malayattoor Mount church and nearby shrines during the Lenten season, culminating in the Holy Week, he said.

At the same time, the church was keen not to create any panic over the health threat, he said.

Social media platform would also be used to spread the message and create awareness among people, Ms. Jain said.

The council has decided to slap fine on those who spit in public places and dump waste on city roads as such unhealthy practices could cause public health hazards and spread of the disease. Dr. Soumya, the nodal officer of the Mental Health Programme of the General Hospital, clarified doubts of councillors.

The Mayor informed the council that she had written to the District Police Chief (Kochi city) seeking action against those who were spreading rumours and unscientific and false messages regarding cure and preventive measures.

Though some of the corporation councillors came to the meeting wearing face masks, they removed them after Dr. Soumya clarified on the segments of society which needed to wear masks. “Only those who are in direct contact with patients and infected ones need to wear it,” she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-corporation-to-provide-protective-gear-to-staff/article31035052.ece
298,2020/03/11,Sailor self-quarantines following suspected case on train,"Navy Petty Officer reaches city from Lucknow by Raptisagar Express

A Petty Officer of the Navy chose to remain self-quarantined at home after being told about a suspected COVID-19 case in the railway coach in which he travelled from Lucknow to Kochi.

It was on March 8 that Petty Officer Jitendra Kumar Prajapati, posted at the Anti-Submarine Warfare School at INS Venduruthy in Kochi, reached the city by Raptisagar Express. As he reached his residence, he received a call from the coach attendant — he travelled in AC 3-tier — who told him about a passenger in a nearby sleeper coach having been isolated for suspected COVID-19 symptoms.

The sailor immediately reached Ernakulam General Hospital after informing the naval authorities and submitted himself for COVID-19 testing as a precautionary measure despite being asymptomatic, said Commander Sridhar Warrier, Defence PRO (Kochi). “Post-testing, he returned home and self-quarantined in accordance with the health advisories issued by the Southern Naval Command in Kochi,” Cdr Warrier said.

The command had earlier sensitised the personnel to be cautious and observant of basic personal hygiene, encouraging them to volunteer to test and self-quarantine in case of doubt.

Meanwhile, the person, who was suspected to have contracted COVID-19 and was deboarded in Chennai tested negative for the virus. Petty Officer Prajapati also tested negative. Railway officials said they had informed passengers in the rake about the suspected case and eventually disinfected the rake before its return journey.

The Southern Naval Command, meanwhile, extended its awareness drive to the nearby Vathuruthy and Cheriya Kadamakkudy villages where it had taken up some post-flood rehab and rebuilding.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sailor-self-quarantines-following-suspected-case-on-train/article31035046.ece
299,2020/03/11,The real McCoy,"Over the past month, jazz fans have had a double shock with the death of two great pianists. On February 10, the talented Lyle Mays, best known for his work with guitarist Pat Metheny, passed away at 66. Last week, we lost the unique McCoy Tyner, one of the most influential players of the instrument.

Pure music

Tyner is best known for being a member of the great saxophonist John Coltrane’s famed 1960s quartet, along with bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Elvin Jones. Their 1965 album, A Love Supreme is considered a milestone, whereas the contributions of Tyner, Jones and bassist Steve Davis on the earlier track ‘My Favorite Things’ are legendary.

Tyner, who was 81, has been regarded as one of the unique jazz piano voices of the 1960s and thereafter, along with Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul of Weather Report, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett and Joe Sample of the Jazz Crusaders. He was staunch believer in acoustic instrumentation, and stayed clear of electronic keyboards and synthesisers. The story goes that despite the Coltrane quartet’s popularity in the first half of the 1960s, Tyner was unhappy with the loud direction the band was taking. After quitting, he released many albums both as leader or sideman.

All time greats

For those who haven’t followed his work after the Coltrane era, I’ve chosen five albums to begin with, with a mention of one or two landmark tracks from each. All these recordings are vastly different in terms of sub-genre and sound, but yet reflect the man’s true genius. This is, but a part-representation of Tyner’s glorious career.

The first choice has to be the 1967 set The Real McCoy, where Tyner is joined by the marvellous saxophonist Joe Henderson, bassist Ron Carter and drummer Jones. Though the trance-like ‘Passion Dance’ is a concert favourite, listeners should check out the calm and beautiful ‘Search For Peace’.

Next up is the 1974 album Sama Layuca, that features different types of saxophones, oboe, flute and vibraphone. The 16-minute closer ‘Paradox’ is absolutely pure genius. On the 1977 recording Supertrios, Tyner divides work between two rhythm sections, and begins with Antonio Carlos Jobim’s ‘Wave’.

Cut to 1985, and Tyner teamed up with alto saxophonist Jackie McLean on It’s About Time. The funk-driven title track was popular, but we would go for the pure romance of ‘You Taught My Heart To Sing’. Finally, we have another collaboration with violinist Stephane Grappelli on the 1990 album One On One. Mostly containing adaptations of older tunes, this has stunning coordination between the two greats. The take on Coltrane’s ‘Mr PC’ especially is a treat.

All through, Tyner set an example with his technique, soul and improvisation. As trumpeter Wynton Marsalis rightly said in his tribute, “There isn’t a quality pianist who’s playing the music today who can’t reach for some McCoy in their sound.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/yhyurb/article31042822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bm-pg4-music-column-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-real-mccoy/article31042823.ece
300,2020/03/11,‘This is the longest journey from me to myself’,"Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty will conduct a master class on bandishes

Torch-bearer of the Patiala-Kasur gharana, Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty will impart advanced training to a selected group of Indian music students as part of an educational initiative by the NCPA. To select participants for this workshop, the NCPA has invited applications from across the country, though a preference will be given to those who have at least been awarded a ‘B’ grade by All India Radio.

The workshop’s primary focus is on the presentation aspect of the bandish in classical and semi-classical music. A bandish in Indian classical music translates into a composition or a song composed in a particular raga. Though all bandishes, are songs but not all songs are bandishes, believes the Padma Bhushan awardee. “The salient characteristics of a raga is very transparent in a bandish of the particular raga,” says Chakrabarty.

Through this workshop, Chakrabarty wants to develop the idea of presenting a bandish with one’s own creativity. Indian classical music especially the Hindustani music is known for the improvisations it allows the artists to do while presenting a particular raga. “The participants for the workshop are selected by NCPA. Most of them have been attending this workshop for last three years and are serious in learning and performing [Indian Classical music],” says the musician.

Chakrabarty has trained with legendary musicians, Pandit Gyan Prakash Ghosh and Ustaad Munawar Ali Khan. “All the ragas are living; they move, they talk with the artist. It is the responsibility of the artist to know how to see ones inner-self,” says Chakrabarty stressing on the fact that guru-shishya parampra is the best way to impart the knowledge of Indian classical music. “In other words this is the longest journey from me to myself. The guru gives us enlightenment through his experiences.”

Though a performing artist of the Patiala Kasur gharana, Chakrabarty has never confined his singing to one gharana. His singing often comprises of compositions from various other gharanas like — Agra, Kirana, Lucknow, Gwalior, Jaipur and Delhi. “I think that an artist is always enriched when one has an exposure of different styles. The whole of India is my gharana,” he says. “I am an Indian musician.” About the young generation of musicians he says, “Among them, at least three dozen are very well-known young maestros. One of them, Anal Chatterjee is coming with me to this workshop,” Chakrabarty says.

The workshop will take place from March 11 to 13, at NCPA, Nariman Point.

301,2020/03/11,Several airlines cancel flights to West Asia,"Air India stops operating wide-bodied aircraft from Karipur

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak globally, several airline companies have either cancelled indefinitely or temporary suspended their services to West Asia and also to domestic destinations from the Calicut International Airport.

As of now, 31 international flights and seven domestic flights have been cancelled over the past one week even as several Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC) nations are adopting immigration-related measures to contain the epidemic. Saudia (Saudi Arabian Airlines) has cancelled its flights to both Jeddah and Riyadh.

SpiceJet has cancelled its flights to Jeddah via Bengaluru. Similarly, Oman Air has cancelled eight flights from March 1 to 11, K. Srinivasa Rao, Airport Director, told The Hindu on Wednesday.

He said Air India Express has cancelled flights to Kuwait and Doha. Likewise, Indigo has cancelled all its flights to Doha. Estimates are being prepared to ascertain the exact dip in the arrival and departure of especially international passengers from West Asia. “The fall now stood at 22.7% when compared to December last,” Mr. Rao said.

Air India had commenced operating its jumbo flights to Jeddah from February 17 after a gap of five years. But the wide-bodied aircraft has been replaced till March 28. Now the national carrier is operating the narrow-bodied Airbus A320 Neo from its existing fleet following the shortfall in the number of passengers. It was operating Boeing 747-400 aircraft initially.

The demand has fallen so badly that some airline companies are trying to woo customers with discounted fares. But meetings and conferences have been cancelled. Also, families planning to travel abroad for the summer vacation has cancelled their ticket.

The GCC countries have issued orders for quarantining passengers who have visited China, Hong Kong and Iran, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Countries such as Kuwait have banned the entry of nationals from the countries including India in the 14 days prior to travel to that country. Oman has also banned nationals of China, Iran and Italy. But it is quarantining passengers arriving from Japan or Singapore.

302,2020/03/11,Mechanical ventilators not functioning at MCH,"Emergency operation theatre functioning without two machines for a month now

Two mechanical ventilators at the emergency operation theatre attached to the casualty ward of Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, are reportedly not functioning for around a month. Doctors are now forced to resort to manual methods to provide breathing support to patients undergoing anaesthesia.

The operation theatre at the hospital works round the clock, all 365 days. A mechanical ventilator helps patients breathe when they are not able to do it properly on their own, especially during surgeries. Its main benefit is that the doctor can control the equipment in tandem with the condition of the patient.

Hospital sources said that both the machines being used while giving anaesthesia during surgeries at the casualty ward stopped functioning within a span of a month. Now, the doctors are using manual ventilators or self-inflating bags to provide breathing support. According to them, this takes more time. The patients may also have to be under sedation for long.

In manual ventilation, the gas inside the bag is force-fed through a one-way valve to the patient and there is a chance of it coming out. However, in mechanical ventilation, the gas is pushed to the lungs through the airways. “In a day, around 15-20 patients who are admitted to the casualty ward need emergency major surgeries, a majority of whom require ventilator support while undergoing anaesthesia. Accident victims or those undergoing neurosurgery or general surgery need it the most. We cannot afford not to have mechanical ventilator support for long,” said the sources.

A high number of complex emergency surgeries are done at the casualty ward here and patients from across north Kerala depend on it.

However, Fijul Komu, Superintendent (Casualty), told The Hindu on Wednesday that steps had been taken to ensure that patients were not troubled. “Both the machines are expected to resume functioning in another two weeks,” he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/mechanical-ventilators-not-functioning-at-mch/article31042260.ece

Ambedkar, has said that while the Muslims are awake to the danger posed by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the Dalits and Adivasis should also raise their voice against it.

Speaking at the launch of the Bhim Vahana Yatra, a Statewide yatra to create awareness on the Constitution, organised by the Dalit, Adivasi, Stree Pouravakasha Koottayma, here on Tuesday, he said the new citizenship law would hurt the Dalits and Adivasis just as much as it would the Muslims.

“Of the 19 lakh people who could not make it to the National Register of Citizens, four lakh are Muslims. But 7 lakh are Dalits and Adivasis,” he said adding that a lie was being propagated that the new Act would not affect the Dalits and Adivasis.

There are about 10 lakh people belonging to nomadic tribes and they do not possess any documents to prove their nativity, said Mr. Prakash.

As per the Constitution, a person is an Indian if born in India. But this new law is asking for proof, he said.

306,2020/03/11,Kozhikode Corporation to maintain alert against bird flu,"Chicken, pet stalls within 10-km radius of affected areas ordered shut

The councillors of Kozhikode Corporation have been directed to actively participate in the Health Department’s efforts to prevent the spread of avian influenza and novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the city.

Mayor Thottathil Raveendran issued the direction at the Corporation Council meeting on Tuesday in the wake of complaints from the Chief Veterinary Officer about councillors not cooperating with health officials who visited various wards to cull birds.

Health Officer R.S. Gopakumar said he was stopped from culling birds in one farm by its owner, who demanded that the birds could not be killed unless they were tested positive for avian influenza.

Later, the Mayor said all possible steps were being taken and the health wing of the Corporation was working in full swing to prevent the spread of the disease. The Health Officer said all pet birds within one kilometre radius of the place where the disease was spotted were being culled. Chicken and pet stalls have been ordered to be closed within a 10-km radius for the sake of surveillance.

Well-cooked chicken

Meanwhile, it was safe to eat well-cooked chicken sold at restaurants, he added.

He urged them not to panic over the mass death of birds as the rising temperature was one of the reasons for it.

However, the samples of every dying bird were being collected and sent for testing. So far the test results had been negative for flu in all such birds, he added.

Water crisis

A large number of councillors demanded immediate action with regard to the water crisis experienced in many parts of the city recently. They pointed out that the Kerala Water Authority’s supply was disrupted in some parts, while water from pipelines was being wasted elsewhere. The Mayor said the strike by KWA contractors, who had not received their payment for a long time, was the reason for the crisis and promised he would take up the issue directly with the Minister for Water Resources.

Street lights

The councillors also protested against the delay in work related to the conversion of street lights into LED, undertaken by the Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation.

IUML councillor K.T. Beeran Koya said the work was too slow and the light was not bright enough in places where the conversion had already been completed. BJP councillor Satheesh Kumar too raised a similar complaint.

Mr. Raveendran said the delay was due to the additional fitting of equipment to control voltage fluctuation and that the 15-watt bulbs initially fitted were now being converted into 20-watt and more.

310,2020/03/11,World Kidney Day: 'Rise in chronic kidney disease among youth due to poor lifestyle',"Experts take stock ahead of World Kidney Day

Ahead of World Kidney Day, doctors at Madurai Kidney Centre and Transplantation Research Institute and Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC) on Wednesday expressed concern over rise in the number of youngsters diagnosed with chronic kidney disease each year due to poor lifestyle.

At a press meet, Centre and Institute director and chief nephrologist T. Dhinakaran said chronic kidney disease slowly creeped up on individuals without any major symptoms. “It is important to keep in mind that patients who cannot undergo transplant need to be on dialysis.”

Peritoneal dialysis (PD) a home-based procedure, would help patients with the disease. It involved taking out waste from the body with the help of a cleansing fluid called dialysate put into the lining of the belly through a catheter. Through the tube, the fluid was then alternately washed in and out of the abdomen drawing out the impurities. Thus, in this form of dialysis, blood was not pumped out of the body. It could be performed by the patient or family member after proper training and involved minimum complications.

“The only aspect to keep in mind is that adequate hygiene needs to be maintained. Thorough hand washing needs to be done to reduce the risk of infection as much as possible,” he said.

K. Sampathkumar, senior consultant nephrologist, Meenakshi Mission Hospital, said: “The therapy prescribed to patients should be such that it is gentle, effective and provides acceptable quality of life to the patient. PD has the potential to make the complex procedures of dialysis simpler for patients.”

There was a need to include PD in the National Dialysis Programme (PMNDP) so as to address the ever-increasing cases of chronic renal failure, he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wo1ppa/article31046525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KozhikodeCITYGNU5IO8CQ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/rise-in-chronic-kidney-disease-among-youth-due-to-poor-lifestyle/article31042696.ece
311,2020/03/11,Tomato price crashes in wholesale market,"DINDIGUL

Tomatoes sold at around ₹ 30 per kg in January was available now for a paltry ₹ 5 per kg, said farmers here on Wednesday.

Explaining their plight, farmers from Kottapatti, Vellodu, Panjampatti and other hamlets surrounding the district said that very many factors had pulled the prices down.

Thanks to good rainfall during the last quarter of 2019, kudimaramathu scheme had facilitated recharge of groundwater, and the weather was very pleasant till two months ago that there was no barren land at all.

Every farmer put his land to use this season that the growth was high. Coupled with the yield, the producers felt that there may be good market, but unfortunately, the prices went crashing since the last three days.

The tale of other farmers, who had grown ladiesfinger, brinjal and other vegetables from the hamlets, too remained almost the same. There was a big difference in the price between January and March. While brinjal was available at ₹ 18 per kg, ladiesfinger was selling at ₹ 12 per kg and beetroot was priced at ₹ 10 kg.

With more and more harvest happening in the villages, the arrivals into the wholesale markets and uzhavar sandhais may see a steady rise in the next couple of days. Hence, scope for upward pricing may not be there for at least another fortnight,” R Balamurugan, a farmer from Vellodu, said.

The presence of cold storage facility should be enhanced so that perishable commodities could be preserved. Similarly, the value addition of commodities such as tomatoes should be disseminated among the farmers. There was no use in revealing data by the officials from the Agriculture and Horticulture departments, they fumed.

According to the transport operators, close to 10 metric tonnes of vegetables arrived on a single day, with tomatoes alone accounting for about 2.5 tonnes from Reddiarchatram, Alagupatti and K Pudukottai, they said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/1hsjl3/article31042649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA12TOMATOES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tomato-price-crashes-in-wholesale-market/article31042650.ece

315,2020/03/11,"Hill temple, dargah and palace to get tourism makeover","Move follows growing increase in arrival of visitors to sites

The staggering rise in the number of devotees visiting Somagiri Hill, a pilgrimage site located around 40 km from here, has prompted the Tourism Department to lay access roads worth ₹1.7 crore on the stretch.

Alagarsamy, who is the hereditary priest, says that only a few knew about the temple 25 years ago. With growing migration, there has been sporadic rise in the number of devotees, touching up to 15,000 on Karthigai Deepam, an important festival in the temple calendar, visiting the hill. This has made the place an up-and-coming tourist site.

“Before tar roads were laid, thousands would arrive on bullock carts and climb the hill. Even the temple here is newly built. Earlier, we offered prayer to statues located in a small cave behind the temple,” he says.

The department has submitted a proposal based on the large number of domestic tourists arriving here, District Tourism Officer P. Balamurugan told reporters, who were taken on a tour of the hill on Wednesday.

“This 5.7-km road from Seekkipatti to Kavatayampatti sees people arriving from Alagarkoil, Melur and other areas, including Pulipatti, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday to offer prayers by sacrificing animals. Hence, the road came into being,” he recalls.

Block Development Officer P. Ramamoorthy adds that toilet and drinking water facilities will be created with panchayat funds.

Sprucing up the palace

The Tourism Department has also begun the process of sprucing up Tirumalai Nayak Palace, a long-pending plan, through funds received from Asian Development Bank.

Nets will be erected around the open courtyard of the palace to prevent pigeon menace, Mr. Balamurugan says. “The Tourism and Archeology Departments together have also started renovation of the 248 pillars by deplastering and replastering them with sunnambu [slaked lime] and karupatti [unrefined sugar made from sap] to ensure that the traditional way of construction is preserved. Since the palace is a huge tourist attraction, we want to ensure that the museum too has something to offer to the public. We will be stepping up works there and redoing the domes for a total of ₹3.24 crore.”

More amenities at dargah

The department will also provide basic amenities, including a resting hall, bathrooms and store rooms, at the dargah in Goripalayam, the oldest in Madurai. “At least 3,000 pilgrims from across the State visit the dargah each day and it becomes our duty to cater to their needs too,” the District Tourism Officer adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ptnb4l/article31046631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA12-Somagirihilljpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hill-temple-dargah-and-palace-to-get-tourism-makeover/article31042292.ece

Entrepreneurs involved in textile manufacturing can make use of the ₹ 2.5 crore subsidy offered by the State government for starting small textile clusters/parks, said Sivaganga Collector J. Jeyakanthan.

A consultative meeting was organised with textile entrepreneurs and investors here on Wednesday.

The Collector said that the textile industry was an important sector because of its ability to generate a large number of jobs.

He also highlighted that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had made an announcement under Rule 110 in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly regarding the subsidy of ₹ 2.5 crore for starting textile parks and added that an organisation with a minimum of three members would be eligible for the scheme. They must also possess two acres of land for the purpose.

He said that this initiative of the State government was to promote the growth of textile industry and modernising it. The objective was to enhance production and also focus on yield. As a result, the workforce can also be trained to the state-of-the-art technologies available, which would facilitate survival in the sector.

The Collector added that the creation of such small textile parks in different regions will help in creation of employment, thus boosting the economy overall. Migration of labourers can be prevented. Also, the workforce would not be concentrated in one city or town, but spread across the length and breadth of the State, Mr. Jayakanthan said.

He appealed to the entrepreneurs to make use of the government’s initiative and help in the creation of jobs for generations.

Some of the participants welcomed the objective and hoped to take it up in the ensuing fiscal year.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/use-subsidies-to-start-small-textile-parks/article31042282.ece

321,2020/03/11,Passengers screened at Thoothukudi airport for COVID - 19,"TIRUNELVELI

Screening of all passengers arriving at Thoothukudi Airport by a well-equipped medical team deployed by the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital for possible SARS-CoV- 2 infection commenced on Wednesday.

The medical team, led by Dean, Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital, R. Thiruvasagamani and Resident Medical Officer Silas Jeyamani screened the passengers at the lounge and distributed to them COVID – 19 awareness pamphlets.

They also collected information from the passengers who landed at Thoothukudi airport from foreign destinations and additional medical examinations were conducted to check their health parameters.

Dr. Thiruvasagamani said the health screening and awareness dissemination on COVID – 19 would continue until the threat triggered by the virus across the globe subsides completely.

Passenger Sethuramalingam of Thoothukudi, who underwent comprehensive health check as he had returned from Abu Dhabi, said almost all the countries had put in place extensive medical screening facilities in all the airports following viral threat that surfaced in China two months ago. Some of the countries in the Middle East had banned travel to foreign destinations and the entry of foreigners into their countries to check possible contraction of the viral infection.

“Though number of COVID – 19 cases in India is still small even as it is spreading fast in other nations, the precautionary measures being taken by the governments are laudable. The medical screening being done in the airports may be a bit irritating for a few. But we, the passengers, should accept it in the larger interest of the public,” Mr. Sethuramalingam said.

Meanwhile, a 27-year-old youth, who returned from Dubai to his native place of Chokkampatti in Tenkasi district on March 7, has been admitted to the isolation ward of Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital.

“Since he’s running high fever with cough and cold, he has been admitted to the isolation ward for constant monitoring by a team of doctors round-the-clock. Even as treatment for fever has already started, blood, saliva and sputum samples collected from the young patient has been sent for analysis. Based on the outcome of the analysis, the line of treatment will be decided,” sources in the TVMCH said.

On its part, the Corporation has started disinfection exercise by spraying the chemical agents in bus stands, Tirunelveli Junction area and also on the public transport vehicles, autorickshaws, bikes and cars parked there and also in the places where the people would gather in large number. Similar exercise is being carried-out in Tirunelveli Railway Junction also, where the workers have been asked to wear mask while on duty.

Members of the Laxmindra Nagar Nagarika Samiti staged a dharna in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s Office here on Tuesday demanding immediate resumption of the pending widening work on the Udupi-Manipal stretch of National Highway 169A.

Addressing the protestors, Ravindra Kamath, president of the samiti, said that there was no U-turn on the Laxmindra Nagar-Vibhudapriya Nagar stretch. People had to travel nearly two kilometres off to turn their vehicles, be it two-wheelers or four-wheelers.

This was affecting people, including school students, senior citizens and autorickshaw drivers, living in Laxmindra Nagar, Vibhudapriya Nagar, Hayagreeva Nagar, Sagri, Kundel and Gulme areas.

This forced people to shell out more money when travelling in autorickshaws. Before the highway was widened, there were two U-turns in Laxmindra Nagar alone; now there was none, he said.

The drainage work on the either side of highway had stopped. Monsoon would set in in about three months. If the roadside drains were not ready by then, then, rainwater would enter shops and business establishments by the side of the highway, he said.

There would also be water-logging on the road making it difficult for people to walk. There was no pedestrian crossing on the entire stretch making it difficult for people to cross the road, Mr. Kamath said.

The Karnataka Beary Sahitya Academy will prevail upon the government to introduce Beary as a third language for primary classes in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, said academy chairman Rahim Uchil here on Tuesday.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Uchil said that to save Beary from extinction, the academy recently requested Primary and Secondary Education Minister Suresh Kumar to include the language as part of the curriculum in the primary schools. Konkani and Tulu are already being taught in schools, he said.

Mr. Kumar, he said, acted swiftly and the Department of State Education Research and Training (DSERT) has asked the academy to form Beary textbook creation and screening committees. Mr. Uchil said that he has sent to the DSERT his and 12 other names as members of the two committees. “We are awaiting their approval,” he said.

The academy, he said, was working to bring out the Beary textbook with Kannada script. There were a good number of Beary speakers who are keen on making their children learn in the language they speak.

“We intend to have the textbook in place by the new academic year (in June). We want to first have the textbook for Class 6,” he said and added that the academy will try introducing Beary in schools in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi before moving to Chikkamagaluru and a few other Beary-speaking areas in the State, he said.

Shifting office

The person from Dubai arrived by a flight here on Sunday evening. The man, a native of Talapady, was found to have had fever during checking at the airport. Though he was taken to Wenlock Hospital, he left the hospital with his relatives after writing down a note in the hospital’s case diary refusing to undergo tests. Later, he was traced to a house in Vitla late on Monday.

Now, he has been quarantined at the government hospital in Bantwal, officials said and added that he did not have fever on Tuesday.

A team of officials from the District Disease Surveillance Office, along with the police, had searched for him after he left the hospital here.

The throat swabs sent to Hassan will be tested for both COVID-19 and H1N1. The VRDL in Hassan is among the few government laboratories that have been authorised to test for COVID-19 and HINI since Tuesday.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/medical-test-report-of-passenger-awaited/article31035252.ece

331,2020/03/11,Re-fix standard moisture level in arecanut to 14 %: stakeholders,"‘This would also help in checking the quality of arecanut imported’

The Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI), Kasaragod, Kerala is likely to take up a study to enable the stakeholders of arecanut to impress upon the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to re-fix the standard level of moisture in arecanut. At present, the maximum standard moisture level for arecanut fixed by the FSSAI stood at 7 %. Now, the stakeholders want the same to be re-fixed at 14 % to help in the marketing of the produce. The stakeholders, who discussed the matter in the city recently under the auspices of the Arecanut Research and Development Foundation (ARDF) and Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO), resolved that the CPCRI should take up a year-long study to enable them to urge the FSSAI to re-fix the standard, sources told The Hindu.

Homi Cheriyan, Director, Directorate of Arecanut and Spices Development, Kozhikode, Kerala, and K.B. Hebbar, Principal Scientist and Head, Physiology, Biochemistry and Post Harvest Technology, CPCRI, were among those who participated in the meeting. The others who took part in the meeting included representatives from Totgars Cooperative Sale Society Ltd. (TSS), Sirsi; Malnad Areca Marketing Cooperative Society Ltd. (MAMCOS), Shivamogga, Tota Utpannagala Maraka Sahakara Santha Niyamitha (TUMCOS), Channagiri, CAMPCO, ARDF, FSSAI and the All India Areca Growers Association, the sources said.

A report in the book, “Arecanut Research and Development”, published by the CPCRI in 1985, said that generally when ripe arecanuts are dried under good sunlight for 35-40 days to get white chali variety and when tender arecanuts are dried for 10-12 days to get red batlu variety, the moisture level in them varied between 5.5 % and 13.4 % depending on the size of the nuts and other climatic conditions.

As the moisture content in arecanut was beyond 7 %, some of the stakeholders found it difficult in marketing their consignments. Hence, there was a need to re-fix the standard, the sources said.

The meeting resolved that the CPCRI should collect samples of white chali and red batlu varieties from different areas for its study. It should submit an interim report first. The final report should be submitted after a year-long study.

Mahesh Puchchappady, general secretary, All India Areca Growers Association, Puttur, said that revising the standard to the actual level helped in the marketing of the produce abroad. In addition, it would help in checking the quality of arecanut imported.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/l847f0/article31035231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MNCHALIVARIETYWHITEARECANUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/re-fix-standard-moisture-level-in-arecanut-to-14-stakeholders/article31035233.ece
332,2020/03/11,Shared economy at $2 bn by end-2020,"Co-working, co-living, shared mobility, furniture rentals account for a chunk

The shared economy in India is estimated to be an about $2 billion industry by the end of the current year, according to a recent report by Maple Capital Advisors.

The ‘shared economy’ includes segments such as co-working (Awfis, WeWork India), co-living (Stanza Living, OYO Life, Oxford Caps), shared mobility (Uber, Ola, Shuttl) and furniture rental (Furlenco, Rentomojo.)

As per the report titled ‘Shared Economy — India Story,’ with high mobile penetration, high millennial concentration and an aspirational population, Asia has the highest willingness to use shared assets.

“India mirrors Asia trends in these aspects and is thus poised for high growth and adoption of shared services,” it added.

In 2019, the segment was estimated to be over $1.5 billion in size in India.

Market size

The market size for the co-working sector is pegged at $500 million, while that for co-living is estimated to be $400 million, shared mobility at over $630 million, and furniture rental at $200 million. The report noted that about $3.7 billion worth of capital has been infused in India in such services till now, adding that a similar amount is expected to be infused in the next couple of years.

“Given the growth, potential profitability and momentum, we expect significant IPOs and private funding in the next 2-3 years,” it added.

“India is at the cusp of a shared economy revolution. We are already witnessing phenomenal growth in this segment with both international companies and home-grown start-ups vying for market share. Even as the space is nascent, over $3.7 bn has been invested in this space and we expect this to accelerate from here, on the back of compelling demand and unit economics,” Pankaj Karna, MD, Maple Capital Advisors, said.

The report added, “In this era of growing concern on climate, wastage, resource scarcity and population intensity (especially in the developing world), the shared economy seems to be a sustainable, scalable and efficient form of addressing these concerns.”",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/deelrd/article31034035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THBUCOWORK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/shared-economy-at-2-bn-by-end-2020/article31034036.ece
333,2020/03/11,Saudi Aramco says it will increase oil production capacity,"The majority State-owned company’s announcement, made on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange, did not say when that capacity increase would happen.

Saudi Arabia’s oil company Aramco said on Wednesday it will increase production capacity to 13 million barrels per day, up from 12 million per day.

The majority State-owned company’s announcement, made on the Saudi Tadawul stock exchange, did not say when that capacity increase would happen.

Aramco says the decision to increase capacity was a directive to the company from the Saudi Energy Ministry.

On Tuesday, Aramco had said it would increase its crude oil production to 12.3 million barrels a day in April, a record amount.

Also read: Oil surges on hope of economic stimulus

The move seemed to make good on the country’s promise over the weekend to increase output after Russia refused to cooperate on cutting production. That led to a 25% plunge in the price of crude on Monday, the sharpest decline seen since the 1991 Gulf War. International benchmark Brent crude traded up more than 8% Tuesday over $37 a barrel.

Aramco’s decisions will likely flood global energy markets and put further pressure on prices. The company had reached $2 trillion in early days of trading in December.

The lower oil prices come as there’s less demand for air travel amid the spread of the new coronavirus around the world, further depressing prices. However, that likely will push down gasoline prices at the pump for Americans. On average, a gallon of regular unleaded in the U.S. sold for $2.36 a gallon, according to AAA, down from $2.43 a month ago.

Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak had sought to project confidence on Tuesday, saying in an interview broadcast by Russian state television that “despite the decrease of prices and volatility that we are witnessing today, our sector stays competitive.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/n6f0qi/article29935779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03IN-SAUDI-ARAMCOIPO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/saudi-aramco-says-it-will-increase-oil-production-capacity/article31039318.ece

335,2020/03/11,Thermal coal imports for 2019 rise 12.6%,"Lower production by Coal India spurs trend; coking coal registers decline

India’s thermal coal imports rose 12.6% to nearly 200 million tonnes in 2019, government data reviewed by Reuters showed, reflecting the second straight year of growth in shipments of the fuel despite attempts by the government to cut imports.

Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, the world’s largest consumer, importer and producer of the fuel.

Imports of thermal coal — mainly used for power generation — jumped 12.6% to 197.84 million tonnes in 2019. However, imports of coking coal — used mainly in the manufacturing of steel — fell marginally, following two straight years of increase, government data showed.

India imported 51.33 million tonnes of coking coal in 2019, down from 51.63 million tonnes in 2018, the data showed.

While higher coal imports may be bad news for the Indian government, they benefit international miners such as Indonesia’s Adaro Energy, U.S. coal miner Peabody Energy Corp and global commodity merchants such as Glencore.

Indonesia top supplier

Indonesia accounted for nearly 60% of India’s thermal coal imports in the April-December period, government data showed, while South Africa accounted for 22% and Russia and Australia accounting for over 5% each.

Rainfall, outages hit CIL

Traders said coal imports grew largely due to lower production by Coal India Ltd., whose output fell for five consecutive months ended November due to the highest annual rainfall in 25 years and frequent outages including strikes by workers and locals.

Higher coal shipments to India were also due to increased imports by Indian utilities, whose imports rebounded after a three-year slide, mainly due to increased purchases by an Adani Power plant in western India.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/a721zb/article31034022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THBUCOAL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/thermal-coal-imports-for-2019-rise-126/article31034023.ece

Oil prices surged by around 8% on Tuesday, a day after the biggest rout in nearly 30 years as investors eyed the possibility of economic stimulus and Russia signalled that talks with OPEC remained possible.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said he will be taking “major” steps to gird the U.S. economy against the impact of the spreading COVID-19 outbreak, while Japan’s government plans to spend more than $4 billion in a second package of steps to cope with the virus.

Brent crude futures were up $2.80, around 8%, to $37.16 a barrel by 7.24 p.m. IST, after hitting a session high of $38.22 a barrel.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained $2.42, or around 8%, to $33.55 a barrel, after hitting a high of $34.60.

Black Monday

Both benchmarks plunged 25% on Monday, dropping to their lowest levels since February 2016 and recording their biggest one-day percentage declines since January 17, 1991, when oil prices fell at the outset of the first Gulf War.

Trading volumes in the front-month for both contracts hit record highs in the previous session after three years of cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Russia and other major oil producers to limit supply fell apart on Friday, triggering a price war for market share.

Saudi, the world’s biggest oil exporter, escalated tensions with plans to supply 12.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, well above current production levels of 9.7 million bpd, Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said.

April’s crude supply will be “300,000 barrels per day over the companys maximum sustained capacity of 12 million bpd,” Mr. Nasser said in a statement.

Joint steps with Russia

Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak said he did not rule out joint measures with OPEC to stabilise the market, adding that the next OPEC+ meeting was planned for May-June.

But in response, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister said he did not see a need to hold an OPEC+ meeting in May-June if there was no agreement on what stepsshould be taken to deal with the impact of the COVID-19 on oil demand and prices.

“I fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said.

“Price wars and pandemics are nothing new to the commodity markets, but both occurring simultaneously is something we have yet to witness in our careers,” RBC analysts said.

Crude was also supported by hopes for a settlement to the price war and potential U.S. output cuts, although analysts warned gains may be temporary as oil demand continues to be hit by COVID-19 outbreak, which has spread beyond China and prompted Italy to implement a nationwide lockdown.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/zez2kz/article31034007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THBUOIL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/oil-surges-as-investors-eye-on-hope-of-economic-stimulus-russian-signal-on-opec-talks/article31034008.ece

The Indian rupee recovered 33 paise to 73.84 against U.S. dollar in early trade on Wednesday amid positive opening in domestic equities and weakening of the American dollar in the overseas market.

The Indian rupee on March 9, had fell to a 17-month low of 74.17 against dollar amid mounting fears of a coronavirus-led economic slowdown.

The forex market was closed on Tuesday on account of Holi.

At the interbank foreign exchange the rupee opened at 73.88, then gained further ground and touched a high of 73.84 against dollar, registering a rise of 33 paise over its previous close.

The domestic currency, however, could not hold on to the gains and was trading at 73.96 against the American unit at 1004 hrs.

On Monday, rupee had settled at 74.17 against the greenback.

Meanwhile, investor sentiment remained fragile amid concerns over the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the global economy, forex traders said.

The global death toll from the new coronavirus crossed 4,000 as the outbreak has spread to over 100 countries with more than 110,000 cases of infection.

Domestic bourses opened on a positive note on Wednesday with benchmark indices Sensex trading 66.97 points higher at 35,701.92 and Nifty up by 3.85 points at 10,455.30.

Traders said the rise in crude oil prices helped in the recovery of equity market and trading sentiment as oil prices had crashed on Monday.

Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, rose 3.36% to USD 38.47 per barrel. Despite the rise, Brent crude prices are trading on a muted note, traders said.

Meanwhile, Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers in the capital market, as they sold equity shares worth ₹6,595.56 crore on Monday, according to provisional exchange data.

Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against the basket of six currencies was trading 0.28% lower at 96.14.

Equity benchmark Sensex rallied over 300 points in opening session on Wednesday led by gains in Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank and HDFC amid mixed cues from global markets.

After surging 308 points in highly volatile trade, the 30-share index was up 72.14 points, or 0.20%, at 35,707.09, and the NSE Nifty rose 22.20 points, or 0.21%, to 10,473.65.

Top gainers in the Sensex pack included Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, Hero MotoCorp, ICICI Bank and PowerGrid.

On the other hand, ITC, Tata Steel, Tech Mahindra, Infosys and UltraTech Cement were among the laggards.

In the previous session on Monday, the BSE Sensex crashed over 1,941 points and the NSE Nifty tumbled 538 points, positing their biggest ever single-day drop in absolute terms.

On a net basis, foreign institutional investors (FPIs) sold equities worth ₹6,595.56 crore, while domestic institutional investors bought shares worth ₹4,974.80 crore on Monday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

Market remained closed on Tuesday on account of Holi.

According to traders, domestic market rebounded from Monday’s lows, but turned increasingly volatile as no respite from the rapid spread of coronavirus seems in sight.

Global stocks too gave mixed signals with bourses in Shanghai and Hong Kong trading on a positive note, while those in Seoul and Tokyo dropping over 1%.

Stock exchanges in the U.S. ended sharply higher on Tuesday on hopes of U.S. economic stimulus efforts as the coronavirus continued to spread rapidly.

339,2020/03/11,Markets bounce back after crash,"S&P 500 futures rally over 4%, treasury yields up sharply; Europe’s shares jump 3-4%, Asia ends higher

Oil and equity markets staged solid rebounds on Tuesday after the previous day’s pummelling, with signs of coordinated action by the world’s biggest economies to cushion the economic impact of coronavirus helping pull investors out of panic mode.

Brent roared back as much as 10% on hopes a supply cut deal could be rescued, while most benchmark government bond yields were off record lows as hopes for stimulus in the face of the epidemic boosted risk sentiment. Wall Street main markets wasted little time in recouping at least 2% of the 7% they had slumped on Monday, one of their worst days on record.

The oil and gas and mining sectors were leading the charge for Europe as oil recovered some of Monday’s 25% fall following what had appeared to be the complete breakdown of a crucial global oil pact between OPEC and Russia.

Yields on benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury debt more than doubled to 0.7% and those on German Bunds jumped around 20 basis points at one point as investors pared some safe-haven holdings, though they were beginning to ease again.

Supporting the mood was a pledge from U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to take “major” steps to protect the economy and float the idea of a payroll tax cut with congressional Republicans.

Japan said it would spend another 430.8 billion yen ($4.1 billion) to ease the effects of the coronavirus outbreak and Italy’s deputy economy minister announced that mortgage payments would be suspended as the country deals with the second highest number of cases outside China.

Some of the biggest global investment banks, including JP Morgan, Citi and Barclays, now expect the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates to zero in the coming months as part of a mass global move to provide some ballast and liquidity to the financial system.

“As of today, we believe that markets have gone from being overly complacent to overly pessimistic,” the chief investment officers of Europe’s largest asset manager Amundi wrote in a note to clients.

“Our central case, instead, is one of a temporary setback, although more prolonged compared to what we were expecting a month ago, followed by a recovery,” they added.

Oil suffered its sharpest drop since the 1991 Gulf war and global stocks plunged on Monday after Saudi Arabia launched a crude price war with Russia, further rattling investors already anxious about the spread of coronavirus.

Tuesday’s market fight back had begun to gain traction in Asia. Japan’s Nikkei had ended the day up 0.85%, after earlier touching its lowest level since April 2017.

Australia’s index closed up 3.1% as some went hunting for bargains in beaten down stocks.

340,2020/03/11,A progressive system of taxation,"Why reverting to the classical system of taxing dividend is a good move

As a concept, ‘dividend’ has been in existence since the inception of the Income Tax Act. Any shareholder in a company is entitled to dividend as a return on investment. Dividend covers various elements of payouts from a company and seeks to tax those at some stage. The question is: at what point should the dividend be taxed and how? The matter assumes significance since corporates pay tax on their profits and any tax on the distribution of post-tax profits amounts to double taxation. The Finance Bill, 2020 has reverted to the classical system of taxing dividends (in the hands of the shareholders). The Bill seeks to withdraw the dividend distribution tax (DDT) payable by the company. This move has created ripples since high-net-worth individuals never expected a full tax in their hands, which is being sought to be achieved by the proposal.

Three methods of taxing dividend

The three methods of taxing dividend are the classical system; the simplistic system or DDT regime; and the imputation system. The classical system was in vogue till 1997-98. According to this system, the dividend was taxable in the hands of the shareholder, subject to the then available deduction under Section 80L for a maximum of ₹12,000. This was a progressive system.

The Finance Act of 1997 analysed the merits and demerits of the classical system and embarked on the route of the simplistic system of taxing dividend in the hands of the distributing company. In the process, millions of shareholders were spared the burden of offering dividends as tax in their hands. The DDT system replaced the classical system from 1997-98. The rate of DDT started at about 10% and climbed to 20.56%. The advantage of DDT was that tracking of dividend in the hands of the company became easier and collecting the tax on dividend was a painless process. The main drawback was that the treaty agreements with countries like the U.S. did not permit the set-off of the DDT paid against the tax liability of the shareholder. DDT was simple but inequitable since it made no distinction between a low taxpayer and a high taxpayer.

With India registering substantial growth between 1997 and 2020, corporate performances also registered progress and dividend pay-outs increased. The income tax payer came under the radar of the IT department. This development made tracking of the shareholder much easier. The withdrawal of DDT came as a relief to the corporate sector which has wanted DDT to be removed and the effective corporate tax rate in India to be reduced. Corporates are also required to conserve cash for further growth. This largely prompted the government to revert to the classical system for taxing dividend.

Maximum tax rate

However, this means that the starting rate of tax works out to 10% and the highest rate works out to, say, 43%. Tax paid in dividend is out of money earned and received and more often than not represents holding of shares passed on by generations without any cost incurred. On this score, discharging tax at the maximum marginal rate more than justifies the principle of equity and sharing with the government in the overall developmental agenda. Shareholders in other countries with a protective treaty regime can receive dividend attracting tax rates as low as 5%. The distortion in the current regime viz. the foreign shareholder being taxed at a much lower rate than the Indian counterpart is obvious. This would require some correction. The main contention of the high-net-worth individual is that while the classical system is acceptable as a concept, the maximum tax rate is an unexpected extra burden.

Some countries follow the imputation system. The dividend is taxed in the hands of the shareholders but they are also allowed a set-off of a portion of the corporate tax discharged by the company. In many ways, the imputation credit resembles an underlying tax credit granted to non-residents under certain treaties entered into by India. While there are complexities in that system, it mitigates the hardships caused by the double taxation impact of dividend distribution.

Indian promoter groups control a majority of shareholding in Indian companies. For them, the wealth is largely represented by the value of shares and the dividends received over a period of time. These have been passed on to successive generations. These shares can be held by individuals, HUFs, family companies, or family trusts. Any decision to declare dividend is analysed from the standpoint of the company and the standpoint of the entity receiving the dividends. As long as dividends were received tax-free, the structure was irrelevant. But with the current proposal even family trusts can be taxed at the maximum rate. This blow is bound to force companies to revisit their strategy of paying dividends.

The move to the classical system is not only well-conceived but also tilted towards the appropriate progressive system of taxation.

On February 6, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognised the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) as one of the 15 laboratories that would provide reference testing support for the novel coronavirus.

The number of COVID-19 cases remained constant at three for nearly a month in India, but now it is going up steadily. Anticipating such a scenario, more labs are screening COVID-19 samples now. Besides the 52 labs belonging to the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories network of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 10 labs under the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) have been included for testing COVID-19 samples.

Till recently, all the 52 labs were allowed to only screen samples; only NIV was authorised to confirm positive cases. With more suspected cases piling up, a long delay in confirming positive test results would have become inevitable for NIV. So, in a welcome move, ICMR has pre-empted such a scenario. “Four-five days ago, 13 labs were authorised to confirm positive cases without sending them to NIV. Another 17 labs will be authorised to do so on March 11 and the remaining labs on March 13,” says Nivedita Gupta of ICMR. With the 10 labs under the NCDC regularly confirming positive H1N1 cases, we can expect these labs to be authorised to also confirm positive COVID-19 cases.

Unfortunately, several national labs have not been brought up to speed to perform other vital functions during an outbreak.

Sequencing the genome

NIV is the only lab in India which has a bio-safety level-4 (BSL-4) facility to culture pathogenic, novel viruses, study the origin of such viruses and provide a comprehensive characterisation of them by sequencing the entire viral genome. NIV has sequenced the SARS-CoV-2 genome collected from two patients in Kerala.

When the entire genome is sequenced it helps researchers understand the arrangement of the four chemical entities or bases that make up the DNA or RNA. The differences in the arrangement of the bases make organisms different from one another. Sequencing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 will help us understand where the virus came from and how it spread.

In the last decade or so, many national laboratories have developed the expertise to sequence the entire genome of viruses and bacteria using the latest equipment (next-generation sequencing, or NGS). About a dozen labs have a BSL-3 facility to inactivate the virus and sequence the genome using advanced equipment. They also have the expertise to undertake such work.

It is therefore puzzling why India relies solely on NIV for undertaking genome sequencing. If there’s a compelling need to have all hands on deck to sequence the genome, it is now.

While NIV sequenced two of the three COVID-19 samples collected from Kerala in late January-early February, it is not clear if more samples have been sequenced. Contrast this with how other countries have responded. Many of the 263 sequences shared with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), a public platform started by the WHO in 2008 for countries to share genome sequences, are by universities and hospitals. In mainland China, many of the sequences are shared by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which is present in all the 31 provinces. At 90, China has posted the most sequence data on GISAID. This is followed by the U.S. (37).

Unutilised expertise in India

“We tested around 75,000 samples of H1N1 during the 2009-2010 outbreak. We have a BSL-3 facility and the latest sequencing equipment. We are ready to help out if ICMR reaches out to us,” says Professor V. Ravi, Head of the Department of Virology at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, about sequencing.

“It is time for team building, not the time to work in silos,” says Dr. Chitra Pattabiraman from NIMHANS. “If we are not given an opportunity to develop these skill sets and not encouraged to participate, then how are we ever going to get good at it?”

During the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala, a lab outside NIV, the Manipal Centre for Virus Research, successfully proved that given an opportunity it could not only diagnose the novel virus but also partially sequence it. The Manipal Centre confirmed the Nipah virus in 17 of the 24 samples it received from Kerala. Unfortunately, since April 2019, the Manipal Centre has been directed to restrict itself to processing the samples of pathogens specific to the BSL-2 facility. It is not even one of the designated labs to test for the novel coronavirus.

Virologist Professor Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, however feels that given that the number of COVID-19 cases in India is still under 60, NIV does not feel overwhelmed.

While agreeing that many labs/ institutions in India have the ability to sequence the viral genome, Professor Kang emphasises that sequencing is useful to know where the virus strain came from and to check if the strain is evolving, but does not inform us of the immediate strategy to control the outbreak or its spread.

With the latest sequencing equipment widely available in many research labs and the cost of sequencing falling, researchers are using genome sequences for genomic epidemiology. This becomes possible as scientists already know the number of mutations that arise on an average in a month in the case of COVID-19, its incubation period, and the average time between cases in a chain transmission (serial interval). Using this data, it has become possible to identify the index case even when the source of infection is not known, and find the link between two seemingly unconnected outbreaks.

How China built capacity

China was completely unprepared when the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) struck in 2002-2003. The outbreak infected over 8,000 people globally and killed nearly 800. The bird flu (H5N1) outbreak that followed in 2003 underscored the need for influenza detection and response in China. This led to a collaboration between the Chinese National Influenza Center and the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2004 to build capacity in influenza surveillance in China.

For the next 10 years the collaboration worked in many ways: it led to developed human technical expertise in virology and epidemiology, a comprehensive influenza surveillance system, strengthened analysis, the dissemination of surveillance data, and improved early response to influenza viruses with pandemic potential. By 2014, the national influenza surveillance and response system included 408 labs and 554 sentinel hospitals.

Today, there is a Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in each of the 31 provinces in mainland China. The infrastructure and capacity-building that was put in place by China for influenza surveillance stood in good stead when the H1N1 pandemic struck in 2009.

342,2020/03/11,"In writing, the wrong can become the right","Despite insurmountable challenges and ennui, distress shouldn’t prevent us from writing

Visuals of the Delhi riots kept many across on tenterhooks. People despaired and felt distressed. Frantic calls were made to ensure safety of friends and family. Social media rituals of ‘like’, ‘dislike’, and ‘share’ were duly performed. Witnessing the frenzy increased our sense of helplessness. During occasions like these, one wonders what we can do to help. Is it good enough to just write and bemoan the troubling state of affairs? Can anyone really benefit from that? The heart-breaking visuals that emerged from the riots and the poignant, relentless accounts remind us of W.B. Yeats’s much cited poem, ‘The Second Coming’, where he says, “The best lack all conviction, while the worst/Are full of passionate intensity.”

Dealing with agony

In the times we live in, violence is being normalised in the most grotesque way. As a result, people resort to different ways of dealing with their agony. Some might take to writing to capture the terror that was unleashed on the streets of Delhi. Writing serves as a document and gory reminder to what transpired and how. Writing captures memory, safeguards it for posterity for future action and recall. But writing in times of distress is easier said than done.

Some might even deem it escapist. They might think it doesn’t take much to write in the comfort of your home when war is being waged on the street outside. Writing is a comfortable option in comparison. And it cannot prevent genocide. However, I am sure many would agree if I say distress derails writing. It makes the act of writing difficult, often perilous.

The writer struggles for the exact word to justly quantify her enormity of grief and desolation. Distress creates perplexity. You wonder if there’s any purpose to it all, to all that you write, read, compose, paint. Does anybody care? While ruminating over these questions, I chanced upon a video of vocalist Shubha Mudgal singing Habib Jalib’s famous nazm, ‘Main nahi manta (I do not accept)’ at a protest site and it made me realise that every such gesture matters. It restored an individual’s faith in what they do. Perhaps all purpose is not lost.

The Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish wrote extensively about and in distress. So did Qurratulain Hyder, Krishna Sobti and Saadat Hasan Manto and many others. Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge, which became the protest anthem across recent demonstrations in the country, lived perennially in distress. Writers like Mirza Waheed, Salma, and Perumal Murugan have given a face and body to distress in their writing. Svetlana Alexievich’s Nobel Prize is a recognition of the memorials to distress she has built in her writing. Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking (2005) is a heartwrenching narrative about living with distress following the death of loved ones. Distress is political but it is also personal. It comes from a deeply felt sense of compassion and heartache. Distress has birthed newer forms of writing and artistic expression. Distress is an institution, a laboratory of ideas to genesis further writing.

A challenge for writers

However, the creation of widespread distress, mayhem and disturbance is, in a sense, a conspiracy against writing. It ensures that writing becomes difficult. But that is exactly the challenge that writers must overcome. The oppressors don’t want them to write. In such a scenario, there would be one kind of story, a single narrative written by the oppressor about the oppressed. And it is everyone’s knowledge what that story would be. In writing sometimes, the wrong can become the right. It is this appropriation that our writing must resist. Despite insurmountable challenges and an all-pervasive ennui, distress shouldn’t prevent us from writing. In fact, it should, ideally, spark off collective action to further the spirit of resistance.

343,2020/03/11,The public unravelling of Yes Bank,"The manner of its collapse raises questions on the central bank’s role and the late action by the Enforcement Directorate

On Sunday, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Yes Bank’s swashbuckling co-promoter Rana Kapoor, accusing him and his family of using shell companies to receive kickbacks from the bank’s corporate borrowers.

On March 5, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had used its powers to supersede the bank’s board and impose restrictions on its operations. The bank’s depositors cannot withdraw more than ₹50,000 for the next four weeks at least. Predictably, the State Bank of India (SBI) has emerged as Yes Bank’s knight in shining armour. Surprisingly, though, it is crowd-sourcing the rescue plan.

Balance sheet scam

The manner in which the Yes Bank collapse has unravelled raises several questions. The full extent of its troubles spilled into the public domain two years ago, when, in September 2018, the RBI had declined to extend Mr. Kapoor’s term as managing director and chief executive officer by three years. It directed the bank to end his tenure by January 31, 2019.

The scam on the bank’s balance sheets must have been visible to the RBI as far back as in 2015. The RBI’s asset quality review (AQR) had forced Yes Bank, as it had several other banks, to report transparently their previously unstated non-performing assets (NPAs).

Before the AQR in 2015, bankers avoided recognising bad loans on their books. They did this by restructuring the loans susceptible to defaults or by extending new loans, called evergreening, to keep the stressed borrowers afloat. Thus, while the borrowers were able to avoid defaults on repayments, the lenders managed to show low NPAs.

The RBI found that for the year ended March 2016, Yes Bank had classified loans worth ₹749 crore as gross NPAs, understating the figure by a whopping ₹4,176.70 crore. It directed Yes Bank to reclassify more loans as NPAs. Disclosing this to the stock exchanges in May 2017, Yes Bank assured investors that the higher NPAs would not have further ramifications as it had already taken remedial action.

However, just five months later, in October 2017, the bank disclosed, once again, that the RBI had discovered more underreported gross NPAs on its books. For the year ended March 2017, the under reporting was of the tune of ₹6,355 crore.

Why has the ED then swung into action so late, giving Mr. Kapoor 18 months to cover his tracks and potentially remove all the money he can from the bank in this period? If the RBI’s inspections of the bank’s books left it with no confidence in Mr. Kapoor, surely then that ought to have been a smoking gun to suspect if not investigate his role in Yes Bank’s serial under-reporting of NPAs. Also, Yes Bank was looking for investors for the last few months. The moratorium and the investigation against Mr. Kapoor seem to have been triggered by the failure to find investors. This suggests that had investors been found, Mr. Kapoor may have escaped action. After all the RBI’s discomfort with him was known even back in 2018. Why didn’t the ED take action at that time?

In December 2018, barely two months after Mr. Kapoor’s extension was rejected, former RBI Governor Urjit Patel resigned from the central bank. Did the RBI and other authorities go soft on Yes Bank after that? Its transgressions continued even after the RBI fined the bank and forced changes in its management. For the year ended March 2019, the RBI discovered underreported NPAs worth ₹2,299 crore. Incidentally, around the time the moratorium was announced last Thursday, news broke of another resignation at the RBI. This time of its well-regarded Deputy Governor N.S. Vishwanathan, a specialist in regulation, supervision of banks and non-banking finance companies. The exit follows a four-decade career at the RBI and just three months ahead of his retirement in June. Was it prompted by the health issues cited or a protest against the RBI’s stance on policy matters such as handling of Yes Bank?

Shareholders’ role

And what of the bank’s shareholders? Why did they ratify remuneration hikes and a renewal of tenure for Mr. Kapoor despite public information of the serial underreporting of NPAs? The regulators must ensure now that all current equity held by Yes Bank holders should get wiped out since it represents a pure risk capital. If this is not done, any investment by Yes Bank’s saviour, the SBI, will be a subsidy to them. Let us not forget that barely two years ago, the SBI and its associate banks received ₹8,800 crore in recapitalisation from the Central government. Other public banks received more.

How credible can the rescue be when barely three months ago the SBI had disclosed that the RBI has discovered under-reported NPAs — of ₹11,932 crore for the year ended March 2019 — on its books?

Most importantly, why are public comments being sought on the restructuring scheme for Yes Bank? This is unfair to the SBI. The restructuring scheme is no one’s business other than the SBI’s. After this precedent, next time a bank, say a Kotak Mahindra Bank or HDFC Bank, is to get an investment from a new investor, will that scheme also be put up for public comments?

If this were a commercial decision taken by the SBI, and not capitulation before the government of the day, it would have put greater financial might and a well-crafted plan behind the rescue.

Finally, what other options were considered by the RBI? Did they include a market-based solution? DBS Bank has just turned into a wholly-owned subsidiary of its Singaporean parent. Could Yes Bank’s network of branches been of interest to it? Ideally, the moratorium ought to have been announced, together with the scheme for restructuring, over a weekend. That would have made it less disruptive, the limit of ₹50,000 on withdrawals by depositors would not have been needed, and the RBI’s credibility would not have suffered as much.

344,2020/03/11,Scoring low: on lack of power in schools,"The absence of playgrounds and electricity in govt. schools speaks poorly of policy priorities

It should rank as an irony that as a founder-leader of the International Solar Alliance, India has not yet electrified a significant number of government schools, while extolling the elegance and virtue of photovoltaic electricity to the rest of the world. The lack of power in schools is taken note of by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development in its latest report on budgetary grants for school education and literacy for 2020-21. Under the framework of concurrent powers, the Centre operates its own schemes and sponsors several school education programmes covering the States, notably Samagra Shiksha and the Mid Day Meal scheme. Yet, as the panel found from data for 2017-18, only 56.45% of government schools had electricity and 56.98% a playground, while almost 40% lacked a boundary wall. There are some high-performing States, but even in politically well-represented Uttar Pradesh, almost 70% of schools lacked electricity. Other depressing insights from the district information database as of end-2019, are: neglect of toilet construction for children with special needs, failure to build toilets for girls in a third of secondary schools and laboratories for higher secondary science students. The tardy progress on such important facilities, in spite of the projects having been sanctioned, shows the low priority that school education is being accorded.

One of the first things the NDA government did at the launch of its second term was a ‘100-day programme’ for education, focused in part on training of schoolteachers and opening of central schools. It should be possible to bring the same mission-mode approach to infrastructure now, ensuring that no school is left behind. Solar power can be installed in schools and toilets built for all students in 100 days. Community participation can make sure that the objectives are satisfactorily met. It may be more challenging to find attached playgrounds, but that problem can also be overcome by identifying suitable commons that can be upgraded to accommodate students, while permanent arrangements are made. More fundamentally, the Centre and States must realise that their talk of a demographic dividend has little meaning, when they do not provide enough funding for proposals on the one hand and the administrative machinery fails to utilise even the amount allocated in some cases. As the parliamentary committee notes, the allocation to the School Education and Literacy department has suffered a cut of 27.52%, amounting to ₹22,725 crore in the Budget Estimate for 2020-21, although public expenditure on education has been rising. The government-run school sector needs a fund infusion. A public school system that guarantees universal access, good learning and all facilities has to be among the highest national priorities.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/scoring-low/article31033847.ece
345,2020/03/11,Market mayhem: on Sensex single-day fall,"The global rout in equities amid the widening coronavirus outbreak portends more pain

Manic Monday saw India’s bellwether S&P BSE Sensex suffer its worst single-day fall in terms of points as the 30-stock gauge plunged 1,942 points, or 5.2%, to its lowest close in 52 weeks. While the proximate trigger for the headlong selling spree was the global market rout induced by an oil price plunge, there are clear indications that the underlying investor sentiment has turned bearish. From the S&P BSE 500 index, comprising the top 500 BSE-listed companies across all key industries, to the S&P BSE SmallCap index, representing the smallest listed firms, there was virtually no corner left untouched by the sell-off. While every Sensex member lost ground, with 22 retreating at least 3%, both the broader gauges accounting for a combined 1,200 companies saw about 93% each of their constituents posting declines. The breadth of the losses is one sure indicator that investors are looking to exit equities for now with whatever gains they can muster, or worse in a bid to cut their losses. And Monday’s losses, while dramatic, have only extended a slide that has over the past month seen the Sensex and BSE 500 lose about 13% each, and the mid-cap gauge drop 14%. Coinciding with this slide has been a 116% jump in volatility as measured by the National Stock Exchange’s India VIX index, another ominous sign that prices are unlikely to stabilise any time soon. Also, foreign institutional investors have turned net sellers of their Indian equity holdings in a big way this month, taking the cumulative net sales since February to ₹10,658 crore.

With the Indian economy still in search of fair winds and the global outlook for growth getting bleaker with each passing day as the widening coronavirus outbreak threatens to push the world into its worst downturn since the 2008 financial crisis, a sustained sell-off looms. To complicate matters, the proposed State Bank of India-led bailout of capital-starved Yes Bank may be a far tougher challenge than appeared at first flush. Among the hurdles is a legal challenge to the plan by holders of the troubled lender’s Additional Tier-1 bonds. And the best intentions of the Centre and efforts by the RBI notwithstanding, any failure to expedite the resolution at Yes Bank runs the risk of undermining wider banking sector stability. To be sure, already there is talk of concerted central bank action among the leading western economies as well as likely fiscal measures to address the threat posed by COVID-19. The U.S. Federal Reserve last week made an emergency cut in its benchmark interest rate and President Trump is contemplating a raft of steps including a payroll tax cut. The RBI and the Centre too would ideally need to move in lockstep with measures to ensure adequate liquidity to help bolster sentiment at this time of market and economic fragility.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/market-mayhem/article31033837.ece

347,2020/03/11,"Withdraw NPR, says Ambedkar","Prakash Ambedkar, president, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, urged the government to withdraw the National Population Register (NPR) process which is all set to begin on April 1.

“No government can fight the people,” he said at a protest rally against CAA-NRC-NPR in the city on Wednesday, organised by a coalition of Dalit organisations.

“The government is adamant that they are right and is refusing to listen to our concerns. They have erected a wall between themselves and the people, which is not the way in a democracy. The government is leaving us with no option but to resist this,” he said expressing concerns over the recent Delhi riots saying he feared the confrontation seems to be giving rise to the “spectre of a civil war”.

“The government must talk to the people and accommodate their concerns, stop the process of NPR and withdraw CAA and that is the only right thing in a democracy,” Mr. Ambedkar said.

Thol. Thirumavalavan, president of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and a member of Parliament, said he visited the riot-affected areas of Delhi and expressed fears that CAA-NRC-NPR will create “a situation of continuous strife across the country”.

Terming “Sanatan forces” more dangerous than COVID-19, Mr. Thirumavalavan said religious nationalism will push the country into darkness especially it’s vulnerable communities. “Ambedkarite forces and Sanatan forces can never unite. CAA-NRC-NPR is a threat to all natives of this land,” he said.

348,2020/03/11,House panel set up on dress code in clubs,"Members recount experience of not being allowed inside because they were wearing khadi kurta

Amidst uproar over entry restrictions imposed by clubs on wearing traditional attire, Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekar on Wednesday announced setting up of a House committee to look into the matter and also the need for uniform guidelines on lease amount.

The minister’s announcement in the Legislative Council came after members, cutting across parties, recounted their experiences in some clubs where they were denied entry because they were wearing khadi kurta.

“On Independence day, I went to Karnataka Golf Club wearing this white (collar less) kurtha after attending a public function. While my family was allowed inside, I was not,” Congress member Prakash Rathod recounted even as another Congress member K.C. Kondaiah recalled restrictions imposed on him in KSCA.

Incidentally, a joint legislature House committee headed by N.A. Harris in 2015-16 has proposed The Karnataka Regulation of Entry to Public Places and Regulation of Clubs bill to remove dress code restriction and had made proposals to monitor clubs that get government facilities such as land.

Former Minister H.M. Revanna, who raised the issue, said some clubs do not allow white dress that the politicians wear or restrict entry over the issue of footwear. “Lease amount on land fixed for clubs using government facilities varies from club to club. There has to be uniformity.”

Members raised the strict dress code maintained in Bangalore Club and Bowring Institute, both established during the British rule. While BJP member Y.A. Narayanswamy also criticised the dress code, he pointed at violations made by the club, and that a strict control has to be had on them since they get concessions from the government.

He also pointed out that nothing has been done on Harris committee report. Members also raised deviations made by clubs, including renting out premises, violation of excise norms and lease norms through constructions made without government approval.

Though the Minister initially pointed out at the Harris Committee report and its contents that can be studied before another committee could be set up, he announced the formation of the house committee after members urged him to make commitment.

Renewed call for legislators club

During the discussion on clubs, council members also brought back the issue of having legislators club near Vidhan Soudha. “When everyone can have their club why can’t we? The government should spilt 60 acres given to Bangalore Golf Club and give some portion of the land to the club,” Janata Dal (Secular) member K.T. Srikante Gowda said.

Members also pointed to a 2-acre land near chief minister’s residence belonging to Public Works department that can be given to the legislator’s club. The Public Works Minister Govind Karjol, however, did not commit on the allocation.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/house-panel-set-up-on-dress-code-in-clubs/article31043694.ece
349,2020/03/11,"10 cases of cholera, gastroenteritis confirmed in city","BBMP intensifies crackdown on roadside eateries

At least 10 people are confirmed to have contracted cholera and gastroenteritis, a majority of which are in the east zone. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike has intensified its eviction drive of unauthorised and unhygienic roadside eateries and meat shops.

Ravikumar Surpur, Special Commissioner (Health and Projects), told The Hindu that there were a total of 25 cases suspected in the city over the past few days out of which 10 cases have been confirmed.

“Crackdown on road side eateries is an ongoing process. However, the recent cases of cholera and gastroenteritis have just precipitated our actions against unhygienic and also unauthorised vendors across the city,” he said.

The civic body on Wednesday, expanded its crackdown to meat shops that are not maintaining proper hygiene. Officials have been directed to conduct surprise inspections on hotels to see whether they are maintaining prescribed standards. “We will sustain this drive for a long period of time. In the larger interests of the citizens of the city, we are taking strict action against many establishments,” he said.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said that the civic body was working with the Health Department and the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board to prevent the spreading of both cholera and gastroenteritis.

“The drive is being carried out in all the zones. We request the citizens to stop consuming roadside food that are the source of infection and practice good hygiene he said,” he said. He also said not all the eateries were closed across the city.

In response to allegations that vendors were being targeted, Randeep D. Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) said, “We are carrying out eviction drives with any exception as the public health department cannot take any risk. The drives are also awareness campaigns warning people to avoid unhealthy and unhygienic food,” he said.

350,2020/03/11,"COVID-19 hits business, trade volume down by 50%","The spread of COVID-19 has impacted 15 to 20 sectors across Karnataka and has resulted in a business decline of at least 50%, say small traders and trade body representatives. Karnataka has over 6 lakh small-scale industries and half of them are already impacted by the market scenario, as per trade body sources.

Trade in Bengaluru and in other parts of the State has a direct or indirect dependence on China as significant portions of raw materials, tool kits, computer accessories, as well as machine, motor, auto and print parts, solar panels and related equipment are mostly imported from China. The list of imports also includes all kinds of building material, fittings, furniture, home-furnishings and electronic and hardware items in addition to fabrics, apparel, yarn, wool and thread, etc.

Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association, president, R. Raju admitted that COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on some 15 to 20 different businesses. “It has disturbed the total supply chain. With the breakout of the virus came several restrictions around material movements and dispatches. This has created a chain reaction and the impact has been very deep. The fear factor further added to the impact.”

In addition to this, travel advisories, entry bans and other mobility restrictions have brought in negative sentiments, all across the country. “We started feeling the heat of the situation in the last over 10 days,” said Sandeep Singh, chairman, CII-Karnataka.

“As the intensity built up, people started cancelling their travels and enterprises cancelled events.” All these have taken a toll on the sales and marketing activities of companies. This in turn can significantly impact the overall productivity of traders and businesses in the last quarter of the fiscal, he added.

“If the situation does not improve in the next four weeks, the impact could be much higher especially on segments such as manufacturing, machine tools, automobile, tour and travels, hotels and entertainment,” Mr. Singh cautioned.

According to Devesh Agarwal, President, Bangalore Chamber Of Industry And Commerce, there is a buffer in the supply chain, at least for some industries, but that will soon be over. “The good news is that Chinese factories are reopening after the Lunar New Year. Also alternative supply chains are being developed. But, the fact is there is a clear slowness in global economic activities, and consumption has been on a decline.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-hits-business-trade-volume-down-by-50/article31043012.ece
351,2020/03/11,Villagers surround leopard near a bush in Tumakuru district,"Man suffers minor injuries as the animal tries to escape

A 55-year-old man was injured after he was attacked by a cornered leopard near Olakallu in Tumakuru district on Tuesday evening. Villagers, who are on edge after two leopard-related deaths in adjacent villages in 2019 and two more this year, discovered the leopard hiding near a bush.

Deputy Conservator of Forests Girish said: “Around a hundred villagers with sticks gathered near the bush on Tuesday.”

Around 25 Forest Department personnel who were also present at the spot requested the villagers not to attack the leopard. “But the villagers did not listen and started beating the leopard. The animal, while escaping, scratched the shoulder of one of the men, Manohar. He was given first-aid. Mr. Girish clarified that the leopard, which was hiding in the bush, was not the man-eater.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/villagers-surround-leopard-near-a-bush-in-tumakuru-district/article31037083.ece

However, the Health Department said there was no need to panic as the World Health Organisation’s protocols on quarantines are being adhered to. “The confirmed cases have been put up in a separate portion of the isolation ward. The prescribed one-metre distance is being maintained between two beds and all the patients are strictly following the precautions — use of N-95 masks, handwashing and sanitisation,” said B.G.

353,2020/03/11,Taxis see a dip in the number of bookings in Bengaluru,"Call taxi services are reeling from the drop in bookings

Taxi drivers, including those on apps like Ola and Uber, are seeing a decline in the number of bookings over the last 10 days.

App-based taxi drivers attribute this to two factors: people, especially those in the IT sector working from home, and decline in the number of bookings from people arriving at Kempegowda International Airport. “I waited for five hours yesterday for a ride from the airport. Usually, the wait is never beyond one hour,” said an Uber driver.

Tanveer Pasha, president, Ola, Uber Drivers and Owners’ Association, said that there was a dip in the number of bookings per day to the extent of 40%. “On an average, our cab drivers would see 10 bookings in 12 hours. Now, to finish 10 trips, our drivers have to work for 15 to 18 hours,” he said.

Call taxi services are reeling from the drop in bookings. K. Radhakrishna Holla, president of the Karnataka State Travel Operators’ Association, said that their industry had collapsed. “We are seeing a cancellation of 60% bookings for on-call taxi services. In addition, there is no local travel as it is exam season,” he said. He added that the situation has been grim over the past 10 days. “I have not seen dull business to this extent for the last 27 years,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/taxis-see-a-dip-in-the-number-of-bookings-in-bengaluru/article31036979.ece

Apart from clearing food carts, the BBMP is also ensuring that all garbage in the city is cleared.

However, BBMP officials said that panic created about COVID-19 has hit in-situ processing. “Many messages are being circulated on WhatsApp about spread of infections that are unverified. Though panic about spread of communicable diseases is unfounded, we have found a disinterest among citizens about in-situ composting. Some people have stated that they are scared,” an official told The Hindu.

355,2020/03/11,COVID-19: Fourth positive case made least contacts,"He isolated himself soon after he realised that he had symptoms

The fourth positive case in Bengaluru, a 50-year-old software professional who travelled from the U.S. via London and landed in Bengaluru on March 8, made the least number of contacts as he isolated himself soon after he realised that he had symptoms.

As of now, the Health Department has identified only 12 primary and secondary contacts of this person, who self-reported to RGICD late in the evening on March 9. While he is under treatment in the hospital, his wife, daughter and mother are under home isolation. His daughter has her II PU exams on Wednesday.

“This person resides in an individual house. He did not mingle with anyone or go out after his return as he realised he had developed symptoms. He promptly reported to the hospital. Hence, only 12 contacts including his family, residents of an immediate neighbouring house and the cab driver, who drove him from the airport and the driver’s family have been identified. We are contacting the airlines, whose flight he took to trace the co-passengers,” said B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases).

Asked if the house has been fumigated and sanitised, Dr. Prakash said all protocols have been followed. “His family is asymptomatic as of now and they will be under regular surveillance for the next 14 days,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-fourth-positive-case-made-least-contacts/article31034887.ece
356,2020/03/11,COVID-19: All four patients in city are stable,"Three of them tested positive on Tuesday; CM holds meeting with officials and Medical Education and Health Ministers

The condition of all the four persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Bengaluru is stable. They are currently admitted in the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) and responding well to treatment.

A day after Karnataka reported the first confirmed COVID-19 case, three more persons tested positive in Bengaluru on Tuesday. While two of the three new cases are the wife and teenaged daughter of the 46-year-old software professional tested positive on Monday, the third is another techie, who returned from the U.S. to Bengaluru via London on March 8.

The colleague of the first positive case, who was also quarantined, has tested negative and has been discharged on Tuesday. The techie’s driver and three members of the driver’s family, who have been isolated at home, continue to be asymptomatic.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who held a high-level meeting with officials and Medical Education and Health Ministers K. Sudhakar and B. Sriramulu, said Karnataka has strengthened all surveillance and containment measures against the possible spread of the disease. Apart from airports and ports, harbours, borders areas have also been put on high alert.

“Contact tracing of the affected persons has been taken up and all will be followed up regularly for 14 days,” he told presspersons after the meeting.

Cumulatively, 1,048 persons have been enrolled for observation and 275 of them have completed 28 days of observation. While 760 persons are continuing home quarantine, 389 of the 446 samples collected have tested negative. While four have tested positive, the remaining reports are awaited, the Chief Minister said.

As on Tuesday, nine cases have been quarantined in various hospitals in Bengaluru (RGICD), Hassan, Dakshina Kannada and Bagalkot. While six of these, including three new cases, are in RGICD, the other three districts have one each.

On Tuesday, Mr. Sudhakar inaugurated new laboratories under the Department of Microbiology in BMCRI.

IT employees

Dell Technologies and Mindtree on Tuesday sent out statements saying one each of their employees have been confirmed with COVID-19 and they have taken all measures as per protocol.

Meanwhile, residents of the apartment where one of patients lived claimed that the premises has not been sanitised. However, the Health Department said their fears were unfounded. “The helpers work in more than one house,” a resident said.

However, B.G. Prakash, Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), Health Department, said: “The officials have screened everyone. The house help has been identified and put under home isolation.

357,2020/03/11,"Examine passport and visa validity of foreign students, VTU tells colleges","Police complain of some city colleges admitting students without valid documents

The Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU) has urged all its affiliated colleges to examine the passport and visa validity of international students before admitting them. This comes after the university received complaints that some colleges in Bengaluru were admitting students without proper documentation.

“We received a letter from the police stating that some of the colleges were accepting admissions without verifying documents. They have also told us that a number of students had stopped attending classes and were engaged in anti-social activities,” a senior VTU official said. The university, in a circular to colleges last week, stated that these details should also be verified at regular intervals. Colleges have also been warned that if any of the conditions are violated, the institutions will be liable for prosecution for sheltering people from other nationalities under relevant provisions of The Foreigners Act 1946.

A VTU official said that many of the Bengaluru-based engineering colleges advertise in other countries to woo students. “They have a large number of vacant seats and admit students without checking their credentials. They also charge a higher fee for foreign students,” the official said.

S.A Kori, Executive Director, Karnataka State Higher Education Council, said that all students enrol in colleges after approval from the Ministry of External Affairs.

According to the All-India Survey of Higher Education 2018-19, Karnataka has the highest number of international students. Of the total 47,427 foreign students enrolled in higher educational institutions across the country, 10,023 students are in institutions within Karnataka.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/examine-passport-and-visa-validity-of-foreign-students-vtu-tells-colleges/article31034831.ece
358,2020/03/11,Cheaper BMTC tickets may benefit all stakeholders: Study,"‘Reduction of fares can lead to increase in ridership, thereby reducing congestion on roads’

At a time when citizens and citizen organisations are demanding that the government reduce fares of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) services, a recent study by a city-based research lab indicated that cheaper tickets may benefit all stakeholders. Their findings showed that reduction of fares could lead to an increase in ridership and thereby reduce congestion on roads and emissions.

The study conducted by a city-based research lab ‘Fields of View’ presents a scenario-based analysis of change in BMTC’s fare to understand possible strategies towards a sustainable transportation in Bengaluru.

Researchers examined the impact of three scenarios after a 10% reduction in BMTC’s average fare prices, which saw an increase in ridership. However, a 10% increase in BMTC’s average fare prices, according to the study, leads to a possible 20% reduction in ridership and possibly increase annual loss by ₹220 crore.

According to the researchers, the gross loss of BMTC in 2018-2019 was ₹538.2 crore. “For 10% reduction in price, the implication on revenue for BMTC ranges from reduction of this loss by ₹362.2 crore to an increase of loss by ₹183 crore,” the research stated.

To understand the effects of change in fare in public transportation, the researchers studied the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST), Delhi Metro Rail corporation (DMRC), Delhi, and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation–Airport express line and considered demand elasticity, revenue generated through ridership and the profit and loss of the BMTC.

The study recommends that it was important for BMTC to increase the capacity and fleet proportional to the population of the city. “BMTC would require 14,952 buses in order to reach India’s average of 1.2 buses per 1,000 population,” they said.

Srinivasa Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) said that citizens and various organisations have been demanding reduction in fare. “We had requested Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan to reduce the fare and announce it in the budget and had also written to the Chief Minister. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Investment in public transport is investment in public health,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/txiqu4/article31034820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGBMTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cheaper-bmtc-tickets-may-benefit-all-stakeholders-study/article31034821.ece
359,2020/03/11,IISc. cancels controversial lecture,"Students and some citizens object to the ‘Islamophobic and sexist’ content

The Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science was forced to cancel a lecture by scientist and Kannada writer K.N. Ganeshaiah after students and other citizens took objection to the content on the grounds that it was both “Islamophobic and sexist”. The lecture was scheduled for Wednesday, but cancelled on Tuesday evening.

Prof. Ganeshaiah, an agricultural scientist from the University of Agricultural Sciences, confirmed the development and said he had received a communication from the institute.

However, Anurag Kumar, Director, IISc, denied any knowledge of the lecture or its cancellation.

The talk was titled ‘Polygamy, Sexual Selection and Terrorism’ and the abstract argued that polygamy and female foeticide created mate-deprived “bare branches” men, making them vulnerable to take up crime, terrorism and militancy. “Bare branches of certain societies are likely to provide the ground force for terrorism,” read the abstract. It further says the talk would “illustrate a strong spatial and anthropological association between polygamy, female foeticide and terrorism”.

Sources said several students of the Centre for Ecological Sciences and other departments of IISc. took objection to the lecture. The abstract of the lecture was shared on Twitter on Tuesday drawing sharp criticism from several students and academics.

One Twitter user termed the talk “A1 eugenicist talk”, while another handle, while praising the IISc. administration for cancelling it, tweeted: “Islamophobia runs deep in India because of its institutional backing.”

Prof. Ganeshaiah, who is also a Kannada novelist writing thrillers in the alternate history genre, said: “It is sad that people are not ready to listen and then decide. The talk was based on an acclaimed book ‘Bare Branches’ by Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer published by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It’s a research that we need to be open to.”

The book ‘Bare Branches’ argues: “High male-to-female ratios often trigger domestic and international violence. Most violent crime is committed by young unmarried males who lack stable social bonds”.

‘Sex ratios skewed’

The authors suggest that “the sex ratios of many Asian countries, particularly China and India — which represent almost 40% of the world’s population — are being skewed in favour of males on a scale that may be unprecedented in human history” attributing it to offspring sex selection – female foeticide and infanticide.

However, Prof. Ganeshaiah’s talk argued that polygamy was also a contributing factor to creation of bare branches, which is not part of the argument in the book, thereby raising objections of Islamophobia. “I was trying to make an argument that polygamy also skewed the availability of mates in certain communities. But polygamy is not limited to Islam alone. It was prevalent in other communities as well,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/1k5vnt/article31034723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGIISC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/iisc-cancels-controversial-lecture/article31034724.ece
360,2020/03/11,Stir continues at Doddabelavangala,"BBMP may resume sending waste to MSGP from tomorrow

Community members from Doddabelavangala, near Doddaballapur, continued their indefinite strike on Tuesday and rejected any reconciliatory attempts made by Revenue Minister R. Ashok, Yelahanka MLA S.R. Vishwanath, BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar and the Mayor.

Mr. Vishwanath told The Hindu that protesters have found support in Hanumanthanatha Swami of Yeleramapura. They are demanding that the BBMP close a waste processing unit in Doddabelavangala and scrap its plans to revive another unit near Doddaballapur that has remained shut since 2016.

“We told them that the BBMP had no plans to revive the second unit, and that we want to clear the legacy waste that is accumulated there,” he said, and added that the operational waste processing plant could not be shut down immediately without any alternative arrangements.

The seer and 10 representatives have been invited for a meeting with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. “We will give them a day’s time. We have also discussed the issue with the police, and will send waste from the city to the plant from Thursday,” he said. Admitting that with the Byragondlu dam coming up around 5-km away from the village under the Yettinahole project, Mr. Vishwanath said: “We may not be able to operate the plant for long.”

The BBMP has not sent any garbage trucks to the plant since the community members began their protest on Friday.

Civic officials maintained that there were no issues with the functioning of the plant. “Members of the Technical Guidance Committee also visited the plant recently. If there were any problems, they would have flagged them,” a senior official told The Hindu.

Mr. Ashok announced that he would visit the plant after Doddaballapur MLA T. Venkataramanaiah and several other MLAs from Bengaluru city raised concerns about environmental hazards being caused by the units, in the Legislative Assembly on Tuesday. The MLAs alleged that the waste processing centre was being managed in an unscientific manner causing environmental hazards.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/stir-continues-at-doddabelavangala/article31034673.ece

Burglars allegedly broke open an iron safe inside a locked house and escaped with more than 25 sovereigns of gold jewels and cash on Tuesday night.

The burglary came to light on Wednesday morning when Padavettammal, 60, of Kambattu village in Thandarampattu, found jewellery missing from one of the iron safes.

Based on a complaint filed with Vanapuram police, a team reached the spot and conducted preliminary inquiries.

Family sleeping

Police sources said Padavettammal and her family had returned home tired from the day’s work on a farm and gone to sleep on Tuesday.

Police found that the locks on doors were not tampered with. Keys kept in another part of the house were used for opening the safe.

Valuables kept in another safe were left untouched. Some cash, realised by the family by selling a cow, was also reported missing.

Deputy Superintendent of Police Hemachitra and her team visited spot and said that forensic experts collected evidence from the scene of crime.

367,2020/03/11,COVID-19: Chennai Port bans arrival of unscheduled international cruise ships,"Even in the case of scheduled vessels, the crew will not be permitted into the port if the ship or any passenger or crew had visited any of the 19 affected countries since February 1, officials said

Chennai Port has banned the arrival of unscheduled international cruise ships until the end of this month in view of the spread of COVID-19. According to sources at the port, the ban has been enforced as a precautionary measure to prevent any vessel that plans to make a stopover here.

International cruise ships that have already made a declaration before January 1 this year that they plan to call on Chennai Port will be allowed to do so as scheduled, sources said. “Even in the case of scheduled vessels that plan to arrive at the city port, the crew will not be permitted into the port if the ship or any passenger or crew had visited any of the 19 affected countries since February 1,” said an official.

“This is not just for Chennai port alone. We have received information from the Centre to all ports in the country,” the official added. Usually, only one cruise ship or a maximum of two comes to Chennai Port every month.

Meanwhile, port officials said they have been following Standard Operating Procedure (SoP) and checking almost all the ships that enter into the port.

There is a tab on the list of crew and their health conditions which is sent by the Masters of Captains to the port authorities before a ship reaches the city. The Port Health Officer continuously monitors the screening of the crew and all necessary equipment are in place at the port, officials said.

Officials said that owing to the spread of COVID-19 in many parts of the world, there is likely to be a dip in the cargo but the estimate will be known only in the coming days.

“We are also facing stiff competition. Only a detailed analysis will show us if the dip is only because of COVID-19 alone or other reasons,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pd259n/article31040663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MARTH--PORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-chennai-port-bans-arrival-of-unscheduled-international-cruise-ships/article31040664.ece

In view of COVID-19, Chennai Metro Rail plans to start making announcements at stations asking passengers to cover their mouths with tissues or handkerchiefs while coughing.

Some passengers cough without covering their mouth inside the station and train and other passengers get anxious. Venkatachalam M, a resident of Nanganallur who travels to Thousand Lights says, “A passenger sitting next to me kept coughing constantly without closing his mouth. I have low immunity and in times like this, I want to be more careful. Chennai Metro Rail should put such announcements not just in stations alone but inside trains as well, because this is public transport and commuters need to be cautious.”

Sources said, they have received a few complaints from passengers stating that staff sitting in the counters are coughing while issuing tickets. Another source said they have issued masks and hand sanitisers to the staff at all stations. “We have more than 1 lakh passengers travelling every day so, we want everyone to be careful.

370,2020/03/11,Public transport hit as employees stage sit-in protest across Tamil Nadu,"With bus drivers and conductors attached to various unions protesting, bus services have been paralysed and commuters are facing difficulties

More than 10 transport trade unions have gone on a sit-in protest across the city and State, paralysing bus transport on Wednesday morning.

A member of the CITU trade union said that the sit-in protest was to demand that the State government call in the Federation of Transport Trade Unions for wage agreement talks.

While the State Transport Department had issued a press release announcing March 20 as the date for the first round of wage agreement talks to be held between transport officials and trade unions at the Chromepet bus depot, the trade union federation members in a press release had stated that the State government should invite them for talks. The union member said that as Transport Department officials were not willing to heed to their various demands, protests are being held in various depots across the State.

The protest by the drivers and conductors attached to various Opposition unions has resulted in commuters facing severe hardships. M. Anand, a resident of Medavakkam, said there were a limited number of Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses being operated on the Tambaram route resulting in commuters being forced to depend on share autorickshaws, as the buses were all jam packed during the morning rush hour.

A senior official of MTC, denying that only a limited number of buses were plying, said more than 2,500 buses were being operated from various depots.

Long-distance buses including those belonging to the State Express Transport Corporation were not operated from the Dr. MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/z00991/article31038069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MARTH-Strike1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/public-transport-hit-as-employees-stage-sit-in-protest-across-tamil-nadu/article31038071.ece
371,2020/03/11,HC stays order for holding fresh polls to Nadigar Sangam,"Bench decides to hear appeals against single judge’s order on April 8

A Division Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday stayed the operation of an order passed by a single judge of the court on January 24, directing the holding of fresh elections to the South Indian Artistes Association (SIAA), popularly known as Nadigar Sangam, after discarding the polls held on June 23 with the court’s permission.

The Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and Abdul Quddhose granted the interim stay till April 8 following a batch of appeals preferred by SIAA through its counsel on record Krishna Ravindran and by its former treasurer Karthi. The appellants insisted that the court allows the counting of votes polled on June 23.

Agreeing to take up the appeals for final hearing next month, the judges stayed the operation of as many as seven out of a series of 10 directions issued by the single judge while passing a common judgment on a batch of writ petitions as well as civil suits filed both for and against the validity of the polls held last year.

The seven directions that the Bench had stayed included those for the preparation of a fresh voters’ list, the holding of fresh elections, the provision of police protection for the fresh polls, holding that the decision of a court-appointed Election Officer will be final in case of any dispute, and the fixing of an ultimatum of three months to conduct fresh elections.

Making it clear that a State government-appointed Special Officer could continue to manage the affairs of the association until the appeals are disposed of, the Division Bench refrained from staying the operation of the single judge’s three other directives, one of which permitted the Special Officer to be in command until new office-bearers take charge.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-stays-order-for-holding-fresh-polls-to-nadigar-sangam/article31035628.ece
372,2020/03/11,‘Follow IRC guidelines while clearing new fuel outlets’,"Petroleum dealers have urged the State government, oil companies and other agencies to follow the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) 12-2009 guidelines strictly while giving clearance to new fuel outlets. Oil majors have started issuing letters of intent to dealers for new retail outlets. Tenders had been called for around 5,000 new locations as part of a national move to strengthen outlet numbers and ensure supply. The State already has around 4,800 fuel outlets.

Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association president K.P. Murali said the courts had also directed the various governments to implement the IRC guidelines while new outlets are being sanctioned.

“Outlets must be at least 100 metres from intersections. They also should not be too close to existing outlets, a minimum distance of 1,000 metres is a must on the plains and 300 metres in the hills. This has also been drawn up keeping the safety of motorists and surrounding installations since the outlets deal with inflammable goods,” he said.

“They keep insisting that we follow various rules and threaten us with fines and strictures under the marketing discipline guidelines. A couple of years ago, they used to breathe down our necks, asking us to ensure clean toilets and also allow highway travellers to use these facilities. We don’t mind providing basic facilities. Companies too should follow rules when new outlets come up,” said a dealer, who has been in the business for over 40 years.

In the last six months, residents of Kasimedu and Royapettah protested against the setting up of auto liquefied petroleum gas outlets stating that they posed fire hazards. There have also been instances of leakage from petroleum outlets in residential areas. And it got mixed with groundwater.

A retired oil company official said in recent times, dealers and oil companies took better care of underground tank facilities.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/follow-irc-guidelines-while-clearing-new-fuel-outlets/article31035499.ece

374,2020/03/11,"PIL wants permanent body to preserve Eastern, Western Ghats","Litigant claims all steps taken so far remain only on paper

A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the Centre and the State government to constitute a permanent body for taking serious and practical steps to safeguard the flora, fauna and other natural resources in the Eastern and Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu.

The case filed by DMK spokesperson K.S. Radhakrishnan, on the basis of the recommendations made by the Madhav Gadgil and Kasturi Rangan committees, has been listed for admission before the first Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad on Wednesday.

According to the petitioner, the Western Ghats run to around 1.6 lakh sq km, from Kanniyakumari to Gujarat, spanning six different States in the country. The ghats were spread over 28,200 sq km in Tamil Nadu, 43,300 sq km in Karnataka, 58,400 sq km in Maharashtra, 1,075 sq km in Goa and 28,100 sq km in Kerala.

“The natural resources abundantly available in this area are being properly utilised by other regions, except Tamil Nadu. The exceptional reasons are not germane but it may not be out of place to mention that the Western Ghats in Tamil Nadu are being misutilised and mismanaged not only by the administrators but also by the public at large,” he said.

The Union Ministry of Environment and Forests had constituted the Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel under the chairmanship of acclaimed ecologist Madhav Dhananjaya Gadgil, who submitted a report in 2011 followed by another report by the Kasturirangan committee. However, their recommendations were not implemented in letter and spirit, the litigant claimed.

He further pointed out that the Eastern Ghats run from northern Odisha to Tamil Nadu through Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Though not as high as the Western Ghats, the eastern ghats also boast of a wide list of sanctuaries, national parks, hills, rivers and waterfalls providing great natural aesthetics to the entire region.

Most reserve forest areas in these hills were protected by the Forest Department under the Tamil Nadu Forest Act of 1982 and Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. “The Tamil Nadu Hill Areas (Preservation of Trees) Act of 1955 is in force in certain parts of these hills but it is not implemented effectively in the absence of popular support.

“As a result, the protection of the trees in private holdings has become a challenge. By making use of the loopholes in the Act and other government rules, trees are felled and removed clandestinely. These activities have made the hills of the Eastern Ghats barren, its streams have run dry and the biodiversity is disappearing gradually.

“Large-scale plantations of coffee, tea and orchards have been raised in these hills. Aromatic and valuable trees like sandal are removed illegally. Despite the Wildlife Protection Act, hunting takes place in some pockets. The forests are getting degraded because of illicit collection of firewood, illicit grazing and illicit felling of trees,” he added.

Though various initiatives had been taken by the government to protect the ecology, all of them remain only on paper though the State had a constitutional duty under Article 48A to protect and improve the environment and to safeguard the forests and wildlife in the country, the petitioner said and sought for the intervention of the court.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pil-wants-permanent-body-to-preserve-eastern-western-ghats/article31035464.ece

376,2020/03/11,CCB arrests three for cheating,"They ran a call centre and offered people bank loans

Sleuths of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) anti-bank fraud team have arrested three persons for running a call centre and cheating people under the pretext of getting them bank loans.

Selvakumar, Kumar and Midhun ran the call centre with over 80 tele-callers. “The main suspect, Selvakumar, is also a member of the trade wing of a political party,” said a police officer.

“The tele-callers would call people and offer quick loans. Most of their targets were from the low/middle income group. Once the customer agreed, they would collect details including their PAN, Aadhaar and bank account numbers,” said a police officer.

A few days later, the tele-callers would call up and ask customers to maintain a minimum balance of ₹50,000 in their accounts. “After that, they would either access the customers’ bank accounts online or fool them into sharing OTP with them. They would then withdraw the ₹50,000. When the customer enquired, they would claim this to be loan processing charges,” the officer said.

Later, when the customers asked them for the loan, they would say that the loan request had been rejected and that the processing fee would be reversed in 45 days. They would then switch off their phones. “People should not believe people offering loans through phones,” the officer said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ccb-arrests-three-for-cheating/article31035456.ece

378,2020/03/11,Mystery behind floating body in Perumbakkam lake solved,"Father, son arrested after they disposed of another body

With the arrest of a 45-year-old auto driver and his son, the Pallikaranai police have solved the case of a woman’s body found floating in the Perumbakkam lake four months ago.

The auto driver from Medavakkam was caught on camera disposing of the body of a lift operator in the same lake. He admitted that he and his son strangulated the woman. He thought that the police would not be able to identify the deceased if the body was drowned.

Four months ago, an unidentified body of a person with long hair was found floating in the Perumbakkam lake.

The Pallikaranai police initially could not identify the gender and interrogated several persons. No one came forward to claim the body.

Last Sunday, even while the investigation was on, the body of an unidentified male was found floating in the lake.

CCTV camera footage

The body was found to be that of Henry Jayasingh, 33, a lift operator residing in the Tamil Nadu Housing Board flats in Chittlapakkam.

His missing motorcyclewas traced to a Tasmac outlet, where he was last seen. “CCTV camera footage showed that he was carried to an auto after he was drunk. The registration number of the auto was vital to tracing its owner, Xavier Arul, in Ramaiah Nagar, Medavakkam,” said Pallikaranai Inspector R. Alagu.

Last Saturday, when Arul and his associate Amulraj alias Vishnu were consuming alcohol, they spotted Jayasingh, wearing a gold chain.

They invited him to drink with them on the banks of the lake.

They drank on the banks. Later, Arul and his associate attacked Jayasingh and dumped his body in the lake.

During interrogation, Arul admitted that he and his son Michael Vijay, 20, killed Sabana, a 24-year-old woman from Tiruvannamalai. She was an orphan, and while working in a textile showroom she fell in love with Vijay. Arul, who opposed their relationship, had asked Vijay to bring her to the lake, where the father-son duo strangulated her with a nylon rope and threw her body into the lake.

Arul is a political functionary, the police said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mystery-behind-floating-body-in-perumbakkam-lake-solved/article31035430.ece

“We are expected to pay 10% TDS for turnover, based on the theatrical run of a film, which might not always mean that the film has given us any profit. This is extremely unfair,” Mr. Rajendar said. Stating that distributors are an important bridge between producers and theatre owners, he said that their appeals had to be considered to ensure that the industry functions smoothly.

Residents and members of the Sea Turtle Protection Force (STPF) at Alambarai Kuppam spotted the dolphin and informed officials of the Kancheepuram Forest Department.

Supraja Dharini, chairperson of the TREE Foundation, said the dolphin was 56 inches long and weighed around 500 kg.

It was found to have flippers 74-inch long. There were wounds near its head, she said.

Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins inhabit coastal waters in tropical to warm-temperate regions, and enter rivers, mangroves and estuaries.

They are at risk from factors that also threaten other cetaceans, such as entanglement in fishing nets, pollution and the depletion of fish stocks worldwide, a press release from the TREE Foundation said.

381,2020/03/11,Metrowater expedites project to fit digital water meters,"Move will ensure judicious use of water in city’s commercial buildings

Chennai Metrowater has accelerated the process to fit digital water meters with automated meter reading (AMR) in commercial buildings to ensure the judicious use of water among consumers in the city.

Of the 12,708 commercial and water-intensive consumers, including hotels, companies and educational institutions, AMR meters have been fitted in 5,300 buildings in the city. Those who use nearly 5,000 kilolitres of water, every month, fall in the category of water-intensive users.

As of now, meter reading is done using hand-held devices that work with radio frequency identification technology.

Metrowater officials said that software for automated reading is being developed to enable officers to read and monitor water meters and raise bills from their area and head offices. The software that will enable transmission of data to the Metrowater server is expected to be ready in a few weeks.

“The meters are being sourced from Hitron, a company in France. More buildings in the category will be identified in the second phase and eventually use of such meters will be expanded to domestic consumers as well,” said an official.

The project is being taken up at a cost of ₹9.5 crore, with funding under the Smart City Mission. This is to encourage consumers to pay according to their use and track water consumption. The water agency has already started billing based on volumetric consumption. Soon, engineers will not have to visit the field to raise bills or read meters, officials said. A recent study by a consultant had suggested that nearly 6.14 lakh new water meters could be fitted in core city and added areas. “We plan to fit AMR meters in the identified buildings by June,” said an official.

Water dispensers

Moreover, the water agency has sought funds of ₹5 crore to fit smartcard-based water dispensers in some of the filling posts that have been left out during the first phase of the Smart City project.

Nearly 191 filling posts in the 41 distribution stations have been fitted with such units, wherein a specific volume of water will flow once a lorry driver swipes his smartcard.

This is set to bring down leaks and monitor pilferage, the official added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/oqwmtp/article31035421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/62c98f05-0aeb-4887-a524-2d1d10c47811,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metrowater-expedites-project-to-fit-digital-water-meters/article31035422.ece

However, a traffic policeman said, “We use fresh straws in breathlysers as we have a stock of three lakh straws. But our safety is not assured”.

Each police station checks at least 1,000 persons every day for drunk driving.

“We fear that when a person breathes into the straw, droplets can fall on the breathalyser and we can contract the infection,” said an enforcement officer.

Even pulmonologists are of the opinion that the traffic policemen should be given masks, said officers.

Several flights fly with poor occupancy. Airports wear a dull and a nearly empty look. At a time when hundreds of passengers have called off non-essential travel this past month following fear of COVID-19, what is it like to work at the airport in such times?

Employees go about their jobs as usual with care and precaution, though there is a faint underlying fear inside, many of them said.

“Immigration staff like me are the first point of contact for passengers after they finish the health check-up. I wear gloves and a mask and have a hand sanitiser. I meet hundreds of passengers every day. I’m confident that with good precautionary measures nothing will happen, but there are moments when I’m a bit nervous,” a staff in immigration said.

The police and CISF personnel, who walk through to different parts of both international and domestic terminals round the clock, say they are in a critical job of communicating with almost all the staff in the terminals.

“I’m confident that as long as we take adequate precautions, there is nothing to fear. Even if there is a chance of getting the infection, we read reports about cases where people have recovered from COVID-19. There should be only caution and not any stigma,” a police source said.

Family in fear

While they are confident, they say their family members don’t feel the same way. “My wife keeps calling me every now and then to check if I’m doing fine. I keep reassuring her that there is nothing to feel paranoid. But yes, the fear is quite natural,” a CISF staff said.

But many passengers are scared to eat or even touch anything in the terminals, they added.

“The growing fear is affecting everyone. This kind of an uneasy atmosphere shouldn’t persist for long,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-what-is-it-like-to-work-at-airport/article31035367.ece
386,2020/03/11,Latest sample of COVID-19 patient tests negative,"Seven close contacts of the man in hospital too test negative

The latest test result of a 45-year-old man, who returned from Muscat and tested positive for COVID-19, has returned negative, top officials of the Health Department said.

The patient, who is undergoing treatment at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), was asymptomatic and fine, officials said.

Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said as per protocol, a patient can be discharged only if two samples test negative for COVID-19. In this case, another sample of the patient should test negative for the disease.

She said that barring one, all nasal and throat swabs and blood samples, numbering 73, have returned negative for COVID-19 in the State.

The Health Department had earlier quarantined two foreigners in a hotel and brought them under surveillance.

The duo was “close contacts” of persons who had arrived from Italy and tested positive for COVID-19 in Kerala. Officials said the two persons were from Switzerland and had been on the same flight as the one taken by the infected persons. However, both were asymptomatic and tested negative for COVID-19.

Earlier, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said eight persons, including seven close contacts of the 45-year-old infected man, had tested negative for COVID-19.

As per the bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine on Tuesday, five persons were under hospital quarantine in the State. A total of 1,225 people were under home surveillance in T.N.

Till date, 1,40,064 people have been screened at the four airports in the State.

Apart from the 300 beds in isolation wards of government hospitals, private hospitals are being roped in to set up isolation wards.

“We held a meeting with private hospitals and asked who among them were equipped to set up isolation wards. Hospitals have come forward to set up wards, and we have formed a team in the government to look into this,” the Minister told reporters after inaugurating hostel buildings at the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital. Ten beds have been earmarked at the Perambur Railway Hospital.

Disinfecting cinemas

The DPH has directed cinemas across the State to disinfect the halls after each show, and shopping malls to disinfect surfaces on a regular basis.

“We have stepped up efforts to disinfect theatres, shopping malls and public transport — both buses and trains. Already, local bodies and transport corporations have started these works. This should be done continuously,” said K. Kolandaswamy, Director of Public Health.

He said the public can call the State’s helpline 104 if they come across any inadequacies in this regard.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eu5nhj/article31035352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THCORONOVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/latest-sample-of-covid-19-patient-tests-negative/article31035353.ece
387,2020/03/11,For a universal status of personhood,"In instilling a regime where there is a presumption against citizenship, the Foreigners Act denies the weakest their rights

A series of judgments delivered by the Gauhati High Court over the course of the last few weeks has brought into sharp focus the utter brutality of the regime governing the Foreigners’ Tribunals in Assam. These verdicts entrench the establishment of an unreasonable burden on people declared as deemed foreigners by seeking from them a standard of proof that is wholly incommensurate with the consequences that befall the ultimate finding — in many cases, consignment to detention camps and a pronouncement of a condition of statelessness. From a reading of the judgments, the standard, as it were, is so disproportionate that it is virtually impossible to glean what a petitioner actually has to do to succeed. Indeed, the chances of success are so negligible that, an analysis of 787 orders and judgments of the High Court between 2010 and 2019, by Leah Verghese and Shruthi Naik of Daksh India, shows us that in 97% of the cases, the petitioner before the court was confirmed as a foreigner.

This statistic is scarcely surprising given the list of documents deemed inadequate for the purposes of establishing a person’s citizenship. Consider the following: electoral photo identity cards, voters’ lists bearing petitioners’ names, land revenue receipts, certificates issued by the local panchayat, bank passbooks, permanent account number (PAN) cards and ration cards. Each of these has been variously rejected as proof of citizenship. What is more, according to the court, not only must a petitioner adduce documentary evidence, whatever that might actually be, establishing that their parents or ancestors were present on Indian soil prior to March 25, 1971 — a cut-off date distinct to Assam — but they must also independently validate those documents by securing the testimony of their issuing authorities. For example, if a petitioner produces a certificate of her marriage in an attempt to establish her lineage, and should that document be accepted by the Tribunal, the petitioner will still have to lead evidence through the authority that was responsible for dispensing the certificate. Is there, we might want to ask ourselves, a more noxiously labyrinthine exercise than this?

Assam and tribunals

The Foreigners’ Tribunals (FT), which work as quasi-judicial bodies, were originally created through an executive order made by the Union government in 1964. Their task was to furnish opinions on whether persons referred to them were “foreigners” or not within the meaning ascribed to the term under the Foreigners Act, 1946. This legislation, which was enacted by the colonial government with a view to regulating migration into India, defines a foreigner as any person who is not a citizen of India. It also accords to the government a wide-ranging power to control the entry, exit and movement of foreigners to and within the territory of the country.

In Assam, the FTs have played a role unique to the State’s history. Typically, the tribunals there have seen two kinds of cases: those concerning persons against whom a reference has been made by the border police and those whose names in the electoral roll has a “D”, or “doubtful”, marked against them. The references made to the FTs in the State have arisen out of a mandate contained in the 1985 Assam Accord. The agreement was a product of a student-driven movement against, among other things, immigration into the State following the declaration of Bangladesh’s independence on March 26, 1971. It made a number of stipulations, including a direction to government to identify and have declared as foreigners any person who entered Assam between January 1, 1966 and March 24, 1971—the names of the persons so identified, the accord says, ought to be deleted from the electoral rolls. What is more, the pact also demanded that the government identify those who came into Assam on or after March 25 of that year and have them deleted and expelled. It was to this end that in 1997 the electoral rolls were revised in the State and more than three lakh individuals were marked as doubtful voters. This revision was made without any prior and independent verification. Out of those left out, nearly two lakh people have already been referred to the FTs.

Burden of proof

Ordinarily, under the Indian Evidence Act of 1872, the burden of proof in any court of law lies on the person who seeks to make a claim or assert a fact. This would mean that before the FTs, it is the government, which avers that a person is a foreigner, on whom the burden ought to lie. But Section 9 of the Foreigners Act reverses this burden. It places the responsibility on every person referred to an FT by the State to establish before the Tribunal that he or she is, in fact, a citizen of India.

In 1983, the Union government, sensing the oppressive nature of the burden placed, introduced the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act. This law, which overrode the Foreigners Act, subtly shifted the onus to prove citizenship from the individual to the government. But, in July 2005, the Supreme Court, in Sarbananda Sonowal vs Union of India, declared the legislation unconstitutional. The Court found, through an almost cavalier consideration of history and facts, that migration into Assam constituted “external aggression” against the State, and, therefore, that the Central government had violated Article 355 of the Constitution. Given this, the burden to establish citizenship, the Court held, ought to always rest on the individual.

It is this judgment in Sarbananda Sonowal that has since served as the fundamental premise on which the Gauhati High Court has ruled on various petitions made against the verdicts of the FTs. But even assuming the burden ought to lie on the individual to establish her citizenship, these rulings could still benefit, as Madhav Khosla recently pointed out, by the outlining of a sensible test on what degree or level of proof ought to be sufficient to discharge the burden. However, by holding, for example, that persons suspected of being foreigners ought to not only provide documentary evidence but also have those documents attested by the authority that issued them, the Court has foisted on the petitioners a standard that is virtually impossible to meet.

Perhaps, the solution lies, as Gautam Bhatia has written, in an approach taken by the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights. That is that the burden to establish citizenship might well lie on the individual, as the Foreigners Act stipulates, but once he or she has produced a basic set of documents that, on the face of things, make out a plausible claim, the onus ought to then shift to the State to rebut the evidence provided. Ultimately, as the Gauhati High Court has itself held, individuals are not expected to establish “beyond reasonable doubt” that they are citizens of India. What is expected of them is to show on a balance of probabilities that they are not foreigners. In such circumstances, the rational answer would be to allow the onus to shift to the State once the individual has met a basic threshold of proof.

This approach is, no doubt, far from perfect. In a country like ours, where the weakest and poorest among us are often denied access to basic goods, requiring individuals to produce documents to establish citizenship can by itself represent an onerous demand. We often see rights as universal, but as political philosopher Hannah Arendt pointed out in The Origins of Totalitarianism, to truly possess rights, individuals often need to belong to a political community. In other words, “the right to have rights” is seen as contingent on citizenship. In instilling a regime where a presumption against citizenship operates, the Foreigners Act denies to the weakest among us this right to have rights. It treats them as less equal beings. To reverse this damage, we must do as Seyla Benhabib has suggested. We must recognise a universal status of personhood of every human being independent of their nationality.

388,2020/03/11,"Letters to the Editor — March 11, 2020","The cost of saving Yes

In the Yes Bank case, in our haste to find faults and then fix responsibility for them, are we not overlooking a vital aspect which could have played a significant role in the disastrous showing by the bank — the floundering economy of the country? I would say that it all started with the folly of demonetisation which virtually brought the cash-driven rural and MSME sectors of the economy to its knees. It also struck a huge blow to the real estate sector. The parlous state of the real estate sector did have a role to play as far as some prominent NBFCs who lent massively to the sector are concerned. The slowdown in realty and the stalling of infrastructure projects has had a chain reaction in the form of sharply reduced demand for many products.

Unless the government realises the gravity of the situation and initiate steps to stimulate the economy, there could be more bad news.

M.P. Muralidharan,

Bengaluru

How many readjustments is the government of the day going to make to save every bank that is ready to collapse? What about the State Bank of India’s own non-performing assets? The Yes Bank case shows that lending heavily to corporates without due diligence of their loan history is one of the major issues affecting the banking sector. Had similar loan amounts been extended to small- and medium-scale industries it would have most certainly boosted growth and employment and might have even revived the sinking growth of MSMEs. The government of the day needs to invite the best banking experts to run banks and also ensure a strong regulation regime to control the issue of growing NPAs.

Ratnaraj Jain,

The case raises questions on the efficacy of present regulatory systems and procedures. It is to be noted that the bigwigs who commit these huge financial frauds are very aware of our legal system, where a case can be dragged on for decades using the maze of adjournments and appeals at various levels. It is to be hoped that at least now the banking regulator will thoroughly reform the regulatory systems and procedures and that independent bank board members will be appointed based on their professional competence and integrity.

Name and shame

The puerile, insidious act of the Uttar Pradesh government, of using hoardings to ‘name and shame” persons arrested during protests last December against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, is reprehensible and exceeding its remit (Page 1, “HC orders removal of Lucknow hoardings”, March 10). By demonising the alleged protesters and portraying them as criminals is proving of mens rea by the government per se. The judiciary should have also adjudicated to recover the expenses against the provision of hoardings from the Lucknow District Magistrate.

Quest for a govt. job

The report that well qualified candidates are among newly appointed conservancy staff in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu is not the first of its kind in India (Page 1, “When PGs pick up the broom to become govt. servants”, March 10). Though social equality has ensured a more level playing field, the question whether there is proper utilisation of skills of an educated person remains unanswered. The government needs to fix strict eligibility criteria and thereby help to channelise the potential of the skilled and the educated for the betterment of the nation. The government should also incentivise job creators and curb the perception that only government jobs are best.

Archana Venkatamadhvaraj,

Thoothukkudi, Tamil Nadu

The report is is a signal to the State governments and the Centre. The fact that highly educated persons are now conservancy staff in the Coimbatore Municipal Corporation highlights rising unemployment every year in the country. There have been reports of how in Uttar Pradesh, there were lakhs of well qualified applicants for lower rung jobs. As there is a huge percentage of the young in India, the government has the foremost responsibility of creating more jobs.

389,2020/03/11,Punchy flavours and quirky flourishes,"Miss T sheds her South East Asian garb and transforms into Mei13

The shiny red door is new, but slide it open and you step into the familiar light-filled interiors of Miss T. The upholstery remains shades of blue but the tables have been rearranged a bit and there’s a new terrazzo wall. Upstairs, a few black and white sketches of Mandarin women have been added.

When Miss T shut down a few months ago, the city lost an interesting mix of Vietnamese, Burmese, and Thai offerings, but the space has been resurrected as a Cantonese diner that opened over this past weekend. “We had to close post monsoon last year to take care of some maintenance issues. Miss T was not commercially at the place we expected 15 months after opening, so we decided to supplement the menu with some classic Chinese dishes for which we brought Chef Lee (Kent Lee, former Executive Chef at Hakkasan Mumbai) on board. When we did the first tasting of his food, we felt that his food deserved a larger platform of its own so we took the difficult decision to rebrand Miss T and revamp the menu entirely,” says Gauri Devidayal, co-owner of Mei 13 (,The Table and Magazine Street Kitchen). Joining Lee in the kitchen is dim sum master Chef Michael Pien and Xavier Tan overseeing the wok. Between the three of them, Mei 13 offers a large menu of beautifully presented Cantonese dishes with punchy flavours and quirky flourishes.

Dim sums galore

After trying the multi-cuisine route in its previous avatar, Mei 13 solely focuses on Mainland China for its inspiration. So there’s no sushi, ramen, and other staples often seen on pan-Asian menus around the city. Instead, you have dim sums (both steamed and fried), a range of appetisers, claypots, noodles, etc. The drinks menu is unchanged, so if you had a favourite at Miss T you can still find it at Mei 13. We began with the Mei 13 Duck Cigar, which is a signature offering of braised duck in a crunchy pastry roll served with sweet hoisin dipping sauce. In keeping with the Cantonese influence, the menu is slightly seafood heavy. The Prawn with Chia Seeds has a pleasing wasabi kick to it while the Kataifi Prawn Roll (from the fried dim sum menu) is deliciously crunchy. The dish is a play on the Greek kataifi or shredded phyllo pastry wrapped prawns, albeit with Asian flavours. Speaking of dim sums, the Red Chilli Poached Peking Dumplings were stellar, plump parcels of prawn in spicy chilli oil dressing. We also tried the moreish Crispy Prawn Dragon Balls, which were crunchy pastry stuffed with nori-wrapped prawns. From the vegetarian selection, the off-the-menu Chives Dumplings was competent enough but the Winter Mushroom Spring Roll was surprisingly insipid.

Comfort food

The mains menu is quite extensive and demands repeat visits. The vegetarian section has a couple of mock meat dishes like Mock Duck in Pepper Sauce and Jiang Bao Mock Chicken, as well as a generous vegetables menu with stir-fries and claypots – think Wok Tossed French Beans with Olives, Sautéed Snow Peas with Truffle Oil, and Stir Fried Broccoli Buds. Seafood lovers, go for the Deep Sea Butter Lobster while the Lamb Rack with Okra should satisfy the meat-eaters. The Egg Fried Race was comfort in a bowl, especially drizzled with one of the housemade sauces on the table. The dessert menu reprises Miss T favourites (like the Yuzu Tart with Black Sesame Ice Cream) with a couple of Cantonese additions such as Mango Pudding with Cream and Pandan Pannacotta with Passion Fruit.

Miss T will be missed, but Mei 13’s Cantonese menu has a soothing familiarity that will have you coming back for more.

390,2020/03/11,Get pizzas from Ciro Cattaneo on food delivery platforms,"Meet the pizza guy: Ciro Cattaneo, the man behind the now defunct Bella Ciao, is back with his pizzas; this time, he sells them on food delivery platforms from his cloud kitchen

Back in the late Nineties, an Italian named Ciro Cattaneo moved from romantic Rome to a rather muggy and laid back Chennai. “I wanted to live in real India,” says Ciro, who has since then made this city home. His requirements were: a place that is cosmopolitan, not touristy, and had the sea. And Chennai just fit in beautifully.

In 1998, he became the reason for many to drive all the way to Thiruvanmiyur just for pizza. Soon, it became trendy to have Italian food by the beach, seated in his cosy windswept restaurant that was called Bella Ciao. There were no other “real” Italian restaurants then, he says. The place had a dream run till it pulled down its shutters in 2018. But the good news is, Ciro is back again with his pizzas. While it is not a sit-down restaurant any more, his pizzas are available on delivery, courtesy a new cloud kitchen venture started by Pooja and Nikhil Nath. Launching today, the company is called Ciro’s Pizzeria while the brand is called Ciro’s, and also has his face on the boxes. “I love dealing with people, so I do miss talking to my clients. But this model is easy because you just have one thing to follow and therefore it is easy to keep the quality,” says Ciro.

His kitchen is in Kottivakkam, and the 750 square foot unit has four people assisting him. Inside his work space, he looks pleased with the custom made oven that has been built from scratch. “It is a wood-fired oven and measures 5 X 6 feet. It can make eight 12-inch pizzas at a time,” he says, proudly patting the brick structure. Here, they spent around eight months creating pizzas with a gamut of combinations — truffle oil, pistachio, scarmoza, blue cheese, leek, smoked salmon, Parma ham... The menu now lists 31 different varieties, with two choices of sauces (Rosso and Bianca) and two different crusts: Romana (crisp on the edges) and Napoletana (fluffy). “To get the perfect base, we had to go through a lot of trial and error. The Napoletana took a bit more work,” he says.

While a lot of the ingredients are imported, they smoke their chicken and make the pesto in-house. Sourcing ingredients is a lot more easier now, believes Ciro, as opposed to when he started Bella Ciao. The food scene has also changed drastically, he says. “There are so many places to eat at. People are more knowledgeable. Other than Italian, there are enough options for Japanese and Asian food too. When I moved here, all we had were Akasaka and Dahlia.”

In addition to pizza, the menu at Ciro’s has milkshakes, a couple of appetisers like crostini and garlic bread, and two classic desserts: lemon curd panna cotta and tiramisu. As of now, it’s only available on Swiggy and Zomato, within a four to five kilometre radius of Kotturpuram. By April they will launch in Adyar as well.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/8xgvvs/article31040534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KARUNAKARAN2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-pizza-guy/article31040535.ece

392,2020/03/11,"Yes Bank effect: tread cautiously, says Maharashtra government","State to keep off private banks for now, focus on nationalised banks

In the wake of the collapse of Yes Bank, the Maharashtra government has directed all its departments, civic bodies and semi-government corporations to not transact with private banks for the time being, and focus only on nationalised banks.

Minister of State for Finance, Shambhuraje Desai, told The Hindu, the administration is being given clear directions in this regard. “Finance Minister Ajit Pawar and I held a meeting with senior officials, including the Chief Secretary and finance secretary after the Yes Bank episode. We discussed the situation and have given directions to the administration,” he said.

The Minister said no new transaction will be initiated with a private bank for the time being. “Government departments, semi-government corporations and civic bodies have independent accounts. Many in the State had already opened accounts with Yes Bank and are facing problems now. We do not want government money to be stuck and have therefore ordered the departments and corporations to go ahead with new transactions with nationalised banks only,” said Mr. Desai.

According to sources in the Finance Department, the Yes Bank episode may impact the Mahatma Phule Crop Loan waiver scheme as a few cooperatives had their deposits with the bank.

The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, the Mumbai and Thane fire brigades too had their accounts with the bank, apart from the City and Industrial Development Corporation’s home loan account, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited.

A senior official from the Co-operation Department, which is executing the crop loan waiver scheme, said the issue is likely to be discussed in Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting.

393,2020/03/11,"A city, a guru and a deep calling: U.S. violinist connects East, West with her music","American violinist Sarah MeeRan Cave, who followed her heart to learn Indian Classical music from a guru in Mumbai, keeps his memory alive in her music, in a city she loves

From the way she boards an autorickshaw, you might be deceived into thinking she is a Mumbaikar. Balancing a violin in one hand, purse slung over her slim shoulder, Sarah MeeRan Cave executes the perfectly timed leap before the vehicle courses through Bandra’s multiple lanes.

Ms. Cave is equally adept at jumping into local trains. Over the years, she has developed a relationship with Mumbai and its ‘amazing vitality’. “There’s that whole train culture, you know, like, ‘Where are you getting down?’ And then you have to know what side your stop is going to be on, and you have to really be firm, or you’re just going to get shoved off the train.”

She had just one day in the city before flying off to Los Angeles, where she lives, and the separation was beginning to gnaw at her. She would return in the winter for sure. “Bombay always makes me a more open-minded, courageous person. I feel like I thrive more here,” she said.

No other city in India, or the world, makes her feel as free. Or as safe. “I’ve never had an issue as a foreigner.” The reason: “there’s an acceptance of different types of people. There’s a respect, like a, ‘You do your thing well, don’t get in my way and we’ll be fine.’ And then if something happens, 20 people will come and help you.”

Leap of faith

The pull came in the spring of 2015, in a way she would never have imagined.

Ms. Cave began violin studies at the age of three. She eventually worked for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and went on to teach violin in the U.S. and abroad, including the Bangalore School of Music, where she conducted their chamber orchestra.

From 2013 to 2015, she attended the Violin Making School of America. “In Utah, of all places,” she says. “It never quite felt right.” Those years were a struggle to find her centre.

In 2015, Ms. Cave won a full scholarship to a three-week Eastern music residency at the Banff Centre of the Arts in Canada.

The residency would give her an exposure to Turkish, Persian, Arabic and Hindustani music. On the faculty was renowned sarangi player Dhruba Ghosh. “From the moment he walked into the space and started to teach the workshop, I just knew. I thought, ‘this is exactly the music I’ve been looking for my entire life’.”

At the end of the three weeks, she sat with her friend in the practice room, crying. “I thought, I can’t go back to my old life, to this violin-making programme. And she said, ‘Well, could you actually just not go back to it?’”

Ms. Cave knew then, she had to move to India. “It was the most clear moment of my entire life.”

In 2015, she arrived in Mumbai, to study under Ghosh. “From the first day with him, nothing has ever felt more right and true to me. He had so much depth. Not only as a musician, but as a teacher and as a person. His presence could ignite something in you that you didn’t know is there. He gave me this sense of belonging that I had been missing.”

For a year-and-a-half, he helped her tap into her potential, little by little. “We would swim through one note for something like 20 minutes, but let that note fill me to completion.”

Her guru helped her stay grounded. “Where I was as a person and musician (before that) was different. I was overplaying notes, playing very fast, to be virtuosic, to play a solo with an orchestra, to win a job. But I never felt rushed by him.”

He helped her open up, free herself from the bindings of her old learning. “These notes (in Indian Classical music) didn’t have any expectations. I was able to dive into that freedom, and the teacher held that freedom.”

She never really connected with her Western music teachers that way. In her tribute to Ghosh on her website, she says, “He showed me the life force that literally lies in the sarangi and the violin themselves, that there is life and energy everywhere... He always welcomed me with an open heart and taught me to dive deep into my soul, into the grids of ragas and soar high above storms like the eagle. He said he wasn’t humble; this apparent humbleness was a natural result — when master and student or two friends sit at sunset and watch the sun set beyond the event horizon, both can share in that moment; both know they are part of that experience. The illusion of the ‘other’ dissolves.”

Signs from the universe

A friend told her about his death in a WhatsApp message in July 2017. She had gone back to the U.S. on her guru’s urging. About three days before he passed on, she had a dream where she was a swirl in a galaxy and her centre was shifting. And the night before his passing, before she went to sleep, she asked the Universe for a clear sign as what to do about moving forward with her Indian life, her musical explorations.

In many ways, Ms. Cave had received her guidance. She had always wanted to try composing. “I thought, ‘I’m going to go back to Bombay. I already have my flat, my community and I’m going to compose. Then I’m going to put a show together.’ And so that’s what I did.”

She creates, produces and performs in her show called Home en Root. Her influences span Bach and Brahms, Roma Gypsy music, Flamenco, Salsa, Arabic and Indian Classical. “It’s about celebrating different aspects of life in different types of music and genres.”

The confluence of cultures in her work excites her. People ask her how she will brand herself, with her “not quite Western and not quite Eastern” work. “For me, it’s like, how do I expand enough to encompass everything?”

It’s like two fish apparently swimming in opposite directions, an image she received in her meditation one day. “I realised the relationship between them does not consist of their moving in opposite directions, but only appears so,” she says on her website. “In order to hold the opposing forces, we simply need to see the two fish are actually part of a greater circle; they’re essentially in orbit... if we step back and expand our perspective, we suddenly see the two fish were part of one current all along.”

Ms. Cave recently put up a show called ‘Sacred Currents’ in Mumbai, to “honour seemingly oppositional forces”. A tabla player, a Carnatic electric guitar player and a Carnatic vocalist performed with her.

Mumbai, she says, is a place where people are more open to collaboration. It’s a tug that goes beyond the workings of her mind; “a grounding into where everyone has come from, in a way.”

Like a soul connect? “There’s no expectation, nothing you have to do; stuff just happens. It’s the perfect combination to allow creativity to happen and I feel like it’s so large, it’s infinite. It holds all of humanity. I feel that especially in the Himalayas or even in Bombay; it’s an energy of the city that isn’t anywhere else.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2wemno/article31034836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BMSARAHCAVES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-city-a-guru-and-a-deep-calling-us-violinist-connects-east-west-with-her-music/article31034837.ece

395,2020/03/11,7-year-old horse wins C.N. Wadia Gold Cup,"Event held in memory of Sir Cusrow Wadia, instrumental in starting racecourse

Seven-year-old horse Vulcan won the 76th C.N. Wadia Gold Cup organised at Mahalaxmi Racecourse in Mumbai this weekend. Every year, the event is sponsored by the Wadia Group in memory of late Sir Cusrow N. Wadia, a visionary and philanthropist from the Wadia family.

Vulcan has been trained by Adhirajsingh Jodha. Jockey A. Sandesh rode the horse to victory.

Children who have survived open-heart surgery or stroke performed at the event on Sunday. At least 10 paediatric doctors and heart patients were also felicitated on the occasion.

The Sir Ness Wadia Foundation, a charitable trust set up in 1969, has disbursed funds to causes ranging from medical needs of the less privileged to scholarships for people with disability and drought relief in different parts of the world.

“It is a moment of pride for me to represent Wadia Group on this special occasion to commemorate the immense contributions made by Sir Cusrow Wadia, not only as a successful businessman but as a custodian of the legacy of philanthropy his parents left him,” said Ness Wadia, managing director, Wadia Group.

396,2020/03/11,"Airport gets more doctors, thermometers to screen all arriving passengers","DGCA warns airlines to ensure self-declaration forms are available on board to prevent crowds

With all international passengers arriving into the country being screened for COVID-19 and the resultant queues over the long weekend, Mumbai airport has added 90 doctors and infrared thermometers.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), meanwhile, has pulled up airlines for not ensuring enough self-declaration forms are available on board, leading to crowds at the terminals.

Officials of Mumbai International Airport Ltd said 1,27, 819 passengers from 1,090 aircraft have been screened at the airport since January 18. Between Monday and Tuesday, 10,902 passengers from 96 flights were screened. The directive to screen all arriving international passengers was issued on March 5.

“We have requisitioned 30 more doctors from the Brihanamumbai Municipal Corporation along with 10-15 medical and paramedical staff from the Airport Health Organisation (APHO). This will be enough to effectively screen the arrival corridor,” an airport official said.

From 42 doctors and paramedics in three shifts last week, Mumbai airport now has 136 doctors and paramedics working in three shifts, along with 25 infrared thermometers.

The official said that all international arriving passengers were being screened by the APHO at 10 additional counters being set up by the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Aairport. “Passengers are advised to fill up the self-reporting form in the flight before disembarking and are mandated to submit it to the APHO at the time of screening. However, this was not happening effectively, leading to long queues,” the official said.

Taking note of this, the DGCA on Tuesday evening issued a circular. “It has come to our knowledge that some airlines are not ensuring availability of self-declaration forms as specified in the circular dated March 4. This is leading to long queues at arrival points,” it said.

The aviation regulator warned all airlines operating on the international sector to ensure sufficient self-declaration forms as specified by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are available on board, and to get passengers to fill them in duplicate before disembarkation.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/o0refl/article31034644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/airport-gets-more-doctors-thermometers-to-screen-all-arriving-passengers/article31034645.ece
397,2020/03/11,"After cooler than usual March, city to see warmer days soon","Summer-like situation may be seen after March 15: IMD

Mumbaikars can expect respite from heat for the next few days, after which temperatures will start rising. The city has seen unusually cool days this month, with daytime temperatures staying under 30 degrees Celsius and night temperatures under 20 degrees, even though March usually records maximum temperatures as high as 41 degrees.

Despite some very hot days in February, this month has not turned out to be as hot as expected. For at least the past week, daytime temperatures in Mumbai have been between 29 and 31 degrees Celsius. The first 10 days of March have been warmer as compared to the last six years.

Even on Tuesday, while people celebrated Holi, the day started with haze and a cloudy sky. As the day progressed, the mercury rose slowly, with the maximum temperature touching 30.5 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The minimum temperature was closer to normal at 21.2 degrees Celsius. The normal daytime temperature for March is 32.8 degrees Celsius while minimum is 21.4 degrees.

The hottest March day every year in the last decade has recorded temperatures between 38 and 41 degrees Celsius. The city’s all-time highest temperature for the month, 41.7 degrees Celsius, was recorded on March 28, 1956. The minimum temperatures in the month, sometimes, can fall to 12 degrees.

Akshay Deoras, a PhD scholar at the University of Reading, U.K., who follows India and especially Maharashtra’s weather closely, said, “The main reason (for the low maximums) is domination of winds from the west. These winds tend to enhance the thermostat effect (relatively cooler sea-breeze from the west keeping a lid on the temperature) in Mumbai. In addition, North India has been getting frequent western disturbances which also “spill” cooler air and keep a check on temperatures. This wind pattern will break from March 14, so expect a rise in temperatures (maximum touching 33-34 degrees Celcius), which will be above normal.”

K.S. Hosalikar, the deputy director general of IMD, on Tuesday tweeted, “Currently Mumbai is enjoying its bit extended pleasant season with max temp around 30 Deg C. As per model guidance, trend to continue for next 48 Hrs in Konkan & N Madhya Mah. Thereafter gradual rise likely. Mumbai summer like situation could be from 15,16 March...with max 34°C.

399,2020/03/11,Belapur couple stuck in Iran,"Senior citizens part of stranded group of pilgrims

A retired officer of the Public Works Department and his wife, both residents of Belapur, are among 44 Indian tourists stranded at Qom in Iran due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Sharifuddin Momin (72), who retired as PWD secretary in 2003, and Jaitunbi (70), were on their way to Iraq, their son Rafiq (44), an architect, has said.

On February 21, the couple and 42 others, mostly from Kolhapur, flew from Mumbai to Tehran. The group of senior citizens, which was going to Najaf and then Baghdad to visit the mausoleum of Abdul Qadir Gilani, reached Tehran airport at 6 p.m. and had a connecting flight to Iraq at 10 p.m. “The group had booked the pilgrimage package with Saad Tours and Travels based in Kolhapur. The travel group has arranged their stay and food till now,” Mr. Rafiq said.

He said the tour was supposed to be till March 3. On learning that the Iran-Iraq border was closed, the tour operator took the group to visit mosques, dargahs and holy places in and around Tehran. “They booked a ticket for India for February 28. But from February 27 evening, the Indian government stopped flights from Iran,” Mr. Rafiq said.

The group is now waiting for news on when they can return home. “A medical team from India has reached Iran and they have been sending back samples, but this group is still waiting to be tested. They are frustrated. Their regular medicines had finished and arrangements were done for alternative ones. We are in touch through video calls. I had approached [NCP leaders] Sharad Pawar and Supriya Sule, tweeted about the problem, yet their is no clarity,” Mr. Rafiq said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kfto56/article31034592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bmBelapur-couple,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/belapur-couple-stuck-in-iran/article31034594.ece
400,2020/03/11,"State accepts bid to regulate Ola, Uber fares","Ceiling for surge price set at 3 times kaali peeli rates

App-based cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber in the State can charge surge pricing fares up to three times of the base fare of black-and-yellow (kaali peeli) taxis, which is ₹14.85 per km, a Government Resolution (GR) on Monday said. The aggregators’ fares could be regulated soon, with the State government accepting most of the recommendations of the Khatua Committee.

In its report, the committee had recommended a ceiling fare for three categories of aggregator cabs: regular, mid-sized and premium, at ₹26, ₹32, and ₹38 per km, respectively. The base fare for the three categories was fixed between ₹14 and ₹16 per km. While accepting the need to regulate the surge, the GR states the new formula to cap the fares.

A.L. Quadros, leader, Mumbai Taximen’s Union, said the State should ideally implement the Maharashtra City Taxi Rules, 2017, which has been stuck in litigation, instead of introducing piecemeal measures like this.

The four-member committee, headed by retired IAS officer B.C. Khatua in 2016, tabled its findings in 2017. In addition to fixing the fares of app-based aggregators, the committee was also asked to suggest fares for kaali peeli taxis and autorickshaws in Mumbai. It had suggested a new telescopic fare for taxis, where the increase in journey length would attract a discount in fares, and a ‘Happy Hour’ scheme, where there would be lower fares during lean periods.

In the GR, the government has agreed to the telescopic fare, but rejected the lean-period suggestion. Mr. Quadros said they had rejected both and that the telescopic fare proposal was not feasible. “What the report doesn’t account for is that taxi drivers who agree to long-distance journeys often have to return empty. Who will pay for the loss borne by the driver? If this is implemented, drivers will have no option but to refuse long journeys,” he said, adding they will take up this issue and demand a fare hike.

“The Khatua Committee recommended a fare hike three years ago. Since then, the price of gas has increased by ₹9.5 per kg. Hence we are demanding that the minimum fare be increased to ₹25,” Mr. Quadros said.

The minimum fare for black-and-yellow taxis is ₹22 for the first 1.5 km, beyond which they charge ₹15 per km. For autorickshaws, the base fare is ₹18 and the per-km rate is ₹12.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9yljhp/article31034576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMTAXI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-accepts-bid-to-regulate-ola-uber-fares/article31034578.ece
401,2020/03/11,2 held with mephedrone,"Duo part of larger supply chain: police

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch arrested two people with 200 grams of mephedrone worth ₹6 lakh on Tuesday. Investigations indicate that the duo is just a link in a larger supply racket of the drug in south and eastern Mumbai.

The accused have been identified as Aslam Khan (41) and Firoz Khan (39), both residents of Sewri. The duo was intercepted on the basis of a tip-off received by senior police inspector Sunil Mane of Unit X.

A Crime Branch officer said, “According to the information, the duo would be present near the court in Sewri on Tuesday with drugs. As soon as we received confirmation from our informant about their arrival, we stopped and searched them.”

The duo was arrested and charged with possession of commercial quantities of a controlled substance under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. They will be produced in court on Wednesday.

The officer said, “Inquiries indicate that the duo had picked up the consignment from Mr. Aslam’s nephew, who is based in Dongri and said to be among the bigger suppliers of mephedrone in the city. They were supposed to deliver it to the next link in the supply chain when they were intercepted. The multiple supply levels that have come to light in just one day of investigation and the quantity of drugs seized indicate that this is a bigger racket.”

Interrogation on

The Crime Branch is interrogating the duo to find out the identity of the intended recipient, the activities of Mr. Aslam’s nephew and how wide the scope of the racket is. Inquiries are also being made with other police stations in Mumbai and neighbouring commissionerates to find out if the two have a criminal record.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2-held-with-mephedrone/article31034561.ece
402,2020/03/11,Fake currency racket based in T.N. busted,"Notes were printed in Tiruppur, sent to Mumbai for circulation

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted a fake currency racket based in Tamil Nadu, where counterfeit notes were printed in Tiruppur and sent to Mumbai with couriers for circulation in the city’s markets.

According to Crime Branch officials, the lid was blown off the racket when the Crime Branch Unit IV picked up Bhaskar Nadar (53) near a Bank of Baroda branch at Sion Circle on March 3 based on a tip-off. He was found to be in possession of 151 counterfeit currency notes of different denominations, with a face value of ₹1.28 lakh.

He was arrested and booked for possession of counterfeit currency notes under the Indian Penal Code. “During his interrogation, Mr. Nadar told us that he had been arrested in an attempt to robbery case in 2011 and had come to Mumbai from his native Tiruppur for a court appearance. Before he left, he was approached by Sarvanan Vaniyar, who gave him the counterfeit notes and told him to hand them over to a receiver in Mumbai,” a Crime Branch officer said.

Raid in Tiruppur

Acting on the information, the Unit IV sent a team to Tiruppur, which, working with the local police, conducted a raid at Mr. Vaniyar’s residence on Monday.

“We found a set-up in Mr. Vaniyar’s house, where genuine currency notes were being scanned and then printed on a paper similar to the one used in currency printing. The accused would then paste green-coloured plastic strips on the notes to make them look like security strips,” the officer said.

The Unit IV team seized a total of 1,473 notes of ₹500 denomination and 85 notes of ₹200 denomination, with a face value of ₹7.55 lakh, from Mr. Vaniyar’s residence and arrested him.

The police are now working on apprehending the person who was to pick up the consignment from Mr. Nadar. The team is also trying to find out how long the racket has been active and pumping fake currency notes into the city’s markets.

Last week, the Crime Branch Unit IX had arrested two people who were allegedly printing counterfeit currency notes using a sophisticated set-up in Ulwe in Navi Mumbai. The racket was found to have links in Kerala. The Unit IV is probing to confirm whether the two rackets are connected.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dz3s3d/article31034537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BM-Tiruppur,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fake-currency-racket-based-in-tn-busted/article31034539.ece
403,2020/03/11,BEST to float tenders to tackle ‘change’ problem,"Agency or bank to be appointed to collect and deposit coins and currency notes

The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking will be floating tenders to appoint an agency or a bank to collect and deposit its loose change and currency notes.

The BEST has been witnessing a surge in collection of coins since it slashed fares last year. Senior BEST officials said ICICI Bank had sought a handling charge to collect the coins and deposit them, which the BEST couldn’t afford.

Anil Patankar, BEST committee chairman, said he had raised the issue of appointing an agency to tackle the issue during the committee’s meeting on Monday.

He said, “The general manager told us that he will be raising the issue with officials of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and request ICICI Bank to reconsider imposing the handling charge. They should ideally exempt the BEST from such charges as we are a public service.”

Mr. Patankar said due to the impasse, around ₹12 crore in coins is lying idle across bus depots. To ease the crisis, the BEST has been paying employees a part of their salaries, around ₹2,000, in coins. However, sources in the BEST said efforts are on to create stacks of ₹10,000 at every depot for disbursal if the issue is not resolved by March 13, when employees get their salaries.

A BEST spokesperson said the general manager would be meeting with the RBI officials soon to find a solution. BEST officials said ICICI Bank had not levied any service charge earlier, but in a letter to the BEST had said it would charge ₹100 for every ₹1,000 collected in coins. The BEST on an average earns ₹2 crore a day, and coins make up ₹15 lakh.

BEST officials said after fares were reduced in July 2019, they had tied up with toll collection agencies to get rid of loose change. “With the introduction of FASTag, even that avenue is no longer available,” an official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/best-to-float-tenders-to-tackle-change-problem/article31034506.ece

405,2020/03/11,India’s day will come,"India did extremely well to reach the title round in a format they aren’t really comfortable with.

India Women choked in the World T20 final. That is not unusual, nor is it unheard of. The best have, at various times. While taking a penalty in soccer, for example, the great Diego Maradona choked at the 1990 World Cup. Greg Norman, who accomplished a ‘Saturday Slam’ in 1986, leading after the third round in all four golf Majors, lost on the final day in three of them. South Africa are yet to shake off the tag of ‘chokers’ in World Cups.

At the end of the final, Indian fans’ emotions were mixed: there was disappointment, of course, but also sympathy, pride, keen anticipation for the future and satisfaction that India are indeed a world class team. Significantly, the one emotion missing was anger, despite what a commentator predicted.

Young team

It is a young team which had done so well till that point, and had caused Australia’s medium-pacer Megan Schutt to say before the match, ""I just hate playing India — they've got the wood over me.” It was not Aussie-like, and highlighted India’s reputation.

India did extremely well to reach the title round in a format they aren’t really comfortable with, and for this credit should go to the coach Woorkeri Raman and the spirit of the players who appeared to be a bunch that trusted one another and had fun together.

There was too the unspoken confidence that if the top players didn’t get runs, someone lower down would; likewise with the bowling. So what went wrong?

“High pressure environments induce a range of brain and body reactions,” wrote Sian Bellock in his book on choking. “Your heart rate goes up, your adrenaline kicks in, and your mind starts to race — often with worries.

“When the worries begin, many people do something that seems quite logical on the surface: they try to control their performance. Unfortunately this increased control can backfire — especially for well-learned skills — because bringing your conscious awareness to skills that once operated outside your working memory can disrupt them.”

Beilock is a cognitive scientist and the quotes are from Choke: The Secret to Performing Under Pressure.

It is not a difficult concept to understand. The speaker who suddenly loses it during a lecture, the model who abruptly seems incapable of taking a few steps on the ramp, the brilliant student who cannot remember his physics formula during an exam — we are familiar with them.

“Choking is a suboptimal performance, not just poor performance. It’s a performance that is inferior to what you can do and have done in the past and occurs when you feel the pressure to get everything right,” according to Beilock.

Tension leads to mistakes

And that sums up the performance of an Indian team that had depth in batting, variety in bowling, yet played like a team that had lost self-confidence. When you are anxious or nervous, you tense up, and that leads to mistakes.

Starting the bowling with full tosses is a symptom of this, as were the two early catches put down by Shafali Verma and Rajeshwari Gayakwad — catches these fielders would have taken smilingly on another day. But that is sport! The real difference between the teams was in the level of fitness. Australia were far fitter, quicker, recovered better and took some terrific catches.

India did enough to suggest that they are future world champions. Two things need to fall into place, though. This column has been suggesting for a while now that the cricket board needs to seriously consider a Women’s IPL. As Melbourne showed, create the excitement and the crowds will come.

India’s men haven’t won the T20 World title since the IPL was introduced in 2008, so you could point at that and say this is being too facile.

But the women need more match practice, and better competition that the entry of players from the top teams promise.

The second issue to be looked at is appointing a psychologist. Modern teams have specialist coaches in the physical aspects of the game — bowling, batting, fielding, fitness. They need to have one who specialises in an equally important aspect — the mental.

Playing a final before a huge audience against a top team is its own pressure even before a ball is bowled. Even a team as experienced as the men’s at the 2003 World Cup choked under that kind of pressure.

India have a fabulous women’s team. It needs better support from the authorities. Women’s contracts need to be looked at afresh. But its not just the money. We need to look no farther than Australia for guidance.

The Australian model

Last year Australia announced a “parental leave policy”. Players are eligible for 12 months’ paid parental leave and are guaranteed a contract extension for the following contract year. Also, partners of players who give birth are entitled to three weeks’ paid leave.

There’s more. Once a player returns after giving birth, travel support is provided for primary carers, including flights, accommodation and other travel expenses. This, till the child is four.

406,2020/03/11,Author Nick Arnold combines horror and humour to make science appealing,"For over 20 years, Nick Arnold has combined horror and humour to make the sciences appealing to children and adults alike

Nick Arnold recalls the time during a Horrible Science show when he had an idea for an experiment: he stood on a table, balanced himself and practised being a tree sucking water. Unfortunately, one of the table’s legs tipped over and he fell and broke his arm. Nonetheless, he completed the show before he was treated for the broken arm. There is a lot he is willing to endure, for the sake of science.

Nick was in Bengaluru at Stonehill International School. The elements of ‘horror’ and ‘humour’ are the reasons why the books are so well received. “Children love to be excited. They love to use their imagination. With Horrible Science, I can be both scary and funny. Sometimes, you see something and you think it is scary and then you realise it is not and you laugh, so I can be scary and funny and get children get excited about science.”

He adds: “If you read the books, you will see that is me talking and thinking — that is my personality. I love to make people laugh and to perform.”

At Stonehill, he entertained the students with his favourite experiments — many involve putting water on people’s heads. “A simple experiment is to get a plastic bottle and make some holes in the bottom, fill it with water and put the cap. You tell people, ‘this bottle has holes, put it on your head and the water will come out.’ It doesn’t, until you take the top off! It is like turning on a tap, and all the water falls on your head. Children find that very funny. They are constantly amazed at how exciting things happen with simple, everyday objects.”

The elements of ‘horror’ and ‘humour’ in his books are why they are so well received. “Sometimes, you see something you think is scary, but then you realise it is not and laugh. With Horrible Science, I can be scary and funny and get children to be excited about science.”

Making a case for the sciences, Nick says: “I predicted the emergence of new viruses in the Far East in my book Deadly Diseases, about 10 years before it happened. The threat of new viruses is just one example of changes affecting the whole world. Science is essential if one has to combat scares such as the coronavirus. That’s why it is so important for children to learn about science.”

Nick says he likes to ‘over research’ his books. “Researching is like packing a bag for a journey. When we think what do we need for a journey, we try to find everything and put it into the bag. I do that all the time with my research. I do not know what I am going to use so I want to take everything. But I go through what I find and select the best and most important things.”

His research sources include everything, from books and magazines to newspapers and the internet. “Also I have been fortunate to meet some real scientists, and I always ask them ‘So what is the most horrible thing that has happened to you? And I put that information in my books.”

Though Nick studied history at University, he enjoyed Biology in school. “I had a very good Biology teacher. I was also very interested in writing horrible stories so I loved my English lessons. I discovered that the other sciences, Chemistry and Physics were just as exciting as Biology, when I started writing books and researching science for myself.” Nick says he loves all the sciences for different reasons. “I love the way Physics can explain everything in simple ways as long as you can understand the way of thinking of Physics. I love Biology because it is so diverse and there are these gross, disgusting details. I love Chemistry because I love the way that you can mix things up and make amazing things out of them. But most of all, I love it when children get excited about science, because they are the future, and we need more scientists, we need more doctors, we need more engineers.”

Imagination is key to science, Nick says: “Consider this, some of the most amazing discoveries come like a flash. A scientist’s imagination helps develop new ideas. And for children learning science, imagination encourages them to understand the facts .”

Nick’s approach to his books have changed a little bit over the years. “Science is changing all the time, and so each year I have to change my books a little bit with new discoveries.” ” He, however, disagrees that children aren’t reading as much, in fact he says that is completely untrue. “Children always like to read books. The big change is of course the internet has become much more common. Although the internet is good for getting information, you can only get little bits of information. If you want to be entertained and if you want something that will talk to you, that you want to come back to, you need a book. Nick also contributes to the Wild Lives series, in which there is an Indian connection. “The idea was that people would write diaries about a particular wild animal. I am very pleased to have written about tigers in Ranthambore. It is a story about particular tiger but with lots of facts, which if children read they become experts on tigers.”

Nick says his brain is constantly buzzing with ideas. “I am always learning about interesting facts, especially horrible science facts. Once I find have these facts, I then have these dreams about them. So I imagine stories about them and ideas and people doing things that I can put in my books.” So what is next for the Horrible Science series? “I am not sure, it is up to the publishers. I hope they will be a big celebration of 25 years of Horrible Sciences. “We will have to see what happens.” And his favourite scientist? He was a horrible, nasty man. If I met him he would have been nasty to me because I am not a scientist, but I would still admire him because he discovered how everything in the Universe works without a computer, just using his mind and thinking about it. He is Isaac Newton.”",children,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/peco5p/article31039091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGMNICKARNOLD3,https://www.thehindu.com/children/i-can-be-scaryand-funny/article31039093.ece
407,2020/03/11,Swimming camels,"Destruction of mangroves and loss of vegetation have resulted in fast dwindling numbers of these magnificent creatures.

Growing up in western Rajasthan, camels were a common sight. I would at times, see their caravan walking over a flyover in my city, with their herders. These are the one-humped camels, found in Rajasthan and some parts of Gujarat and Haryana. Later on, when I shifted to Kachchh in Gujarat, I was amazed to learn that there were camels that could swim. I thought maybe that’s why they are called the ‘ship’ of the desert. However, these are the ‘Kharai’ camels, a unique breed found only in Kachchh, and not the ones I knew from Rajasthan. Their webbed feet reminded me of a frog’s and their mouth looked like they were always smiling.

Mangrove diets

Kharai camels are known to feed on mangroves on the island off shore. And to eat this salty marine food, they sometimes swim for hours. I found that their population was under threat. The mangrove forests they fed on were being destroyed. On my way to one village, I saw camel herders protesting on a salt pan. They told me that that area was used for grazing and as a passage for their camels to the mangrove forests. But now, salt manufacturing factories had destroyed their food, and blocked the passage by developing the salt pans. This has been happening for many years now. Sometimes, it is a cement factory, at other times a salt pan — obstructing the path. If these animals do not eat the mangrove vegetation for a long period of time, they get sick and eventually die. The camel population has reduced drastically.

Last year, the court ordered the factories to open up the route for camels and make access to mangroves possible. I was happy and to celebrate I bought myself a camel milk chocolate. Did you know Amul makes camel milk chocolate? This is an initiative to support camel herders.

A video showing an Inspector and Sub-Inspector of police quarrelling over examining a petition submitted by the latter’s wife went viral on social media on Wednesday.

According to police sources, the incident occurred on Monday. Prabhu, sub-inspector of police attached to Cheyyar police station in Tiruvannamalai district had a property dispute with his mother and sister staying in Naduveerapattu near here. He had sent his wife Sasikala, to Panruti, to file a complaint against his family members accusing them of demanding dowry.

Panruti All Women Police Station Inspector Vanaja had reportedly told the complainant that she would look into the issue. However, Prabhu called the Inspector on her mobile demanding she take “immediate” cognisance of his wife’s complaint.

He later went to the police station and questioned Ms. Vanaja over the delay in examining the petition against his family. A quarrel ensued between the duo and police personnel in the station tried to intervene. The video of the quarrel was recorded by the sub-inspector and it went viral on WhatsApp.

A senior police officer said that Prabhu had instigated his wife to lodge a complaint against his mother and sister as he was not given a share of their property. Cuddalore Superintendent of Police M.

409,2020/03/11,Site finalised for Kallakurichi Government Medical College and Hospital in Siruvangur,"About 20 acres of land on the Kallakurichi Government Arts College premises, now in the possession of the college, will be handed over to the Public Works Department to start construction

The proposed Government Medical College and Hospital for Kallakurichi will come up on a sprawling area over 20 acres in Siruvangur. The district administration has now finalised the site, after considering various proposals.

About 20 acres of land on the Kallakurichi Government Arts College premises, now in the possession of the college, would be handed over to the Public Works Department (PWD) for starting the construction work. The college will be located on 11 acres and the entire land parcel would be handed over.

“After evaluating several locations for the medical college, the district administration zeroed in on the sprawling campus in Siruvangur to comply with the basic minimum standards prescribed by the Medical Council of India (MCI).

As per MCI norms, the site for the medical college should be located in a single land parcel and located within a 10-km radius from the District Government Headquarters Hospital. “The site at Siruvangur is located at a distance of 4.2 km from the Kallakurichi Government Headquarters Hospital,” said District Collector Kiran Gurrala.

The Government Arts College in Siruvangur would be shifted to Sadayampattu near here. The administration has already transferred six acres of land for the Arts College. The Arts College would continue to operate from the existing premises till the new site is ready, he said.

The Government has issued the order to hand over the Government Headquarters Hospital now under the control of the Director of Medical and Rural Health Services to the Director of Medical Education.

The existing Arts College building in Siruvangur would be used for the proposed Government Medical College while new buildings including the academic block, hospital, hostels for students, and other facilities would come up at an estimated cost of ₹387 crore.

The medical college would be a boon to the region, as the nearest government medical college and hospitals are located at a distance of 85 to 100 km in neighbouring Villupuram and Salem districts.

The construction of buildings for the medical college would begin soon and is expected to be completed in one year to enable admission of students during the 2021-22 academic year.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ivd031/article31038532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MARTH-COLLEGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/site-finalised-for-kallakurichi-government-medical-college-and-hospital-in-siruvangur/article31038533.ece

411,2020/03/11,Annamalai varsity inks pact with Germany’s Aachen University,"Plan to study impact of toxic floods in coastal areas of Tamil Nadu

Annamalai University has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Aachen University, Germany, for deeper studies on the impact of toxic floods in coastal areas of Tamil Nadu.

The MoU will facilitate research collaboration between Applied Mineralogy and Economic Geology and Laboratory Geochemistry and Environmental Analytical Chemistry, RWTH, Aachen University and Annamalai University’s Centre of Advanced Study in Marine Biology.

The IIT Madras also has signed an MoU with the German institution.

Sven Sindern, Institute of Applied Mineralogy and Economic Geology, RWTH Aachen University and N. Krishnamohan, Registrar i/c, Annamalai University, signed the MoU in the presence of V. Murugesan, Vice-Chancellor of Annamalai University.

The MoU will provide applied research on impact of metal incorporation to aquatic biota related to toxic flood events and the mineralisation process in aquatic organisms for Tamil Nadu coastal areas.

The MoU will permit research activities, exchange of students and faculty members for doing research on marine and environmental science for both the countries. The study will be examining the extent and consequences of the discharge of agricultural, industrial and domestic effluents into coastal waters.

“We expect to do an in-depth analysis of the magnitude of toxicity sedimentation of heavy metal and mineral elements in waste discharges into the coastal stretch, the sea floor and tissue-level changes in aquatic life from long-term ingestion of the pollutants,” said M. Arumugam, associate professor, Centre of Advanced Study in Marine Biology at Annamalai University, who had earlier made a presentation on the topic at Aachen University.

The study will also look at how long it takes for intake of these pollutants for the traces to become embedded in tissue of aquaric forms like fish.

“The tissue contamination in fish has a direct bearing as well on human health,” he said.

Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal on Tuesday said the resolutions adopted by the Legislative Assemblies against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) were “unconstitutional” and “politically motivated.”

Interacting with BJP workers here, the Union Minister said provisions of Citizenship came under the Central list. Parliament amended the Citizenship Act and it was duly approved by the President.

‘No threat to rights’

States cannot pass resolutions against a Central legislation. The agitations against CAA are politically motivated. The Act would not take away the rights of any Indian citizen, Mr. Meghwal said.

He said he would apprise the Union Home Minister about the concerns raised by various sections of leaders regarding the development needs of Puducherry.

Over 1,500 students in eight schools in Puducherry were sensitised on responsible disposal and recycling of e-waste as part of a ‘Clean to Green’ campaign held recently.

The initiative, which is a flagship campaign of Reverse Logistics Group (RLG), a global service provider of comprehensive reverse logistics solutions, covered eight schools in Puducherry, including the MTVS Government School, Government Girls Middle School, Anni Sivagami Government Girls School, Government Primary School and Government High School, Villianur Main Road.

Radhika Kalia, managing director, RLG India, said, “We were encouraged by the successful roll out of the flagship campaign last year. In FY 2019-20, we seek to extend the reach of the Clean to Green campaign to ensure individuals and professionals understand that proper disposal and recycling of electronics is a national priority and lack of awareness of responsible disposal of e-waste among masses is a serious issue.”

The second edition of the campaign targets reaching out to over 1 million individuals in 38 cities across 27 States and five Union Territories. The coverage includes an estimated 1,245 schools and 33 colleges, 72 informal sector units and 50 bulk consumers and retailers.

According to Sandeep Chatterjee, Director, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the campaign seeks to collaborate with the electronics industry and corporate bodies to ensure responsible disposal and recycling of e-waste in India.

415,2020/03/11,Documentary marks 90th year of Dandi march,"‘Oru Pidi Uppu’ attempts to document one of the finest moments of Indian freedom struggle

Picking up a handful of salt at seaside Dandi on April 6, 1930, Mahatma Gandhi demonstrated that even salt can be a deadly weapon against mighty empires.

As the nation remembers the epic Dandi Yatra on its 90th anniversary, a documentary in Malayalam attempts to recapture the magic of that extraordinary foot march for the younger generation.

Oru Pidi Uppu (A Handful of Salt) traces the historic trek against the loathed British salt laws that Gandhiji launched with his trusted satyagrahis on this day 90 years ago — March 12, 1930 — from the Sabarmati Ashram.

The 28-minute documentary, which features English subtitles, is produced by D&S Combines, a private collaboration between P.D. Santhosh (direction and camera), programme producer at KITE-VICTERS, and Dominic J. Kattoor (script, narration), an assistant professor in Malayalam at the Government Sanskrit College, Pattambi.

Oru Pidi Uppu is a modest attempt to document one of the finest moments of the Indian freedom struggle, according to Mr. Santhosh. “It took Gandhiji 25 days to cover the distance from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi in Navsari district. The impact of the Salt Satyaraha on the freedom struggle and the concept of civil disobedience was tremendous,” he said.

241-mile yatra

In the documentary, the 241-mile yatra is revisited through the eyes of Mohanan Nair and K.G. Harikrishnan, members of Malayali associations in Gujarat.

For its making, the eight-member team led by Mr. Santhosh and Mr. Kattoor toured the entire route of the march, documenting the places where Gandhiji and the volunteers made stopovers and spoke to people.

While some of those spots are marked by museums and memorials today, others in private hands lie largely neglected.

They may disappear one day soon, the documentary reveals. “Even the local people have forgotten them now. Is not that strange for a march that drew massive crowds as it progressed?

It is important to preserve these locations, especially in an age when history itself is being rewritten with impunity,” Mr. Santhosh said.

Oru Pidi Uppu is the fourth of a 10-part documentary project on milestones in the Indian Independence struggle which D&S Combines launched in 2011.

Three of the 10 parts

The first three dealt with the the Cellular Jail in the Andamans, the Malabar Rebellion, and the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.

Last month, a Gujarati-dubbed version of Oru Pidi Uppu was premiered at the Urmi School, Vadodara.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/u42i4f/article31043703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200309-WA0016,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/documentary-marks-90th-year-of-dandi-march/article31043704.ece

Officials said the condition of the 85-year-old woman was worsening due to age-related vulnerability and that of her 91-year-old husband continued to fluctuate. Meanwhile, the health condition of a couple from Chengalam who tested positive for the disease remained stable. As of now, 10 people were in isolation wards.

417,2020/03/11,Assembly to take up cause of Keralites stranded abroad,"Failure to produce medical certificate vouching no COVID-19

The State government will introduce a resolution with Opposition approval in the Assembly on Thursday to condemn the Central government for decreeing that Indian citizens require a COVID-19 negative certification to travel to their country from Italy and Korea.

A calling attention motion moved by Communist Party of India (Marxist) legislator K.V. Abdul Kader on Wednesday drew the attention of the House to the plight of Keralites stranded at airports in Italy for want of such a certificate.

Video messages sent by the grounded families to their relatives here narrate their inability to procure such proof at the last minute before boarding their flight. Several news channels disseminate the videos, which cause public concern, given the State’s large diaspora.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan slammed the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for making COVID-19-free medical testimonials compulsory. The decision sought to keep citizens out of their own country simply because they have an illness. It was a form of social ostracisation, he said.

PM’s intervention sought

Mr. Vijayan said he has sought the urgent intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar to redeem the worrying situation.

He has also communicated the distress of the stranded passengers in a letter to Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri. Mr. Vijayan said Chief Secretary Tom Jose has talked to the Union Cabinet Secretary late Tuesday. Mr Jose has gathered the impression that the Union Health Ministry insists that passengers bound for India from COVID-19 hotspots be tested for the contagion before being allowed to board inbound flights.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the United Democratic Front (UDF) would support the resolution in the House.

Fear of epidemic

He condemned the move to close the country’s borders against its citizens out of viral outbreak fear. Union Minister of State for Foreign Affairs V. Muraleedharan told journalists in New Delhi that the Congress and CPI(M) are politicising the outbreak.

418,2020/03/11,Quick legal service at hand in police stations,"KELSA to launch early access to justice protocol today

From now onwards, no need to panic when police ask you to be present at some police station for questioning. You would get the support of lawyers at all the police stations across the State, thanks to the early access to justice protocol, introduced by the Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KELSA).

On reaching the police station, the officials are expected to hand over a charter of rights that is available for every person. The rights of persons during the pre-arrest stage and while being arrested will be explained in the charter.

“You have the right to know why the police have called you for interrogation and the right to know what the police think you have done. You have the right not to answer the question, which have the effect of self-incrimination. You also have the right to have a lawyer present if the police interview you. You can also avail yourselves of free legal assistance from the nearest legal service authority,” reads the charter.

One lawyer will be put in charge of a cluster of four police stations in a locality and the service of the lawyer will be available round-the-clock. The lawyers will be paid by the authority for their service, says K.T. Nizar Ahammed, the secretary of KELSA.

The lawyers will assist the arrestees in filing bail application and furnishing bail bonds.

Every person who is arrested has the right to be informed about the grounds for arrest and the right to bail. No one shall be denied the right to inform his friends or relative about the arrest and the place of detection. The right to medical examination by a medical officer or a registered medical practitioner soon after the arrest cannot be denied for the arrested, he said.

Every person thus arrested also has the right to be produced before a competent magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest. The charter of rights details all the rights that are available for the arrested and persons who are summoned to the police stations, says Mr. Ahammed.

The initiative is expected to legally empower the citizens besides curbing the illegal practices of custodial torture. The rights are listed in English, Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi in the charter. It would be the poor and the marginalised sections of the society and migrant labourers that are likely to be benefited by the programme, he says.

Kerala Chief Justice S. Manikumar will launch the programme at a function to be held at the Kerala High Court Auditorium at 9.30 a.m. on Thursday. C.K.

419,2020/03/11,Railways face shortage of masks for frontline staff,"Biometric punching for personnel stopped

The Divisional Railway that has geared up its entire machinery in a big way to take steps to prevent Corona virus infection has been hit by the acute shortage of face masks.

The State had been approached to make available the masks, as it was needed for the frontline personnel of the Railways who were in direct contact with the commuters, the Divisional Railway Manager, Shirish Kumar Sinha said on Wednesday. The Railways were insisting the frontline staff like the Travelling Ticketing Inspector (TTI) and the Coach Attendants who travel in the trains to wear the protective masks.

“We approached the State, as we are unable to procure them locally. Shops have exhausted the stock due to panic buying following the alert sounded by the government,” the DRM said.

The situation is being constantly monitored and coordinated at the Railway Board level, zone level, and at the division level. Control rooms have been set up all over the Railway system and the staff has been sensitised and educated about the deadly virus and on the precautionary measures to be taken.

Biometric punching in the divisional office and other offices for the Railway staff had been stopped as a precautionary measure. Help desks have been set up at Thiruvananthapuram Central, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur and other key railway stations to assist the commuters and coordinate the awareness programmes.

Posters and pamphlets regarding coronavirus are being prominently displayed for awareness of public in local language at railway stations and in trains. Audio and video clips are being played at railway stations to spread awareness among the travellers. Public announcements are being made at the railway stations.

In addition to the arrangements made at the Railway Hospital, the authorities have identified buildings in Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Ernakulam to keep those showing symptoms of COVID-19.

423,2020/03/11,A step to allay city’s water woes,"RO plant by Kudumbashree to provide drinking water at low rates to people

The Kudumbashree district mission will set up a reverse osmosis plant in the city.

A project of the city Corporation, the plant is aimed at providing drinking water at low rates to people.

While 20-litre water cans available in the market cost between ₹50 and ₹70, the Corporation hopes to provide water at ₹40 through the project.

The Corporation plan is to set up the plant at a cost of ₹75 lakh as part of the first phase of a project to distribute pure water.

Implementing agency

The Kudumbashree district mission is the implementing agency of the project that is included in the Plan project of the civic body for 2019-29.

The plant will come up at Mannanthala.

A pond where water is available round the year will be the source.

Using the reverse osmosis technology, water will be purified and distributed.

Five-member unit

The mission will select a Kudumbashree unit with five members and entrust the functioning of the plant to them.

The 1,000-sq ft plant will have a capacity of 2,000 litres per hour.

Setting up of the plant and machinery will be tendered to an empanelled agency of the State mission.

Two laboratories and a store room will be needed at the plant.

Besides the five people running the unit, two qualified people will be employed at the lab, and 10 to 15 people will be required for water distribution around the city.

Kudumbashree women who know how to drive vehicles will take up the distribution to the extent possible.

Kudumbashree will provide entrepreneurship training to the unit too.

Kudumbashree plans to give wide publicity to the initiative to attract customers.

Besides various institutions in the city Corporation, flats and houses, and private establishments, Kudumbashree hopes to distribute water to various government offices and agencies.

Employment

The venture will also provide employment to financially backward urban women who are Kudumbashree members and is expected to provide them a good income.

Against the backdrop of a drop in employment opportunities in the agricultural sector, the RO plant is an attempt by the civic body to strengthen microenterprises, start more enterprises, and help in poverty alleviation.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-step-to-allay-citys-water-woes/article31035171.ece

426,2020/03/11,Some do's and don’ts to fight COVID-19,"Better to avoid public places and streamline hospital visits

There was some sense of jubilation among health activists in Kerala when the three patients tested positive for novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) recovered last month.

The joy was apparently shortlived as the State has been put on high alert again with more people getting infected with the virus now. Apart from being alert, the situation will have to be handled with care too, say doctors.

“At least till March-end, gatherings and celebrations in public places will have to be avoided. All religious communities will have to cooperate with this,” says P.K. Sunil, functionary of the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA).

He says the rituals could be held in a minimal way, avoiding participation of a large number of people.

“Also, unnecessary travel plans should be dropped. Visit to shopping malls could be stopped,” Dr. Sunil says.

Those who return from COVID-19-infected countries should be willing to be home-quarantined for 14 days, he adds.

Hospital visits

The most important among the suggestions is to avoid hospital visits to reduce the chance of hospital-acquired infection.

If there are unavoidable circumstances that force you to go to a hospital, the duration of the visit should be kept to the bare minimum.

“No need to hang around there unnecessarily. There is always a chance of needle stick injuries if you are not careful on hospital premises. It may lead to future health hazards,” Dr. Sunil says.

Dozens of people accompanying accident victims to hospitals is not an uncommon sight. “There is no need to visit infants and those admitted for surgeries, as they stand a high chance of getting infected. If one person is admitted to the hospital, one bystander will do to help him. No need for the whole family and other relatives to go there,” Dr. Sunil says.

It is also mandatory to avoid taking children to hospitals while visiting patients there. “There is a practice of pregnant women bringing their older kids to the hospital while being admitted for delivery. That should be discouraged,” he says.

Patients should also take care while consulting doctors. “Cover face with a handkerchief if you cough or sneeze so that the droplets fall on it. Wet handkerchiefs should be washed and replaced,” Dr. Sunil adds.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/o4ousp/article31035144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tv-CORONO085,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/some-dos-and-donts-to-fight-covid-19/article31035148.ece

429,2020/03/11,Devotees deplore delay in renovation of temple car,"Devotees of Sri Aadhi Kumbeswarar temple, Kumbakonam, are disappointed over mounting of the presiding deity Sri Aadhi Kumbeswarar on a make-shift temple car-like structure for the procession along Mada Streets during the car festival held as part of the annual Maasi Magam festival.

Decorated idols of Sri Aadhi Kumbeswarar, Goddess Mangalambigai, Sri Vinayakar, Sri Subramanyar and Chandikeswarar are to be mounted on the temporary structure on the day of car festival.

In 2018, Public Works Department officials listed the defects in the temple car, informed the Hindu Religious and Charitable Board authorities and suggested its use only after rectification. But the ‘defective’ wooden car was used for the festival with some minor rectifications, sources said. In the subsequent year, the PWD had firmly refused to issue the No Objection Certificate for use of the wooden structure for the temple festival. A make-shift temple car-like structure mounted on a bullock cart was used for carrying the presiding deity in the 2019 festival. The other deities were mounted on their respective wooden temple cars and pulled along Mada Streets.

Devotees, who were upset with the HR and CE for using the make-shift structure for the presiding deity, were hopeful that the officials set right the ‘defective’ wooden car for 2020 annual festival, said Nijanantha Meenakshi of Salai Street. “But this year also we are made to witness the presiding deity going round Mada Streets in the temporary make-shift temple car-like structure,” she said.

“Devotee want top priority for the presiding deity in the festivities,” she said suggesting use of wooden car of any of other deities for the presiding deity. Official sources said the temple administrators had received clearance for taking up repair work on the ‘defective’ wooden temple car only recently and the work would be taken up along with the consecration of the temple likely to be held by next year or later.

Sakthivel, a functionary of the Hindu Munnani, and two accomplices were arrested on Wednesday for conspiring and conjuring up a spectre that his two-wheeler had been set on fire by unidentified miscreants while he was asleep.

The Manikandam union secretary of HM lodged a complaint with the police alleging that his two-wheeler was torched at his residence at Adhavathur by unidentified persons. He said that he was sleeping in his house when a stone flung by unidentified persons broke the window. He came out to find his two-wheeler parked at the portico set ablaze and burnt completely.

435,2020/03/11,Passenger trains start plying on Mayiladuthurai-Tiruvarur electrified section,"Nearly a month after statutory clearance from Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru, operation of passenger trains hauled by electric locomotives began on Mayiladuthurai - Tiruvarur - Mayiladuthurai electrified broad gauge section on Tuesday.

The first passenger train left Mayiladuthurai junction in the morning to Tiruvarur junction, a distance of about 38 km, through Peralam, Poonthottam and Nannilam. Another passenger train arrived in Mayiladuthurai from Tiruvarur. Hitherto, passenger trains were drawn by diesel locomotives on the section, which was laid over 70 years ago.

Following Southern Railway’s decision to operate four electric loco-hauled passenger trains on the stretch, a communication from Tiruchi railway divisional authorities was circulated to station masters along the section.

The operational process involved mandatory inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety early last month of the overhead electrification works executed by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Government of India enterprise, from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur. Authorisation for introduction of electric locomotives for both passenger and freight trains came a week later.

Also, a freight train hauled by electric locomotive was operated prior to introduction of passenger trains on the newly energised section on the direction of the Commissioner of Railway Safety, a senior railway official said.

Daily trains, which were already in operation on the stretch, would, henceforth, be powered by electric locomotives, according to the official.

Although Mayiladuthurai-Tiruvarur was a separate stretch, RVNL took up the portion as part of electrification of the entire main line section (228 km) from Villupuram to Thanjavur junction via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam.

Operation of electric loco-hauled trains began recently from Villupuram to Mayiladuthurai via Cuddalore on the main line section after mandatory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety.

The remaining portion on the main line section from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur junction was expected to be electrified by June. Overhead electrification works in another stretch from Tiruvarur to Karaikal, executed by Central Organisation for Railway Electrification, was slated for completion this month-end.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/passenger-trains-start-plying-on-mayiladuthurai-tiruvarur-electrified-section/article31036946.ece

437,2020/03/11,Mayiladuthurai residents hope for formal announcement,"Demand for formation of new district

A cross-section of public in Mayiladuthurai hope that the State government will make a formal announcement on formation of a new district with the town as the headquarters during the current Assembly session.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s assurance to consider the long-felt demand of residents in Mayiladuthurai during his visit to Nagapattinam last week for initiating work on a government medical college.

While asserting that the government had taken cognisance of the need for a district, he stopped short of making an outright announcement.

Votaries for a new district in Mayiladuthurai presume that a formal announcement could be made only in the Assembly and, hence, hope that it will come during the current session convened to debate demands for grants for various government departments under the budget for 2020-21.

“The Chief Minister's assurance was heartening. We hope the follow-up action will be prompt as in the case of Kallakurichi and other new districts announced and formed in recent months,” Rajendran, senior advocate and BJP National Council Member, said.

There is cause for apprehension since the delay in announcement will put formation of the new district in jeopardy. Though the next Assembly election is a year away, by-election to the vacant seats have to be conducted and the election code of conduct may lead to delay, Mr. Rajendran said.

The Mayiladuthurai division in Nagapattinam district encompasses four taluks: Mayiladuthurai, Kuttalam, Tranquebar and Sirkazhi. At present, it takes not less than three hours of travel by road for people in Kollidam block, the farthest location in Sirkazhi taluk, to reach the district headquarters. Even administrators have a strong reason to heave a sigh of relief over formation of Mayiladuthurai district, C. Senthilvel, president of Mayiladuthurai Chamber of Commerce, said.

A new district implies better infrastructure and connectivity and hence more business activities for economic growth. In all likelihood, the population in Mayiladuthurai division exceeds 15 lakh, and more than qualifies for district status, Mr. Senthilvel said.

The short-term needs that will require immediate attention are betterment of facilities in the government hospital and laying of ring road for the town, which has been pending even after completion of land acquisition process, Sakthivel, a trader based in Mayiladuthurai town, said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/mayiladuthurai-residents-hope-for-formal-announcement/article31036942.ece

439,2020/03/11,Leipzig punishes lacklustre Spurs,"Ilicic nets four as Atalanta romps past Valencia

RB Leipzig’s Marcel Sabitzer scored two early goals as it eased past last year’s Champions League finalist Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 in its last 16 second-leg tie on Tuesday to reach its first quarterfinals by 4-0 on aggregate.

Sabitzer fired the lively German side in front with a low shot from about 20 metres after 10 minutes and it never looked back, pinning the visitor, which was without injured strikers Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, in its own half.

Leipzig’s captain was then given far too much space in the 21st to head home Angelino’s cross at the near post after Serge Aurier’s poor clearance as the Spurs’ players heads started to drop.

Emil Forsberg completed the victory with a third goal from inside the box in the 87th as Leipzig, which only got promoted to the Bundesliga in 2016, reached its first quarterfinal in Europe’s premier club competition.

Stunning display

Atalanta’s Josip Ilicic scored four goals in a stunning individual display to lead it to a 4-3 Champions League last-16, second-leg win over Valencia, that completed an 8-4 aggregate victory, at an empty Mestalla.

Playing in the Champions League for the first time this season, Atalanta’s European adventure continued in emphatic fashion as Slovenian Ilicic netted twice in each half to guide his side comfortably into the quarterfinals.

Valencia defender Mouctar Diakhaby conceded two penalties in the first half, both converted by Ilicic, either side of Kevin Gameiro’s equaliser.

Gameiro headed home a second and Ferran Torres put Valencia ahead on the night but Slovenian playmaker Ilicic completed his hat-trick and then curled in a sumptuous fourth as his team reached the quarterfinals.

Valencia started badly, with the hapless Diakhaby bringing down Ilicic inside the second minute and the Slovenian converted from the penalty spot to give the visitor a dream start.

Gameiro pounced on a loose ball and slotted home to level but Gian Piero Gasperinis Serie A side could not be repressed.

The Italians went back ahead two minutes before the break after Diakhaby handled in the area to concede another penalty, dispatched by Ilicic.

Remo Freuler crashed an effort against the crossbar for Atalanta but Gameiro headed home Torres’s cross to level on the night after 51 minutes. Electric winger Torres, recently linked with Barcelona by Spanish media, lobbed home to give the host some hope, but the sublime Ilicic wrapped up the tie with two classy finishes.

The results (last-16, second-leg): RB Leipzig 3 (Sabitzer 10, 21, Forsberg 87) bt Tottenham Hotspur 0 (Leipzig won 4-0 on aggregate); Valencia 3 (Gameiro 21, 51, Ferran Torres 67) lost to Atalanta 4 (Ilicic 3-pen, 43-pen, 71, 82).

Based on advice received from the World Health Organization, UEFA believes a city can host Euro 2020 games if it has the medical infrastructure to treat COVID-19 patients while still providing the necessary facilities to cope with tens of thousands of fans, a person with knowledge of the planning told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private planning conversations.

UEFA is using 12 stadiums in 12 nations for this unique pan-European tournament, which provides flexibility to give a city additional games if another is prevented from doing so due to the coronavirus. UEFA would remove games from a city if necessary to ensure the 24-team tournament can go ahead, the person said.

Brussels was already stripped of hosting because its stadium wasn’t finished and additional games were placed at Wembley, which has the semifinals and final in north London.

UEFA said reports that European football federations had requested that the 24-team tournament is moved to next year were “completely untrue.”

UEFA has had no requests to move or cancel the tournament, the governing body told the AP.

Officials from European football’s governing body have been working with the WHO to form a plan to mitigate the risks from the COVID-19 disease across the 12 countries due to stage games.

UEFA has been told by the WHO that it does not expect the virus to have been contained by the time Euro 2020 opens on June 12 in Rome, the persons with with knowledge of the planning said. No sports events are currently taking place in Italy after the country was put in effective lockdown by the government this week.

UEFA takes the situation linked to the coronavirus very seriously, the Nyon, Switzerland-based organization said in a statement.

“We are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with the World Health Organisation and national authorities regarding COVID-19 and its development. UEFA wants Euro 2020 to take place with fans. But some European club competition games are taking place this week in empty stadiums, including Paris Saint-Germain’s last-16 meeting in the Champions League with Borussia Dortmund on the orders of French authorities,” it said in a statement.

Decisions have already been made for later this month. Ireland’s Euro 2020 playoff match against Slovakia on March 26 will be played without fans on the instruction of the Slovakian government. Supporters will be barred from the stadium in Nuremberg for Germany’s friendly against Italy on March 31.

Like the IOC with the Tokyo Olympics, UEFA is trying to ensure its flagship event is not derailed by the virus. Cities in Azerbaijan, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Scotland and Spain will also stage games.

The new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, such as fever and cough, and the vast majority recover. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/9dp4n7/article31038517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-EUROGERMANYTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/uefa-asking-governments-to-ensure-euro-2020-goes-ahead/article31038518.ece
441,2020/03/11,Man City vs Arsenal match postponed after coronavirus contact,"The players will remain at their homes for 14 days of self-isolation.

Manchester City's Premier League home match against Arsenal on Wednesday has been postponed because players from the London club have had contact with the owner of Greek side Olympiakos Piraeus, who has contracted the coronavirus.

A number of players from Arsenal's squad had met Evangelos Marinakis following their Europa League round of 32 meeting in London on Feb. 27.

Marinakis, who also owns English Championship (second tier) side Nottingham Forest, said on Tuesday he had contracted the coronavirus.

Globally, more than 116,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus and over 4,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements.

“Manchester City's Premier League fixture at home to Arsenal has been postponed,” City said in a statement.

“The decision to postpone tonight's game has been taken as a precautionary measure on medical advice, after it emerged that personnel from Arsenal FC have come into contact with the Olympiacos owner, Evangelos Marinakis, who has been named as a positive case of COVID-19.”

Arsenal said the risk to their players was “extremely low” but they would follow medical guidelines.

“The medical advice we have received puts the risk of them developing COVID-19 at extremely low,” Arsenal said in a statement.

“However, we are strictly following government guidelines which recommend that anyone coming into close contact with someone with the virus should self-isolate at home for 14 days from the last time they had contact. The players will remain at their homes until the 14-day period expires. Four Arsenal staff, who were sitting close to Mr Marinakis during the match will also remain at home until the 14 days are complete,” the club said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/1wepoz/article31037385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKHEALTH-CORONAVIRUSMARINAKIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/man-city-vs-arsenal-match-postponed-after-coronavirus-contact/article31037386.ece

443,2020/03/11,AFC Cup | CCFC motivated to do something special,"Head coach Nawas says it’s eager to do well against Maziya Sports & Recreation

Chennai City FC (CCFC) hasn’t had a good run in the I-League this season. However, that is not the team’s concern now.

The focus is on its maiden AFC Cup campaign against Male-based Maldives team — Maziya Sports & Recreation — to be played at the Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday.

While CCFC qualified for the AFC Cup as the I-League champion last season, Maziya made it by winning the playoffs against Bengaluru FC (BFC) 4-3 on penalties after the two-leg contest ended 4-4 on aggregate.

CCFC head coach Akbar Nawas said his team was more than eager to prove itself.

“We are proud to be participating [in AFC Cup], and being the only Indian team, we are motivated to do something special.

Respect for opponent

“We respect them [Maziya] as they beat BFC, which is a competitive team. We can’t underestimate them,” he said at an interaction on Tuesday.

CCFC is coming back to Chennai after playing in the I-League for one season in 2016-17 before shifting base to Coimbatore in 2018-19.

Nawas felt playing here would be a big motivation.

“Everybody is excited to play their first AFC group game because we are playing in Chennai’s Nehru stadium.

“It’s a good motivation. We are looking forward to it,” he said. Maziya’s head coach Marjan Sekulovski said the team was prepared and will go for full points.

“It is our first game in the group stage. It will be difficult and [moreover] we don’t know the strength of all the teams. [But] we always we play to win,” he said.

Dismal record

Maziya is no stranger to Indian clubs in the AFC Cup. It has played Mohun Bagan and BFC six times across three seasons, but has lost five times.

With four teams in Group-E, including Bashundhara Kings (Bangladesh) and TC Sports Club (Maldives), every side will play three matches each at home and away. The top two will progress to the round-of-32.

Having not met earlier, both CCFC and Maziya will fancy their chances.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/vnk8z8/article31033775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11CCFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/afc-cup-ccfc-motivated-to-do-something-special/article31033776.ece
444,2020/03/11,Man’s best friend gets specialist treatment for free here,"Be it cancer surgery or advice on feeding habits, just walk in for services at NTR vet hospital

Unable to bear the sight of his adorable Golden Retriever writhing in pain unable to relieve itself, Mr. Bhaskara Rao thought the end was near and had spent a sleepless night recently. At daybreak, upon the advice of a friend, he rushed his pet to the NTR Veterinary Super Specialty Hospital at Labbipet here and it turned out to be one of the best suggestions he has ever got.

Assistant Director K. Srinivasa Rao and his team of veterinarians rushed the dog to the operation theatre and surgically removed more than half a dozen pebble-like stones from its bladder.

“I almost gave up hope on my pet but now it’s hale and hearty and the treatment didn’t cost me a penny,” says a much-relieved Rao, who stays near Vinayak Theatre.

Common illnesses

Not many pet lovers may be aware but your dog or cat is susceptible to many illnesses common to humans and the good news is the veterinary hospital is well-equipped to treat the disorders, including surgeries, free of cost.

“Surgeries for ear problems, removal of various tumours, stones, and ovaries and uterus and even caesarean section for dogs and other animals are quite common,” Srinivasa Rao, the Best Veterinarian award winner, tells The Hindu. Citing another case, he says an Alsatian having delivery difficulty, had to be operated upon to bring out a large litter of 12 puppies, a bounty for its owner!

Especially for animals, post-operative care by owners is crucial to ensure proper recovery, underlines Dr. Srinivasa Rao, who has performed about 800 surgeries in a span of four years in the hospital.

He suggests deworming once in two months and vaccination once a year to keep a dog healthy.

“Such surgeries cost thousands of rupees outside, and many people who can’t afford them leave their pets to suffer silently, unaware of the facility here,” remarks Mr. Rambabu who got his 13-year-old Pomeranean operated upon for bladder stones.

Pet owners can just walk into the hospital even for general advice on feeding habits and health care.

Expansion plans

The referral hospital for six districts has eight veterinarians working in two shifts assisted by para-vet personnel and other support staff, an operation theatre and a lab facility, says D. Subhakar Rao, Joint Director of Animal Husbandry and head of the institution. The hospital is awaiting scanning and other latest diagnostic equipment as part of its expansion plans, he adds.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/u3gqvk/article31034514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-vj-veterniary-hospital-graphiccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/mans-best-friend-gets-specialist-treatment-for-free-here/article31034515.ece

The Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty which became effective on March 5,1970 has achieved much in the last 50 years, though the pace of change has dwindled recently. The initial progress was rapid, reducing the nuclear weapons in the world by around 90% from Cold War levels, but the final goal of complete disarmament is not on the horizon.

447,2020/03/11,‘No defined seat sharing formula for local body polls’,"JSP-BJP combine to release vision statement tomorrow

The Jana Sena Party–BJP combine that will be contesting together in the local body polls has decided to share seats based on the strength of their candidates.

During a joint media conference here on Tuesday, BJP MLC P.V.N. Madhav said that there was no defined formula on seat sharing.

“We have decided to share the seats based on the strength of candidates. If the BJP candidate is strong in one ward, we will project him or her, with the support of the JSP-BJP combine. Strong JSP candidates will also be promoted in the respective wards,” said Mr. Madhav.

JSP General Secretary Shiv Shankar said a common vision statement of the combine was being designed and it would be released on March 12. “The local issues will be in focus,” he said.

Referring to the combine, Mr. Shiv Shankar said: “This is neither an alliance of convenience nor power. It is an alliance that caters to the need of the hour, which calls for a corruption- free government and development.” According to Mr. Madhav, the alliance was needed to end the dynasty rule in the State politics.

Decentralisation

Asked whether people would support the BJP despite the party opposing the State government’s decision of making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital, Mr. Madhav said, “We were never against decentralised development. But giving the capital tag to a place only does not mean development. The move will increase the real estate prices for the benefit of some political leaders.” Clarifying further, he said, “We were against Hyderabad-centric or Amaravai-centric development. But decentralisation does not mean splitting capitals. Visakhapatnam has always been the financial capital of the State and will continue to be so, irrespective of it being declared as capital.”

Both Mr. Madhav and Mr. Shiv Shankar said supporting the TDP in 2014 was the need of the hour, as the State was just split and there was a need for a stable government. “We were disappointed with the way the TDP ruled and withdrew our support,” they said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/kppth5/article31037256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VZ3BJPJSP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/no-defined-seat-sharing-formula-for-local-body-polls/article31037257.ece

The senate also decided to increase the number of seats in M.A. English programme to 40 from 30. “The decision was taken in the wake of the government decision of introducing English as the medium of instruction in all State-run schools. The senate members felt that the demand for English teachers would go up in the coming days,” said Mr. Prasad Reddy.

In total, 56 topics were discussed in the senate meeting.

Several members suggested that the PG Diploma in yoga therapy course should be made a two-year postgraduate programme.

Courses scrapped

The senate also decided to scrap M.A. course in communications and media studies and PG Diploma programme in journalism and mass communication. Apart from it, decision was taken to scrap sound recording and editing courses being offered by the Department of Music.

The members also decided to reserve 75 % of the total M.A. in Sociology seats to the candidates who have completed degree programmes in social science and humanities, leaving 25 % of seats the graduates from any other stream.

The senate suggested that the M.A. course in human rights and duties should be attached to the Department of Sociology. The members also decided to award bachelor of academics law degree to the students who have completed three years of the five-year law programme.

449,2020/03/11,Vizag youngsters ring in Holi with a riot of colour,"Coronavirus scare fails to dampen the spirit of celebrations

Residents thronged Beach Road in large numbers to celebrate Holi, paying little heed to the coronavirus scare that has gripped other parts of the country.

Youngsters caked in several layers of colour ran on the beach, spraying one another with their water guns. Young couples took selfies while families lounged on the beach as their children mingled with other kids on the beach and kept the celebrations going well past noon.

Any doubts of a large turnout on the beach due to the coronavirus scare were quelled by 9 a.m. as youths slowly began to turn up at the beach.

The celebrations, which began on a slow note, quickly gained pace as large crowds gathered all along the beach starting from Naval Coastal Battery to Park Hotel Junction. Rushikonda and Tenneti Park also saw large gatherings.

Last-minute sales

Several stalls made brisk business on Tuesday morning as youths turned up to buy colours, water bombs and water guns.

Many youngsters who ran out of colours in the middle of their celebrations also made a quick detour to the stalls lined up along Beach Road.

Not content with dousing each other in colour, many youths hurled eggs and tomatoes at each other. “Just rubbing colour in others’ faces won’t do. You have to break an egg on their head and also hurl a tomato if you have one as it is difficult to get it off,” said Sidharth, an engineering student living in Lawson’s Bay Colony.

The revelry complete, youngsters took a dip in the sea at RK Beach to wash off the colours before heading home. Lifeguards had their hands full ensuring that nobody ventured too far into the water.

“I have come here with my family like I do every year. There is no better spot than Beach Road to celebrate Holi. My children love coming here and playing with other kids,” said N. Yeshwanth, a bank employee from the city.

Many families organised parties at home, inviting friends and relatives.

“It is an annual ritual for us to celebrate with our cousins and friends. After playing Holi, we go for a long drive and have lunch together at a restaurant,” said P. Anitha, a resident of Visalakshi Nagar.

Playing it safe

Several hotels chose not to hold the traditional Holi rain dance programme at their establishments. Several apartments too decided not to organise Holi celebrations in view of the COVID-19 scare. “Though our city has not reported any confirmed case of coronavirus, it is better to avoid public gatherings as the number of suspected cases are increasing each passing day,” said K Harika, an IT employee from the city.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/toxdl3/article31035311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VZ2HOLI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vizag-youngsters-ring-in-holi-with-a-riot-of-colour/article31035313.ece

The administration has sent requisitions to the State Election Commission for 2,200 big size ballot boxes. In all, 1,712 polling stations will be set up and each polling station will have a Presiding Officer and four other officials.

The last GVMC polls were held in 2007. There was a delay in holding the elections due to the court cases over the delimitation exercise. Now, the number of wards has gone up from 72 to 98.

After a review meeting on Tuesday, Collector V. Vinay Chand and Police Commissioner R.K. Meena and DCP S. Ranga Reddy told the media that fool-proof arrangements were being made to ensure a free and fare election.

The sensitive and hyper sensitive polling stations are being identified.

The Election Commission issued the notification for the polls on March 9. As per the schedule, the notice by the Returning Officer concerned will be issued on March 11. The nominations will be filed on the same day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The nominations will be scrutinised on March 14. Nominations can be withdrawn by 3 p.m. on March 16.

Election will be held from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. The votes will be counted from 8 a.m. on March 27. Re-polling, if required, will be held on March 26.

Poll personnel

In total 17.52 lakh voters including 8.73 lakh women and 126 third gender people will exercise their franchise. “The poll personnel have been undergoing training since Monday. The GVMC election will need 10,600 personnel. Polling personnel will be appointed as per the lists obtained from the office of District Election Officer,” said Mr. Vinay Chand.

Printing of ballot papers will be undertaken in various presses in the city allotted by the District Collector. Proposals will be sent on conferring magisterial powers on the officials concerned.

Web-casting

Stating that web-casting would be done at all the polling stations, Mr. Meena said flying squads and static surveillance teams had been arranged to keep a tab on flow of cash and liquor to influence the voters.

“The teams will act immediately on receipt of complaints on violation of the model code of conduct,” he said.

Meanwhile, all history and rowdy-sheeters have been kept under surveillance.

451,2020/03/11,YSRCP makes winning civic body election a prestige issue,"‘Mayoral candidate will be finalised later due to strategic reasons’

Having received setbacks twice from Visakhapatnam, the YSR Congress Party is taking the the GVMC elections as a prestigious issues in view of the State government’s move to set up Executive capital in the city.

Even as an exercise has been launched to select the candidates before the filing of nominations ends on March 14, the YSRCP leadership has appointed its national general secretary V. Vijay Sai Reddy as the key strategist to ensure win in the polls being held in 98 wards.

In no uncertain terms, Mr. Reddy has told the party rank and file that winning the mayor post is very important for the party.

Setback in the past

The party had received the first jolt when working president Vijayamma, wife of late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and mother of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was trounced by the TDP-BJP combine candidate K. Haribabu in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections in Visakhapatnam.

The second setback came during the last general elections when the YSRCP had to bite the dust in all the four city segments.

It has already launched a scathing attack on the four TDP MLAs for doing nothing and not adopting a clear stand on the Executive capital issue.

Selection of nominees

The YSRCP, besides holding constituency-wise review meetings, has also fixed responsibility with the coordinators and in-charges who will recommend candidates.

Survey on

The party high command has already conducted surveys on the ground realities. Another survey is being conducted to pick up candidates from outside even if they have not submitted their applications before the screening committees based on their track record.

As far as the mayoral post is concerned, party sources told The Hindu that it would be finalised after the elections due to ‘strategic reasons.’

As it is an indirect election, based on various equations, the party will take a call in consultation with district in-charge and Agriculture Minister Kurasala Kannababu and Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao in the eleventh hour.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on March 11 said that according to its assessment, COVID-19 “can be characterised as a pandemic.”

“WHO has been assessing this outbreak round-the-clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,” it said.

“Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

WHO noted with concern that 1,18,000 positive cases have been reported globally in 114 countries and more than 90% of cases are in just four countries.

Dr. Ghebreyesus said 81 countries had not reported any COVID-19 cases, and 57 countries had reported 10 case or less.

With 60 confirmed cases of the virus in India, the Central government on March 11 night issued a new travel advisory stating that all existing visas, except diplomatic, official, U.N./International Organisations, employment, project visas, stand suspended till April 15 and this order will come into effect from March 13 at the port of departure.

The new advisory, issued following a meeting of the Group of Ministers, noted that visa-free travel facility granted to OCI card holders is kept in abeyance till April 15 and also comes into effect from March 13.

It added that any foreign national who intends to travel to India for compelling reason may contact the nearest Indian Mission and all incoming travellers, including Indian nationals, arriving from or having visited China, Italy, Iran, Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany after Feb 15 shall be quarantined for a minimum period of 14 days.

“Provision for testing primarily for students/compassionate cases in Italy to be made and collection for samples to be organised accordingly. Those tested negative will be allowed to travel and will be quarantined on arrival in India for 14 days,” the release added.

It also noted that international traffic through land borders will be restricted.

Fresh cases

Meanwhile the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has risen to 60 in India on March 11 with two fresh positive cases — one each from Delhi and Rajasthan being reported — according to a release issued by the Union Health Ministry.

However, as per State health officials, the number of confirmed cases may be up to 65, but the cases are not confirmed by the Centre.

“There are now 60 positive cases of COVID-19 in the country [including the 3 cases from Kerala discharged earlier],” noted the Health Ministry which has also confirmed cases from Kerala (8), Karnataka and Maharashtra which were reported earlier this week by the State governments.

Kerala has till now reported 17 cases which include the three patients who were discharged last month following recovery.

Pune authorities said three more persons, who were part of a 40-member tour group which recently travelled to Dubai, have tested positive for COVID-19. This takes the tally of positive cases in Pune district to eight and that in Maharashtra to 10.

2 IT staff test positive

Two employees working with IT companies Dell and Mindtree have tested positive for coronavirus, according to company statements. However, their locations were not disclosed.

Army sources said on Wednesday that 83 individuals who arrived from Italy on AI flight AI138 on March 11 have been quarantined at Manesar.

“The evacuees will be monitored for two weeks by doctors. If any individual is suspected to be infected, he/she will be shifted to isolation facility,” they said.

“About 119 people who were on board Diamond Princess cruise ship off the Japan coast and brought back in a special flight from Japan and currently at Manesar will complete their two weeks of quarantine on Wednesday. Once the final test results are out, which are expected by Thursday, they will be allowed to go home with their detailed documentation sent to the District/ State surveillance units for further surveillance,” the source noted.

948 evacuated

India has so far evacuated 948 passengers from coronavirus-affected countries. Of these, 900 are Indian citizens and 48 belonging to different nationalities”.

A 76-year-old man suspected to be infected with COVID-19 has died in Karnataka’s Kalaburagi, District Health and Family Welfare department said on March 11. “Mohammed Hussain Siddiqui’s swab samples have been sent to a lab in Bengaluru. The report is awaited,” department officials said. Mr. Siddiqui had recently returned from Saudi Arabia.

The Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways issued an advisory to reduce the spread of the virus and noted that all necessary steps may be undertaken in public transport vehicles to ensure sanitation of seats, handles and bars. “The hygiene and sanitation may be stepped up at all the bus terminals and the display of public health massages may be ensured on public transport vehicles,” noted the Ministry.

Doctors to Italy

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in his statement in the Rajya Sabha noted that India will be sending a team of doctors to Italy by Thursday for testing its nationals for coronavirus to bring them back, while samples of 529 more people have been brought from Iran.

He said the Indian government was working with the Iranian authorities to operate some limited commercial flights for facilitating early return of the remaining Indians after testing them. He added that Iran and Italy were two “focal points” for the government as any “worldwide activity” will only add to the panic. “There are over 6,000 Indians in various provinces of Iran, which include 1,100 pilgrims, nearly 300 students and about 1,000 fishermen. The others are on a longer term stay for earning livelihood and education,” he added.

Cases have also come in from Pune and Jaipur though not confirmed by the Central government.

Also an 85-year-old man, who returned from Dubai to Jaipur on February 28, was sent to the isolation ward in Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital on March 11 after he tested positive for COVID-19. His confirmatory test with fresh samples was carried out after his initial test turned out to be positive on march 10.

The Union Home Ministry, in an order on March 11, transferred some of its power to the Union Health Ministry for tackling the COVID-19 if the outbreak turns out to be a disaster of national proportions. This will allow the Health Ministry to act as “coordinating and monitoring body for disaster management”; to prepare a national plan to deal with the emergency and “coordinate and monitor the implementation of the National Policy.”

Classes suspended in J&K

The J&K administration has suspended classwork in all educational institutions, including schools and universities, till March 31. ""The public is urged to avoid unnecessary travel and use of public transport,"" the J&K spokesman said. This comes as one positive case of COVID-19 was reported in Jammu two days ago.

WHO busts myths and fake messages on coronavirus

Busting the myths and fake messages circulating on social media, the Public Health department of Maharashtra on Wednesday said consuming more garlic, curry leaves or cow’s urine would neither treat nor prevent one from the novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection.

The officials urged people to instead follow good hand hygiene, have coughing and sneezing etiquette and eat nutritious and well-cooked food. Click here to read more.

Are there differences between symptoms caused by the flu and COVID-19?

Cough and cold could mean an allergy. A fever with cough and cold is a symptom of the flu. When you have fever with cough which is complicated by breathlessness, it is a symptom of Coronavirus infection and you must call your doctor to rule it out.

Dr KK Aggarwal; President, Confederation of Medical Associations of Asia and Oceania and former president of Indian Medical Association

Can a person exposed to Coronavirus transmit it to others if he/she uses a swimming pool?

Highly unlikely. The Coronavirus is a droplet infection. It has to be inhaled to cause the disease. Chlorination of swimming pools to recommended levels can certainly inactivate any virus, including COVID-19.

Dr Ravi Santosham; Pulmonologist

Is it true that hot weather conditions can prevent COVID-19 transmission? Can sunlight kill the virus?

It can probably inhibit the growth, viability or stability of the virus but to what extent we do not know. If the virus is already in my body and I sneeze, you will get it. There is no question of heat in such situations. We know that it survives in the human body at 37 degree Celsius. So, heat is no deterrent for its transmission. The only probability is that it may not survive in the outside environment. So, to say that the hot Indian summer will inhibit it... no, it will transmit as effectively. But the virus may not survive outside for long. That is the only advantage.

Will wearing masks prevent the spreading of Coronavirus? What kind of masks should we wear?

For common people, it is not necessary to wear masks. Only people infected with COVID-19 and healthcare professionals, who are in contact with such infected patients, need to use N95 masks. The rest need not wear.

Dr J Euphrasia Latha; Head, Institute of Microbiology, Madras Medical College

If you are travelling to places where the probability of catching the infection is high, say hospitals, you need to wear masks. If you are using public transport system, where you cannot know if somebody will sneeze or cough, you can use a mask. But the main prevention mechanism is to frequently wash your hands and refrain from shaking other people’s hands or hugging them. Follow cough etiquette when you are travelling or outside.

Dr P Kuganantham; Founder-chairman, Indian Public Health Foundation and former Chennai City Health Officer

Should people avoid eating meat based food to prevent transmission?

Eating meat has nothing to do with Coronavirus. It is a respiratory virus and not a food-borne one.

Dr KK Aggarwal

Coronavirus has nothing to do with food or pet animals or eating chicken and mutton. People can eat whatever they want and how much ever they want.

Dr V Ramasubramanian

What measures are being taken in airports to screen passengers for COVID-19 infection?

All international passengers are being screened. On average, at the Chennai airport, at least 6,500 passengers are being screened through the 10 health screening counters. Since the outbreak, we have seen a 27% reduction in the number of passengers at Chennai. On the advice of the Government of India, we are using dedicated aerobridges, immigration counters, X-ray Baggage Inspection Systems, carousel and exit gate for flights operating from 12 countries. All the touch points of passenger flow area like aerobridges, baggage trolleys and floor areas are frequently cleaned. The airport has five automatic sanitiser dispensers. Bottled sanitisers are provided by Airports Authority of India at various points. We have stuck awareness posters, put up digital TV displays and Do’s and Don’ts at passenger flow locations. Awareness programmes are being conducted by National Disaster Response Force and Airport Health Organisation to housekeeping staff for method of cleaning.

How soon can a vaccine be developed for COVID-19?

Novel viruses happen due to reassortment. They remain for a short period and mutate depending on various factors like geography etc. A vaccine for COVID-19 is likely to be developed in another three to six months because the trials are on at the moment. Like H1N1, a vaccine can be developed for COVID-19 too.

Dr P Kuganantham

In the case of a hit-and-run virus like SARS, no vaccine was developed because after six months it did not come back. If COVID-19 too disappears, then there wouldn’t be a need for one.

Dr KK Aggarwal

Is there a link between a person’s immunity and COVID-19 transmission? Is this curable?

Sometimes, the virus enters a person’s lungs and causes pneumonia. People with vulnerable immunity like the elderly succumb to this. Young people with good immunity, the effects of the virus may not be too strong but if you are someone with comorbid conditions like diabetes or cardiac disease, or if you are on immunosuppresive drugs, then the risk of infection is severe.

Dr J Euphrasia Latha

Coronovirus is one of the weakest family of viruses. The deaths caused so far or people affected could have been ones with less immunity like children or the elderly. It does not affect everybody. Yes, 100% immunocompromised people like those with HIV, people with cancer, those who have undergone transplant surgeries or people with diabetes are at risk. Children and elderly are at risk as well. If you take the history of all who died in China or Iran, 90% of them would have been suffering from an illness that compromises their immunity.

Dr P Kuganantham

The average age of virus death is 59. The mortality rate for people aged 60 and above after contracting a viral infection is 3.4%; above 70 years is 8% and 80 and above is 15%. Generally, if the immunity is good, you can tolerate any viral infection but there is no specific evidence as it pertains to COVID-19.

Dr KK Aggarwal

If I have symptoms of COVID-19 virus, should I approach the hospital directly? What if I accidentally pass on the virus to others on the way or at the hospital?

You are not supposed to visit a hospital directly. In Delhi, you must call a hospital or doctor. There are designated centres to give your samples. Depending on your symptoms, a call will be made on what needs to be done, and they will come and collect a sample at your home. You cannot go to a hospital and infect others.

Dr KK Aggarwal

There are helpline numbers to contact. At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) in Chennai, there is a separate outpatient section for Coronavirus cases. You can visit here and consult a doctor and leave samples for testing. No other patient will be permitted to access this entrance. RGGGH is the only place in Chennai where samples will be collected for testing.

Dr J Euphrasia Latha

Most people will go to see their family physician or the neighbourhood doctor for treatment. But they will transmit the disease. Only government facilities are equipped to test for Coronavirus.

Dr Ravi Santhosham

Are there any home remedies to treat COVID-19?

Home remedies and treatment other than allopathy is not proven science. The best thing is precaution only. You must keep away from a patient who coughs and sneezes. If you are coughing, you need to cover your face with a mask and not spread the droplets around. COVID-19 spreads through droplets.

Dr J Euphrasia Latha

Why should we consider such opinions and baseless assumptions? Go ahead with home remedies if you want but none of them works on Coronavirus. But go ahead because if you can prove that anything can cure COVID-19 infection, then that is worth a Nobel Prize.

Dr KK Aggarwal

Is India equipped to battle Coronavirus?

We have started late. There are two steps in case of a viral outbreak — preparedness and containment. If you cannot contain, you delay and if you cannot delay, you research and mitigate the circumstances. Preparedness phased cannot be considered now when there already is infection. After 43 cases, now we are going through preparedness. It is a bit of a delayed response. You need both preparedness and containment tactics at the moment. At least, in India, community spread has not happened so far.

Dr KK Aggarwal

We must change the focus of our battle to personal hygiene. For example, during the Ebola outbreak in Africa, the Governments there was able to contain not because of drugs and treatment but by improving personal hygiene. They mandated hand-washing frequently at schools and industries, which helped bring down the cases. For COVID-19, the management is only by handling patients with travel history. They need to be isolated for the incubation period and kept under observation.

455,2020/03/11,"Australian Grand Prix | Haas, McLaren team members quarantined, tested for coronavirus","Formula One organisers have already postponed the Chinese race scheduled in April, while the Bahrain Grand Prix will go ahead without spectators on March 22

Two members of the Haas Formula One team and one from McLaren were quarantined in Melbourne on Wednesday as a precaution amid coronavirus fears ahead of Sunday’s season-opening Australian Grand Prix.

“Two members showed some cold-like symptoms this morning. With the guidelines we’ve followed, they have been tested (for coronavirus),” a Haas spokesman told Reuters at Albert Park.

“As a result of being tested they have to go back into the hotel for isolation while we await the results.”

McLaren said one team member had self-isolated in the team hotel as a precaution for showing “coronavirus-like symptoms”.

“We expect to receive the results overnight. The team is operating as per our normal schedule,” a spokeswoman said.

Reuters has sought comment from race organisers.

Both Haas and McLaren are Britain-based, while Haas has close ties with Italy-based Ferrari, which supplies their power units.

Italian authorities have been struggling to contain a major outbreak of the coronavirus.

More than 119,100 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and 4,298 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

Australia extended its travel ban to Italy on Wednesday after the southern European nation expanded a lockdown to cover the entire country to contain the spread of the virus.

Australia has already barred entry to those arriving directly from mainland China, South Korea and Iran, except for its citizens and permanent residents.

A spokeswoman for Ferrari said none of its team members had been quarantined or tested.

“All are present and accounted for,” she said.

Formula One organisers have already postponed the Chinese race scheduled in April, while the Bahrain Grand Prix will go ahead without spectators on March 22.

Australian Grand Prix Corporation chief executive Andrew Westacott had said on Monday that Albert Park was ready to welcome thousands of motor sport fans and there was “no chance” of a spectator ban.

More than 300,000 people attended race week last year, according to organisers’ estimates.

With a surge in local cases in recent days and confirmed community transmission in Melbourne, organisers have been under fire from some media pundits for insisting the race will go ahead without restrictions.

Australian health authorities are battling to contain community spread of the coronavirus, with infections mounting day by day and several schools forced to close in Melbourne and Sydney.

Australia had recorded 112 cases of the coronavirus as of 11 a.m. local time (0000 GMT) on Wednesday, up from 100 the previous day, the health department said. Three people have died from the disease in the country.

The new coronavirus has infected more than 116,000 people and killed more than 4,000 around the world since it surfaced in China late last year.

More than 300,000 fans attended race week at Albert Park last year, according to organsiers' estimates.

With a prominent art festival in Australia's southern Tasmania State and other local events cancelled in recent days, Australian media pundits have queried the safety of thousands of fans flocking to Albert Park.

“In the real world, the Indian Wells tennis tournament in the US has been cancelled, the Socceroos World Cup qualifiers have been postponed, major club matches in Italy are being played behind closed doors, and the World Cup skiing finals in Cortina dAmpezzo have been scratched altogether,” Greg Baum wrote in Melbourne daily The Age on Tuesday.
