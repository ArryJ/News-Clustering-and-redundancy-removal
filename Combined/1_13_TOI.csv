0,['13/01/2020'],Prithviraj: What I love most about acting are the moments of no control,"Many could effectively argue that 2019 belonged to Prithviraj , with the sci-fi thriller 9, record-breaking Lucifer and the superhit Driving Licence . This year, however, he seems to have decided to take it slow – announcing a three-month break to prepare for Aadujeevitham for which he will be shooting from March till September. In between, he also Ayyappum Koshyum coming up. In conversation with the actor and director.I don’t know, maybe it would have been a better film, maybe not. But I am a huge Mohanlal fan. There’s this popular cliché that we want the Mohanlal of yore. I am really not looking for Mohanlal sir to go back and do that. He has done that and been the best at that. Now, he has evolved and aged, and today at this stage of his stardom, as a genuine fan you would want him to do what you think would suit him at this point in his career and Stephen Nedumpally in Lucifer fit that bill.There are multiple times during the film’s shoot where I have told him that he has forgotten his shoulder tilt. That kind of shot comes from being a genuine fan. I am sure that if and when I direct Mammukka, I will have tonnes of similar things to tell him too because I have followed his career for so long and grown up watching his films. In my mind, there is a Mammukka I want to see now as a fan and I will keep pulling him to that Mammukka when I direct him.When we did Koode , (director) Anjali Menon asked me to just get into a pool and float every day, if I can. I asked her why and she was spot on in her observation. ‘I think you are a control freak,’ she said. Floating is basically letting go to stay buoyant. With control freaks, what happens is that you become more comfortable when you are more in control. The most control you can exercise on a film set is when you are directing, which is why I was relaxed while doing Lucifer.That is what I love most about acting. You think you can control everything but every actor would tell you that there are distinct moments of absolute no control in performance. That is my high. For a control freak, those moments are like a narcotic. I am not saying it happens for every shot but there are certain moments between action and cut when I realise that those things were unplanned and happened without me knowing. Lalettan has also told me this, he calls these ‘happy accidents’.The variables of direction remain the same, regardless of the size of the film. What probably differs between the kinds of film is that when you make a film like Lucifer, one important factor you consider is what would be the reaction of the viewer, who is the third person apart from the director and the actor. When you shoot a film as commercial as Lucifer, you design that into the filmmaking. For instance, if there’s a punchline, you throw a silent reaction because you expect applause there. You want the moment to sink in. In the truest sense of the narrative, you don’t need that counter close-up or pause, but in a film like Lucifer you design that into your filmmaking. In terms of variables, regardless of the size of the film, it remains the same. My exercise of making a film would remain the same, regardless of me doing Empuraan or a Rs 50 lakh film shot on a GoPro.I would love to direct Fahadh, Dulquer and Nivin. But the thing is I am basically an actor and I can’t be directing films one after the other even if I want to. That’s not how I am programmed. I still see myself as an actor. Direction is something I will do once in three years. I know that I am not going to end up as a director who has done 50 films. But once in a while I will do what I want to do. I have a few thoughts in mind, but it will all depend on what I want to do after Empuraan.I think there’s a general perception that Ayyappanum Koshyum is a verbose, massy film. It’s not. It is a very intense, realistic kind of cinema. There is action in it, but not a lot. It is an interesting film for me because it presents an opportunity to do a layered character. I play a very flawed man. In a lot of ways, Biju Menon’s character plays the ideal guy. I had a ball playing the role. Also, we had fun in the sets, with Ranjiettan, Sachy and Biju, except for the fact that I was on a crash diet. I think that environment helped in the making of the film too. Even Biju’s portrayal in the film will be different.I am not a very pious person, but there is something about Najeeb’s staunch focus on faith that I kind of understand. I guess my focus is mostly cinema and work. Supriya would tell you that when I am at work, I am only tuned in to that and nobody can talk to me. I get that with Najeeb’s faith. Also, the very interesting angle about thing is that for three years if a human communicates and interacts more with animals than men, who do you become one amongst? It’s an interesting physical, physiological and spiritual journey for the character. I hope all that comes through in the film and my performance. It’s a big film and we are taking a zero-compromise approach for the film. I resume filming for Aadujeevitham from beginning of March till September in Jordan, Egypt and some portions in India. Every other film will start only after that.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73212838,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-82177/73212838.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/prithviraj-what-i-love-most-about-acting-are-the-moments-of-no-control/articleshow/73212838.cms

Though she’s been to Europe before, this trip was special because she chose to see fewer cities, but spend longer durations in each of them. “I backpacked, but unlike earlier trips when I was keen on ticking off places, this visit was more about a detailed tour of some of my favourite places and soaking in their vibe,” explains the actor.She tried skiiing, but also stumbled over numerous times. “Yes, it’s more painful than it looks. I had a hard time walking after that,” says Samyuktha.She opted to forego public transport or using a car and, instead, chose to walk around Prague. “You discover so many little gems that way. We found so many local eating joints and grubberies, because we were on foot,” she observes.Had a memorable time decorating a 15-foot Christmas tree. “In Europe, they take their tradition of decking up the tree rather seriously, so we spent many hours doing it up.

She also baked a cake for the first time ever, and is glad that she was able to satisfactorily feed a group of 10 people.“Spend the time you have together wisely, shorten the fights and prolong the good moments. But when you aren’t around, make sure to keep yourself busy with other things like work, family and friends,” shares the actor, who straddles such a relationship herself. Being in a long distance relationship is hard, she admits. “But finding ‘the one’ is harder, so effort is everything,” states Samyuktha, adding, “So, plan your breaks wisely and book tickets in advance.

Apart from some song sequences, the team also filmed a few talkie portions at a place that Prem describes as an ‘extraordinary location’. “We shot atop a hill that overlooks a hamlet named, Avalanchi. The beauty of this hamlet lies in the fact that the houses there are built at points where the rays fall directly on them during sunrise every morning. Meanwhile, the rest of the area is almost always covered by fog until way past noon. Also, almost 60% of the 50-odd homes in the hamlet are owned by Kannadigas,” says Prem, adding, “My cinematographer, Mahen Simha, and I were completely smitten by these scenic parts of Ooty.”The team will now be travelling to Gujarat to shoot more songs sequences, says the filmmaker.

The wedding will take place in Mysuru on February 25 and 26 at a convention centre. Chandan and Niveditha, who met during their stint on the Kannada reality show, gave their relationship an official stamp when the former proposed to her on the stage during his Yuva Dasara performance in October. They followed that up with a formal engagement a few days later, hinting at the time that they would get married in February.

Although we met in the Bigg Boss house, it is our trust and mutual understanding that has taken our relationship to another level. After the TV show, I have got several film offers, but I did not take it up, as it has been my dream to work in the operations of an airport, which I have now got in Bengaluru. Now that I have begun working, and Chandan has been travelling a lot for shows, both our families locked in on the days that he would be in town and decided to fix a date in February. Right now, we are in the process of deciding the theme for the wedding and our outfits as well. The customs and rituals of both the families will be followed at the wedding.

7,['13/01/2020'],I have always harboured dreams of being an actor: Manju Maandavya,"Manju Maandavya, who has played character roles on screen before and has donned multiple other hats, including that of a writer, director and lyricist in the Kannada film industry, debuts as a hero in Sri Bharatha Baahubali , which releases on January 17. The multitasker shares how his debut as a hero had been impending, in a chat with Bangalore Times. Excerpts:During my college days, I had starred in a film called Prema as the lead. Since then, I have always harboured dreams of being an actor. However, when I started my career, I decided to dabble with multiple aspects of filmmaking to keep options open, and writing clicked. I wrote for over 30 movies and eventually it became my comfort zone. So, I was looking for a change. That’s how my acting stint in Raja Huli happened.After that, people started asking me to act more and many wanted me to take up a rural subject. After directing Masterpiece, there was anticipation about what I would take up next. Many actors were busy and had commitments for a year or two and I did not want a completely new face to play the lead in my next. I believed a familiar face will help the movie attain commercial success. Around that time, I got the idea of Sri Bharatha Baahubali. Bharatha, the protagonist, is a village boy. He had to look natural and relatable and I thought it was a good role to debut with. I knew I wanted Chikkanna to play Baahubali as our performances in Raja Huli was liked by the audiences. Therefore, this seemed a promising film to begin with.People, including Chikkanna and music director Manikanth Kadri , asked me why I chose to turn a hero. I’ve been part of theatre productions before and have also done character roles in films. So, I was confident that I could play this role.I am from a theatre background and have experience in writing, acting, singing and dancing for multiple stage productions. So, multitasking comes easily to me.Mani and I have a great rapport. I'd write lyrics and then he would compose the tune. When writing Kannamuche, Mani asked me to sing the track so that he could record it later with the singers. However, after hearing me sing, he thought my voice worked well with Mythri Iyer, who sang the female’s part, and that I had done justice to the Mandya slang in the song. So, we decided to retain my voice for the track.There are some roles that I am sure will click with the audiences. I get an intuition when I am writing them. Chikkanna’s role in Raja Huli was one such role. I had told him back then that offers would pour in after that film and they did. He is one of the most popular performers in the Kannada industry. He trusts my writing and I know his prowess as an actor and comedian. When I narrated Sri Bharatha Baahubali, he came on board immediately.Cinema is my passion and is not a process that can be hurried. We have paid attention to every aspect of this movie. For example, there is a scene that is set in a sunflower field. We waited for three months to shoot the scene so that the flowers are in full bloom. Also, every person on board has been chosen after a lot of thought. Therefore, I have no regrets about the time this movie has taken. Thankfully, the producer too shared my passion, so it came out well.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73214081,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1003286/73214081.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-have-always-harboured-dreams-of-being-an-actor-manju-maandavya/articleshow/73214066.cms

9,['13/01/2020'],Railways comes to the rescue of government school,"When it was announced that the government higher primary school in Ashokpuram, Mysuru, which was established in 1936, was to be razed and rebuilt, given its dilapidated condition, uncertainty loomed over the future of the school’s nearly 60 wards’ education. Most of the children belong to the lower strata of society, and the lack of a school would have meant the end of the road for them, as far as academics is concerned. But there’s now a ray of hope, as the Railway workshop in Mysuru, which is in the vicinity of the school, has found a solution to this problem. On Saturday, four decommissioned railway coaches at the workshop were thrown open as a makeshift school for these kids. According to the school’s head mistress, HM Jayalakshmi, it was announced last year that the building would be demolished, and the new building would be up in a year. “Senior officials from the railway workshop came up with the idea of converting a few old coaches, which would have otherwise been sold for scrap metal, into classrooms,” she says.Apart from fresh coats of paint, the bogies were also worked on to create the concept of Nali-Kali (learn while you play). From information about the solar system to alphabets, numbers and more, the railway department has gone all out to create an ideal environment for these children. When the ‘new school’ was thrown open for the kids, they excitedly scampered in to see their classrooms for the next year. “Our train school will begin functioning this week,” adds Jayalakshmi.- Sridhar VG",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73214009,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-2085947/73214009.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/railways-comes-to-the-rescue-of-government-school/articleshow/73214038.cms
10,['13/01/2020'],"Actors are actors with talent; there is no yesteryear, veteran","For Sarath Kumar , 2020 has been earmarked for a number of film roles, among which are his reunion project with actress and his wife Radikaa Sarathkumar , Vaanam Kottatum, and Mani Ratnam ’s grand telling of Kalki’s saga Ponniyin Selvan . While the year does look promising, this is only just the beginning, the 65-year-old actor tells us with a warm smile, as we settled in for a chat at his office. Excerpts from the interview:She is such a refined actor. I would go on to add that Radikaa is one of the best actors this industry has seen. She plays all her roles with such conviction. Her growth in the industry is massive. In Vaanam Kottatum, Radikaa and I play a married couple. It is such a lovely script that it instantly drew me to it. I think our off-screen chemistry as a married couple definitely seeped into the characters as well. The camaraderie that we share definitely helped us flesh out our characters better.Mani Ratnam is a master storyteller. And Kalki’s Ponniyin Selvan is one of the most complex, yet detailed books I have come across. It is so detailed that each and every character in the book can have their own backstory.I cannot pick a favourite because all the characters are so well written— be it Nandini or Ponniyin Selvan or Pazhuvettaraiyar. Such a book needs very accurate and perceptive writing, which the project has achieved so beautifully. The book is an exciting saga of genres: It has comedy, action, romance and drama.The entire look and feel of the film has been confirmed. Once the crew comes back from their Bangkok schedule, Mani Ratnam will confirm the looks and I will mostly begin shooting in the next 15-20 days.I have read the book already. But I am now reading the 5-volume book once again. I am now in the middle of the third volume. I am going through the characterisation once again to refresh my mind. It has a huge scope to be filmed because the content is that vast. It will be a big film and will have an impact.When I did Suryavamsam, it was one of the most watched films at that time. The longevity of the film was such. Today, it’s quite tough to measure the longevity of a film. I think that is one of the ways in which films have changed over the years.Today, you have films like Robert De Nero’s The Irishman and Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce’s The Two Popes, both with the most seasoned actors from the industry, doing so well among audiences. When it comes to actors, there is nothing called yesteryear, current or veteran. Actors, at the end of the day, are actors with talent. The audience is ready to accept us if different stories are presented to them. This is something that the industry should collectively think about because I cannot just keep making films and star in it, too. They should start thinking about actors like Amitabh Bachchan in Piku and Pink. You can also tailor-make a film for an actor based on their strengths. Films like these could be made in a lesser budget and can still be a commercial success.It should change and I hope things look up this New Year. I am not trying to blame anybody. People do look at us and know how we have maintained ourselves and how we perform. That way, I am very grateful to Mani Ratnam for giving me Vaanam Kottatum and his next film (Ponniyin Selvan).We look at marketability instead of taking challenges in terms of good scripts. You see Clint Eastwood still making movies and people still want to watch him. People often think that commercial films will work based on saleable or popular heroes. If a film is entertaining and has something for the audience, it will definitely be a grosser.I have got all the ingredients to make it again and I will make it this year (smiles). Films need to be socially conscious, but also does not necessarily need to remind people of the past. It is time to live in the society as one, think about climate change and use the stars that are available here. Films like Kanchana took me to the new-age audiences. Stars like me, Vijayakanth and Sathyaraj are still there. Audiences’ appetite to see us on screen is still not satiated. People still need to start writing stories for us.A film on the court case of MR Radha is in the offing. It will be about two friends and will explore the story behind the shootout. Since biopics are in, I think this will make for a good story. We should also look at reinventing the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Even Kovalan and Kannagi’s story can be retold. If our values from the past are given a modern spin in films today, it will create a huge impact among audiences.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73214339,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-89473/73214339.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/actors-are-actors-with-talent-there-is-no-yesteryear-veteran/articleshow/73214339.cms

Most of the children belong to the lower strata of society, and the lack of a school would have meant the end of the road for them, as far as academics is concerned. But there’s now a ray of hope, as the Railway workshop in Mysuru, which is in the vicinity of the school, has found a solution to this problem. On Saturday, four decommissioned railway coaches at the workshop were thrown open as a makeshift school for these kids.According to the school’s head mistress, HM Jayalakshmi, it was announced last year that the building would be demolished, and the new building would be up in a year. “Senior officials from the railway workshop came up with the idea of converting a few old coaches, which would have otherwise been sold for scrap metal, into classrooms,” she says.Apart from fresh coats of paint, the bogies were also worked on to create the concept of Nali-Kali (learn while you play). From information about the solar system to alphabets, numbers and more, the railway department has gone all out to create an ideal environment for these children. When the ‘new school’ was thrown open for the kids, they excitedly scampered in to see their classrooms for the next year. “Our train school will begin functioning this week,” adds Jayalakshmi.- Sridhar VG",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73214009,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2085947,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/railways-comes-to-the-rescue-of-government-school/articleshow/73214007.cms

But did you know that Jiiva first met Srikkanth when he was a Class 8 student? “It was for a school project, and we were asked to interview one person who inspired us. I interviewed Chika (Srikkanth). It was in the year 1996, I think,” recollects Jiiva with a smile.83 traces the journey of Kapil Dev (played by Ranveer Singh) and also chronicles India’s historic win at the 1983 Cricket World Cup. Jiiva’s look as Srikkanth was released yesterday, and the first-look poster has been receiving rave reviews.“We didn’t do any prosthetics,” states Jiiva, “We only worked on the hairstyle and I grew a moustache. I was also shooting for my other Tamil films. So literally, Seeru film mudichuttu anga shoot panna odinen. Most of the actors had started training for their roles, but I couldn’t participate in the camp throughout.”So, how easy or difficult was it to become Srikkanth on screen for the film, which will also release in Tamil? “I’m a street player. If you’ve noticed boys who play gully cricket, you would have figured out how they always say there are going to bowl like Javagal Srinath or Waqar Younis or Wasim Akram. Many of my friends are batsmen and they used to say that they’d bat like Brian Lara or hold a stance like Sachin Tendulkar. In fact, most tennis ball cricketers play like Srikkanth; orey damaal dumeel dhan. So, I feel street cricketers can adapt to any style of batting or bowling,” explains the actor.Jiiva adds, “Yes, my bat lift was very different from Chika’s, and to help me understand how he would hold and bat, Balwinder Singh Sandhu sir came down from Mumbai. Since I couldn’t attend the training camp in Mumbai for the first three months, I used to practice in Chennai. My friend Vineet Padmanabhan is also a cricketer, and he used to help me with the game here. Balwinder sir used to send us videos and we’d also send him videos of what we did here. He’d tell me what corrections I had to make, and Kabir Khan (director) would also tell me if what I was doing was fine. It’s not like I transformed into Chika in just one day. I breathed this character and lived the role, and playing him perfectly was a big deal for me. But I was confident I could pull it off because I’ve had the opportunity to interact with him and I’ve followed his game.”The actor admits his confidence increased when Sunil Gavaskar came to the set once. “We were doing a take one day, just to see how everybody was in the frame. Gavaskar was silently observing the shot. He then called out on the mic and told me that I looked exactly like Chika,” he says, “Gundappa Viswanath sir, Gordon Greenidge and Clive Lloyd also said I resembled Chika.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73214361,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-581208/73214361.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/most-tennis-ball-cricketers-play-like-srikkanth-orey-damaal-dumeel-dhan-jiiva/articleshow/73214361.cms
15,['13/01/2020'],"SC recognises internet users' right, also formalises their accountability","This story is from January 13, 2020

Kashmiri journalists during a peaceful protest against the internet ban (File photo)

Internet services debuted in India on August 15, 1995, through Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited. It was a weird thing at the time as one had barely became familiar with the keyboard commands needed to operate a computer. Unfamiliar with the nature of the beast, offices had very few computers with internet connection and access to these were strictly monitored. The beast soon became beneficial and popular. In November 1998, the government allowed private players to provide internet services.

In two decades, internet became the busiest medium for dissemination of views, news and everything under the sun. The Supreme Court's nine-judge bench judgment in K S Puttaswamy case, which in August 2017 declared right to privacy to be part of right to life, paid handsome tributes to the internet and how it had become intrinsic to basic daily activities.

""Internet has become all pervasive as individuals spend more and more time online each day of their lives. Individuals connect with others and use the internet as means of communication. Internet is used to carry on business and to buy goods and services. Individuals browse the web in search of information, to send emails, use instant messaging services and to download movies,"" Justice D Y Chandrachud had said, while writing the main judgment in the privacy case.

""Online purchases have become an efficient substitute for the daily visit to the neighbouring store. Online banking has redefined relationships between bankers and customers. Online trading has created a new platform for the market in securities. Online music has refashioned the radio. Online books have opened up a new universe for the bibliophile. Th old-fashioned travel agent has been rendered redundant by web portals which provide everything from restaurants to resthouses, airline tickets to art galleries, museum tickets to music shows. These are but a few of the reasons people access the internet each day of their lives,"" he had said.

While dwelling on the benefits of internet, the SC had noted concerns about private players monitoring an individual's choices and preferences exercised online daily to create meta data that became the proverbial gold mine of personal information, which business houses were ready to buy at a premium for commercial exploitation.

The SC acknowledged how difficult it was to get out of the web of internet. ""The impact of the digital age results in information on the internet being permanent. Humans forget, but the internet does not forget and does not let humans forget. Any endeavour to remove information from the internet does not result in its absolute obliteration. The footprints remain. It is, thus, said that in the digital world, preservation is the norm and forgetting a struggle,"" the bench said.

So, when individuals are so direly dependent on the internet, its suspension obviously has a disrupting effect. If something like internet has become fundamental to daily activities of individuals, should access to internet, like access to water, be treated as a fundamental right? The SC dealt with this issue in its judgment last week while testing the validity of the decision to shut down internet in J&K after August 5, when the state was stripped of its special status and divided into two Union Territories.

Writing the judgment for a three-judge bench, Justice N V Ramana distinguished between internet as a tool and freedom of expression through the medium of internet. The SC did not examine whether access to internet is a fundamental right as the issue was not raised by petitioners.

However, it held that ""freedom of speech and expression through the medium of internet is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a)"", under which the Constitution treats it as a fundamental right.

Taking a cue from the Puttaswamy case, the Justice Ramana-led bench rightly said since internet has become a important tool for trade and commerce, ""freedom of trade and commerce through the medium of internet is also constitutionally protected under Article 19(1)(g)"".

The verdict made netizens erupt in joy. Well, the SC's ruling that freedom of speech and trade and commerce through the medium of internet is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) and (g) of the Constitution automatically circumscribes these rights by the restrictions prescribed under Article 19(2).

Before this judgment, fastening accountability on those making comments on social media fell in the grey area, except probably in defamation cases as we saw many proceedings being initiated against individuals who heaped charges against some during the 'Me Too' movement.

With the SC formalising right to expression through internet as a fundamental right, it gave the government and authorities a handle to impose restrictions on use of internet or suspend internet in a particular area if they apprehended that it was needed to protect sovereignty, integrity and security of the country; not to harm friendly relations with foreign countries; protect public order, decency, morality and dignity of courts, stop defamation or incitement to an offence.

An important change was brought about by the SC by ruling that orders suspending or restricting internet services must be based on doctrine of proportionality and could be done only as a last resort after examining all other options. Moreover, all orders suspending internet services have to be notified and reviewed periodically by the authorities. Additionally, these orders were made subject to judicial scrutiny.

What emerges from the SC judgment is - those exercising free speech on social media would be held accountable for their words if these fell foul any of the restrictions enumerated in Article 19(2) of the Constitution. ""Your right ends where my nose (or belly) begins,"" is an age-old adage which social media users must keep in mind before chirping in writing.

17,['13/01/2020'],Article 370: India hopeful of winning support of Democrats on Jammu and Kashmir,"This story is from January 13, 2020

J&K is under tight security since the abrogation of Article 370 (PTI)

NEW DELHI: While several Republicans in the US have publicly backed India's decision to revoke the special status of what was the state of J&K, many 'moderate' Democrat Congressmen too have reached out to the Indian government and have expressed understanding of India's position, according to senior Indian government sources. These Congressmen, said an official, are reluctant to speak out in public because of the 'ultra left-liberal flank' of the Democratic Party.

The six Congressmen to have spoken so far for India are all Republicans.

""The moderate elements within the Democratic Party, even if privately, have shown serious understanding of not just India’s position that the decision to amend Article 370 was meant to ensure economic opportunities and social justice but also the fact that Pakistan was exploiting the separatist sentiment in some areas of the Valley for perpetrating cross-border terrorism,"" claimed a senior official.

Many top Democrats, including presidential hopefuls like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have publicly expressed concern about the situation in J&K. While Sanders had described India’s actions as unacceptable, Warren had called for India to show respect for the rights of Kashmiri people.

After the Indian mission outreach led by ambassador Harsh Vardhan Shringla, official sources said, more Congressmen are said to be considering making statements in support of India’s position. Shringla returns to India this week to take charge as foreign secretary later this month.

Congressman Scott Perry last week became the 6th leader from the Republican Party to express support for India on the J&K issue. Perry is a 4th-term Congressman from Pennsylvania and is a member of important House Committees like Foreign Affairs and Transportation & Infrastructure.

“I stand with India in their aspiration to provide equal economic, social, and political opportunities to all citizens. As part of this pursuit, two-thirds of the Indian Parliament voted last year to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir. This vote allowed the government of India to address the stagnant economy and high youth unemployment plaguing the region by providing economic opportunity and sound governance. The residents of Jammu and Kashmir have battled economic depression and forces of extremism and radicalization for too long. The regional stability now provided by government will give residents of Jammu and Kashmir a better way forward and hope for the future,"" Perry was quoted as having said. In March, 2019, Perry had introduced a resolution in the House to condemn the Pulwama terror attack.

Other Congressmen who have publicly backed India include Francis Rooney and Joe Wilson, both members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Speaking in the House, Wilson had said that India’s decision was meant to ""boost economic development, fight corruption and end gender, caste and religious discrimination"".

Congressmen Pete Olson, Paul Gosar and George Holding are the three others who have endorsed India’s position in public. The first Congressman to issue a statement on J&K, Holding had said that while Article 370 might have worked well for 'those with political connections,’ it denied economic opportunities for the people and that it also created a polarizing environment that was exploited politically.

""These are all very influential people in their own right. Holding is a member of House Ways and Means Committee which is the oldest committee of the US Congress. Gosar is the Chair of the House Committee on natural resources,"" said the official.

18,['13/01/2020'],Those who raise anti-national slogans will be sent to jail: Amit Shah,"This story is from January 13, 2020

BHOPAL: Those who raise slogans against India will be sent behind bars, BJP president and Union home minister Amit Shah said at a rally in Jabalpur on Sunday, his first since CAA came into force. A ‘sky-high’ Ram Mandir will be built in Ayodhya in just four months, he announced.

“Some students raised anti-India slogans, ‘Bharat tere tukde honge ek hazar, Inshallah Inshallah’ at JNU. Shouldn’t they be put in jail? Those who would raise anti-national slogans will be sent behind bars,” said Shah at the CAA outreach rally.

The BJP chief challenged Congress to stop construction of Ram temple. “Should Ram temple be constructed or not? Congress leader and advocate Kapil Sibal said it should not be built. Sibal bhai, stop it if you can. A sky-high Ram temple is going to come up within the next four months.”

Shah challenged Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee to point out a single provision in CAA that can take away any Indian’s citizenship.

“Congress and opposition parties are misleading the nation on CAA and instigating minorities,” he alleged, adding: “After Independence, Congress divided the country on the basis of religion. Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis and Jains, who lived in both East and West Pakistan wanted to return, but they stayed because of the bloodshed. The leaders of our country had assured them that they will be welcomed here and given the citizenship whenever they want.”

Justifying CAA, Shah said, “After Partition, there were 30% Hindus in both East and West Pakistan. Today, there are just 3% Hindus in Pakistan and 7% Hindus in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). I want to ask the blind and deaf Congress leaders, where have the Hindus, Sikh, Sindhi brothers gone? Where have Machhua (fishermen) of Bangladesh vanished?”

“Mahatma Gandhi had said, they were citizens of India and would be welcomed here when they want to return. The then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru had also promised to give them Indian citizenship, but Congress is running away from the promise. We will do everything for them. Those who were being tormented will be rehabilitated here. Congress should open its ears and listen. Do whatever you can. We will give citizenship to all of them,” Shah emphasised.

The home minister also raised the issue of human rights violations in Pakistan and said, “Atrocities are being committed in Pakistan on minorities. Gurudwara Nanakana Sahib was attacked and the daughter of the Granthi kidnapped. What is happening there? Why is Congress not raising this matter?”

Shah also quoted the election manifesto of Rajasthan Congress, which promises to provide citizenship to Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan. “Now, Congress is refusing. The party is misleading the public. I would like to assure that there is no provision of taking back citizenship of any Indian citizen,” he said.

Accusing Congress of propagating lies, Shah said: “We will tell the public how Mamata Banerjee, Kejriwal and Rahul Baba are spreading false information. We will contact more than 3 crore people under the awareness drive. BJP has committed to finish some tasks since 1950. Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji has completed those tasks.”

Congress opposes every move taken by the BJP-led NDA government, he said. “Congress is opposing every decision, from Article 370, 35A, to Ram temple, triple talaq, surgical strike, air strike, and now citizenship law. For vote bank politics, Congress is singing the tune of Pakistan and Imran on every issue. I urge Congress to return from the wrong path. It should understand the feelings of the public else, you (Congress) will be completely wiped out,” said Shah.

The BJP president also hit out at Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath for refusing to implement CAA. “Nath should not talk loud. Instead, he should focus on MP. The state has already been handed over to liquor and sand mafia. We are searching for gaushalas that Congress had promised in MP but couldn’t see a single one. Farmers who have been cheated in the name of loan waiver are demanding bonus on wheat. If you have the strength, then come on the (election) ground. Public makes mistake once, not every time. We will trounce you by two-thirds majority,” claimed Shah.

The BJP chief lauded former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and said people still remember the government he led in MP. MP BJP chief Rakesh Singh, leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava and Union minister Faggan Singh Kulaste were also at the rally.

But Lohri remains largely untouched. A few notable exceptions are 'Lo Aa Gayi Lohri' from 'Veer Zaara', 'Charha De Rang' from 'Yamla Pagla Deewana', and most recently 'Laal Ghagra' from 'Good Newwz'. Songs like 'Tu Kamaal Di' ('Son of Sardaar') and 'Chappa Chappa' ('Maachis') were picturised during Lohri celebrations in the films but aren't Lohri songs per se.Singer Harshdeep Kaur says that she is surprised that there are no Lohri songs even in the Punjabi music industry. She tells us, ""It is really surprising that we don't have any Lohri specific song. The only song that I remember and used to hear in my childhood was 'Sundar Mundariye' (Punjabi folk song). My parents would sing this song and tell us ki Lohri ka yahi ek gaana hota hai.""However, that lack of songs never threatens to dampen the Lohri spirits in Delhi's famous Lohri parties. It is a festival of music and dance and revellers from the capital say they find substitutes in some evergreen Punjabi songs, both folk and pop. Sukhdeep Singh from Rajouri Garden says, ""It doesn't matter if there are no songs on Lohri. The Lohri parties and get together are all about dancing and having fun. Aur woh toh mahaul banne ke baad kissi bhi Punjabi gaane pe ho hi jaata hai.”While Punjabi folk songs are eternal favourites of people, several pop songs have also remained Lohri staples over the years. The frontrunners are the tracks sung by legendary singers Gurdas Maan and Surinder Kaur. “I don’t remember a Lohri party in the last 20 years without someone dancing to 'Lathe Di Chadar' or 'Chhalla'. They might not be about Lohri but for me, these are my Lohri songs,” says Delhi-based homemaker Tavleen.Charha De Rang: Sung by Ali Pervez Mehdi, Shweta Pandit, Mahalakshmi Iyer and Rahul Seth, the romantic song has been picturised during Lohri.Other retro Punjabi hits that have sustained their popularity include 'Jind Maahi Baaj Tere' and Naseebo Lal’s 'Dhola Ve Dhola'. Harshdeep tells us, ""Surinder Kaur ji and Gurdas Mann ji ke gaano ke bina our Lohri is incomplete. We sing songs jisme sabka involvement ho, like 'Jind Mahi Baaj Tere', 'Kamli Yaar Di', 'Dhola Ve Dhola'. Whenever I'm performing at a Lohri festival, I am asked to sing 'Katiya Karun' a lot, maybe because it has a festive vibe and is a folk song.""Gallan Goodiyan: Rendered by Shankar Mahadevan , Yashita Sharma, Manish Kumar Tipu, Farhan Akhtar, Sukhwinder Singh , this song in the movie brings several generations together and has since become a favourite for family gatherings and festivities.There are (relatively) newer songs in demand too, particularly among the younger crowd. Apart from the aforementioned 'Katiya Karun', songs like 'Kala Sha Kala', 'Tutak Tutak Tutiya', and 'Gallan Goodiyan' remain popular. Ashutosh Sharma, a west Delhi resident who organises a Lohri party in his locality every year, says, ""The older generation listens to songs that they had when they were growing up. Our generation, similarly, listens to songs from our childhood, such as 'Tutak Tutak Tutiya' or 'Gallan Goodiyan'.""

Improved affordability of stents has resulted in a 30-40% increase in usage and local manufacturers have gained market share at the expense of imports with a jump in volume to over 60% from 35% in 2016-17, industry data showed.Price regulation has also allowed better margins to Indian companies even as locally made, lower-priced products gain in the market, helping local players increase revenues. The share of Indian companies in terms of value has increased from 30% in 2016-17 to over 55% in 2019-20.On the other hand, with pressure on their margins, MNCs - particularly those selling expensive stents imported from the US - have faced a significant decline in market share from around 70% to nearly 45% in terms of value in last three years, after government capped prices of stents in February 2017.Currently, the Indian stent market is pegged at around Rs 1,500 crore, growing at around 15-18% annually. The change in market share volumes and revenues came about after the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) imposed a price cap on stents, reducing prices by up to 85%. Subsequently, the regulator also capped the trade margin on stents at 8% which included distributors, retailers and stockists and even hospitals.After a few revisions in last three years, a bare metal stent (BMS) is currently priced at Rs 8,261, while a drug eluting stent (DES) costs Rs 30,080. There have been reports of hospitals finding ways to up the costs through other charges but the use - and therefore accessibility - of stents seems to have gone up.Industry executives describe the price capping as a ""game changer and breakthrough"", helping consumers as well as Indian companies struggling to make their mark. While before the price cap, MNCs were able to market products tagging them as ""superior in quality"" and had better margins to push through multiple trade channels, price regulation helped level the field for Indian firms.""Indian drug eluting stents have gained 25% additional market post price revision. It has also enabled domestic companies to spend more efforts in R&D and clinical trials which has improved their market competitiveness,"" said Gurmit Singh Chugh, chief executive of Translumina.Three Indian manufacturers - Translumina, Meril and SMT - together control around 45% of the domestic share. There are around seven more Indian companies manufacturing stents.""The cap on margins helped Indian companies because they were already selling at a significantly lower price than imported counterparts. Besides, 65% of the business for local companies came directly through hospitals, whereas MNCs were giving huge margins to distributors. The price cap consolidated the trade margin and disrupted the traditional model. This protected manufacturers by rationalising trade margins,"" a senior executive said.However, even with a reduced market share, volume of imported products has increased because of improved affordability, indicating some gains for them too in an expanding market. Data showed the average number of coronary stents implanted per person has increased from 1.2 to 1.5 in the last three years.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73219652,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34237,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/after-price-cap-local-stent-makers-capture-60-of-market/articleshow/73219650.cms

GUWAHATI: Opposition leader in Assam assembly Debabrata Saikia on Saturday asked CM Sarbananda Sonowal to quit BJP along with his MLAs and form an alternate government in the state with support from Congress.

Saikia said the new government will be ""anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act"" and ""anti-BJP"".

A day after the Union home ministry issued a gazette notification that the CAA will come into force from January 10, Saikia said if Sonowal along with his MLAs quits BJP, his party will support them to ensure that a new government is formed with Sonowal as the chief minister. ""In view of the current situation in Assam, Sonowal should leave BJP and come out with just 30 of his MLAs as Independents. We will support him to form a new anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act and anti-BJP government in Assam. He will be made the chief minister again,"" he said.

""BJP and its alliance partner Asom Gana Parishad have failed to keep their poll promises. Many of the ministers and MLAs who had joined BJP from All Assam Students Union had promised to implement the Assam Accord .""

""Let them revolt against the central BJP for their unwillingness to implement the accord and come out of BJP and we will support them to form an alternative government,"" Saikia suggested. Asked if Sonowal will continue to be the chief minister in the alternative government, the Congress leader said: ""We have no opposition to it. Sonowal is facing the wrath of the people for supporting the CAA. The MLAs and ministers who love Assam must quit the saffron party and stand with the people of Assam. That is why I am making this proposal,"" Saikia said.

After the Rajya Sabha passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill on December 11 last year, massive protests erupted in Assam and have continued across the state with people demanding that the Act be repealed.

The people of Assam have termed the CAA as anti-secular and a threat to their existence, language and culture as it will grant citizenship to refugees from neighbouring Bangladesh who have settled in the state.

27,['13/01/2020'],Over 200 academics write to PM against ‘Left role’,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Several university campuses have seen protests against a host of issues like CAA

NEW DELHI: More than 200 academicians, including vice-chancellors of universities, have written to PM Narendra Modi blaming a “small coterie of Left-wing activists” for the deteriorating academic environment in the country.

“We observe with dismay that in the name of student politics, a disruptive far-Left agenda is being pursued. The recent turn of events in campuses from JNU to Jamia, from AMU to Jadavpur alarms us to the deteriorating academic environment due to the shenanigans of a small coterie of Left-wing activists,” they wrote.

The signatories to the statement include Hari Singh Gour University VC R P Tiwari, Central University of South Bihar VC HCS Rathore and Sardar Patel University VC Shirish Kulkarni, among others, according to official sources. It is titled ‘Statement against Left-wing anarchy in educational institutions’.

The statement by 208 academicians, issued on Saturday, is being seen as part of the ruling dispensation's efforts to mobilise support in academia after it faced flak from a section of the intelligentsia over protests in certain universities over a host of issues, including the Citizenship Amendment Act and the recent violence on the JNU campus.

Taking on Left-leaning groups, the statement said it had become difficult to organise public talks or speak independently due to the “censorship imposed by Left-wing politics”.

Strikes, dharnas and shutdowns over maximalist demands were common in Left strongholds and personal targeting, public slandering and harassment for not conforming to the Left ideology were on the rise, the academicians wrote to Modi.

The worst sufferers of this kind of politics were poor students and those from marginalised communities, the statement said.

“They (these students) lose out on the opportunity to learn and build a better future for themselves. They also lose out on the freedom to articulate their own views and alternative politics. They find themselves constrained to conform to the majoritarian Left politics. We appeal to all democratic forces to come together and stand for academic freedom, freedom of speech and plurality of thoughts,” it added.

NEW DELHI: Accidents on expressways in India claimed 1,253 lives during 2018, which was little over 5% more than the fatalities registered during in the previous year. While expressways in Uttar Pradesh registered maximum number road deaths at 764 in 2018 as compared to 629 in 2017, Maharashtra and Gujarat recorded sharp declines in such fatalities on high speed corridors.

According to the latest report of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), maximum fatalities on expressways were reported in Uttar Pradesh contributing 61% deaths followed by Maharashtra (8.5%), Gujarat (7.5%), West Bengal (5%) and Jharkhand (4.4%) during 2018. Jharkhand and Odisha recorded steep decline in such fatalities.

Like the expressways in UP, such roads in West Bengal, Haryana and Assam saw more fatalities during 2018 as compared to 2017. Haryana, which added 135 km of Western Peripheral Expressway in 2018, saw 37 fatalities as compared to 25 in 2017. In Assam, 22 persons died in 2018 against only one fatality during the previous year.

Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Meghalaya registered 18, 34 and 14 deaths on expressways in 2018 while there was not a single fatality during 2017 in these states.

“The overall numbers have gone up as more and more expressway stretches are being made operational. But it’s also a challenge to ensure that such stretches become safe for commuters,” admitted a government official. Roads that are access-controlled are also treated as expressways. Such stretches have increased in the past couple of years.

Sources said the fatalities have reduced in Maharashtra because of the safety interventions by the state PWD on Mumbai-Pune expressway.

Indian cricket ’s first lady Anushka Sharma got a taste of hubby Virat Kohli ’s on-field life at the floodlit Eden Gardens late on Saturday evening when she shot for a teaser of an upcoming Jhulan Goswami biopic. The film, tentatively titled Chakdah Express, is being directed by Prosit Roy of Pari fame.

The actress, who is playing the former Team India captain and all-rounder in the film, reached the city around 5 pm and the stadium, around 7 pm. She was reportedly greeted there by Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) officials with a bouquet of flowers, sweets and mishti doi. Also part of the shoot were 10 real-life women cricketers, who had been rehearsing the shots since evening. Jhulan, too, had reached the ground early.

A source close to the unit told us that it was a test shoot that may be used to create a teaser for the film. “The sequence shows Jhulan (Anushka) enter the field with her team to play a match. The production house was also very choosy about the 10 other players. They wanted them to be actual cricketers, between 5'3"" and 5'4"" in height,” the source added.

Anushka entered the ground dressed in the Team India blues around 9.30 pm. She interacted with the director and the other players and took tips from Jhulan before the shoot began. “Jhulan has a particular way of walking and Anushka practised that along with her. She also sported a similar hairstyle. And the two of them have a similar physical structure too,” the source added.

Beauty Chakraborty, a former Bengal cricketer who is now an umpire, was part of the 10-member team at the shoot. “Anushka was very friendly during the shoot. She seemed extremely grounded and very particular about everything. Apart from her bowling action, Anushka constantly rehearsed the walking and warm-up style with Jhulandi,” she said.

While the team shot on till 5 am, Anushka packed up around 4 am and flew back to Mumbai on Sunday morning.

NEW DELHI: ""India was the first country with which we signed a strategic partnership. But beyond that, there is a people-to-people relationship, shared culture and values. This relationship is very strong and goes back thousands of years and nothing can destroy it,"" said Naheed Esar , Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister who was in the country last week to open Afghanistan's second consulate in Hyderabad .

Afghanistan is yet to get a final result of its elections, which add to the political uncertainty and has a big bearing on the peace process. India has insisted the peace process must be ""Afghan-owned and Afghan-led"". Esar said the September 2019 elections were the fourth, but the first which were Afghan-owned. ""We introduced a biometric system this time. I see it as a very successful election process with two million Afghans voting despite security challenges,"" she told TOI.

""The idea is to expand the relationship between the two countries further. We want to further expand our presence. We have a diaspora in Hyderabad, as well as about 3,000 Afghan students. Hyderabad is one of the main centres for India-Afghan trade. We're trying to move from an aid-dependent to trading nation,"" she added.

A key part of the peace process has been the concern that women, after 18 years, should not roll back the gains that they have seen. ""When I was a child, I watched an Indian movie called 'Phoolan Devi'. There was a sentence (in it) which talked about freedom and rights,"" Esar said.

Trichy: Senior BJP leader Pon Radhakrishnan came down heavily on the ruling and opposition parties in the state at Ariyalur on Sunday for not debating the death of special-sub inspector of police Y Wilson, who was shot dead at Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district on January 8. The BJP leader, who was at Ariyalur for the BJP district-level functionaries’ meet, claimed that a war has been declared on Tamil Nadu police through the murder.

“We have been reading in newspapers that Muslim terrorists belonging to Tamil Nadu were arrested in Kerala and Gujarat. I have been telling that Tamil Nadu is a training ground for terrorists since Jayalalithaa’s period and I stand by that even now. Strong action should be taken against such terrorists,” the former union minister said.

Recalling the death of SSI in Kanyakumari district, who was shot dead on duty near a police check post, the former state BJP president said that the opposition parties including DMK should have discussed the murder in the ongoing assembly session. “Neither the ruling party nor the opposition parties discussed the murder of a policeman in the state assembly. I am not blaming the government but is the value of a policeman’s life just Rs 1 crore? At least, DMK should have condemned the murder,” Radhakrishnan said. The BJP leader sought for a thorough inquiry about the background of the murder to safeguard the Tamil Nadu people.tnn

MUMBAI: Troubled billionaire Anil Ambani-led Reliance Home Finance ( RHF ) and Reliance Commercial Finance ( RCF ) on Sunday said forensic auditor Grant Thornton has given the two companies a clean chit relating to various allegations. These included diversion or siphoning of funds, embezzlement, mala fide operations, falsification of accounts, fraudulent transactions and frauds by its promoters.

Grant Thornton was roped in by lenders of the two subsidiaries of Reliance Capital ( RCap ) in August 2019 as part of the debt-resolution process. The two companies separately informed the bourses about the forensic auditor’s findings through releases having similar contents.

“We have neither come across any instance of fraud by the company, or any fraud on the company by its officers or employees,” the reports by the auditor were quoted as saying in both the releases by the two companies.

Based on completion of the forensic audit, the companies have now requested its bankers to proceed on a fast-track basis with the debt resolution plan under ‘change of management and control’ in the overall interests of all lenders, the companies said.

Meanwhile, commuters said vehicles move at a snail’s pace due to potholes created by the construction works

PATNA: Commuters are facing problems while passing through several ongoing infrastructure project sites in the state capital.

Though the upcoming projects like R Block-Digha Road , Lohia Path Chakra and widening of Danapur-Saguna Mor are set to change the urban landscape of the city, the residents and commuters are having a harrowing time in passing through these stretches nowadays.

Residents of Rajiv Nagar and other areas connected with the under construction R Block-Digha road are annoyed with frequent and prolonged snarls at the erstwhile Rajiv Nagar railway crossing where a flyover is being constructed under the project.

Rajiv Nagar resident Chandan Kumar said he was stuck in a traffic snarl between the erstwhile railway crossing and Rajiv Nagar drain for more than two hours on Saturday evening. “My car along with hundreds of other vehicles, including an ambulance, was stuck in a jam for nearly two hours in the evening. This is basically due to flyover construction and parking of vehicles engaged in the construction work near the site. There is hardly any space for the vehicles to move and the situation worsens during the evening hours,” he said.

Bihar State Road Development Corporation (BSRDC) managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said that the R Block-Digha road will be ready by June and will provide much respite and better connectivity to people on this stretch.

The construction works make traffic movement slow in several other areas connected with Bailey Road, R-Block and Saguna Mor. Residents of several localities, including Khagaul, Danapur, Bailey Road and Saguna Mor claimed that they face frequent traffic jams due to damage or absence of road dividers on the road in between DRM office and Saguna Mor.

“Trrafic snarl between Saguna Mor and Danapur railway station has become a regular feature because of ongoing road widening works and trucks parked on either side of the road. At times, it takes more than an hour to cover this stretch of around 3km,” said Vikas Ranjan, a local resident.

Agarwal, who is also the Patna divisional commissioner, said that issues leading to snarls and accidents on Saguna Mor-Danapur road are being removed. “Proper dividers are being installed. No unauthorized cuts will be kept on this road in order to ensure public safety and avoid road mishaps. Also, proper dividers are being constructed,” he said.

Similarly, the ongoing construction work on Lohia Path Chakra project causes slow traffic movement on the stretch of Bailey Road between Lalit Bhavan and Hartali Mor. The stretch towards BPSC office has been closed for construction of an underpass. In a bid to ease vehicular congestion, one flank of elevated road in front of Lalit Bhavan was opened for vehicular movement on Thursday.

Similarly, the 1.27km-long R Block flyover from Mithapur ROB to Bhikhari Thakur ROB on Hardinge Road via R-Block remains chock-a-block throughout the day. Vehicular movement on the two flanks of the flyover was supposed to begin from December last year, but it has been delayed by at least a month.

Meanwhile, commuters said vehicles move at a snail’s pace due to potholes created by the construction works. “The roads are not just damaged but they also have potholes. I get stuck in traffic at R-Block almost everyday,” said Zeeshan, a resident of Anisabad.

State road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav said the problem will be solved with completion of works on flyover sites this year.

Rivers are facing threats from pollution and encroachments.

38,['13/01/2020'],NHAI seeks six weeks time to fill potholes on NH-83,"This story is from January 13, 2020

GAYA: Drawing flak for its failure to convert NH-83 linking the state capital with Grand Trunk Road into four-lane highway, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) on Saturday assured members of the district-level monitoring and coordination committee that all the potholes would be filled in the next six weeks. The NH is 127km long.

The committee reviewed the execution of development projects at the Gaya collectorate. District magistrate Abhishek Singh, ex-officio secretary of the committee, presided over the meet. According to a press release issued by the district public relations department, Sherghati MLA Vinod Prasad Yadav raised the issue of potholes that have made the road virtually unmotorable. Most of the motorists, it may be recalled now prefer taking the much longer (about 20km longer) routes via Tekari and Khizarsarai to skip the accident prone potholes all along the NH-83.

Earlier, Patna high court Chief Justice Sanjay Karol during his visit on December 16, had to leave behind his vehicle in Gaya and return to the state capital by train to avoid the potholes. The CJ subsequently constituted a committee of senior lawyers to ascertain the facts about the road condition.

During the Saturday meet, the NHAI representative said that potholes are being filled on a priority basis and the job will be completed by the end of February 2020. The participants were also informed that the four-laning job has been now split in three parts. Separate agencies will execute the job district wise. The road criss crosses three districts—Gaya, Jehanabad and Patna. The biggest chunk, about 56 km (between Dobhi and Belaganj) of the 127 km long stretch falls in Gaya district.

As per the available facts, the NHAI on April 24, 2014 awarded the contract to IL&FS Engineering & Construction Company Limited for executing the four-laning project of NH-83. Less than 20% of the work was done when the construction company backed off. The NHAI had fixed April 9, 2018 as the deadline for the construction job. The project was estimated to cost Rs 2015 crore.

Besides four-laning of the 127 km stretch between Dobhi and Patna, the company was to construct 11 major bridges, 17 minor bridges, three service roads, three road overbridge and 218 culverts. Japan International Cooperation agency is funding the project.

According to a Delhi datelined report published in this newspaper on 13 May 2019, on account of severe resource crunch, several NHAI projects were being shelved. The report further said that in the current financial year, the NHAI proposes to take up work for only 4 km in Bihar .

PATNA: Police on Sunday arrested a youth for his alleged involvement in the murder of the owner of a veterinary medicine shop, Shailendra Kumar Singh (48), who was shot dead on a moving bike near Gulzarbagh railway station under the Alamganj police station area in Patna City around 11pm on Saturday over a financial dispute.

The arrested youth was identified as Guddu Kumar (25), a resident of Maheshpur village under the Mehendiganj police station area in Patna City. Singh was also the native of the same village. The incident took place when Singh was returning home on a motorcycle after closing his shop on Govind Mitra Road here.

Patna City SDPO Manish Kumar said the shooters, who were riding parallel to Singh, suddenly opened fire from a close range. “The bullet pierced through Singh’s waist and he fell down on the road. Though he was rushed to Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH), the doctors declared him brought dead,” the SDPO said, adding no empty cartridge was recovered from the spot.

Kumar said initial investigations revealed that Singh was killed over a financial dispute. “The victim had given Rs 22 lakh to Guddu and some other people close to him for buying a plot. However, the plot was not bought and money also not returned to Singh,” the SDPO said.

He said Sunny, who was also named in the FIR along with Guddu, is still at large. The FIR was lodged by the victim’s mother at Alamganj police station.

SHO of Alamganj police station Sudhir Kumar said some other people were also under scanner. “It has come to light that Singh had taken money from someone else and handed it over to Guddu to buy a plot. Efforts are on to identify the others involved in the financial deal with Singh,” the SHO added.

41,['13/01/2020'],Western disturbance brings mercury down,"This story is from January 13, 2020

PATNA: The city reeled under intense cold on Sunday as the minimum temperature touched 8.4 degrees Celsius and the maximum declined to 15.2 degrees Celsius. According to weathermen, the prevailing biting cold conditions will prevail in the city at least till the next 24 hours.

The chill in air, according to weathermen, was the result of a western disturbance in East Iran and adjoining Afghanistan, which led to snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. It brought a northerly and chilly component to the westerly winds blowing over Bihar and led to drop in temperatures.

The weather bulletin issued by Patna Meteorological Centre on Sunday stated that dry weather prevailed across Bihar and moderate to dense fog occurred at one or two places on Sunday. “The highest maximum and lowest minimum temperatures of 20.6 degrees Celsius and 5 degrees Celsius were recorded in Bhagalpur and Dehri during the day,” it said.

According to the bulletin, there will be no significant change in night temperature over the next two days.

Skymet Weather’s bulletin stated that moderate to dense fog prevailed at scattered places in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, north Jharkhand and northeastern states. “The minimum temperatures will remain below normal by 3-4 degrees Celsius in the eastern parts of the country, including Bihar,” it said.

The western disturbance, which lies near Afghanistan, is moving towards east-northeastwards. However, its cyclonic circulation will have minimal impact in Bihar, the weathermen said.

Anand Shankar, acting director of Patna Meteorological Centre, said minimum temperature across the state will remain in the range 7-12 degrees Celsius till January 16. Thereafter, the minimum and maximum temperatures will rise, he added.

PATNA: Though Patna recorded the highest rate of murder among 19 metropolitan cities in the country and the state saw 15% rise in crime against women in 2018 when compared to the previous year as per the latest data released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar presented a brave face on Sunday, saying Bihar’s position is relatively same in terms of cognizable offence when compared to other states and union territories in the country.

According to NCRB figure, 4.4 murders were recorded per one lakh population in Patna in 2018.

Kumar held a joint press briefing with ADG (law and order) Amit Kumar at the state police headquarters on Sunday to throw light on state’s crime scenario.

He said the Bihar’s ‘murder crime rate’ improved from 2.7 in 2017 to 2.5 in 2018, bringing the state to 11th position from 9th position in the country.

CHANDRAPUR: Forest officials have arrested two persons from Mudjha village in connection with the suspected poaching of an adult tiger in South Bramhapuri forest range. The arrested persons, identified as Bajirao Mashakhetri and Rakesh Zade, were produced before the JMFC court in Mul. The court remanded them to forest custody remand till January 20.

The mutilated body of the tiger was found in compartment no. 1179 of the range on Saturday morning. The tiger’s head, all four paws and tail were missing. A partially eaten carcass of a cow was also found at some distance from the body.

Even as the post mortem finding remained inconclusive, foresters suspect that the tiger died after eating the cow carcass that was poisoned by the accused. It is not clear whether the tiger had killed the cow or the carcass was dumped in the forest by the cow’s owner after it died a natural death.

After questioning people from Mudjha village, cow owner Mashakhetri and shepherd Zade were arrested for allegedly beheading the tiger and chopping off its paws and tail. The duo has not yet been booked for poaching as the cause of death is yet to be ascertained. Forensic test report of viscera is awaited, said sources.

Forest officials have recovered the tiger’s head and couple of paws from the places identified by Mashakhetri and Zade. Canines removed from tiger’s jaws and nails removed from the recovered paws are yet to be found. Two other paws and tail is still missing. Cops suspect involvement of more persons in the case.

44,['13/01/2020'],MMC begins night patrolling to catch nocturnal litterers,"This story is from January 13, 2020

The MMC had introduced the garbage sentinel scheme in June 2019.

MARGAO: Faced with the daunting task of eliminating dark spots of garbage from across the city, chief officer of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) Ajit Panchwadkar has begun ‘ night vigils’ to rein in unscrupulous elements found dumping waste on the roadsides under the cover of darkness.

The municipality’s night vigil squad led by Panchwadkar went round the city until well past midnight on Friday and Saturday and caught several persons red-handed dumping waste. On Friday and Saturday, the municipality imposed fines of over Rs 4,600 for unauthorised dumping of waste at prohibited places , Panchwadkar said.

The latest exercise aimed at targetting such offenders comes less than six months after the MMC’s garbage sentinel scheme introduced by Panchwadkar’s predecessor Siddhivinayak Naik came a cropper.

The MMC had introduced the garbage sentinel scheme in June 2019. The scheme envisaged penalising violators after identifying them from photographs/videos captured by the sentinels, who were to be awarded from municipal funds- but the scheme was abruptly withdrawn as the response was poor.

While the MMC has improved waste segregation at source, dark spots, like the stretch from the powerhouse junction at Aquem to the railway station, which does not have streetlights, continue to be a hurdle on the garbage management front.

Representative image

PATNA: The Bihar Chemists and Druggists Association on Sunday called a three-day statewide strike from January 22 to 24 against the alleged harassment and exploitation by drug inspectors in the name of shop inspection.

Association president PK Singh said the decision to keep shops across the state shut for three days was taken in the executive body meeting held at Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries in Patna on Sunday.

Singh told TOI over phone that for first time shops selling emergency and life-saving drugs near hospitals and other places would also remain closed. “We would write to state government to make arrangements for emergency and life-saving drugs on its own for people during the strike period,” he said.

Singh said there are hardly 7,500 pharmacists in the state as against around 35,000 drugstores. “Despite being aware of the situation that every shop can’t have a pharmacist, drugstore licences are suspended during inspection by drug inspectors. It is government only which had given licence to 35,000 drugstores,” he said, adding the government must take a decision so that drug retailers and wholesalers are not harassed for lack of pharmacists.

The association president said the government must also issue uniform guidelines for all drugstores on issues like serial numbers on bills or display board size outside shop as drug inspectors define it in their own suitable way because Drugs and Cosmetics Act is of pre-independence era.

“Drugstores should be given at least a chance to rectify any small shortcomings instead of suspending their licences,” he said.

Singh also said there are four pharmacy colleges in Bihar. “Even if they produce 100% result, only 240 persons with diploma in pharmacy would be produced every two years. They don’t want to work in rural areas. It’s also virtually impossible for small-time shopowners to hire pharmacist on minimum Rs10,000 monthly remuneration,” he said.

It’s time that state government learns from the Uttar Pradesh government which took steps to train drugstore owners amid similar scarcity of pharmacists. “There are around 75,000 drugstores in UP,” he said.

“If state government takes initiative to train shopowners here, our association would bear all financial expenditures. We are also ready to give written undertaking to the government for not demanding any job after training,” he said.

Singh also said there is no authorized information centre of health department to display whose licences got suspended, cancelled or restored on daily basis. “If a retailer from rural area, with suspended or cancelled licence, reaches Govind Mitra Road to purchase medicines, there is no way for the wholesaler to know that and deny him the drugs. Most of the time, drugs are sold in similar condition and later wholesalers face action,” he said.

Sushil Kumar Modi

PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said on Sunday that the state government will frame law to stop water exploitation in the state.

Addressing the students, experts and professors at the concluding ceremony of three-day 52nd annual conference of Indian Water Works Association (IWWA) at NIT-Patna, Modi said that the entire world has been struggling with the water crisis and the state government will soon bring Bihar Groundwater Conservation Bill in the assembly.

Modi recounted that the state government provided water tanks to several districts, including Darbhanga, Saran and Vaishali, during summer because of water crisis. “Water crisis is a global issue because we can’t produce water in lab and factory. IWWA will have to work on cheaper technology to modify and reuse wastewater. We have to recharge the groundwater, do rainwater harvesting and save every single drop of water,” he said.

He also pointed out that an estimated 75% of the untreated sewage water of households is discharged directly into river.

Modi, who holds environment, forest and climate change department, said the central government is to spent Rs3.5 lakh crore for Jal Shakti Mission to provide drinking water to every household by 2024 and the state government is ensuring the supply of tap water to every household by March 2020 with an expenditure to the tune of Rs29,000 crore.

He blamed the previous policymakers for the uncontrolled extraction of groundwater and said water was misused in Punjab for paddy plantation and instates like Karnataka for promotion of cane crop. As a result, the water level went deep down. “Also due to free electricity, water was misused badly. Now the water level in Punjab has gone 600 to 700 feet down. There is acute water scarcity in Chennai and some other big cities,” Modi said.

PHED secretary Jitendra Shrivastava, IWWA president Dineshwar Prasad Singh, coordinator Nityanand Singh Maurya, NIT-P director PK Jain and programme coordinator DP Singh were present at the concluding ceremony.

KOLKATA: The epicentre of protest against CAA and NRC shifted from Esplanade to Park Circus on Sunday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took an aerial route over the city and flew out of the Kolkata airport around 12.30pm on Sunday. However, even though the protesters were gone, they left behind a number of messages painted with permanent street paint and white cement on the city’s most popular square.“The idea was simple. We wanted to shout out a message that was loud and clear — any leader or organisation that tries to divide people on the basis of religion is not welcome in this state or city,” said Usashi Pal, a post-graduate student of Jadavpur University who had stayed up all night at Metro Channel in Esplanade.Pal was among the 200-odd protesters — mostly students from Jadavpur University, Presidency University and Calcutta University — who camped on the road in Esplanade all night long, shouting slogans and singing songs around bonfire and playing cricket and football under street lights and under police watch. Those who felt sleepy, took a nap on the pavement and atop matadors, but a fair number of protesters kept the slogans going till early hours of the day when reinforcement arrived in the form of a fresh batch of agitators.“It was a kind of protest we had never witnessed in the city before. Random people were giving us shawls, food and water, along with tea, at regular intervals. It was like a party, but the one with a cause. And the cause doesn’t end with the Prime Minister leaving the city. Hence, the moment we got the news that he left, we moved out of Esplanade, clearing the road for traffic. We shifted to Park Circus where a set of protesters have been camping for the past seven days,” said Ranojoy Dasgupta, a CU student.Modi left Belur Math at 10.10am on Sunday, crossed the Hooghly to Babughat and reached Netaji Indoor Stadium around 11pm for the inaugural function celebrating 150 years of Kolkata Port. While he was entering the stadium, a group of protesters shouted “Go Back Modi” and waved black flags in front of his convoy. Cops were, however, alert and detained a few of the protesters to control the situation.Modi flew to Kolkata airport in a chopper from the race course in Maidan and left the city around 12.30pm.In an attempt to catch the Prime Minister’s attention, some protesters even flew balloons and kites with protest messages on Sunday morning from different parts of the city around the time Modi was flying over the city.“We believe in unity of the nation and we will not allow anyone to break this unity that makes our Constitution and gives us our own identity.

48,['13/01/2020'],Raghuvansh Prasad Singh writes to Lalu Prasad against party’s Bihar chief,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Raghuvansh Prasad Singh

PATNA: Former Union minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh has written a letter to RJD chief Lalu Prasad against the style of functioning of party’s state president Jagdanand Singh, indicating differences between the two senior party leaders.

“Only 300 days are left for the state assembly election. But the party has not initiated any exercise as yet. As a result, party workers at grassroots level are disappointed and slowly losing their interest. How can we give a befitting reply to ruling coalition under such circumstances,” the RJD national vice-president wrote to Lalu on Saturday with a copy marked to Jagdanand.

Raghuvansh, the outspoken RJD leader, expressed concern over Jagdanand’s reluctance to constitute committees at different levels even after a month of the party’s organizational election. He said the ruling coalition partners have already started preparations for coming assembly election and they are attacking the RJD on one pretext or the other. “On the contrary, we are still sitting idle. It is high time party workers should move to villages and raise issues which have remained still unaddressed by the government,” he stated.

The former Vaishali MP, however, exuded confidence that Lalu ji would take cognizance of his letter and initiate steps to end the impasse. “Since I am not a member of ‘Jaykara team’ (bandwagon), I will continue to raise issues plaguing the party. I have done nothing wrong by drawing attention of the party supremo,” he said while informing the media about his letter on Sunday.

Jagdanand, however, said he doesn’t pay much attention to such letters. “Letters do come to the party office. Every RJD worker has the right to express his view as we are a democratic party,” he said.

Earlier, Raghuvansh had launched a veiled attack on Jagdanand alleging that the party office almost resembled a “government office”. “Discipline ought to be self-enforced and not imposed from outside. It needs to be appreciated that our party workers are not our paid employees,” he had said earlier.

Both Raghuvansh and Jagdanand have been associated with RJD since its inception in 1997. Party spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari, however, denied that the two senior leaders were engaged in shadow boxing against each other. “Dono party ke sammanniye neta hain. Koi vivad nahi hai (Both are honourable leaders of the party. There is no difference between the two),” he said.

49,['13/01/2020'],Seven flights to and from Surat cancelled in one week,"This story is from January 13, 2020

In last one week alone, Air India, Spice jet and Indigo flights to Delhi, Bengaluru, Goa, Kolkata, Hyderabad h... Read More

SURAT: Three airlines operating flights to and from Surat have either cancelled flights or reduced frequency owing to adverse weather conditions. Altogether seven flights have been cancelled in the past few days causing major inconveniences for the passengers.

In last one week alone, Air India, Spice jet and Indigo flights to Delhi, Bengaluru, Goa, Kolkata, Hyderabad have either been cancelled for a specific period or have curtailed frequency.

This comes as a setback for the airport that has been buzzing with activities in the past one year after a large number of domestic destinations got air connectivity to and from the city. Passenger traffic also went up to 1.5 lakh per month which was a win-win situation both for the city as well as the airline operators.

Chairman of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) airport committee, Manoj Singapuri said, “These cancellation or curtailment looks more due to rotational issues of aircraft due to the winter conditions. When a flight scheduled for Surat from Delhi in the early morning hours is unable to take off due to heavy fog, it affects the whole schedule of the aircraft which may be covering six other destinations before returning to its base at Delhi at night.”

Singapuri also added that the disruption has nothing to do with business or occupancy. “We are aware that flights operating to and from Surat run with 80 per cent load and there is no other reason but pollution levels,” he said, adding that even Surat doesn’t have category III lights to operate in hazy and adverse conditions. “So, if a pilot finds it difficult to land safely, he doesn’t land and returns back,” he added.

However, in the wake of this new development, frequent fliers, especially businessmen are highly inconvenienced. This apart, even flights to destination like Goa will be on hold for a few months.

“If by March 28 when the new summer schedules are announced by the airlines and these flights are not reintroduced then there is a cause for worry for the city’s fliers,” Singapuri said.

When asked, Surat airport Director Aman Saini said, “Officially, we have heard nothing from any of the airlines and hence cannot comment on anything at present.”

PATNA: A day after the murder of Siwan gangster Vishal Singh’s close aide Raj Kumar Sharma near Hathua railway station under the Mirganj police station area in Gopalganj district, Arun Kumar Singh, a former mukhiya, was shot dead by two criminals at an automobile workshop under the same police station on Sunday.

Police said two assailants riding a motorbike reached the workshop at Jigna under Mirganj police station and pumped two bullets into Arun’s body, causing grievous injuries to him. Arun, the former mukhiya of Matihani Nain panchayat, was rushed to the Hathua sub-divisional hospital from where he was referred to the sadar hospital at Gopalganj.

Arun, however, succumbed to his injuries during treatment at the Gopalganj sadar hospital. Police said Arun was earlier arrested in connection with the murder of JD(U) district general secretary Upendra Singh last year.

The supporters of the former mukhiya created a scene outside the sadar hospital and raised anti-police slogans.

Gopalganj SP Manoj Kumar Tiwari said it was being probed whether the former mukhiya was killed over rivalry between the gangs of former Siwan MP Md Shahabuddin and his arch rival Vishal Singh.

An investigating officer said Arun had gone to workshop for personal work. “The incident has been captured in the CCTV camera installed at the workshop,” he said, adding efforts were on to identity the shooters.

The SP said a special investigation team has been set up under the leadership of Hathua SDPO to crack the case at the earliest. “We have taken the two murders as a challenge. The culprits will be brought to book soon,” he said.

On Saturday, Raj Kumar Sharma, a resident of Rampur village under the Mufassil police station area in Siwan district, was gunned down by unidentified criminals at a railway rake point near Hathua station. The criminals had pumped four bullets into Sharma’s body, killing him on the spot.

Meanwhile, the two murders within 24 hours have created panic in the area.

Narendra Modi with monks at Belur Math on Sunday

KOLKATA: Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who stayed the night at Belur Math, spent Sunday morning meditating and praying in Swami Vivekananda’s room. He described his Belur Math visit, the second one after he became Prime Minister, as a “homecoming”.

The evening before, he had requested his room be kept in its usual spartan state. In the morning, Modi came out of the international guest house clad in a dhoti in a style typical of the monks at the ashram and walked towards Swamiji’s room to pay him a floral tribute on his birth anniversary. The room, which is kept open for visitors only on his birthday, is where Vivekananda meditated and spoke to his fellow monks. “Today on Vivekananda Jayanti and National Youth Day I am at the Belur Math including the room where Swamiji meditated,” Modi tweeted.

Though a battery-operated golf cart had been kept on stand-by, Modi chose to walk on campus. He visited the main temple, which has a statue of Ramakrishna. Dedicated in 1938, the temple was designed by Vivekananda’s disciple Vijnanananda. Modi paid tribute to Ramakrishna and prayed there. Leaving the temple a while later, Modi joined the monks and walked towards the Vivekananda birth centenary programme stage.

“I had the fortune of spending a night here. Coming to Belur Math is like opening old chapters of my life,” Modi said in his speech.

When Modi had wanted to join the Ramakrishna Math and Mission as an ascetic during the 60s, former president of the Mission Swami Atmasthananda had asked him to pursue life in the service of the people. Addressing the brahmacharis (ascetics) in the audience, the PM said, “I had a similar state of mind which you have now. Most of us get drawn to this place because of Vivekananda’s ideals and his personality. Maa Sarada exuded a mother’s love to me. All the brahmacharis here must have felt the same.”

Talking about Vivekananda, Modi said the country’s youth has been part of the sankalpa (oath) Vivekananda had. “India is gifted with the power of the youth. The country has also taken sankalpa. It is not sankalpa of the government alone, but of the people,” Modi added.

Modi then visited Ma Sarada Devi temple and Swami Brahmananda temple, after which president of the Math and Mission Swami Smaranananda gave him a “prasadi” flower. “The thoughts of Sri Ramakrishna emphasise furthering harmony and compassion. He believed that a great way to serve God is to serve people, especially the poor and downtrodden,” the Prime Minister tweeted later.

Before he left the temple, Modi posed for a group photograph with the monks.

More than 500 women, both professionals and housewives, cleaned up a major portion of Dumas beach on Sunday

SURAT: More than 500 women , both professionals and housewives , cleaned up a major portion of Dumas beach on Sunday. Working under the banner of Swaccha Bharat, United Bharat , the volunteers collected about 500 kg of litter , mostly plastic from Dumas beach near Temple of Luck in the day-long operation.

Union textile minister Smriti Irani was also present on the occasion. Volunteers from two NGOs — Project Surat and Great Weekender — got together on cold Sunday morning and took up the Clean Dumas beach campaign.

While Project Surat works towards making Surat the most sustainable city in the world aims, Great Weekender aims for the betterment of the women with their motto ‘Conservation, connection and celebration’.

D R Prabhakar of Great Weekender said, “We invited minister Irani to flag off the clean-up project which is a precursor to out celebration of International Women’s day on March 8. This was the first of its kind all-women clean up team.”

Lamenting that rapid urbanization and industrialization has led to rampant use of plastic everywhere, Prabhakar emphasized on the need for Swaccha and plastic-free Bharat. “We organized this project to remove all plastic from our beach and nearly 500 kg of plastic litter was handpicked by the women volunteers on Sunday,” he said.

In her address on the spot, Smriti Irani was acerbic on the disruptive elements who were trying to ‘break the country’, she said that such acts like the clean-up project is heartening to see people in Surat are working overtime to unite the nation.

Local MLA, Harsh Sanghvi said that people from this city will continue the activities which will help unite India in a more stronger way and also achieve targets of Swaccha India, United India.

Volunteers at Dumas beach formed the shape of tree to show their solidarity and their dedication towards saving tree life in the city.

On the occasion, another organization, Kamakhya, was also launched which will work towards Menstrual Hygiene for women.

53,['13/01/2020'],Madhusudan Dutt’s English drama ‘Rizia’ makes it to print,"A portrait of Michael Madhusudan Dutt

KOLKATA: The unpublished manuscript of an English drama written by Bengali poet-dramatist Michael Madhusudan Dutt has finally been printed after professor Ananda Lal chanced upon it a few years ago. The timing of the publication is significant because the reason why it was never staged is as relevant now as it was 150 years ago. Dutt’s attempts to stage it in Bengali were foiled by his patrons’ opinion that Muslim names would not suit a Bengali drama.The play, titled ‘ Rizia , Empress of Inde’, is a fictional account of Razia Sultana, the only woman ruler of the Delhi Sultanate . Lal told TOI, “Rizia personifies a quadruply marginalized tragic heroine from a minority community — the nobles opposed her for reigning and for daring to love her Abyssinian Siddi slave. Dutt made her a four-fold ‘captive ladie’: as a woman, a Muslim for 19th-century Indian audiences, one who assumed power above her gender role and loved below her socio-racial station.”Lal feels Rizia deserves greater attention today than ever before for the very factor of religion that Dutt pointed out in his correspondence with Bengali actor and confidant Keshub Chunder Gangooly. “Here was India’s first dramatist to write about Muslim society, however amateurish or superficial that representation may appear now, for which his play was unjustly rejected,” he said.Dutt started ‘Rizia’ in 1849 in Madras where he had relocated, and published extracts in ‘The Eurasian’ there. The manuscript in his elegant cursive reveals that he continued to compose it during his stay. “A page bears the dateline ‘Madras University 1855’, suggesting that Dutt had worked on it till the last year of his stay in Madras. Act III Scene I is even dated precisely — 28/5/55. In this manuscript, Dutt crossed out certain lines that appear in ‘The Eurasian’, indicating that he had revised his 1849-50 script and fleshed out the play while compressing existing scenes, making it much more theatrical,” explained Lal.In 1858, after he returned to Calcutta following his father’s demise, Dutt began writing drama for the Rajas (two brothers) of Paikpara in north Calcutta who had just set up the Belgachhia Theatre. He gave them his first original Bengali play, ‘Sharmishtha’, based on the Hindu legend. The Rajas performed it on September 3, 1859 to considerable acclaim. He later submitted an English synopsis of ‘Rizia’ with 48 lines of Rizia’s speech in Bengali to the Rajas through K C Gangooly, hoping to stage it too. Unfortunately, that was not to be. Gangooly wrote back: “They say that Mahomedan names will not perhaps hear well in a Bengali drama.”In 1860, Dutt again expressed his desire to Gangooly for the Rajas to stage ‘Rizia’: “We ought to take up Indo-Mussulman subjects. We must look to ‘Rizia’. The prejudice against Moslem names must be given up.” But he never got the green light. His forgotten manuscript came into the possession of Jotindro Mohun Tagore, the Rajas’ friend.Lal believes Dutt was so keen to have ‘Rizia’ performed that he gave it to Tagore, hoping he would either convince the Rajas or stage it himself at the Tagores’ own Pathuriaghata Theatre.A few years ago, Lal was discussing his research on 19th-century Indian drama in class at Jadavpur University.“A few days later, Pramantha Mohun Tagore — a student and descendant of the Jotindro Mohun–Sourindro Mohun Tagore family — brought two leather-bound volumes for me to see: Dutt’s Bengali manuscript of ‘Tilottama’, which Jotindro Mohun had aided in publishing, and the damaged English manuscript of ‘Rizia’,” Lal said. He decided then and there that ‘Rizia’ had to see the light of day, and reconstructed it. His book is titled ‘Indian Drama in English: The Beginnings’.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73221399,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-441373,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/madhusudan-dutts-english-drama-rizia-makes-it-to-print/articleshow/73218826.cms
54,['13/01/2020'],Admin to settle land disputes for NHAI projects by Feb 1st week,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Apart from the national highway projects, ring-road project is also being delayed by disputes over land acquis... Read More

Varanasi: In a bid to ensure that the National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) completes all highway projects before its deadline of June 2020, especially in the limits of Varanasi, the district administration has decided to settle all disputes regarding land acquired for the projects by the first week of February.

The administration will ensure hearings for out of court settlement of maximum disputes, and will pursue earliest disposal of the cases pending in civil court. The compensation amount of those who have not collected will be deposited in the district judge’s court.

The land acquisition process for NHAI’s projects has come on fast track three months after the NHAI had to face ire of chief minister Yogi Adityanath following his experience about the bad condition of the under-construction highways during his journey to Varanasi from Mau on October 16, 2019. The NHAI had cited the incomplete process of land acquisition as the reason for delay in execution of highway projects in and around Varanasi.

Providing details of meeting with NHAI officials to TOI, district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said, “As per NHAI officials, over 90% issues of land acquisition are complete in the district. Regarding pending issues of land acquisition, NHAI was asked to provide details of each dispute.”

NHAI reported that on Varanasi-Gorakhpur NH-29 an issue of a mosque at Molnapur is pending in civil court while owner of a land in Udaipur had not been receiving compensation amount for four months in a patch of Varanasi-Ghaghra bridge.

Apart from the national highway projects, ring-road project is also being delayed by disputes over land acquisition, reported NHAI and special land acquisition officer (SLO), mentioning that owners are obstructing land acquisition process in 580 mt patch at Rakhuana area and on 900 mt strip in Seo village.

Sharma said land acquisition officials were asked to bring the land owners of Rakhauna, Seo, Barsianpur and Haridaspur villages, who are not allowing agencies to take possession of their land, for arbitration. Officials were also asked to deposit the compensation amount of those, who are not collecting it even after arbitration, in the district judges court by January 31 and take possession of the land, he said.

An order was also issued to lodge FIR against the land owners obstructing NHAI’s work on Varanasi-Lucknow highway in Pindra area and it has also been decided that district administration will become a party in the cases like of mosque in Molnapur area, which are pending in court for their early settlement, said the DM.

He said that except the issues pending in court, all other disputes and hurdles coming in the way of major infrastructural projects, especially of highways, will be cleared by February first week.

NHAI is finding it hard to meet the deadline of June 2020 set for the completion of Varanasi-Sultanpur (NH-56), Varanasi-Ghazipur (NH-29) and Varanasi-Azamgarh (NH-233).

NHAI project director Varanasi SB Singh said, “Under all on-going highway projects, the alignment of the three highways had been finalised after including a plan of by-passes to avoid major destruction in existing townships. However, major work in the same by-passes lingered while in remaining length of all these highways over 80% civil works are complete.”

The NHAI officials expressed difficulty in meeting the deadline of June 2020 for all these projects if issues of acquisition of the remaining land was not settled at the earliest.

55,['13/01/2020'],Cong misleading people on CAA: Rai,"This story is from January 13, 2020

BAGAHA: Allaying fears on Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Union minister of state for home affairs Nityanand Rai while addressing a gathering at the Kutchery Ground here on Sunday said that nobody will lose citizenship because of CAA. “I challenge that if any citizen of our country loses citizenship or if they get discouraged through CAA then we are ready to bring changes in CAA,” said Rai.

“There is no loss to any citizen from the CAA act. The CAA grants citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians etc fleeing Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh due to religious persecution. In fact, the legislation applies to those who were forced or compelled to seek shelter in India due to persecution on the ground of religion. It aims to protect such people from proceedings of illegal migration. The cut-off date for citizenship is December 31, 2014 which means the applicant should have entered India on or before that date,” Rai added.

“The Congress and company is spreading rumours that Muslims may lose their citizenship ,” the minister said and added that is is against the infiltrators like Rohingiyas.

He also urged the Muslims to look into the CAA, which was now available on the government website. “Go through the Act. No one will lose citizenship. Pakistan failed to implement the Nehru-Liaquat pact to protect religious and other rights of the minorities which prompted the Narendra Modi-led BJP government to table the legislation in Parliament,” he said.

State BJP chief Sanjay Jaiswal, while praising the achievement of Modi government said, “We are helping those Hindus, who were living as refugees in India, migrating from countries which were once our integrated part. The Congress is the root of all troubles, creating nuisance in the country. It is the party which had given citizenship to Hindu Bangladeshi refugees in 1971.”

Other prominent leaders, who spoke on the occasion were Satish Chandra Dubey, Rajya Sabha member Bhagirathi Devi, Vinay Bihari, Raghav Saran Pandey (MLAs), Renu Devi, BJP national vice-president Deepak Yadav and former MP Omprakash Yadav.

56,['13/01/2020'],Hundreds stage indefinite protest against CAA in Gaya,"This story is from January 13, 2020

GAYA: Away from camera glares and emotive sound bites, hundreds of protesters, beating hostile weather conditions and stench coming out of the nearby khatals, have been holding peaceful protest against CAA, NPR and NRC in the ‘Shanti Bagh’ locality of Gaya since December 29.

With the statues of Mahatma Gandhi on the left and Ambedkar on the right and the national tricolour fluttering in the middle of the entrance hoarding, the protesters intermittently raise ‘Inqualab Zindabad’ and ‘Samvidhan Zindabad’ slogans. The protest has been sponsored by ‘Samvidhan Bachao Morcha’, a forum especially created to register protest.

A large number of activists and non-NDA politicians, including ex-CM Jitan Ram Manjhi, Kerala’s former governor Nikhil Kumar and former Bihar assembly Speaker Uday Narain Chaudhary have visited the protest site to express solidarity with the protesters. The protest has also brought into focus the oratorial skills of otherwise veiled women. Besides slogans, popular Urdu couplets are also frequently recited to keep the morale of the protesters high.

On Sunday afternoon, Bilqis Nishat, an undergraduate student, proclaimed, “pne Bharat ki hifazat ko utar aye hain, dekh diwane shahadat pe utar aye hain (we are here to defend the idea of India, look the passionate patriots are ready to embrace martyrdom).”

Besides the likes of Bilqis and Mariam Farhad, Poonam Kumari, an advocate, and Rajeshwari Devi, a homemaker and mother of five children, are also regular at the protest venue, though for different reasons. Whereas Poonam is angry that the Constitution is being ‘put upside down’, Rajeshwari’s worry is that she does not have any documents to prove her nationality.

The protest is not the exact replica of Shaheen Bagh (Delhi) agitation. Whereas in Delhi, women remain there 24X7, the Shanti Bagh (Gaya) women go home late in the evening, handing over the baton to young men who spend the night at the venue. Blankets and bonfire have been arranged with the help of spot donations collected there.

“Voice amplifiers go off at 10 in the evening,” says Morcha co-convener Satish Das. “Public address system is not used during school hours,” says Mariam, a law degree aspirant.

“Nazareth Academy, a premier school of the town, is located near the protest site and we do not want to disturb school students,” said Mariam, a former student of the school.

Asked whether the political affiliation of the morcha convener Omair Khan @Tikka Khan does not erode the credibility of the protest (Khan is the state working president of the Pappu Yadav-led Jan Adhikar Party), Das said the issue was much bigger than politics.

“It is a non-political protest and political leaders from any party are welcome in their individual capacity,” Satish added.

As of now, the protest is indefinite but the organizers may review it after the Supreme Court takes up the matter later this month.

57,['13/01/2020'],Population Research Centre to start courses on demography,"This story is from January 13, 2020

PATNA: Fifty-year-old Population Research Centre (PRC) of Patna University, an institution set up by the Union ministry of health and family welfare, is likely to start one-year diploma and six-month certificate courses in demography from the next academic session.

“The university’s proposal to this effect has been approved by the ministry and the details of course work and necessary admission ordinance and examination regulations are being worked out,” said PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh.

The VC pointed out that having been associated with PU statistics department right since its inception, PRC has been conducting studies and research on demographic, social and economic aspects of the population, especially of Bihar. In fact, the investigations carried out by the PRC aim at assessing the impact of various factors having bearing on family welfare programmes, which, in turn, provide feedback to strengthen their implementation.

The progress of research made by the PRC is communicated to the ministry through quarterly reports. So far more than 450 reports and research papers on different aspects of population have been produced by PRC. Apart from completing the assignments of the ministry, the PRC has also carried out several studies of the USAID, the Population Council, New York, UNICEF and Care India, he said.

The PRC will organise a two-day knowledge dissemination workshop in collaboration with the Centre here on January 16 and 17. Union minister of state for health and family welfare Ashwini Kumar Choubey will inaugurate the workshop. Ministry’s deputy director general D K Ojha will be presenting the keynote address on ‘Setting the agenda of population and health related issues’.

A compendium of research studies made by all the 18 PRCs in the country would be prepared at the workshop. As many as 26 of 44 research papers received from PRCs will be included in the compendium.

PU PRC’s assistant director Dilip Kumar said prominent experts like IIT-Kanpur humanities’ professor A K Sharma, JNU’s retired professor Sudesh Nangia, International Institute of Population Studies’ professor Sanjay Kumar Mohanty and PU’s former vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Sinha will screen the papers and select the best three papers for awards.

Furthermore, in collaboration with the International Institute of Population Studies (IIPS), Mumbai, PU’s PRC will be organizing a three-day national seminar on ‘Population, health and sustainable development goals: performance and prioritizing policies’ here from February 13 to 15. The focus of the seminar will be on ensuring healthy lives of people and promoting their well-being.

58,['13/01/2020'],Up to 24% defaulters had safe credit rating,"(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Nearly a fourth of borrowers who defaulted to banks carried an investment grade credit rating up to a quarter before they defaulted, according to a report published in the Reserve Bank of India ’s ( RBI ’s) latest bulletin.What this means is that ratings of companies have plunged from at least BBB (investment grade) to D (default) in three months. The study has concluded that ratings do not always reflect the asset quality of borrowers in a timely manner and there are concerns over delayed reporting of ratings by banks. But despite the limitations, the report says the use of external ratings in regulations is inevitable and ways to improve agency performance should be explored.The study was authored by Sukhbir Singh and Pallavi Chavan from RBI’s department of supervision . It covered 560 large borrowers, accounting for about 21% of NPA borrowers and as high as 40% of NPAs as of end-March 2018. About 24% of the sampled NPA exposure from Central Repository of Information on Large Credits ( CRILC ) carried an investment grade rating just a quarter before becoming non-performing.Since 2014, the RBI has been maintaining a database of large accounts that have defaulted on the CRILC. These are companies where banks have an exposure of Rs 5 crore and above. According to the authors, an earlier study concerning accredited credit rating agencies (CRAs) shows that the cumulative default rates ( CDRs ) for the CRAs in India are much higher than those prescribed under the Basel framework (an international standard for banks).“As a result, the possibility of undercapitalisation in banks cannot be denied, given the application of the same risk weights as prescribed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). There is also some evidence on the inability of CRAs to provide timely guidance on the weakening creditworthiness of borrowers,” the report said.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73223357,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-51602,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/up-to-24-defaulters-had-safe-credit-rating/articleshow/73218832.cms
59,['13/01/2020'],Morgan Stanley set to buy 20% in Centrum Housing Finance,"This story is from January 13, 2020

(Representative image)

MUMBAI: Morgan Stanley is set to buy a 20% stake in the affordable housing finance unit of Centrum Group , said people familiar with the transaction. Private equity Jacob Ballas too was in the race, but Morgan has emerged as the frontrunner for the stake purchase in Centrum Housing Finance , they said.

The US financial services giant will also get a seat on the board of Centrum Housing Finance, a company set up three years ago by the Mumbai-based financial services group. Currently, there are six members on the board of the company chaired by Sridar Venkatesan . Morgan will invest Rs 200 crore for the minority stake.

The deal values Centrum Housing Finance at Rs 1,000 crore, which is equivalent to the market value of its listed parent Centrum Capital , the sources said. The housing finance unit, which also offers loans for home improvement and renovation, has a book size of over Rs 400 crore.

Morgan Stanley could not be reached for a reaction and Centrum declined to comment on the report.

Morgan will be the first external investor in Centrum Housing Finance, which is equity funded by Centrum Capital and its promoters. Centrum, founded by the late K Byramjee and Chandir Gidwani in 1997, was among the first brokerage firms to enter the housing finance business in the country in 2017 after the Narendra Modi government increased its focus on affordable housing. Centrum Housing Finance opened its first branch in Indore.

Morgan’s investment in Centrum Housing Finance tracks the trend in the sector that saw General Atlantic buying 6.5% in PNB Housing Finance for Rs 926 crore last May, and Blackstone acquiring 98% in Aadhar Housing Finance for Rs 2,200 crore in June 2019.

Housing finance companies (HFCs) grew sharply between 2013 and 2018, recording a five-year CAGR of 22% in their loan books. However, in fiscal 2019, growth eased on account of liquidity squeeze after a default by IL&FS. A report by ratings agency Care last week said the HFC business model has come under immense competitive pressure, but the overall sector is well-capitalised.

“Further the sector continues to face competition from the banks, however, HFCs with strong parentage continue to grow secularly. Going forward, the growth in on-book advances of non-government HFCs would be in the range of 7-8.5% year-on-year for March 2020, given the downside risks on moderation in the housing market and a consumption slowdown, which could reduce retail demand,” the report said.

A view of air quality monitoring stations at Rajdhani Vatika[Eco Park] in Patna (File photo)

PATNA: The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) has installed two more continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations at Patna and Hajipur , which would be operational from Monday (January 13). A proposal in this regard has been sent to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

The new stations will be linked to the national grid soon, an official at the board said.

Track the pollution level in your city

The new stations have been set up at DRM office in Khagaul and government office in Hajipur town area. One more air monitoring station will be operational by this month at Government Boy’s High School in Patna City. The installation work is underway.

The stations would provide information regarding the ambient air quality along with individual readings of seven parameters, including PM 2.5 (particulate matters less than 2.5 microns), PM 10 (particulate matters less than 10 microns), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Ozone and Ammonia (NH3). It will also show the temperature, humidity, wind speed and other climatic conditions of the day.

The new air monitoring boards are procured from a US-based company, which cost around Rs1.15 crore each.

The state capital presently has four monitoring stations at Eco Park, Planetarium, Birla Institute of Technology-Mesra at Patna and SK Memorial Hall.

BSPCB chairman Ashok Ghosh told this newspaper that the installation work of monitoring stations have been done and it will be soon connected with the CPCB server. “The city’s overall air quality index (AQI) would now be calculated on inputs from five monitoring stations. It will give the clear picture of air pollution in the city,” he said.

“At least 10 monitoring stations are needed in a city like Patna to get a broader scenario with regard to air pollution. With four stations in city, we have covered only 70% area of the city,” he added.

Ghosh said two more stations have been proposed at Kankarbagh and Digha.

Besides Patna and Hajipur, a monitoring station each will also come up at Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Gaya and Muzaffarpur by December-end. The state government is also planning to set up 42 monitoring stations in different cities of Bihar.

The BSPCB, in association with other organizations that works for environment, had prepared a comprehensive action plan. It also conducted a source appointment study to help it prepare data to quantify proportion of various elements to the overall level of air pollution in Patna. The source appointment study is now taking place at other two districts, including Gaya and Muzaffarpur.

Bengaluru: The Kishore Chhabria-owned Allied Blenders & Distillers ( ABD ) has made top-level changes in its management with the exit of long-time executive vice-chairman Deepak Roy , vice-chairman Utpal Ganguly and CEO Paramjit Gill from day-to-day operations. The maker of the world’s highest-selling whisky Officer’s Choice has started succession planning by roping in the next generation of executives.

Chhabria has made former top Diageo global executive Nicholas Blazquez , who joined the board of the company last year, responsible for finding a new CEO, said two sources familiar with the matter.

Roy, who is 70 years old and also holds a small sweat equity stake in the Mumbai-based ABD, continues to be an adviser to the board and so does Ganguly. The move is significant as ABD is the only Indian distiller among the top three players, with Diageo-United Spirits and Pernod Ricard ruling the market. “Blazquez is looking at the day-to day-operations for now and he is responsible for bringing a new CEO in six-nine months,” said one of the sources mentioned earlier. The increasing involvement of Blazquez, who is executive deputy chairman of ABD, in steering the company along with chairman Chhabria is also significant as he was responsible for about half of Diageo’s global business with India market under his purview before he left in 2016.

Chhabria could not be immediately reached for a comment. Over the last two years, the company has been moving into the premium whisky market with its Sterling Reserve brand, which became the fastest brand to reach 1 million cases sold in 261 days last year. This brand is competing with Diageo’s Royal Challenge and Pernod Ricard’s Blenders Pride, helping ABD improving margins.

Trichy: Assistant engineers in the agricultural engineering department have put forward a charter of demands to the government including their long-pending promotion. They said that a total of 104 assistant engineers posted on temporary basis during 1998 without getting TNPSC concurrence have been trying to supersede the members of the Association of Agricultural Engineers.

Association state president S Sivashanmugam said that the state government had regularised the 104 AEs during 2012 based on a direction from the Madurai bench of Madras high court. However, the court had clarified that their seniority should be taken into consideration only from 2012. Despite that, the state government is preparing to announce promotion for them which would ultimately affect the prospects of about 200 AEs posted in junior grade and promoted as AEs step by step for the last 30 year, he said. “Stating that we were diploma holders at the time of appointment, the government is denying promotion to us,” he said while urging the government to follow norms in seniority to get promoted as assistant executive engineers, he added.

Trichy: Pongal, a harvest festival, is essentially observed by farmers in rural parts to cherish their agricultural yield, while celebrations in urban areas often remain confined to homes with mere sweet pongal preparation.

A section of urban folks in Trichy witnessed traditional Pongal celebrations organized by Thaneer – a city-based environmental organization, where close to 300 people, mostly families, participated at Gundur village on Sunday.

About 8 km from the city in the outskirts, Pongal was celebrated on an agriculture field. Instead of a conventional stove, brick stove was setup to prepare sweet pongal apart from other dishes.

To add a flavour of tradition to the whole event, folk artists performed ancient folk dance Karakattam apart from beating Parai – ancient drums. Traditional martial art forms like silambattam were also performed by children. Terming it to be first of its kind Pongal celebration, Trichy district library officer A P Sivakumar said that such events remind us that we should not forget our roots.

“Our roots are in villages and farmers in the agriculture land remind us of that fact. People should take this as an opportunity and visit their villages, meet farmers and celebrate Pongal with them,” he said.

K C Neelamegam, secretary, Thaneer, said that traditional Pongal celebration is organized every year to thank farmers for their hard work. “We chose not to make any special arrangements but keep the venue in the middle of a farmland to get real feel of village Pongal. While traditional folk artistes performed during the event, farmers were also asked to take up organic farming to create a healthier environment,” said Neelamegam.

People who want entry in the court for hearing of their cases will be issued entry passes. Anyone without a genuine entry pass will not be allowed to enter the compound.

“To ensure full-fledged security of the court, which had witnessed a series of blasts on November 23, 2007, DM Kaushal Raj Sharma and SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary along with other officials reviewed the security arrangements on campus and held a meeting with the district judge on Saturday.

High court had also recently directed the government to ensure security of court campuses after the Bijnour court shooting.

Following the daylong exercise, SSP told TOI, “A standard operating procedure (SOP) for the security of district court compound has been prepared. The SOP will be strictly implemented. Besides, the height of the existing boundary walls of the court will be raised up to 9 ft.”

“During discussion with the district judge and other officials, it was also decided that separate entry points will be fixed for the entry of judges, lawyers and people visiting the court compound for case hearings,” the SSP said.

“Soon, a counter will be opened for issuing entry passes to people seeking entry in court compound for their cases in different courts. With the implementation of this arrangement, no unauthorised person can get access to the district court,” he added.

Earlier, the officials also took stock of all the access points of the court compound, apart from reviewing the existing security arrangements. Some CCTV cameras were found defunct during the inspection and the DM had ordered for their immediate repair/replacement.

Trichy: Railway board has formed a multi-disciplinary team to identify safety and security-related issues in railway stations and yards in select stations in Trichy division and take immediate action to rectify lapses. The team will also report the remedial action taken to the headquarters every month.

Trichy, Thanjavur, Mayiladuthurai, Vridachalam, Villupuram, Cuddalore Port, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Ariyalur, Pudhuchathiram, Puducherry, Thiruvannamalai and Kumbakonam stations have been earmarked for the monthly inspection.

According to the directives of the railway board chairman, from now on officials from various departments including signalling, operation, engineering and telecommunication will conduct the multi-disciplinary inspection every month.

Trichy divisional railway manager (DRM) has nominated senior divisional safety officer (Sr DSO) to function as coordinator of the team who will advise branch officers about the joint inspection in the last week of every month.

The coordinator will prepare the inspection report identifying the weak areas and remedial action and send a monthly report on or before 5th of every month to the nominated officer in the headquarters.

The nominated officer will liaise with the DRMs and keep the general manager informed of the matters which require his intervention, a senior divisional officer said.

The report highlighting the weak areas and remedial action should be sent to the designated officer on or before 7th of every month by the nominated officer so as to compile monthly feedback for onward transmission to railway board.

Railway unions have welcomed the railway board’s move. “Usually, department officials would carry out inspections individually and find out issues relating to their department only. If the team of officials comprising all departments carry out an inspection, all of them can get a clear picture of a particular issue and can take the required action immediately. This practice would minimize cost, time and specifically red-tapism”, deputy general secretary of Dakshin Railway Employees Union (DREU) D Manoharan said.

“The claimant stated that he suffered permanent disability due to the accident and was compelled to remain at his residence for almost two years and eight months, due to which lost almost 273 days of earned leave. I have no reason to doubt the claimant on this count as it was brought on record, in the cross examination of Dr Bandekar, that his injuries would take 10-12 months to heal and only then would the patient be given a fitness certificate,” stated tribunal member, justice Sherin Paul, in the order.

Fernandes had submitted that he suffered heavy monetary loss due to the accident as he was the only earning member of the family. He has a permanent disability to his left leg and continues to limp while walking, cannot run or fold his left knee, has partially lost sensation of his left foot and is unable to move the toes of his left foot.

PANAJI: The slight dip in mercury to 21.3C brought some chill on Sunday morning. But after 12 days, barring two occasions, night hours in January seem as warm as December 2019, which ended as the warmest in 50 years.

In January, Panaji recorded minimum temperatures below 20C only on January 4 and 5 – 19.7C and 18.6C. In Mormugao , it was on three occasions - 20C on Jan 4, 18.4 on Jan 5 and 19 on Jan 6. Otherwise, warm weather prevailed on other nights, as the minimum temperature hovered between 21 to 24C.

December 2019 was a month with warmest nights for 60 years, as the mercury didn’t drop below 20C. The local meteorological centre recorded minimum temperatures over 22C on nine days, over 24C on eight days and over 23C on seven days.

On Sunday, the minimum temperature was just 0.9C above normal. During January so far, the mercury has remained above normal for most part, but meteorologists at India meteorological department (IMD), Goa, expect the mild winter chill to set in during the next few days.

Strong western disturbances over north India are likely to impact surface temperature in coastal areas upto Goa’s latitude. “We are expecting a gradual fall in minimum temperature over Goa for about three to four days,’ Rahul M, scientist, IMD, Goa said.

80,['13/01/2020'],Beyond enemy lines: A soldier’s mission to protect the country,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Secunderabad: To join the Indian Army and serve the country had always been Lt Col Ananda Pillai’s dream. And when the opportunity presented itself, Pillai grabbed it with both hands. Pillai who was born in Chittoor joined the Indian Army Services Corps as he wanted to protect his country. “I want to cross over to fight the Pakistan army,” he volunteered as the senior army officers asked for those who were willing. “You have just been married for less than a year. Are you sure you want to take a chance?” his colleagues asked the 26-year-old Ananda Pillai.

Ananda Pillai had only been waiting for such an opportunity in his life. During his admission interview at Indian Military Academy (IMA), Dehradun, interviewers asked him was why he wanted to join the forces. “I want to kill the enemy,” he had said in response. “What if we do not give you admission?” the interviewers asked. “I will try again and not give up,” he responded. “The Indian Army needs people like you who are fearless and with a never-give-up attitude,” they said.

After graduating from the IMA, it was a proud moment for Ananda Pillai as he went to his village wearing his uniform. “Didn’t I tell you he would achieve what he wanted?” his father whispered into his mother’s ear. “From my childhood my father knew I was cut out for something different and something challenging,” Ananda Pillai recalled in a conversation with TOI.

“I had the ‘josh’ and the zeal to serve the Indian Army. And here was my chance to live the moment of my life,” Ananda Pillai said recalling how he had volunteered to stealthily cross over into Pakistan territory with his unit in the night during the 1971-72 war. Walking through the fields finding a pathway, the unit crossed into Pakistan territory on bridge that had been constructed on war footing by the army.

As the Pakistani army started firing, Ananda Pillai and his unit shifted their tents to another part. “Spare my life,” a Pakistani villager who had been hiding in the sugarcane fields during the firing pleaded. “Who said we will kill you?” Ananda Pillai asked him. To the villager’s surprise, he made him sit in his vehicle and took him to his village and dropped him there safely. For Ananda Pillai, the enemy was the Pakistani army and not an unarmed civilian. For 25 days, Ananda Pillai was on Pakistani territory. “For five days, I literally went hungry and the only thing available was the cane from the sugarcane fields,” he recollected.

The war was over and Ananda Pillai was back on Indian territory with the satisfaction that India had achieved its purpose. In 1972-73, he faced a life threatening situation in Kargil. The weather was too cold and breathing at a high altitude had become difficult. He was taken to Leh in a chopper and then to a hospital where he recovered. When facing the enemy, he had one word to his troops. “Koi darna nahi ( Have no fear)” he told them in all situations. There is proof of his valour and fearlessness at his home at Ramachandrapuram at Neredmet in Secunderabad. The Pakistan army had the American first generation main battle tank called the ‘Patton tank’. He went right into the enemy camp and collected more than a dozen ammunition shells and gave to other officers as souvenirs and kept one to himself. “We got the ammunition removed from it as it was a live shell and have kept the shell,” he said. Having served for 33 years in the army, and in several sensitive places, Lt Col Ananda Pillai retired in 1995.

82,['13/01/2020'],"2 new bridges, road to ease Hadapsar commute pain","This story is from January 13, 2020

Pune: The civic administration is set to start construction of two vehicular bridges on two canals and also a 30m-wide road in the Hadapsar area to provide a link to the Mohammadwadi-Kausarbaug areas through Sasanenagar.

Work on the railway track underpass at Sasanenagar is already under way. Once ready, the facilities will reduce the burden on the existing roads in the Hadapsar area and ensure a smoother commute up to the Mohammadwadi-Kausarbaug via Sasanenagar.

The administration had tabled a proposal before the standing committee of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) of various road development projects on the Hadapsar-Sasanenagar stretch at an estimated Rs 30 crore. The standing committee recently approved works of Rs 10 crore. The projects will include construction of two bridges on the canals and the 300m-long road.

A road development department official said a 30m wide road has been proposed from Solapur road up to the Sasanenagar underpass. The 980m-long road will be a crucial link because vehicles at present have to take smaller lanes through the congested areas of the Hadapsar gaothan areas.

Officials said traffic snarls were a daily feature in the area because the existing roads were insufficient to accommodate the increasing vehicular traffic. The new road will bypass the gaothan areas, which are extremely congested. In the initial stage, the civic budget and standing committee have approved Rs 10 crore for the work. “The remaining work will be planned in the next phase,” an official said.

Traffic snarls in the Hadapsar areas and Sasanenagar have been for long bothering the residents. A group of housing societies from South Hadapsar had put up banners in the run-up to last year’s assembly elections, asking candidates to give written commitments regarding their demands before seeking their vote.

Among the major issues raised by the residents were the pending work of the subway, traffic management near the subway, action against encroachments, incomplete and poor condition of roads.

Representatives of the housing societies had said the candidates should explain how the subways have been planned and the planning of traffic management at the railway crossing, Sasanenagar junction and the Krishnanagar road.

Sasanenagar residents said while constructing a wider road, the civic administration should ensure that the new road remained free of encroachments and illegal housing societies.

KOCHI: When the three buildings — Holy Faith H2O, Jains Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram — were razed through controlled implosion by South Africa’s leading demolition firm Jet Demolition over the last two days in Maradu , it marked three firsts for the company’s managing director Joe Brinkmann — his first project in India, his first-ever demolition of a waterfront highrise, and above all, the three buildings were the first-ever illegal buildings demolished by the 60-year-old implosion expert who has a track record of over 2,000 successful demolitions.Brinkmann, whose demolition career spans over nearly three decades, said all the buildings that he had blasted were legal but were demolished for various other reasons like fire or structural damage. “Demolishing an illegal building was a first in my career. I heard that many people were evicted from their flats for implementing the demolition order. I feel sorry for them,” Brinkmann said.When asked how he has pulled-off the Maradu job like a breeze, Brinkmann, with a smile, said, “A precise demolition design coupled with years of experience did the job.”Brinkmann has started tinkering with explosives at the age of 21 after securing a degree in mining engineering in 1981. With over 10 years of experience in mining operations, he ventured into demolition industry with his first independent demolition in 1991. Three years later, he launched his own firm (Jet Demolition) and since then he pulled down many structures all over the world, including the 108-m tall fire-damaged Bank of Lisbon building on November 24 last year, which he calls the most challenging task of his career.“There is a lot of homework to do with every demolition design like understanding the make of the building and knowing the structure very well. You can make infinite numbers of demolition designs but the challenge is to pick the right one from those plans. Then you need to focus on refining it,” he added.And for his design, Brinkmann has never used any software or simulations yet. “There are two or three software packages available , but I think they needed some refinement. I do my own drawings and calculations. And the rest is based on my ‘mental anguish’, which is a complex process where I have to take a call on many things related to the each stage of the demolition,” he said.He added that demolition was not like any other engineering discipline which can be studied in universities. “Though some courses in demolition management have been introduced in the recent past, there are no courses or degrees available in any colleges. You need to be adept in basic Physics,” Brinkmann said.He said that the tight schedule — when he had to prepare the demolition design for three buildings situated in three different locations — within two months was a real challenge.Brinkmann will be flying to Delhi with his wife Liz and son Nicholas as he intends to visit heritage sites, including Taj Mahal. He flies back to South Africa next week.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220702,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-175676,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/perfect-thanks-to-demolition-mann/articleshow/73219120.cms
84,['13/01/2020'],Police collect samples from 10 Kannauj victims for DNA test,"This story is from January 13, 2020

People gather near the charred bus.

CHHIBRAMAU: Hours after a private sleeper bus carrying over 60 people rolled out of a bus station in Kannauj at 8:05 pm on Friday and was left wrapped in flames after colliding head on with a truck, police collected 10 samples from charred bodies, including that of the truck driver, and sent them to a forensic lab for DNA profiling on Saturday. Nearly 16 injured passengers are undergoing treatment at separate hospitals, including Tirwa Medical College and Saushaiya Hospital in Kannauj.

Only one deceased has been identified so far, while the rest are unaccounted including family of five, a mother-daughter duo and a girl and police fear that most of them might have been trapped inside the bus and killed.

“On the basis of badly charred body parts, only the body of the truck driver, Ajay alias Rinku, of Kurawli Mainpuri has been identified by his maternal uncle,” said a senior police officer while talking to TOI.

However, inside the bus the bodies were so badly burnt and reduced to a heap of charred bones that it was virtually impossible to even count the bodies. Investigators suspect that the high temperature of the bus was apparently due to combustible foam and leather seat covers coupled with warm clothes which the passengers were wearing. Police are of the view that apart from 20 passengers, who have been accounted for, the remaining around 40 might have been killed.

Farrukhabad’s Kamalganj native Raees Ahmed sank down on the road in front of ill-fated bus after learning that his elder brother Laeeq Ahmed (42), his wife Shahida (40), their daughter Shadia (11) and their two sons Shaan (9) and Saif (7) are untraceable. “They had left the house at 4.30 pm and boarded the bus for Jaipur at around 6 pm near Razipur. They all have gone missing after the blaze,” said an inconsolable Raees.

Fifty-year-old Urmila, a native of Narainpur in Farrukhabad , said she along with her 20-year-old daughter Priya was going to Jaipur where they own a vegetable shop. As soon as the fire broke out, she somehow managed to escape by jumping off after breaking the window pane of the bus. After, the fire was doused, she has been looking for her daughter, but to no avail.

“I was sitting at the back side, while my daughter was sitting near the driver’s seat. I searched for her inside the bus, hospital and mortuary, but in vain, only God knows where she’s gone,” said Urmila, weeping inconsolably at the spot.

At the mishap site, one Zubair of Chhibramau, who was a bit lucky as his eight-year-old nephew survived the blaze, was frantically looking for his 35-year-old sister Noori and her 4-year-old daughter Samiya, who were travelling in the bus. “My nephew was lucky as he was rescued by some ‘Allah ka banda’, but his mother and elder sister are still missing. If Allah is merciful, we will find them alive,” said a tearful Zubair, still nursing hope of finding them alive.

“This is perhaps the worst tragedy of this nature where either victims have been reduced to ashes or only charred body parts were recovered,” said a police officer privy to the investigation.

Meanwhile, wails of inconsolable family members filled the air at the morgue. “Charred bodies of 10 people have been recovered from the completely-damaged bus,” said district magistrate Ravindra Kumar, adding that “one of the bodies has been identified as of Rinku Yadav (32), the driver of the truck which collided with the bus”.

Earlier, SP Amrendra Pratap Singh had said that around 20 people were feared to have lost their lives in the incident. Of the 16 injured, 13 are undergoing treatment at Tirwa Medical College while remaining are at Saushaiya hospital, he added.

IG Kanpur Mohit Agarwal said, “Both the bus and the truck caught fire after the collision and exact death toll can be established only after DNA tests.”

State’s excise minister Ram Naresh Agnihotri, who rushed to the district on the direction of the chief minister, met senior officials and also inspected the accident site. He met the injured undergoing treatment and handed over Rs 50,000 cheque to each of the nine injured admitted in Saushaiya hospital.

State Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu, too, met the injured in the hospital and assured them of all possible help.

ALLAHABAD: The Uttar Pradesh Rajashri Tandon Open University ( UPRTOU ), the only open university of the state, has launched an awareness campaign on the Citizenship Amendment Act and Article 370. These two topics will be part of the syllabus of a new three-month certificate course.

“The new course came into force on January 10 and the admissions have already begun,” said Prabhat Mishra, public relation officer of UPRTOU.

“The fee for the course is Rs 700. There is no limit to the number of students taking admission,” he added. Vice chancellor of the open university, professor Kameshwar Nath Singh, said, “No institution can remain aloof from the issues and policies of the country. There is immediate need to remove the fog of misconceptions surrounding the two burring issues—CAA and Article 370. It is the moral duty of the university to spread awareness among students and others in order to clear the fog.”

“Anyone who has completed intermediate, can get enrolled for the awareness course through online registration and can complete the same in three months along with the main course they are pursuing,” added Singh.

“UPRTOU runs courses based on the current issues of society. Students will be given assignments during the course, on the completion of which, certificates will be distributed to them,” informed the VC.

Pune: The Pune Cantonment Board has proposed to construct to commercial complex to boost its income.

The complexes would be build on a public-private partnership basis at prime locations in the PCB limits.

“We are in the process of appointing a transaction advisory agency, which will prepare the design of the complexes and look after other aspects of the project. So far, four agencies have expressed interest,” PCB chief executive officer Amit Kumar told TOI on Saturday.

The board has earmarked three locations — JJ Garden and Rani Laxmibai Garden on MG Road and Golibar Maidan on Shankarsheth Road. “These are prime locations and would prove beneficial for the commercial hubs, considering the current market scenario in these areas,” a senior PCB official said.

The board has been considering the development of multi-storey parking facility and commercial hubs, Kumar said. “But now, these projects cannot be executed due to the board’s weak financial position,” Kumar said, explaining the reasoning behind opting for the PPP model.

Officials said the board was struggling financially, with very few sources of revenue. “Monthly expenditure, including salaries and pension, comes close to Rs6 crore. PCB requires at least Rs2 crore to provide essential civic facilities to citizens. This means the board needs at least Rs8 crore per month, which is difficult currently. Unless the board creates multiple income sources, its financial position will not improve,” another PCB official said.

The projects are pending approval from the local military authority and the Army top brass. “The security aspects and other nitty-gritties related to the project would be scrutinized by the local military authority and the Southern Command before approval,” a PCB member said.

89,['13/01/2020'],Activists push for stronger law to curb acid attacks,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Pune: Last year, a 20-year-old third year engineering student was seriously injured in Maharashtra’s Gondia district when two motorcycle-borne men threw acid on her. Acid attacks in the country have risen despite amendments to the 2013 Act.

The open sale of acid was curbed to some extent after acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal filed a public interest litigation. A movie on her trials will be released this week. It chronicles Laxmi’s journey and how she fought against acid violence

Activists and lawyers feel the growing incidence of acid attacks clearly indicates that India needs a clearer, more objective and stringent law against the perpetrators.

The National Crime Records Bureau report of 2017 released in October last year registered 244 cases as against 222 cases in 2015 and 223 cases reported in 2016.

Uttar Pradesh topped with 56 cases, West Bengal reported 54 cases, national capital New Delhi was at the third spot with 14 cases and Kerala and Odisha had the fourth highest number of acid attacks at 13 cases each while Maharashtra reported six cases as per the data.

The current legal provisions do not take into account various injuries inflicted on the victim in an acid attack. The statute does not take into account the act of administering acid. Most importantly, it does not punish the intentional act of throwing acid if the victim suffers no injuries, lawyers and activists said.

Pune-based lawyer and activist for women’s rights Charmaine Anne D’souza said such cases should be treated in the same category as rape cases and culprits should be awarded a death penalty. “It kills the dignity and soul of the victim and so the same punishment should be awarded,’’she said.

Fast-track courts to expedite judgments within a year and medical benefits to the attacker are needed, she added. Awareness about rights and remedies for the victim should be spread wide, another lawyer said.

While the cabinet has decided to increase the compensation to Rs 10 lakh from the previous limit of Rs 3 lakh, these acid attack survivors have a long wait to receive the amount with a district legal board to clear these cases.

A single one-time compensation may not help as the state must focus on rehabilitation, a social worker working with the victims, said. Poor implementation of Manodhairya yojana for disbursing compensation to the survivor in the state does not help as the state has a dismal record on usage of funds, another activist said.

CM Yogi Adityanath

MUZAFFARNAGAR: The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to withdraw four more cases related to 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots and will soon move court for it. With this, the total number of cases that the UP plans to drop has reached 80. In all, 566 cases were filed before, during and after the August-September 2013 violence.

Labeling them politically motivated, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP government, soon after coming to power, had decided to withdraw the cases slapped against “innocent” people by the erstwhile SP government.

In most of the cases, the trial is going on and it’s on the court to decide if these could be dropped, officials said. According to the UP’s special law secretary Arun Rai, the government has asked the district authorities to file an appeal in local court to withdraw the four cases.

So far, no case has been dropped. Union minister Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, BJP MLA Sangeet Som and minister Suresh Rana are some of the BJP leaders facing charges in the riot cases. At least 62 people – 42 Muslims and 20 Hindus—were killed during the communal riots in 2013. Over 50,000 were also displaced.

91,['13/01/2020'],Fairy shrimps find a home in temporary rock pools on plateaus of Western Ghats,"This story is from January 13, 2020

The new species of fairy shrimp crustacean ‘Streptocephalus sahyadriensis’

PUNE: A new species of fairy shrimp crustacean called Streptocephalus sahyadriensis has been found recently in the temporary rock pools formed on the tableland, or Asia Plateau in Panchgani in the Western Ghats.

Also known as the Sahyadri Fairy Shrimp, the crustacean species was collected by two researchers —Yugandhar Shinde, an assistant professor at the department of zoology, Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce and Sameer Padhye — who have been studying such habitats in and around Pune.

These researchers from colleges and institutes across Pune have been studying temporary water habitats and the species they host since 2008. The species has so far only been recorded on few rocky outcrops of Satara.

Scientist Sameer Padhye, who works on freshwater crustaceans, described the species. He said what was interesting about the shrimp was its unique survival strategy.

“The shrimp survives in rocky pools formed in the monsoon on some of the rocky outcrops of the Western Ghats’. These pools get filled with water during the monsoon, and are dry for the most of the year. The eggs that these shrimp lay, can survive for the dry phase. Once the rocky pool is filled up again during the next monsoon, the eggs hatch allowing the species to once again populate the pool,” Padhye, who works with Zoo Outreach Organisation, said.

He has published his findings in the peer-reviewed journal Zootaxa. He added that the fairy shrimp is unique in terms of its morphological characteristics. Not only can the shrimp survive in fluctuating temperature conditions, but is also an endemic species. “So far, this species has only been recorded in pools on a few lateritic rocky outcrops in Satara.”

Padhye said rocky outcrops need to be studied further as rock pools host a variety of new and undescribed species.

“These habitats are formed only during the monsoon, and last for around a month after the monsoon. They’re home to very unique life forms and many are found only in such habitats. These animals are specifically adapted to survive in such ecosystems and their populations are restricted to these habitats. For instance, if you see them on rock pools on Tableland plateau, then there is a possibility that could be restricted to such habitats,” he said.

One of the biggest challenges in conservation of this species is habitat protection. “If the pool is completely destroyed, you lose that population and possibly the species itself. People are unaware of these species, which makes it tough to conserve them. Our aim is to tell them to study these habitats as they have tremendous biodiversity,” Padhye said.

KOCHI: The herculean task of bringing down three high-rises in the middle of the city without affecting the wealth or the health of the citizens wouldn’t have been complete without the concerted effort put in by police, fire force, district administration and the Maradu municipality .According to sources, over 500 police personnel were deployed to maintain law and order while 300 others were handling traffic when each demolition happened over the past two days. They were on duty even on Friday when a trial run was conducted ahead of the actual demolitions.A 13-member technical committee headed by Fort Kochi sub-collector Snehil Kumar Singh coordinated the activities from the district administration’s part while the city police commissionerate headed by IG Vijay Sakhare, DIG K P Philip and DCP G Poonguzhali executed the operation, almost perfectly. Fire force personnel, led by district fire officer Jogy A S, were mobilized from across the district with 113 personnel from 18 fire stations with all-sorts of equipment staying guard as the risky operation underwent. Maradu municipality played their part in the evacuation and awareness drives ahead of the demolition.Assistant commissioner of police Ernakulam K Laljy said that the biggest task for the police was to ensure a foolproof evacuation. “We had to take extra caution to ensure that no one was in that danger zone of 200 metres during the demolition. People were made to understand the situation before evacuation.Preventing people from coming back into this danger zone and ensuring that people were not enter places which are dangerous to view the demolition were another major tasks. All these, including traffic management, was done through great coordination by the city police chief and other senior officers,” said Laljy.Kadavanthaa SI Vibin Das, who was on duty near the demolition sites on Saturday and Sunday, said that crowd control was the trickiest part. “A great deal of effort was required to manage the crowd,” said Das.There was heavy deployment of fire force personnel too. “We were ready with all type of hydraulic equipment, scuba teams and rubber boats. Our personnel from different parts of Ernakulam camped in Maradu for three days to act swiftly in case of an emergency. Dust control was entrusted with the fire force, but the heavy deployment was not just for this,” said district fire officer Jogy A S.Maradu muncipality officials led by chairperson T H Nadeera were always in talks with the residents sharing their apprehensions and addressing them.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73221855,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-234827,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/coordination-proved-key-at-maradu/articleshow/73219132.cms

ALLAHABAD: A series of robberies on three trains important trains — Rajdhani Express , Sampoorn Kranti Express and Garib Rath Express — within a span of a few hours in Fatehpur late on Friday, has exposed the security arrangements on trains. FIRs have been lodged in connection with the robberies.

Armed robbers had escaped with mobile phones and cash of the passengers of the three trains between Malwa and Kustilkalan railway stations in Fatehpur district during wee hours of Saturday. They also robbed women passengers of gold ornaments and cash.

On Saturday, three special teams of Railway Protection Force (RPF) were constituted to crack the robberies.

Inspector (RPF) Fatehpur Praveen Singh said, “Special teams are collecting information on gangs of train robbers which have expertise in turning signals from green to red. Teams are carrying out raids in Fatehpur, Kanpur and Kaushambi. Government railway police (GRP) teams are also assisting RPF to crack the cases.”

“Robbers entered the AC compartment of Garib Rath Express at 12.48am on Saturday and looted cash and mobile phones from passengers. They then targeted Delhi-bound Rajdhani Express and Sampoorna Kranti Express after turning green signal to red,” Singh said.

“On the descriptions being given by the victims, the GRP and RPF teams are also preparing sketches of the suspects,” said an RPF official, adding that raids were on in different parts of Fatehpur as the robbery is being suspected to be a handiwork of a local gang.

RPF and GRP officials are also studying the modus operandi of the gang.

Inspector (RPF Allahabad) BP Singh said, “Teams from Allahabad are assisting Fatehpur RPF and the case would be worked out soon.”

DEHRADUN: After Haryana which started a monthly pension for acid attack survivors last year, Uttarakhand may also follow suit.

Rekha Arya, state minister of women and child welfare, told TOI on Sunday that the idea was still in the proposal stage and details are still being worked out, adding that the monthly pension amount could be in the range of Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000.

The minister added that the state has 10 acid attack survivors and they often meet her to demand for jobs and other facilities which is why, she thought of a scheme that can provide them financial aid.

“Acid attack doesn’t just burn the face of victims but also destroys their lives. Acid attack survivors keep telling me that they are being deprived of jobs because of their physical appearances. Even their families go bankrupt as a lot of money has to be spent on their treatment. We were planning to help these survivors and what could be a better way than giving them some monetary assistance,” said Arya.

She further added that her ministry will work on the proposal and forward it to the state government for approval shortly.

Last year, Haryana government implemented a scheme under which monthly pension ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 9,000 is being disbursed to acid attack survivors on the basis of percentage of disability so as to provide them a continuous source of income. If the survivor is a minor, then her parents or guardian can apply for pension on her behalf.

Burnt out remains of the bus

Kanpur: To ascertain the exact toll and identity of people who were charred to death after a bus and a truck caught fire following a collision in Kannauj on Friday, police have started collecting DNA samples of the relatives of people who boarded the ill-fated bus.

Additional superintendent of police Vinod Kumar said, “So far, we have collected nine samples of persons related to the deceased. The samples will be sent to forensic lab in Lucknow for DNA profiling.”

Police had collected 10 samples from charred bodies, including that of the truck driver, for DNA profiling on Saturday.

A senior police official said the blaze was so intense that even the bones of victims melted and got stuck with steel fixtures of the bus.

Preliminary findings revealed that 9-10 people were trapped inside the bus.

Nazim (40), an embroidery worker, whose wife Noori (35) and four-year-old daughter Samiya were killed in the blaze, reached Kannauj from Jaipur to give his DNA sample.

“I went to the SDM’s office on Sunday with my brother-in-law Zubair. Officials asked me to submit an application and asked about the persons I am looking for. I have no idea if any remains of my wife and daughter were found. Officials told me that DNA sample is the one way to find out if they were in the bus or not,” he told TOI.

According to injured bus passengers, there were around 60 people, including 7-8 minors in the bus but cops are of the view that about 45 passengers were in the vehicle when the incident took place.

A forensic science expert said burnt items like utensils, plastic suitcases, containers, leather bags, grocery items loaded in the truck would help in ascertaining if a chemical triggered the blaze.

“We carried out a detailed study of the spot and collected samples. An electric short-circuit could have led to the mishap,” he said, adding the exact cause of fire would only be ascertained the investigation was over.

At least 20 people were feared dead in the massive fire that broke out after a head-on collision between a private sleeper bus and a truck near the Ghiloi village under Chhibramau police station of Kannauj.

Of the 21 injured passengers, thirteen jumped from the burning bus to save their lives.

Golden Kayaloram was demolished using controlled implosion at Maradu on Sunday

KOCHI: Though dust clouds rose during the implosion to bring down Jains Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram , favourable winds ensured that the dust settled very fast.

Pollution control board officials said emissions were observed as expected. The dust in cloud form was noticed at about 200m radius and 50m in height of Jains Coral Cove. The emissions dispersed to normalcy within 30 minutes. No debris was seen disposed into the backwaters. The maximum sound level recorded at Jains was 115 dB while it was around 107 dB at Golden Kayaloram.

A cloud of dust in brown colour was seen at about 100m diametre and 50m in height after the demolition of Golden Kayaloram. The emissions dispersed to normal within 30 minutes and the wind direction observed was towards east and northeast directions.

“We are doing a detailed study to assess approximate quantum of dust emanated due to demolition and the study will be completed within a week. While no debris was seen falling into backwaters in the Sunday demolition, we will be doing a post monitoring of water in the backwaters too,” said M A Baiju, chief environmental engineer.

He said that common directive will be issued to parties engaged in the removal of debris asking them to follow the environment protection rules so that dust and sound are under control. Regular inspection and monitoring will be continued to ensure no further pollution is there due to demolition activities. The PCB had already formed a team to monitor pollution occurrence and to coordinate pollution control activities due to these demolition episodes.

Prof C T Aravindakumar, school of environment sciences, MG University, said that unlike yesterday, the winds were unidirectional and helped in clearing the dust. “However, the dust particles from Golden Kayaloram were really fine and could be around 400 microns per cubic meter when it started spreading,” he said.

Maradu municipality councillors Bindu Prasanth of Ward 6 and T K Devarajan of Ward 2 said the dust subsided by evening. “There is not much trouble now,” said Devarajan. Ajitha Kumari, councillor of Ward 23 said, “When Jains Coral Cove was demolished, the wind brought dust towards Santhivanam area. However, by evening it subsided, and we don’t have much issues here.”

Xavier Mathan, a resident who stays next to Jains Coral Cove, said dust was carried away by the wind soon and hence they did not face any lasting trouble.

MEERUT: Days after a bullion trader was robbed of cash and jewelry, scores of traders in the city took out a march to protest the deteriorating law and order situation in the city. Earlier on Saturday, trade associations had staged a sit-in at the office of the SP (city), near Ghantaghar.

The protests have been triggered by police “inaction” in the robbery case, with breakthrough as yet. On December 17, 2019, a bullion trader who owns a jewelry shop in Meerut ’s posh Central Market was robbed of jewelry and cash worth over Rs 30 lakh.

The brazen daylight robbery sent local traders in panic mode, till police assured them of immediate recovery of the loot and arrest of all accused. Yet, after over 20 days, they are yet to land a breakthrough in the case. This has irked city trade associations, who are on the warpath, demanding immediate action in cases involving cheating, fraud and loot of city businessmen.

“Meerut is a hub of bullion trade in the region. But now, outstation traders are afraid, which is adversely affecting local business. If these incidents against local businessmen are not solved quickly, it will negatively affect trading in the city,” said Vijay Anand Agrawal, general secretary of Meerut Bullion Traders Association, in a memorandum submitted to SP (city) Akhilesh Narayan Singh.

Senior cops claimed efforts are underway to solve the case at the earliest. “We’ve identified the gang behind the Central Market incident. The suspects are also being identified. They’ll be arrested soon,” said the SP (city).

KANPUR: Local residents of Ghiloi in Chhibramau have declared as “haunted” the site of Friday night accident in which a passenger bus and a truck were burnt to ashes and several lives were lost, and decided to hold a “havan to ward off evil spirits on the advice of elders”.

The spot where more than 20 people were killed in the blaze on Friday night, has witnessed two back-to-back accidents in a couple of days.

As per police, in the first mishap, which took place on late Friday night, seven people were injured when a Bolero vehicle rammed into a truck, while in the second incident which took place on Sunday morning, 10 persons were injured after a van and a loader had a head-on collision.

The first accident occurred when the Bolero had rammed into a truck that was stuck in a jam near Ghiloi following Friday night mishap that claimed several lives. The seven occupants of the vehicle were returning from Bewar area of Mainpuri , where they had gone to participate in the ‘terhanvi’ (ritual held on the 13th day of death) of their relative.

Similarly, the mishap that was reported on Sunday morning, a van which was carrying nine persons and heading towards Bairagpur Nabiganj area from Birauli area of the district collided head-on with the loader coming from the opposite direction near Ghiloi. A loader driver also suffered injuries in the mishap, said Inspector Chhibramau Shailendra Kumar Mishra.

“All injured, including victims of late Friday night and Sunday morning accidents have been undergoing treatment at Tirwa medical college,"" informed nayab tehsildar Saurabh Yadav.

Meanwhile, locals have decided to perform ‘ havan ’ and religious rituals in the area on Monday on suspicion that the mishap site was haunted by ghosts.

“Our elders have advised us to perform havan near the mishap site to free it of evil spirits,” said Manoj a local, who added, “More than 20 people have lost their lives, besides 38 others have sustained wounds in three separate mishaps since Friday night, which in itself is very strange. As per the elders, if the prayers were performed, the evil spirits would go away and would not return.”

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Addressing a rally in favour of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Union minister and BJP MP Sanjeev Baliyan said, “What’s wrong with CAA ? Earlier, Hindu immigrants got citizenship in 11 years. Now, they will be able to get it in five years. Pakistan had 23% Hindus, which has fallen to 3.7%. In Bangladesh, the number has fallen from 24% to 7%. Who were those masked men who carried out the violence in Muzaffarnagar on December 20?”

Thousands of people gathered at the field of Rajkiya Inter College, and were addressed by BJP leaders including Baliyan and UP Cabinet minister Chetan Chauhan on CAA. Baliyan said, “CAA will provide citizenship to migrants who have come from three countries. But some people are spreading rumours.”

He later told media: “Today, Muzffaranagar’s citizens showed they are with CAA.” Reacting to Priyanka Gandhi’s visit to homes of the victims of violence in Muzaffarnagar, he said, “She wants to do vote bank politics. She visited homes of those who were involved in violence. What does she want to prove? There is a fight over the Muslim vote bank, which is leaving Muslims confused.”

Chetan Chauhan said, “Everywhere, people have come to support CAA in Muzaffarnagar.” Speaking on the Muzaffarnagar violence he said, “People who vandalised public property and were involved in stone-pelting will be punished. Notices to recover damages have been sent. If they don’t have that much money, their properties will be auctioned to recover costs.”

Later, holding a banner of slogans in favour of CAA, thousands of protestors took out a march, in the presence of heavy police deployment.

In Bijnor, thousands of Hindus holding national flags and slogans walked in support of CAA, under aegis of Samajik Samrasta Manch (social harmony forum) of RSS. Over 4,000 people gathered at Exhibition ground and marched to instill social harmony among those opposing CAA. Addressing the gathering, chief guest Mahesh Chandra, vibhag sanghchalak of RSS, said, “CAA is not against anyone and will not take away citizenship of those who are Indian. It will bring relief to those who are being oppressed and persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.”

Thousands of protesters were also spotted at a march in Shamli in support of CAA.

Dehradun: The state government has decided to install synthetic turf at the Pavilion Ground after requests from the District Football Association (DFA). The move will give a boost to the sport as currently, Dehradun doesn’t have a single football ground with synthetic turf. Pavilion Ground is the main football ground of the city and the decision to install synthetic turf has excited members of the football community here.

“It is a much-needed boost to the sport. Pavilion Ground is the go-to ground for football and it needed a synthetic turf. Currently, higher-level football is played on synthetic turf and it was necessary that at least our premier ground possessed it. We have requested CM to give financial assistance to host a couple of major national tournaments. Also, we have asked to let Dehradun host football matches of the National Games 2021,” said Mohammad Usman Khan, DFA secretary.

Naveen Singh, a footballer with a Doon-based club, said, “The decision will help Pavilion Ground achieve standards of an international ground. Currently, due to poor facilities in the state, Uttarakhand has faced difficulties in hosting major national tournaments. The synthetic turf doesn’t ask for much maintenance and it is used in almost all national-level and international-level matches.”

Jaipur: Despite being a bit expensive than the locally made kites, Bareilly kites are a rage among the kite lovers here. Though kites from both the cities look similar, a careful look will reveal the differences between the two.

Abdul Khaleel, a kite seller at Handipura said that Bareilly kites are of superior quality than their Jaipur counterparts. “Look closely. The bamboo sticks used in Jaipur kites are rough whereas those in Bareilly kites are smooth intact with a tape. The Jaipur kites do not have tape which actually gives a grip to the string when attached to the kite” said Khaleel.

The quality of paper used in the Bareilly kites is also better than that used in the locals ones, this keeps it flying for a longer time. Bareilly kites have simple patterns whereas Jaipur kites have colourful ones. Rashid Khan, another kite seller in Haldiyon ka Raasta said, “Kite lovers always ask for Bareilly kites though they are a bit expensive. They stay longer in the air and do not get torn easily. Children usually fly Jaipur kites while those passionate about the kites buy Bareilly kites.”

Even the charkhi (spool) from Bareilly is made of wood and more durable with a better finish. Whereas, Jaipur-made charkhis are usually of plastic and always in demand due to their cheaper rates.

Apart from Bareilly and Jaipur kites, Chinese kites can also be seen in the market. Chinese kites are made of plastic cloth with plastic sticks and are of different shapes. Rehman Malik, seller of Chinese kites in Handipura says that people who are passionate about the craft purchase these kites albeit they cost between Rs 150 and Rs 500.

“These kites can be seen at the kite festival that is celebrated on Makar Sankranti in Chaughan Stadium every year. It has a niche market and are not bought on a regular basis. People from all over the city come looking for these kites,” said Rehman.

Kakinada: Tensions refused to subside in Kakinada on the second day after YSRC and Jana Sena cadre clashed over Kakinada city MLA Dwarampudi Chandrasekhar Reddy’s derogatory comments against Jana Sena chief Pawan Kalyan at a public meet on Saturday.

The day began with Jana Sena party workers and leaders assembling at Bhanugudi centre to protest and they then took out a rally; a few of them held a rasta roko and squatted near the MLA’s house following which YSRC workers allegedly pelted them with stones and attacked Jana Sena workers with sticks, who then retaliated. Several cadre of both parties sustained injuries and were admitted to the Kakinada General Hospital and a few private hospitals. A few Jana Sena workers were arrested by the police for laying seige to the MLA’s house.

Jana Sena party leaders have alleged that police failed to control the YSRC cadre and did not deploy the required forces even though they knew that Jana Sena workers may try to reach the house of the MLA. They also alleged that police arrested only Jana Sena workers.

Talking to the TOI, Jana Sena political affairs’ committee member and chief official spokesperson Kandula Durgesh said Jana Sena cadre had taken out a peaceful rally and some of the party workers had squatted in front of Chandrasekhar Reddy’s house. He claimed that the ‘goons’ of the MLA were prepared with stones and sticks and attacked the Jana Sena cadre indiscriminately. He said that a woman party leader has suffered a fracture in her hand.

Meanwhile, Peddapuram DSP Srinivasa Rao, who is monitoring the situation, said that trouble started when Jana Sena workers neared the MLA’s house and tried to burn his effigy. The stones that were pelted at each other were those kept to lay the road, he said. He said cases will be filed based on probe report.

BHOPAL: Despite opening of multilevel parking, New Market — the commercial hub of Bhopal — remains one of the most congested area to drive through or even walk. Two years after the market was declared no-go areas for motorised vehicles, the situation has little but improved for pedestrians. Vehicle-free markets is one of the primary components of smart city plan.The civic body has been lax on enforcement of no-vehicle zone, shoppers at the market say. “The idea was to provide ease to the pedestrians. With additional spaces, the market footpaths have been encroached by illegal vendors and illegal extension of the shops,” said Farheen Khan, a regular shopper at the market.BMC staffers — mostly contractual — are entrusted with enforcing the ban on movement of vehicles within the market. BMC ward official R K Sinha said, “The enforcement of no-vehicle zone is handled by BMC anti-encroachment wing. We are not aware of any complications or inconvenience to pedestrians.”At any given point of the day, over 200 vehicles can be seen parked right inside the market. Even the provision of adequate parking lots in the vicinity and the BMC barriers have failed to stop two-wheelers from gaining entry to the narrow lanes of the market.BMC officials are still hopeful for revitalization plan of the New Market under the smart city development with a Rs-5-crore project which is expected to make the zone vehicle-free and pedestrian-friendly. 50% of the project has been completed.“Our policy would encourage setting up of a organised hawkers zone to benefit not just the hawkers but also to ensure that the general public does not face any inconvenience. Cleanliness and impact on local colonies will be paramount,” said a BMC official. It would also increase the revenue of the BMC.On weekends, there are more than one lakh vehicles that require parking space at New Market. The core commercial space was one of the best planned locations of the city.

PUNE: The Bhosari police on Sunday arrested a 21-year-old man from Dapodi for murdering his 17-year-old friend and dumping the body on the Savitribai Phule Pune University campus on Saturday night.

Police said the suspect, an unemployed school dropout — committed the crime to demand a Rs40 lakh ransom from the murdered teenager’s father as he wanted to buy a fancy car. According to the police, the suspect lured the victim to a liquor party on Saturday night, strangulated him and got rid of the body.

The suspect then placed ransom calls to the boy’s father.

“We have arrested Umar Nasir Shaikh, who was a good friend of the victim, Abdul Ahad Sayad Siddiqui — a std XII student of a junior college in Camp,” senior police inspector Shankar Awatade said. “During questioning, Shaikh admitted to the murder and led the police to the spot where he dumped the body,” Awatade added.

Awatade said both were from the same neighbourhood in Dapodi. The investigation found that the duo would often go to the same spot to have drinks. “They went to the spot five-six times, drink some beer and return home,” Awatade said.

Siddiqui’s father runs a scrap business in the area, while Shaikh’s father is a vegetable vendor. Late on Saturday night, Siddiqui’s father received a call twice from an unknown caller, who claimed to have kidnapped

his son and demanded Rs40 lakh for his release. “The father had recorded this call. The family members found the caller’s voice quite familiar, but could not identify it. They then called a couple of Siddiqui’s friends and played the recorded call to them. The friends identified the voice as Shaikh’s. A police team detained him,” Awatade said.

“Shaikh was driven to the crime by a strong desire to buy a big car and was under the impression that Siddiqui’s father earned lot of money from his business,” Awatade said, adding that they were still questioning him on why he placed the “ransom” call after the murder.

“Shaikh told police that he had watched a South Indian crime thriller earlier in the day. He got the idea from the movie that he could kidnap his friend and earn quick money to buy a car,” Awatade said.

According to the police, Shaikh called up Siddiqui around 8.30pm on Saturday and asked him to accompany him for drinks at the spot. “He picked up Siddiqui from home. Riding Shaikh’s motorcycle, the duo reached the spot, which is near a compound wall that separates the IUCAA facility and the animal husbandry department near SPPU. The duo sat near some bushes and drank some liquor,” Awatade said.

Soon after, Shaikh throttled Siddiqui. “Shaikh threw the body on the SPPU premises and then placed a ransom call to his family, seeking Rs40 lakh in exchange for the teenager’s release,” Awatade said. “Siddiqui’s family belongs to an economically backward class. His stunned father immediately approached the police after getting the ransom call,” Awatade said.

Madras high court

MADURAI: After reviewing the video recording of the height measurements, Madras high court has overturned the decision of Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board ( TNUSRB ) disqualifying two candidates for not fulfilling the height requirement for the recruitment of grade II police constable, grade II jail warden and fireman.

The court asked the board to proceed with the further selection process, saying both these candidates have passed the height measurement test.

The candidates, K Jansirani and M Ayyambose, had moved the court seeking to quash the TNUSRB order and sought to permit them to participate in the physical endurance test and other recruitment process.

Justice M S Ramesh observed that since the petitioners were aggrieved at the measurement of height conducted by the officials, the court had permitted them to participate in the re-measurement conducted on December 11. Since the petitioners were still not satisfied, the court on December 16 permitted them to view the video recording of the re-measurement in the presence of the registrar (judicial) of the court who also submitted a report the next day.

Justice Ramesh said he had reviewed the video recording and it was seen that the height measurement of Jansirani is between 156.7cm and 156.8cm and that of Ayyambose between 169.7cm and 169.8cm. The judge said the fraction which is over 156.7cm is closer to 156.8cm and that over 169.7cm is closer to 169.8cm.

“Therefore, the height of Jansirani and Ayyambose could be ascertained as 156.8cm and 169.8cm respectively,” observed the judge.

The court said that by applying the guidelines in the GO passed by home department on November 19, 2014, a fraction of 0.2cm could be extended to the petitioners. Hence the height of Jansirani can be determined as 157cm which is the minimum height required for women candidates belonging to scheduled caste community and the height of Ayyambose as 170cm, the minimum required height for male candidates.

Since both the petitioners have passed the height measurement test, the judge directed TNUSRB to subject both these petitioners to further stages of selection process in accordance with procedure laid down in recruitment notification and closed these petitions.

Pune: Incessant rains on Saturday took a toll on flight operations at the Dubai International Airport leading an almost two-hour delay of a SpiceJet flight from Pune to the emirate in the evening.

Passengers on board had to be seated inside the aircraft for an hour after landing.

An airline representative, while answering to the query on Twitter, wrote, “The flight (SG-51) from Pune to Dubai was initially delayed due to operational reasons and further got affected due to bad weather in Dubai.”

A SpiceJet spokesperson told TOI, “The rain, as a result of a thunderstorm in Dubai yesterday, has caused massive congestion on the airside while hampering the normal functioning of the airport and airline operators.”

“The flight from Pune was supposed to take off at around 7:50pm. However, it did so at around 9:40pm and landed in Dubai at around 11:45pm (GST). On landing, it seemed as if the aircraft didn’t get its desired parking spot and all passengers had to sit in the aircraft for an hour. I lost my luggage as well,” Varun Velhankar, a passenger, told TOI.

The Dubai Airport’s twitter handle said on Saturday, “Operations at Dubai (DXB) continue to be hampered by the knock-on effects of today’s heavy rainfall resulting in a number of flight delays, cancellations and diversions. We continue to work closely with our partners to restore full operations and minimize inconvenience to our customers. However, with additional rain expected later this evening, the disruption is expected to continue for the next 24 hours. Customers are advised to check directly with their airlines for more specific flight information and allow additional time to get to the airport.”

Air India had cancelled four of its flights to Dubai from Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai on Saturday. “While AI-905 (Chennai-Dubai) landed in Dubai, the aircraft took nearly five hours to reach to the parking bay. Also, AI-937 (Calicut-Dubai) was not able to land and was diverted to Al-Makhtoum airport,” AI spokesperson Dhananjay Kumar said.

Madurai: Madras high court has dismissed a woman’s petition to declare her as the panchayat president of Punavasal village in Ramanathapuram district as her name was published as winner in the official website of the state election commission.

Petitioner S Nagarani stated that another woman candidate, A Devaki, who was favoured by the ruling AIADMK, had also contested for the post. After the counting of votes, the election officer declared her as winner in the presence of the election observer and started preparing the certificates in her name. Her name was also published in the official website of the state election commission as the elected representative for the post of panchayat president of the village. However, she stated that the election officer subsequently issued form 25, the certificate declaring the winner, to Devaki. Hence the petitioner moved the high court seeking to declare the election official’s action as illegal and declare her as the candidate elected to the post.

A division bench of Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice T Ravindran observed that the petition cannot be entertained since it was filed without exhausting the alternative remedy available under section 258 (filing an election petition before district court) of Tamil Nadu Panchayats Act, 1994. While dismissing the petition, the judges observed that the issues involved in it are matter for evidence and the same cannot be decided in this petition.

Madurai: It has been four years since the work on a community hall began in Vasudevanallur near Sivagiri in the newly formed Tenkasi district, but has been stuck owing to lack of funds.

Construction work, which was taken up by Tirunelveli district administration, on the main hall at a cost of Rs 30 lakh was completed 20 months ago. Villagers have been running from pillar to post urging the government to complete the construction works and open the hall for public use.

P Suresh, 23, a social worker from Vasudevanallur, who has been petitioning district authorities and chief minister cell, had obtained a reply last year from the district collector stating that the hall has not been opened for want of construction of kitchen, compound wall and dining hall. Work will resume after obtaining fund to the tune of Rs 40 lakh from the state government, the collector had stated. Suresh says that he is getting the same reply even now.

“Public money is rotting away for two years now. The building will dilapidate if it is not attended to and brought to public use. Immediately fund should be allocated. The money spent on this hall can be earned within a year as there would be many takers for it,” he said.

Vasudevanallur panchayat union consists of 18 wards and has around 30,000 people. There are two temples in Vasudevanallur- Chinathamani Nathar and Venkatachalapathi temples. Many marriages are conducted in Chinathamani Nathar temple. Villagers said that whenever there is an inspection by higher officials, overgrowth around the hall is cleared, but are reluctant to take up the work. They demanded the district collector of newly formed Tenkasi district to take it up with the state government and complete the work.

Jaipur: Two bikers were injured after they rode through snapped manjha kite strings here on Sunday.

According to Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital, there has been an increased flow of people with kite string injuries at the Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (ITO).

A 60-year-old Chiranjilal and 45-year-old Vinod Saini on Sunday had a close save after being cut by `manjha’ of snapped kites when they were riding their bikes. It was a horrific incident for them as they narrated their ordeal.

Vinod Saini ($%) of Sodala was riding his bike along with his wife for shopping in Walled City. When he reached Sarga Suli area, a snapped kite string came from nowhere and cut his nose. “The feeling was like being cut with a sharp knife. I somehow managed not to lose control over my motorbike,” said Saini.

Since he knew that a four-year-old boy had died following an injury on his throat caused by a snapped kite string on December 22, he took precautions before moving out of the house. “I am aware about the fact that riding a motorbike is not safe. Because of that, I covered my neck with a scarf. I was wearing a helmet and despite that, the string cut my nose. It was bleeding profusely. Blood stains are all around my scarf,” said Saini. He got three stitches on his nose at ITO.

Chiranjilal (60) of Goner Road also got a cut on his nose due to a kite string. “I am fortunate that the kite string cut my nose not my throat,” he said, while showing blood stains on his jacket. The incident happened between Badi Chauper and Tripolia. He was riding a bike with his son in pillion.

ITO doctors said kite strings has become a menace in the city and the flow of injured continued all day. Doctors said such cases had been pouring in for the past 15 to 20 days. The hospital has decided to deploy extra doctors and make special arrangements to deal with such cases during the kite festival on Tuesday.

PUNE: The civic body has started a drive to make 11 arterial roads free of hawkers, but activists fear that the initiative might end up being more talk than walk.Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials said the initiative aimed at making these roads, including the ever-busy Laxmi Road, FC road, JM Road, Bajirao Road, Shivaji Road, Sinhagad Road, Karve Road, Kumthekar Road, Shatri Road, Tilak Road and Ahmednagar road, free of congestions.“All illegal hawkers will be removed from the roadside, while measures such as fixing points of hawking on these roads will also be taken,” a PMC official said.The PMC had in 2007-08 planned to make 45 major roads and 108 crossings free of hawking. The project was introduced to ensure hassle-free commute for the citizens and proper utilization of the hawking zones. The initiative, however, had failed to yield any result.Madhav Jagtap, head of the PMC’s anti-encroachment department, said the drive this time would be carried out in association with the traffic police. “Besides removing the illegal hawkers and encroachments, traffic management will be a key aspect of the drive to decongest the roads,” he said.“The civic administration has approached the traffic police to look into this aspect. Continuous monitoring on the roads with heavy presence of hawkers will be a key aspect of the initiative,” Jagtap said.PMC officials said the drive would focus on all major roads in the city and their surrounding streets. After the successful implementation of the initiative on 11 roads, the drive would be expanded to other areas.“The drive has been started. It will be carried out in association with the local ward offices for around a month,” an official said.The civic activists have welcomed the initiative, but expressed apprehensions about the outcome. “If the civic administration is taking steps to ensure congestion-free roads, then we must appreciate its efforts. But the plans should prove effective on the ground,’ said Vivek Velankar of citizens’ group Sajag Nagrik Manch.“Previous announcements, such as finalizing five roads for the parking zone project, have remained on paper. The plan to make 45 roads hawker-free also did not become a reality. However, the civic body’s plan to shift hawkers from roads like Laxmi Road appears a tough task. These areas are popular market place. The vendors will resist such moves,” he said.Prashant Inamdar of Pedestrians’ First said, “The drive should be of permanent nature and not fizzle out after a temporary or one-time action. It should continue round-the-clock for 365 days. Measures should be taken to ensure that new hawkers do not take over the spaces vacated. The use of the hawking zones should be made mandatory.”",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73222276,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135383,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-plans-to-rid-11-streets-of-hawkers/articleshow/73219224.cms

Madurai: For residents of Karumbalai in Anna Nagar, good roads and clean environment are a dream. Ask them when was the last time a new road was laid and they look at each other for answers as none of them remember such an activity in recent memory. Most of the residents are daily wage labourers and poor people who live with this blatant denial of basic amenities .

Elaborating on the state of roads, residents point to Middle Street, a long and narrow stretch connecting Sathyamoorthy Nagar and Karumbalai Main Road in KK Nagar used by hundreds of people regularly. J Sankaranarayanan, a resident of the street, said the road has become narrow at many places and the structure itself is missing on a couple of stretches. Officials should come forward to remove encroachments and lay fresh road. “Officials are turning a blind eye towards areas in Karumbalai. We also want the same kind of attention received by other localities. While complaints from other areas are attended to immediately, our area is not getting the same treatment,” he said.

P Maduraiveeran, a resident of Sathyamoorthy Nagar, said that in the absence of dumper bins people leave garbage openly at the old toilet building. It is an eyesore and creates sanitation issues to those residing nearby. “Although corporation employees come for door-to-door waste collection in the morning, a lot of garbage is being dumped here since most of the people leave houses early in the morning for work. Bins should be placed at a few places to manage such waste,” he said.

He also urged corporation officials to raze the old toilet building so that the space can be utilised by the children to play kabaddi. There are a large number of children in Karumbalai, but they do not have an open space to play. Since the place is notorious for anti-social elements, only sports can channelize children away from the evil path, he said.

Residents have also urged officials to ensure cleanliness of the toilet available at Sathyamoorthy Nagar as it is stinking due to poor maintenance. An official of Madurai corporation told TOI that they will visit the area and take necessary action after consulting the residents.

Residents stage protest after their bikes were found burnt

BHOPAL: Unidentified accused set ablaze 13 motorcycles at Kolar colony in Chunna Bhatti on Saturday late night.

Infuriated by the incident, the residents of the locality staged protest with the charred vehicles on Sunday morning for around two hours, bringing the traffic to a standstill. The alleged delayed response on part of the fire brigade and also of the police. They said the teams were “too slow” in reaching the spot. They also demanded improved police patroling and CCTV surveillance in the area. The road was cleared after senior police officials reached the spot and ensured fast detection in the case.

Habibganj CSP, Bhupendra Singh said that the fire may have been triggered due to bonfire nearby but exact cause will be known after thorough investigation.

Chunna Bhatti SHO Chaain Singh Raghuvanshi said that police and corporator of the area addressed their issues. No CCTVs are installed near the spot and investigations are underway to nab the accused. About the alleged delayed response by police, the SHO said that there was no laxity on part of the police team and in any case it takes 15 to 20 minutes to reach the spot.

Complainant Ram Gopal Nayak’s son Deepak who lost his bike in the incident, told TOI that around 2am, they heard a loud horn sound outside their homes.

“When we went out to check it, truck drivers informed us about the fire. We rushed to check and were shocked to find that around eight to ten motorcycles were burning. We informed police on Dial-100 and later the fire brigades were also alerted. Police reached the spot some 15 to 20 minutes of the incident,” said Nayak.

Deepak said that the local residents had doused the fire after which the fire brigade arrived with three fire tenders. By then, 10 motorcycles were already charred and three were partially burnt. Complainant Nayak said that he had bought his bike around two months back and blamed lack of security in the area for the incident.

Kolar fire station shift in-charge Lakha Ram said that as soon as they received information about the fire, a fire brigade was rushed to the spot. “We received information too late about the incident,” he said.

124,['13/01/2020'],"‘Widow of Silence’, personal stories of women in Kashmir, to do the talking at film festival","This story is from January 13, 2020

Praveen Morchhale (left), director of the movie, interacts with Samar Nakhate

PUNE: Praveen Morchhale knew the subject he was approaching before making ‘Widow of Silence’ was intensely political. But, he was insistent that it would not be just another political film about affairs in the Kashmir Valley.

“I was never interested in the political side of the issue. I wanted to know and film the personal stories of the half-widows. In a conflict zone, women and children are the silent sufferers, which is why I chose this story,” he said, as part of an interaction at NFAI, which will host his film as part of the Pune International Film Festival (PIFF).

As is visible in Morchhale’s film and in numerous academic and media reports, the “half-widows” in Kashmir are caught between a rock and a hard place, with information about their missing husbands and hope — both in scarcity. The husbands were either picked up by militants or security forces and were never seen again, without any sign of dead bodies or birth certificates. The state never declares them dead, resulting in confusion and an abject sense of absurdity for people left behind, Morchhale said.

The problem was of a scale so large that the Islamic clerics in Kashmir issued an edict in 2013 that allowed half-widows to remarry if their husbands had been missing for four years or more. In the film, Morchhale tells the story Aasiya, played by the theatre actress Shilpi Marwaha. Her husband is missing for over seven years and her efforts to survive with her daughter and mother-in-law are interspersed with a friend-turned-potential suitor at a tea stall and a corrupt registrar nearby.

“I had read about half-widows in a newspaper and I went to Kashmir to meet some of them. They asked why I wanted to make a film about them. They said, ‘Nobody considers us alive.’ That had me convinced that I should make the film,” he said while interacting with PIFF’s creative director Samar Nakhate.

The film has limited dialogue and no background music, making the silence do the talking in the evocative landscape of Dras. Morchhale is influenced by Iranian filmmakers, where nature itself is a character in the film. His cinematographer Mohammed Reza Jahanpanah is also Iranian. “We did 241 shots, out of which 240 were used. My understanding with the cinematographer worked well. The editing was pretty easy too. We just had to line the shots up and do some minor trimming,” he said.

Morchhale said he had to fight with the Central Board of Film Certification over the film. “They didn’t even want to rate it at first and had many questions along with many cuts. We had an answer for everything. As for a theatrical release, I don’t know whether distributors would be interested. Everything is now on calculators, finding out how much money the film will make,” he told TOI.

Representative image

PUNE: A 17-year-old student from Sinhagad Road was tricked into paying Rs1.94 lakh after an unidentified woman threatened to expose the minor’s information on an online dating site.

The Class XII student made the payments between February and August last year with his mother’s debit and credit card, an officer from the Sinhagad police said.

“The student’s ordeal began last year in February, when he created his profile on a virtual dating site and began talking to a woman there. Few days later, when the woman came to know that he was a minor, she threatened to reveal his profile details to his parents. She also told him that she will lodge a complaint with the police, following which he would be arrested,” the officer said.

Distressed and not wanting his parents to know about his dating profile, the student agreed to the woman’s demand of transferring her money.

“He made the transfer of Rs1.94 lakh by using his mother’s debit and credit card. He used to delete the transaction message from his mother’s cellphone after every payment,” the officer said.

Last month, the mother came to know of one such transaction made from her account and went to the bank. When she found that Rs1.94 lakh had been debited from her account through multiple transactions over the last few months, she asked her husband about it. “He said he had no part in the development. She then asked his son, who narrated his ordeal to her,” the officer added.

The mother, who is private company employee, then lodged a complaint with the Sinhagad police.

The unidentified woman was booked on Saturday under sections sections 419 (cheating by impersonation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.

The officer said the police were in the process of tracing the details of the bank account where the money was transferred. “Our probe is on,” the officer added.

Bhopal: Not paying outstanding power bills may now lead to suspension of your gun licences.

The central zone discom -- Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (MPMKVVCL) -- which had implemented such a plan in Gwalior and Chambal regions, home to the largest number of people with licensed weapons, has shown improvement in its revenue collection. Enthused with the improvement in revenue collection, the central zone discom has urged district collectors in all districts of the division to suspend gun licences of the defaulting consumers.

Central zone discom is headquartered at the state capital and supplies power to 16 districts, including Bhopal and districts coming under Gwalior and Chambal divisions of the state.

The per unit revenue recovery or the average amount that the central zone power distribution company earns on sale of each unit of power is lowest in areas coming under its Gwalior region. It is the same region where people are known for their penchant for weapons and area is home to largest number of people with licensed weapons.

Though there has been significant improvement in revenue generation as well as reduction of distribution losses (power loss in transmission and distribution) of the central zone discom in this financial year, the discom is putting in more effort to further better its revenue.

The average revenue per unit in the districts coming under Gwalior region of the discom was only Rs 1.98 per unit in March last year, but with sustained efforts, it has now increased to Rs 2.34 per unit in December last year.

There has been significant improvement in overall revenue generation, too, wherein overall average per unit revenue generation of the central discom was only Rs 2.49 in March 2019, which increased to Rs 2.89 per unit in December 2019.

When contacted over the issue, managing director of the central zone discom, Vishesh Gadhpale, said, “All district collectors have been asked to suspend the gun licences of the defaulting consumers. If a consumer can afford to have a weapon, why can’t he pay his power bills?”

“There has been improvement on all parameters in this financial year. Efforts are being made to improve it further,” he added.

In Overall Central Zone Discom

Billing Efficiency increased from 63.33% (March-19) to 71.36 % in Dec-19

Revenue per unit increased from Rs. 2.49 (March-19) to Rs. 2.89 in Dec-19

In Gwalior Region of Central Zone Discom

Billing Efficiency increased from 57.8% (March-19) to 64 % in Dec-19

Bareilly: A bunch of villagers in Budaun district on Sunday allegedly mowed down a leopard with a tractor after mercilessly beating it with sticks, making it the third big cat to be killed in a week in western UP which has also seen a sudden surge in leopard attacks in the last six months. One leopard each was killed in Bijnor on January 6 and Moradabad on January 8.

The recent killing of leopard took place in Budaun’s remote Jarifpur Gadhiya village, where two persons were allegedly attacked and injured by the animal in a span of two hours.

According to sources, Sher Singh, 16, was playing in Jarifpur Gadhiya village when a leopard attacked and injured him. His family members took him to a private hospital for treatment. Nearly two hours later, Mohan Lal, 60, who was in a field on the outskirts of the village to relieve himself, was also attacked by a leopard.

Lal sustained injuries on his right arm. On hearing the cries of Lal, his son-in-law and other villagers rushed to the spot. They spotted the leopard and attacked it with sticks. Then a few of them brought a tractor and mowed down the animal to make sure that it was dead.

When contacted, sub-divisional forest officer VK Gupta said, “I am about to reach the spot and can comment only after inspecting the scene.”

Station house officer (SHO) of Sahaswan police station Harendra Singh said, “The villagers killed leopard after it injured two locals. We are awaiting complaint from forest department to lodge an FIR in the matter.”

In a similar incident in Bijnor, enraged villagers shot dead a leopard, hours after it killed a 14-year-old boy. Following the incident, an FIR was lodged against 80 unidentified villagers under sections of Wildlife Protection Act while forest department suspended deputy ranger and guard for dereliction of duty.

On January 8, a leopard’s carcass was found in a village in Kaanth area of Moradabad following which forest department lodged an FIR against unknown villagers.

Madurai: Police arrested three people in connection with a robbery, in which an armed gang robbed 175 sovereigns of gold jewels and Rs 1.80 lakh in cash from a contractor’s house in Appadurai Nagar. The contractor’s son is among the arrested trio.

The gang had introduced themselves as a special police team and gained access into the house claiming to be carrying out a search, purportedly looking for some banned substance. Although the incident took place on December 27, 2019, Solai Gunasekaran, the owner of the house lodged a complaint a week later. An inquiry carried out by a police team led by Tallakulam assistant commissioner of police, A Godwin Jagdeesh Kumar, revealed that Solai Gunasekaran’s son Rajan, 36, masterminded the robbery. Police said Solai Gunasekaran has two wives and Rajan is Gunasekaran’s son from his first wife. He hatched the plan to loot the house along with his friends Umadevi, 38, from Madakulam and Rajarajan, 42, from Nagamalai, since he was not given a share of his father’s property. Rajan, Umadevi and Rajarajan entered the house at night in police uniform. Pretending to be conducting a search the trio opened bureaus and looted jewels and cash. As Gunasekaran tried to stop them, they took out a pistol and threatened him.

A police officer said that they suspected an insider’s role in the robbery. Based on the suspicion, Rajan was picked up and questioned after which he admitted to have committed the crime. Police have recovered the stolen jewels. Further inquiry is underway to find out the source of the pistol possessed by the accused.

PUNE: The Kondhwa police on Saturday arrested a 26-year-old man who posed as a RAW agent when he came to the police station for giving a tip-off about a consignment of illegal arms being supplied to Pune from Bihar on January 15 by train.

When senior police inspector of the Kondhwa police Vinayak Gaikwad told the man about his identity card, he failed to produce it. The police took the suspect, Sunu Suraj Tiwari, 26, currently residing in Kondhwa, but originally from Bihar, into custody.

When the police contacted the Bihar police to get information about Tiwari, it was revealed that he was a murder suspect who was on the run.

“A team of Bihar police will come to Pune on Monday to take Tiwari into custody,” V V Vadkar, sub-inspector of the Kondhwa police, told TOI.

Vadkar said on Saturday, around 2pm, the suspect had come to Kondhwa police station where he introduced himself as Akhand Kumar Shukla, an additional superintendent-level officer currently working for RAW.

“He had told the constables at the police station about a supply of arms to Pune by train on January 15,” Vadkar said.

He said he was immediately taken to senior inspector Gaikwad where he failed to produce the identity card. “We took him into custody. He has been arrested under section 419 (cheating by impersonation) of the Indian Penal Code,” Vadkar said.

He said Tiwari was produced before the court on Sunday and has been remanded in judicial custody.

131,['13/01/2020'],"Expect cooler days, warmer nights for a week in Pune, says IMD","This story is from January 13, 2020

Night temperatures recorded were around 3 degrees above normal

PUNE: The city is experiencing unusual weather conditions and will continue to do so at least for another week. While day time temperature were below normal on Sunday, the temperature at night was significantly above normal.

On Sunday, Pune and Shivajinagar observatories recorded day time temperatures at 28.8Celsius and 28.8C, below normal by 0.6C and 1.2C respectively. At the same time, both observatories recorded minimum temperatures at 13.9C and 15.6C that were above normal temperatures by 3C and 3.6C respectively.

“The night time breeze associated with southwesterly/westerly winds is bringing some moisture to Madhya Maharashtra region, which is resulting in partial cloudy cover during late night and early morning hours. Hazy conditions, associated with partial cloudy cover, are reducing the heat load in the morning hours. Due to this phenomenon, day time temperature will remain below 30C while nights will experience above normal temperature,” said Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting division at IMD, Pune.

The city is expected to experience partly to generally cloudy condition on January 14, 15 and 16. “There is chance of partial interaction between the southwesterly and south-easterly winds,” an official from the met department explained.

In the Vidarbha region, the weather scenario has remained different as compared to Madhya Maharashtra, Konkan & Goa and Marathwada. The region has recorded below normal night temperatures in the range of 3C to 5C. In some districts, daytime temperatures have also been below normal, as per the IMD.

“Northerly winds are penetrating in some parts of the Vidarbha region from time to time. But this weather condition will change in the next couple of days due to western disturbances,” said an IMD official.

MADURAI: A five-year-old boy and his three-year-old sister were killed when the wall of a house in the neighbourhood collapsed on them while they were playing nearby on Sunday.

The boy was identified as P Mahavishnu and his sister as P Ajisri from Navinipatti village near Melur in the district. The kids were playing next to the house belonging to Senthil in the same street, while their mother Jeeva was looking after household chores.

On hearing a loud thud, a large number of village gathered at the spot and helped retrieve the children who were found unconscious. They were rushed to Melur government hospital in a private vehicle without waiting for an ambulance. However, doctors at the hospital declared them brought dead.

The walls of the tile-roofed house were constructed using bricks on one side and mud on the other. The one which fell on the children was constructed using mud and adjoins a public thoroughfare measuring about 10feet.

The children’s parents Jeeva and Premkumar or siblings Harini, 9, and Munish, 7, were not at the spot when the incident occurred. Harini told newsmen that she had gone home to change her clothes. When she came back, she saw her siblings trapped and a lot of people around the house.

Melur inspector Deivegapandian told TOI that the house owner identified as Senthil was booked under IPC section 304(ii)- culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The section has been evoked since no effort was taken by him to strengthen the wall which has been visibly weak for long.

Another police officer said that the house owner has been picked up for inquiry after which he was likely to be arrested. Villagers said that although the village had received good rain this season, there has not been any heavy spell recently. Relatives who gathered at the hospital were found inconsolable.

AMARAVATI: The proposal for three capital cities for Andhra Pradesh seems to have opened a Pandora’s box this festive season.

Amaravati, touted as the dream capital of the Andhras, is on the boil for the last three weeks with hundreds of farmers including women taking to the streets against the proposed shifting of the state capital to Visakhapatnam and the state government deploying an unprecedented number of police personnel to maintain law and order.

The 29 villages that make up Amaravati have never witnessed such a volatile situation even at the height of agitation against bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh during 2009-2014 and Jai Andhra movement in early 1970s.

Rallies in favour of and against Amaravati have become the order of the day in different parts of the state. Some political parties have roped in students too into the agitation. For the first time, after the bifurcation of the state in 2014, politicians have renewed the demand for location of the capital in their respective region.

Scores of police personnel could be seen at road junctions and village corners with razor-barbed wires laid across arterial roads in Amaravati to prevent farmers from rallying together.

In one instance at Mandadam village a large posse of policemen was seen marching through a narrow street to make the announcement that prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC were in force and people should not gather. In normal circumstances, such announcements are made by a couple of policemen or through a loud speaker fitted to a vehicle.

Farmers, who gave away 33,000 acres of their agricultural land for the dream capital city of the Andhras, are angry over the proposal to shift the capital city as they will lose heavily. The agitators including women farmers were lathi-charged on several occasions forcing the National Commission for Women (NCW) to intervene and send a fact-finding team. The police, however, deny instances of cane-charge. Several women were injured in the agitation. Scores of agitators were detained and later released. The police had registered cases against people, who damaged the vehicle of a YSRCP legislator, and defaced a panchayat office signboard. Farmers in capital city decided not to celebrate Sankranti, the biggest festival for agriculturists.

With TDP, BJP and Jana Sena extending support to the farmers' agitation, the protest is gradually getting a political colour. The police had for the first time issued individual notices to farmers to declare whenever a relative visits them or a stranger is seen in their locality. Many farmers said such notices were unprecedented in the region. TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh accused the government of posting 1,000 policemen in every village in the capital city.

The three capital cities idea has also kicked off political spat among senior leaders and legislators of different parties with some of them using filthy and unprintable language.

YSRCP Kakinada legislator D Chandrasekhar Reddy used unparliamentary language against Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena leader Pawan Kalyan at a public meeting sparking off trouble in the town. YSRC and Jana Sena activists pelted stones forcing the police to use lathi-charge. Many people were injured.

Meanwhile, the YSRCP came down heavily on the opposition for “creating trouble” in the state. Accusing Naidu of playing “barbaric tricks”, an official statement of YSRCP on Sunday said, “(Naidu is) provoking farmers and capital city region people to create unrest across the state, prevail tension, disturb law and order for political existence and protect properties in the capital city region to benefit a specific community”.

136,['13/01/2020'],TB treatment made easy with ‘Zero Tuberculosis’ initiative,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Bareilly: A 24-year-old woman suffering from tuberculosis (TB) was not getting free medicines regularly due to “carelessness” of accredited social health activists (Asha) of her village in Bhamora area of Bareilly district. The woman, an illiterate, was too sceptical to lodge a complaint with senior officials. Last month, however, she received a call from a volunteer of ‘Zero Tuberculosis’, who asked her several questions about her disease and the treatment. The woman told the volunteer that she was not getting medicines regularly. The volunteer shared her problem with district tuberculosis officials, who immediately ensured that Asha workers provide her with the monthly medicines on time.

In another case, a 16-year-old TB patient discontinued her treatment after she was diagnosed with jaundice — a side-effect of TB drugs. However, following the intervention of Zero Tuberculosis, the health department conducted her counselling and she resumed her TB treatment.

Like them, there are many TB patients who have received help from Zero Tuberculosis started by Amit Verma, assistant professor at the pharmacy department of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University, in October. Verma launched Zero Tuberculosis, a unique digital platform, on Facebook to help poor TB patients.

The volunteers associated with the programme are asked to register online and sign a declaration that they will not reveal the identity of TB patients in the public.

“After the training, a volunteer gets the responsibility of one TB patient. The volunteers are given a set of questions to be asked to the patients twice a month over the phone to learn about the progress of their treatment and understand their problems. After every call, the volunteers share the feedback with the health department,” Verma told TOI.

Verma said they were monitoring 100 TB patients telephonically through 65 volunteers, including students, teachers and social workers. “When we initially asked people to adopt TB patients and provide them with the nutritional package, most of them were reluctant considering it would be expensive. A few were even against the idea, as they did not want to come in direct contact with the patients. We, then, decided to approach TB patients over the phone to ensure they complete the full course of treatment,” said Verma. A TB patient has to undergo six months of treatment, while the duration of treatment for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients is one to two years.”

Dr Sudhir Garg, district tuberculosis officer, said, “With the help of Zero Tuberculosis team, we are able to resolve the problems of TB patients swiftly. We have one health worker for a population of 2 lakh and it takes us time to visit the patients. However, volunteers’ calls help us reach out to patients early.”

Apart from making calls, many volunteers are also donating nutritional packages for children suffering from TB. A food collection centre has been set up at the pharmacy department, and the health department delivers the collected foods to the patients.

Bareilly: A biting cold continued to grip the city on Sunday with minimum temperature dropping to 5.7 degrees Celsius, which was around two degrees less than the temperature recorded on Saturday. The day was cloudy and foggy throughout the day. The maximum temperature was recorded at 14.0 degrees Celsius.

According to meteorological department sources, mercury is likely to hover around 6 to 7 degrees Celsius with possibility of rainfall and dense fog for the next four or five days. In the morning, city roads saw little traffic. The sun did not show up and a damp foggy weather prevailed throughout the day.

At several places in the city, people were seen warming themselves by lighting bonfires. People bundled in warm clothes carried on their daily chores. Tea-stalls and coffee shops did brisk business as people gathered there for a cup of warm comfort.

Preeti Rajput, a yoga trainer who lives in City Station, said, “It is very cold in Bareilly today (Sunday). I was shivering while driving my two-wheeler in the morning on my way to yoga class. It was colder than the earlier days. Visibility was also affected as there was moderate fog even when I returned in the afternoon.”

Met office sources attributed the cold and foggy conditions to western disturbances and snowfall in the Himalayan region. They predicted similar weather conditions over the next couple of days with dense to moderate fog and possibility of rainfall.

An enthusiast chooses kites from a shop in the Walled City area

JAIPUR: There was a time when kites from Bareilly , Hathras and Rampur were a craze among Jaipurites. With changing times and cost factors, makers from these cities have started assembling kites here to maximise profits. However, to ensure that customers get the old feel, the makers stamp a seal of the UP towns for that authentic satisfaction.

These days, kite makers bring the raw materials and stamps from UP to make production cost effective and maximise profits.

Local traders have brought labourers from the famed kite makers from Bareilly and Rampur to make it in the city.

Major kite markets including Handipura, Haldiyon Ka Raasta, Jhotwara, Murlipura and Kishanpole Bazaar are loaded with kites made by labourers from UP. “We come to Jaipur post Diwali in November and complete our orders by the first week of January. Our kites are also sent to the nearby districts including Sikar, Jhunjhunu and Churu where there’s a huge demand,” said Kalu Khan, a kite manufacturer from Bareilly.

On reasons why local traders are not buying directly from UP, Rajiv Motwani, a wholesale kite trader in Jhotwara said, “In December, we witness heavy fog in Rampur and Bareilly. So, kites get damaged. So, we contacted UP makers and requested them to send their workers here to make it here.”

Anwar Khan, a wholesale kite trader at Handipura, said in Rajasthan there was already a huge market for kites as they were flown almost around the year on various occasions. “In places like Alwar, Ajmer and Dausa, people fly kites during Raksha Bandhan. In Jaipur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu and Bikaner, they are flown on the occasion of Makar Sakranti. And many other districts fly them on August 15 like in Delhi. So, we keep calling the labourers making kites from Uttar Pradesh.”

Locals throng city markets to buy goods for Makar Sankranti.

JAIPUR: Makar Sankranti is a couple of days away but sale of kites and manjhas was yet to gather desired momentum in the city.

Majority of the shops in Walled City especially Handipura and Haldiyon Ka Raasta had few customers on Sunday. Traders said mushrooming of smaller shops in almost every part of the city has distrinuted the customers evenly across with no particular area witnessing a major rush. Traders, however, expect that the sale of kites and manjha would peak on Monday.

TOI visited various markets including Tripolia Bazaar, Haldiyon Ka Raasta and others in Walled City.

“Gone are the days when we had a good sale starting from mid-December to Makar Sakranti. These days it is just a business of 2 to 3 days. However, the sale is not what we had expected. Hopefully, Monday would bring a good number of customers,” said Ramesh Chandra Khunteta, a wholesale dealer of kites at Tripolia Bazaar.

Kites varying from Adha, Manjola, Pauna and Dedh Kanni have flooded the markets this year. “The Adha of Bareilly is very popular as it becomes heavy in the air and helps to cut other kites,” said Abdul Kaleem, a wholesale dealer of kites who reached here from Bareilly.

Traders are planning to keep their shops open till late in the evening on Sunday and Monday.

On not having desired rush in the markets, a wholesale trader said, “Earlier, Walled City was the only option to buy kites. Now you have got shops everywhere and thus our customers are scattered,” said Kaleem.

Meanwhile, the manjhas available in the markets are expensive due to ban on Chinese ones. “We are selling a manjha charkhee having 3,000 metres priced between Rs 300 and Rs 500 while the charkhee having 6,000 metres to 12,000 metres are sold in the range of Rs 800 to Rs 1,200. The prices are more compared to last year due to curtailed supply from Bareilly, Hathras and Moradabad ,” said Anil Bhutani, a wholesale trader at Haldiyon Ka Raasta.

Amaravati: Government and private employees and students in the city have started to leave for home ahead of Sankranti . Railway and bus stations were packed with passengers over the weekend and educational institutions declared holidays for the festival.

Farmers in the region expect a bumper crop this season owing to abundant rains last monsoon. The state government’s decision to remit Rs 15,000 under the Amma Vodi scheme into back accounts of mothers ahead of the festival also seems to have spurred sales of clothes and household items in nearby towns.

Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) is plying special services to various destinations in the state. Buses from Hyderabad, especially, have registered a heavy rush with passengers returning home for the festival.

Traffic congestion on National Highway (NH)-65 between Hyderabad and Vijayawada continued on Sunday. Toll plazas at Pantangi in Nalgonda district and Keesara in Krishna district registered high levels of traffic with malfunctioning FASTag scanners delaying traffic. Staff at the toll plaza claimed that the devices lacked sufficient balance and requested commuters to make cash payments for the toll fee. Commuters, however, argued that the devices were operational. At Keesara toll plaza, commuters waited between 45 minutes to an hour.

In his complaint Ramkumar, a mason, said that he had gone to work to Thirumangalam on Friday and was returning home in the evening, when he got a phone call from a neighbour saying that his son Jeevan, 5, had been taken to Virudhunagar government hospital. He rushed to the hospital, where he was told by his wife that their son died in his sleep.

While Ananthajothi claimed that Jeevan was bitten by an insect leading to his death, Ramkumar did not believe it since there were external injuries on his body. Based on Ramkumar’s complaint the police conducted an inquiry with Ananthajothi. During police questioning Ananthajothi confessed that she and Maruthupandian had strangulated Jeevan to death as they feared that the boy might reveal their relationship to Ramkumar.

NCW team visited capital city villages

GUNTUR: A team of National Commission for Women ( NCW ) visited the capital city area on Sunday and launched a probe into the alleged police overtures against women during the protests held recently.

NCW senior coordinator Kanchan Khattar and counselor Praveen Singh visited the villages on Sunday.

The team first interacted with local officials including tahsildar and DSP. They inquired about the situation that led to the imposition of Section 144 of Cr.PC and Section 30 of the Police Act.

The NCW team held a meeting with locals at Thullur and took statements of women who detailed their experiences with the police in the last few weeks. Women broke down before the NCW team while narrating their version. The women said they were disturbed by the presence of massive police forces in villages and their high-handed attitude.

“The police are using force to throw us into vehicles without showing any concern about women,” said Padmavathamma, a local woman. The locals said many women received injuries in the lathi-charge and were rushed to hospitals.

A student told the NCW that morphed photos of women protesters were circulated on social media. She blamed YSRC cadres for the campaign against women and demanded action against those involved in the campaign. The NCW team also visited different villages in the capital city area.

Earlier, a TDP delegation led by MP Galla Jayadev met the NCW team and submitted a representation. Jayadev explained how the police crossed all the limits in harassing women protesters. He said the police detained the women who took part in peaceful agitations in police stations till late night.

He presented some visual evidence to the NCW team to show the police action. Former Krishna district ZP chairperson Gadde Anuradha, former Vijayawada mayor Panchumarthi Anuradha, former state women commission chairperson Nannapaneni Rajakumari met the NCW team and demanded action against the government for encouraging violence against women.

BHOPAL: If the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report on 'Crimes in India' is any indication, then senior citizens -- along with women and children in Madhya Pradesh -- appear to be the most unsafe among 29 states in the country.The data for 29 states on crimes against senior citizens (people of 60 years and above) shows that the rate of crimes against the elderly (no. of crimes per lakh population) in MP is as high as 69.4, followed by Maharashtra (53.7) and Chhattisgarh (53.5). However, among nine union territories, Chandigarh has a crime rate against senior citizens in excess of Madhya Pradesh, which stands at 95.4. In Delhi, too, it is quite high, 68, but still less than MP. Interestingly, there are several states in the country where there is “no or nearly no crime” against senior citizens. The rate of crime against senior citizens in Meghalaya is zero, in Assam 0.1, and Uttarakhand 0.7. In states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, too, it is 2.9 and 5.5.When asked about reasons for excessively high crime rate against senior citizens in MP, associate professor, sociology, National Law Institute University (NLIU), Dr Tapan Mohanty, said: “I think it has something to do with the larger concentration of senior citizens at places like Bhopal in MP. The other reason could be the urban-rural disconnect. In a traditional society like you have in UP or Bihar, social systems are better equipped to take care of vulnerable sections like elderly persons. And, also because crime reportage in MP is better than several other states.""Professor, psychology, Bhopal School of Social Sciences , Dr Vinay Mishra said: “I didn’t imagine that crime rate against senior citizens could be so alarmingly high in MP. I don’t want to go into what is culturally amiss in our state, but we definitely don’t have infrastructure in place to take better care of elderly persons. By infrastructure, I mean, vigilant police, better medical facilities and easy access to law. Lack of proper care renders them all the more vulnerable”.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73223866,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-337294,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-2nd-most-unsafe-state-for-sr-citizens/articleshow/73219274.cms

Rajkot: The man who allegedly raped and blackmailed a 21-year-old woman in Thakkarbapa Harijanvas locality of Rajkot was arrested on Sunday.

Police arrested Mayur Ghavri (24) for allegedly raping the woman after promising to marry her. Ghavri allegedly filmed their intimate moments and sent the video clip to the survivor’s brother on WhatsApp.

“In her complaint, the survivor said that she had come in contact with Ghavri at a wedding function in her locality one-and-a-half-years ago. They started talking to each other on phone and developed a romantic relationship. Promising to marry her, Ghavri developed physical relationship with her and shot the video of their act on his cellphone, of which the survivor was unaware of,” said R A Kapasi, sub-inspector at Pradyumannagar police station.

Last month, when the survivor asked Ghavri about his marriage plan, he went back on his promise and blackmailed her with the video, threatening her that she would have to come for sex with him whenever he called her, otherwise he would upload her video on WhatsApp and other social media platforms.

On January 1, when the survivor refused to give in to Ghavri’s blackmailing, he sent the video to her brother. When inquired about it, the survivor confided her ordeal to her family members, following which they approached police.

MADURAI: Truckloads of water hyacinths, which have engulfed the Vandiyur tank, were removed by the PWD with the help of residents , Dhan Foundation and youth volunteers in a day-long drive on Sunday.

Vandiyur tank, with a water spread area of 687.08 acres, is the biggest tank in Madurai city. Alert residents living near the tank and the walkers who use the park have been able to save the tank from encroachments and they contribute regularly towards its upkeep. They have been regularly demanding the government to help them bring water to it from its main water sources, Sathayaiyar dam , Uthangudi tank, Mangalagudi tank and Periyar main channel.

PWD superintending engineer M Sugumar, who oversaw Sunday’s cleaning operation, said that the tank was a boon to the people of the region and it could well be Madurai’s best recreational spot with a little contribution from public. The tank bund could be developed into a walk and if water is kept clean it could well become Madurai’s leading bird nesting spots. “Water hyacinths have overgrown after the corporation allowed sewage from the northern end near the EB sub station and the Pudur channel. But it is not too late, with public support it could be cleaned,” he said. Two private hospitals sponsored Sunday’s program, and Walkers Club, Gomathipuram Thendral Nagar Residents Welfare Association, Dhan Foundation and V V Kumar Memorial Youth organisation chipped in.

Around 100 people, including 20 labourers of the PWD, assistant engineers Karthikeyan, Sandhanakumar and Hariharasudan entered the water and cleaned the plants that had grown over an area of two acres. Labourers, who wore tubes on their body, swam up to the growth and pushed them with long sticks towards the bank and the volunteers pulled them. It was dumped on the bank as manure for plants in the park.

Sugumar said that it would be a continuous process till the entire tank is cleaned, and steps would be taken to explore ways in which the sewage could be treated and let into the tank.

In an exchange programme for government school students, 20 Class VIII students from Kondapethan middle school visited Andarkottaram government higher secondary school. “I had plenty to admire and learn about how it is at an urban government school at the higher secondary level. I’m happy to make new friends and share knowledge,” said Sathya, a student from Kondapethan middle school.

The students planted saplings in the school and went around visiting labs, classrooms, library and audio-visual room. A look at the infrastructure gave them an idea what could be implemented in their own school. “Such visits are useful for middle school students so they can be encouraged to pursue higher education.

150,['13/01/2020'],Clamour for new Andhra capital comes from all regions,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Hyderabad: The proposal to shift Andhra Pradesh state capital from Amaravati has triggered new demands from various districts for locating the new capital in respective regions. It has also brought about a wedge among politicians within all political parties with leaders divided into regional lines.

Many common people, including students, too, have taken to streets demanding capital in their area and supporting or opposing shifting of capital. The government deployed hundreds of troops to quell clashes, triggered by farmer protests.

Soon after chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy announced on December 17 the possibility of three capital cities for Andhra Pradesh, local politicians cutting across party lines began raising own demands.

Andhra government is examining the proposal of locating administrative capital in Visakhapatnam, judicial capital in Kurnool, while limiting existing capital city of Amaravati to a mere host of assembly sessions for some days a year.

In the last 26 days the demand for capital city has come from Kurnool, Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur, Prakasam, Nellore and Visakhapatnam districts. On the regional front, local leaders want the capital city to be located in Rayalaseema , north coastal Andhra and south coastal Andhra respectively. The state witnessed a similar demand six years ago during the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh to form Telangana. Some leaders want another bifurcation to carve out what they call Greater Rayalaseema.

Leaders from Rayalaseema were the first to renew their demand for the capital city. Former legislator Byreddy Rajasekhar Reddy, who recently joined BJP, has renewed his demand for state capital in Kurnool (Rayalaseema). “The capital should be in Rayalaseema. The government has given head (administrative capital) to Visakhapatnam, torso to Amaravati and tail to Rayalaseema,” he said.

Rajya Sabha member TG Venkatesh wants high court apart from secretariat (administrative capital) in the region. PV Sidda Reddy, YSRCP legislator from Kadiri, has demanded Rayalaseema be given judicial as well as legislative capital cities. Former minister and TDP leader B Akhila Priya wants the capital be shifted to Rayalaseema if the government was not in favour of Amaravati.

Former MP Chinta Mohan is in favour of Tirupati as state capital while ex-minister Ganta Srinivas Rao supports shifting of capital to Visakhapatnam. Former MP and TDP leader JC Diwakar Reddy has renewed demand for Greater Rayalaseema in capital shifts from Amaravati.

Assembly speaker Tammineni Sitaram supported the proposal for three capitals saying that will arrest demand for separate states. Earlier, he has called Amaravati a desert.

While the opposition blames ruling YSRCP for capital trouble across the state, ruling YSRCP blames TDP for a “political conspiracy”. “A political conspiracy is being planned to create unrest across the state and disturb law and order,” a YSRCP official statement said on Sunday.

Vijayawada: With thousands of cops in olive greens marching on the streets with lathis and automatic weapons, hundreds of vehicles deployed, tear gas shelling vehicles at every corner and razor wire fences blocking the roads, a pall of gloom descended over the 29 villages in the capital region ahead of Sankranti .

The season, otherwise, would have been buzzing with friends and family members coming from distant places to celebrate the harvest festival with rangolis, bonfires and other cultural activities.

The farmers in the capital region celebrate every festival in a big way. After the announcement of the new capital in Amaravati , it was cheers in the last four years. The change in the regime has changed the farmers’ fortunes. The uncertainty began with YSRC forming the government and it has now reached a stage where farmers are on the streets.

As the capital region turned into a fortress, there is no festival mood with everyone worried about their future if the capital gets shifted from Amaravati.

For the last 26 days, the farmers are opposing the three- capital city formula. As the shifting of capital looks imminent with enough indications coming from the government, the capital region is in no mood to celebrate Sankranti. Due to the recent police action against women, the situation in the region resembles a battleground as voices get louder and protests intensify with each passing day.

Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary, Jyotiraditya Scindia , said on Sunday that Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) would make poor people queue up again as they had done at the time of demonetisation.

Speaking at the valedictory session of 11-day Congress Sevadal training camp here, he said “Poor will again queue up as they had done at the time of demonetisation. The rich will have VIP entry but it’s the poor who will suffer”, this message must go down among the people and Congress has no better instrument to do it than Sevadal.

He further said that who is the BJP or its government or anyone else to ask any Indian his lineage, parentage or the place his family belongs to and who has given the right to BJP to “digress” from India’s philosophy of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (The whole world is a family).

“It’s time Sevadal redefines it role. It has a glorious past. During freedom struggle, their role was so vital that I don’t have any doubt in saying if Sevadal were not there, Indian freedom struggle would not have succeeded in throwing the British out but over the years, its role has become limited. A country which never refused shelter to anyone, how can it approve of CAA? India stands for humanity and non-violence. And, economy, which the Congress built brick by brick, is going down the drains,” the senior Congress leader said.

Later, talking informally to reporters, Scindia said he finds it quite astonishing that those who didn’t participate in India’s freedom struggle at all dare to question Congress on nationalism but parried a direct reply on Vir Savarkar. A booklet on Savarkar circulated among participants of the camp in which he was portrayed as someone who compromised with the British for his personal liberty had created quite a buzz in political circles.

In reply to a question on film actress Deepika’s visit to JNU campus, he said “I salute Deepika. At a time, when you are hounded the moment you open your mouth against the ruling dispensation, she had the courage to visit JNU is solidarity with the students of the university”.

When asked whether he was vying for nomination to Rajya Sabha, he said “I am never in race for any post or position. I was not in race in December nor am I vying for anything now”.

He gave a similar reply to a question on the possibility of his becoming the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief in near future.

BAREILLY: A tent-house owner has been booked under provisions of the SC/ST Act for allegedly making casteist abuses and turning way a Dalit man who had gone to his shop to book for a tent for his sister’s engagement function at Naugavan village under Fareedpur police station limits here on January 5. Police are investigating the matter.

According to Manoj Valmiki, initially when he went to the local police, his complaint was not registered. Then, he approached local MLA Shyam Bihari Lal and on his intervention, police registered a case and began a probe into the matter.

According to Valmiki, his sister’s engagement was fixed for January 6. “For the function, we needed a tent for the guests. When I visited the tent house, its owner, Iqbal, refused to rent me a tent, saying they didn’t deal with Dalits, especially Valmikis,” he claimed.

Manoj said since no other facility was available in the village, he offered to pay the rent in advance but he was still denied. “When I argued, what harm would it do if he rented a tent to us, he started abusing me, using casteist slurs and threatened dire consequences if I did not leave his shop immediately. I returned home and with a few family members and neighbours went to the police station to lodge a complaint but to no avail,” he alleged.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, Dhananjay Singh, SHO of Fareedpur, said they had registered an FIR under provisions of the SC/ST Act had been registered. “We have lodged the FIR and the area circle officer, DSP Nagendra Yadav, is investigating the matter himself.”

DSP Yadav told TOI, “I am investigating the matter and will visit the village soon. If the allegations are found to be true, we will take strict action against the accused tent house owner.”

RAJKOT: A total of 5 ,982 bottles of Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) worth Rs 20.94 lakh were seized from a tanker and three bootleggers arrested on Bilkha Road on the outskirts of Vijapur village near Junagadh on early Sunday morning.

157,['13/01/2020'],TB treatment made easy with ‘Zero Tuberculosis’ initiative,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Bareilly: A 24-year-old woman suffering from tuberculosis (TB) was not getting free medicines regularly due to “carelessness” of accredited social health activists (Asha) of her village in Bhamora area of Bareilly district. The woman, an illiterate, was too sceptical to lodge a complaint with senior officials. Last month, however, she received a call from a volunteer of ‘Zero Tuberculosis’, who asked her several questions about her disease and the treatment. The woman told the volunteer that she was not getting medicines regularly. The volunteer shared her problem with district tuberculosis officials, who immediately ensured that Asha workers provide her with the monthly medicines on time.

In another case, a 16-year-old TB patient discontinued her treatment after she was diagnosed with jaundice — a side-effect of TB drugs. However, following the intervention of Zero Tuberculosis, the health department conducted her counselling and she resumed her TB treatment.

Like them, there are many TB patients who have received help from Zero Tuberculosis started by Amit Verma, assistant professor at the pharmacy department of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University, in October. Verma launched Zero Tuberculosis, a unique digital platform, on Facebook to help poor TB patients.

The volunteers associated with the programme are asked to register online and sign a declaration that they will not reveal the identity of TB patients in the public.

“After the training, a volunteer gets the responsibility of one TB patient. The volunteers are given a set of questions to be asked to the patients twice a month over the phone to learn about the progress of their treatment and understand their problems. After every call, the volunteers share the feedback with the health department,” Verma told TOI.

Verma said they were monitoring 100 TB patients telephonically through 65 volunteers, including students, teachers and social workers. “When we initially asked people to adopt TB patients and provide them with the nutritional package, most of them were reluctant considering it would be expensive. A few were even against the idea, as they did not want to come in direct contact with the patients. We, then, decided to approach TB patients over the phone to ensure they complete the full course of treatment,” said Verma. A TB patient has to undergo six months of treatment, while the duration of treatment for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients is one to two years.”

Dr Sudhir Garg, district tuberculosis officer, said, “With the help of Zero Tuberculosis team, we are able to resolve the problems of TB patients swiftly. We have one health worker for a population of 2 lakh and it takes us time to visit the patients. However, volunteers’ calls help us reach out to patients early.”

Apart from making calls, many volunteers are also donating nutritional packages for children suffering from TB. A food collection centre has been set up at the pharmacy department, and the health department delivers the collected foods to the patients.

KOLKATA: Physical illness and depression are the biggest reasons behind suicides in the city, though there are also some other personal reasons like physical abuse, love affairs, drug abuse and unwanted pregnancy, according to the National Crime Records Bureau data for 2018 , released recently.Total number of suicides in the city took a 25% dip from 216 persons in 2017 to 162 persons in 2018, though the state took a reverse path in this regard.In 2017, 12,014 people committed suicide across the state while the number took nearly 10.3% jump with 13,255 suicides in 2018.According to the NCRB sources, failure in examinations led six young women to commit suicide in 2018 when total 779 students ended their lives across the state.The number of girls committing suicide is more than boys in the state. As per the data, 436 girls and 343 boys were among the suicide victims, mostly students.Of 914 young professionals who committed suicide in the state, 223 were women. Fifty-four of them were from Kolkata.Physical illness drove 76 persons in the city to end their lives and 67 of them were men, including eight cancer and three paralysis patients. Of 63 mentally challenged suicide victims, 54 were men. Futile love affairs led to 11 suicides while illicit affair, unwanted pregnancy and physical abuse on women prompted 14 persons to take the extreme step of killing themselves in the city.According to Lalbazar sources, an analysis of suicides committed in 2018 and 2019 has revealed that the victims are of two age groups like 20-29 years and 30-45 years. Maximum cases have been reported from the added areas where the pressure on young people to get jobs is more because of their economic conditions, said a detective department officer who had carried out the analysis with psychiatrists in last month.“According to studies, 90% of the suicide cases are related to depression. In majority of the suicide cases, the victims are aged between 19 and 29 years. Depression is a silent killer. We need to talk about depression and other mental illness more often, so that the stigma attached with the ailment can be driven away. Those suffering from the illness can seek professional help before it is too late,” Pradeep Saha, director Institute of Psychiatry (IOP) at IPGMER, SSKM Hospital, told TOI a couple of days ago.“When people are aged between 30 and 45 years, they start to re-evaluate themselves on their achievements and the aspirations they have not been able to meet. The key factor in a suicide case is the feeling of helplessness. When one feels that he or she has not achieved enough and the prospects are not good, this can make them feel helpless, forcing them to take a drastic step like suicide,” said psychiatrist, J R Ram.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220264,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89072,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/city-sees-25-dip-in-suicides-ncrb/articleshow/73219306.cms

INDORE: After onions , garlic has disturbed household budget of common man as prices breached Rs 100 per kg due to a squeeze in supplies in spot markets.

Harvest of new season garlic has delayed by over a month owing to extended rainfall in growing pockets adversely hitting local supplies. At Choithram mandi, Indore’s largest vegetable mandi, garlic prices have jumped to Rs 80 to 120 per kg on Saturday from Rs 60 – 70 per kg a month ago.

Mohan Singh Goud, president, Devi Ahilyabai Holker Harisabzi Vayapari and Commission Agent Association said, “New season arrivals have been delayed by over a month this season because of prolong rain. Supplies are skeletal in spot and with good demand in winters, prices have shot up.”

According to wholesale garlic dealers, daily arrivals of garlic in Choithram mandi have reduced to around 15,000 -20,000 bags (1 bag weighs 50 kg) as against 60,000 bags in past months.

New season supplies are anticipated to hit spot market by February as against January, said traders and farmers. In Indore, garlic comes from Mandsaur, Shajapur, Dewas, Maksi, Sujalpur and Manpur among others.

163,['13/01/2020'],Collective resistance: How Jamia Millia Islamia became the new Jantar Mantar,"This story is from January 13, 2020

NEW DELHI: There are many faces of resistance outside Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI): a makeshift library along the road, a small cell symbolising detention centres, an art corner where students make posters against the Citizenship Amendment Act , and a stage that hosts different artistes, writers and politicians every day.

Most recently, it was Man Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy. Earlier, actors Zeeshan Ayyub and Swara Bhasker, activist Harsh Mander, lyricist Hussain Haidry and academic Zoya Hasan have taken to the same stage to express solidarity with the students.

The students’ protest at JMI began on December 12, the day CAA was passed in the Rajya Sabha. But it was only on December 15 that the university began to be identified as the centrestage against the new law. Delhi Police forcibly entered JMI, its library and washrooms, catapulting the university to national limelight. Several students were injured, including one who lost vision in one of his eyes.

“Jamia is the new Jantar Mantar,” said a girl who was sitting on a hunger strike outside Gate No. 3 of the university. Kumail Fatima, a second-year law student, was one of the five people who have been on “relay hunger” strike for the past nine days. The students fast for seven hours and, then, someone else takes their place.

“We have derived our idea of non-violence from Mahatma Gandhi. This is a civil disobedience movement against divisive forces. It’s a fight for the Constitution, which ensures equal treatment for everyone notwithstanding their religion, caste or class,” she said. Fatima added that CAA would be an “assault on the secular values enshrined in the Constitution”.

JMI, which does not have a students’ union, has, however, formed a Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) to organise the protests. JCC now has several departments, including crowd, traffic, media and stage management. “The students felt the need to organise themselves to make sure everything functions smoothly. We have nearly 100 members right now who serve as decision makers, but it will only grow. We also have a steady inflow of volunteers who work round the clock,” said Arbaz Mevati, a polytechnic student.

The university, which reopened on January 6, is also trying to return to normalcy. “A lot of our exams were postponed. Some students even boycotted their papers. But our appeal to the students is to ensure that we continue the protests without jeopardising our futures. This may be a long fight, but we are prepared. We won’t back down until CAA is repealed,” said Mevati.

Even as students try to return to their daily lives, reminders of police brutality still haunt the campus. The walls of the university speak the language of resistance. They have been covered in graffiti by students to represent the right to dissent and the rise of “authoritarianism”. A open photo-exhibition called “Hum Dekhenge” and curated by Md Maharban, depicts scenes from December 15 — smoke from teargas shells, broken glasses and injured students. “This is a small effort to showcase how the events unfolded in reality,” reads the description of the exhibition.

“Pictures don’t lie. What happened at the university that day was an intimidation tactic. But we won’t back down,” said Maharban, a student of the Mass Communication Research Centre at the university, who is also one of the contributing photographers.

One of the most striking features of the Jamia protest installation is a prison made of wood. It’s meant to remind people of the fate of those in Assam, who were declared foreigners and, then, shifted to detention centres. Another quiet revolution outside Gate No. 7 is a street library, called “Read for Revolution”. JCC has put up a poster announcing its purpose. “Dear reader, On December 15, 2019, Zakir Hussain Library was vandalised. However, this could not deter the spirits of students for education...” it reads.

Gaurab Roy Dasgupta, a reader who comes to the library every day, told TOI that he was there because “protest and dissent are the state of my mind right now”. He added: “We are told that students should only study. But the purpose of education is awareness. We are not here only for Jamia. We are fighting for the country, we are raising our voice so that this does not happen to any other university,” he said.

The residents of Jamia Nagar have also lent their support to the student movement. Several locals reach the university early in the morning to distribute free water, tea and snacks to the agitating students. Shiraz, who owns a business in Batla House, told TOI that he and his friends came to Jamia Millia Islamia to show their support after the students shook the “nation’s conscience”.

The determination of the students has baffled many and inspired some, who turn up at Okhla to lend their support. But one thing has emerged strongly. As Fatima put it, Jamia truly has become an alternate Jantar Mantar, a voice of dissent, and an example non-violent struggle.

LUCKNOW: Invoking Swami Vivekananda as a youth icon who committed his life to nation-building, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the shouting of anti-national slogans at some universities indicates that extremism and Naxalism have found their way onto campuses.

Speaking at the National Youth Festival at the Indira Gandhi Pratishthan, he said: ""The slogans being shouted at some institutes trouble us. They thrive on the country's resources and are throwing India into the cauldron of extremism and Naxalism.""

Yogi said some forces were trying to divide the country, which was not acceptable to the youth who wanted to see India grow. ""There will be conspiracies but we need to be alert,"" the CM added. Yogi said those who did not know about the ancient history of India were trying to divide the country.

Making a veiled reference to the new citizenship law, Yogi said Jogendra Nath Mandal, who shifted to Pakistan and later became its law minister, could not stop atrocities against minorities. ""He came back to India and died. No one remembers him, unlike B R Ambedkar who went on to become a Bharat Ratna,"" he said.

Yogi said the country was remembering Vivekananda and drawing inspiration from him. ""We need to utilise the energy of the youth in nation-building. The youth can become role models in their respective cities and villages,"" he said.

Jaipur: Broken chairs, damp walls, no wash basins and dirty floors summarises the condition of canteens at Rajasthan University colleges. Students in Maharaja College, Rajasthan College and Commerce College have complained several times to the authorities to improve the quality of canteens, but all please have fallen on deaf ears.

In the Maharaja College canteen, there are only three food options available out of 20 in the menu. Rajesh Meena, a second-year student of the institute, said there was a need to improve the facility.

“There are many options on the menu but only samosas, patties and kachori are available. The condition of the kitchen is very bad and we have asked the student leaders to raise this issue, but nothing has been done,” said Rajesh.

The sorry state-of-affairs at the canteen was one of the main issues discussed during the last students’ union elections.

In Commerce College, there are complaints of under-age workers employed in the canteen. Student Junaid Qureshi said one person had been running the canteen for many years and has its say on how the things are managed.

“Furniture is broken and needs replacement. Children below 14 years are employed right under the nose of the administration and no has done anything to change it. There is an immediate need to look into the hygiene of the canteen, but the administration still gives the tender to run the canteen to the same person every year,” said Juniad.

One of the faculty members at Commerce College said the issue was raised at meetings many times. “Everyone has their own share to give tender to such people. In the beginning, contractor will claim to provide variety of food items which would be no where to be found after a month of bagging the tender. They all look into more profit making,” said the faculty member.

In Rajasthan College, drinking water is a major issue. “There is a water cooler in the building or else normal tap water from tanks which are not cleaned on time is our only option,” said Randheer Singh, a student.

Sandip Dass at CMRI Hospital after surgery

KOLKATA: A 42-year-old Barrackpore resident suffering from sleep apnoea lost his limb in a road accident as he had dozed off while riding a bike. It was a close shave for Sandip Dass who is now undergoing treatment for the sleep disorder after his surgery. The businessman was riding the bike on Kalyani Expressway on December 16 afternoon when he had a narrow escape from a fatal accident.

In a state of sleep, he failed to notice a crane approaching from the opposite side. His two-wheeler collided head-on with the crane.

“I had left home on work on my bike. The accident happened somewhere between Barrackpore and Sodepur. I don’t remember the exact place and what exactly had happened to me after the collision. When I came to my senses, I was in the hospital,” said Dass.

Dass’s right leg had come under the wheel of the crane. Bystanders first rushed him to a nearby government hospital, from where his family shifted him to CMRI Hospital . “When the patient was brought to us, he was in state of severe shock due to the loss of blood. His leg was badly crushed,” said orthopaedic surgeon Somesh Deb.

While resuscitating the patient, the orthopaedic team consulted with the vascular surgery team to check whether his limb could be salvaged. But they found the damage was beyond repair. The right leg had to be amputatedfrom above the knee .

During the treatment doctors found that the patient had been diagnosed with sleep apnoea earlier. But he neglected it and did not continue with the treatment. Another sleep test was conducted at the hospital that confirmed sleep apnoea.

“Driving could be dangerous for anybody suffering from sleep apnoea. And this patient was on a motorcycle and it was a narrow escape for him. It is important that people do not ignore sleep apnoea and seek medical help,” said a doctor from the critical care team involved in the treatment.

Learning from the near fatal accident, Dass is now ready to fight the sleep order.

With extreme obesity being one of the causes behind sleep apnoea, he has vowed to reduce his weight along with medication and other treatment protocols.

RAJKOT: Five burglars who had stolen 200 pieces of scrap from a ship anchored near Alang ship-breaking yard on January 7 were arrested by police on Saturday night.

Police said Ashok Baraiya (25), Ajay Chauhan (27), Ravin Dihora (29), Vipul Bariya (32) and Ram Sarvaiya (35) had committed the theft by going in a boat to the ship near Alang ship-breaking yard.

“The accused are suspected to be involved in more than one theft. Their modus operandi was to go in a boat to the ships anchored near the ship-breaking yard and commit burglaries of scrap and other items from them,” said S T Maheshweri, sub-inspector at Alang marine police station.

“Not all the ships that come to the ship-breaking yard in Alang get a berth to anchor. Hence, they wait for their turn in mid-sea. It is at then that the accused would target the ships for burglaries,” added Maheshweri.

170,['13/01/2020'],GVMC says it plans to treat all sewage draining into sea,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Visakhapatnam: The Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation ( GVMC ) is preparing a detailed project report to divert drains, which have been directly releasing sewage into the sea , in the city. There are a total of 21 drains releasing sewage into the sea, from the fishing harbour to Tenneti Park.

While the waste water from eight drains is treated before being discharged into the sea, the sewage from the remaining 13 sewers are partially or not treated at all. This has not only been affecting marine life but has also been exposing the dark underbelly of the city beaches. The direct dumping of sewage into the sea has been a major complaint of city dwellers.

GVMC Commissioner G Srijana said that the GVMC was working on the DPR of the project. “The sewage treatment plants in Appu Ghar and One Town area will be upgraded to divert these sewers and the waste water from the drains will be treated there. The drain diversion project is estimated to cost about Rs 8-10 crore,” Srijana said.

The commissioner added the GVMC has already started installing screens made of stainless steel on open drains to prevent bulky waste from entering the sea. “The idea behind the initiative is to reduce the quantum of plastic and other waste entering the sea,” said Srijana.

The two existing sewerage treatment plants in the area-based development (ABD) area—25 MLD STP near Appughar and 38 MLD STP near Lakshmi Talkies in One Town area—remain underutilised, as the current inflow of sewerage into both the STPs is about 19 MLD each. Both the STPs can be technologically upgraded to connect these drains and make sure the discharges meet central pollution control board standards.

Several environmentalists also point to toxic waste which, in the absence of sewage treatment, end up in the sea and return to the food chain. Apart from plastic waste, several bulky items are also found to be dumped in the city drains. The plastic going into the sea through drains sometimes washes up ashore, which not only makes the beach look bad, but is also not safe.

Visakhapatnam: Officials of the GVMC health wing have warned the public to not celebrate Bhogi (the bonfire festival) on the streets. Authorities have warned that roads, public places and parks are not be utilised for the celebration of the festival.

Sources in the GVMC said that Bhogi must be celebrated only in designated community places. Moreover, as per GVMC norms, wood waste should not burnt. However, this is not being enforced fully, especially during Bhogi festival.

“The problem with this rule lies in the fact that there are very few designated community spaces for festivities in the city. Moreover, Visakhapatnam is not a planned city. Even planned areas like MVP Colony only have tiny community halls which are fully concretised,” said G Rosiah, a retired state government employee.

With the city having close to 1.5 lakh multi-storied buildings, the problem has further intensified. G Ramana, a resident of One Town area who is a financier said: “Once upon a time, One Town area did not have a single high-rise building. Today all the old houses have been knocked down and replaced by box-like concrete structures, most of which are multi-storied. We have no other option but to burn the logs on the streets.” Health department authorities, however, made it clear that such an act would be considered as flouting the rules and warned that heavy fines would be imposed. They added that a general notification to this effect would be released on Monday.

After the festival, commuters and residents also face the issue of pollution levels rising significantly.

DEHRADUN: An anganwadi worker , who has been fasting to press for higher wages demand for days, was forcefully taken by city police to Doon Hospital from the ‘Dharna Sthal’ on Sunday. The move came after her vitals dipped drastically.

“We didn’t intend to disrupt the protest but it is also our duty to take care of a protester’s life,” Shekhar Suyal, circle officer (city), told TOI.

As the protest entered its 37th day on Sunday, other anganwadi workers, who have been fasting in protest , sang songs and shared their life stories amongst each other to keep themselves motivated. Vineeta (name changed), a 56-year-old anganwadi worker who takes care of 21 children at an anganwadi centre in Uttarkashi , said that she hadn’t met her family in months as she has been protesting at Dehradun since the first week of December.

“ I bring 21 kids to my centre every day. I bathe them, feed them, and play with them. Also, I am frequently asked to conduct surveys. In return, I am paid a salary of just Rs 7,000,” she lamented.

Another protesting anganwadi worker Vimla Kumari, a Tehri Garhwal-resident whose husband died over 20 years ago, runs a centre that has 11 children. Kumari’s day starts at 7 am and ends around 10 pm.

Her job includes cleaning the centre, looking after kids, collecting data regarding cattle population or polio vaccination, and other such tasks. “They call us to visit the head office twice a week. The office is located 27 kilometres from my house and each visit costs me Rs 400. So, half my salary goes into conveyance costs. How am I supposed to manage with a Rs 3,500 salary each month?,” questioned Kumari, while adding that “even a labourer earns Rs 700 per day, more than what anganwadi workers get.”

“We ensure children are ready for school, care for their polio vaccination, collect data for surveys, and yet we are paid a meagre amount. Then, why are we being paid a mere pittance?,” asked Sonakshi Rawat, another protesting worker. Notably, the state has 20,070 anganwadi centres across 13 districts.

173,['13/01/2020'],"Inaugurated last Nov, escalator at platform no 1 yet to start working","This story is from January 13, 2020

Bareilly: It has been nearly two months when an escalator for passengers’ convenience was installed on platform number 1 at the busy Bareilly Junction railway station. But, it is yet to become operational. And the reason stated is quite bizarre.

According to railway authorities, they don’t have any “expert to restart the machine, if anyone stops it by pressing the emergency button by mistake”.

Notably, the escalator for Bareilly Junction station was sanctioned in 2016-17, but it could be installed only in 2019 - at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore.

Seeing the escalator lying defunct, passengers questioned why such a large amount was spent when the railway officials don’t even have an “expert” to operate it. “This escalator is nothing but a showpiece. I had read that a minister had inaugurated it in November, and thought that elderly persons like me can now easily cross over to platforms 2 and 3. But, I am disappointed. The escalator is yet to start,” said Pushpa Saxena, a 65-year-old passenger.

Divulging the reason behind the newly installed escalator lying non-functional, station superintendent (SS) Satyaveer Singh told TOI on Sunday, “We don’t have an expert who can restart it once it is forcibly stopped by pressing the emergency button. Since its inauguration, we have been facing this issue daily. Though, we asked the company that has installed it to remove the emergency ‘stop’ button, they didn’t do so, citing safety concerns.”

Singh added that senior officials had been informed about the issue and “very soon they would resolve it so that passengers can avail the facility”.

AMARAVATI: A curfew like atmosphere prevailed in the capital city area on Sunday after the state government deployment massive police forces in the villages.

The police outnumbered villagers and cracked down on protests demanding continuation of Amaravati as the state capital.

The locals are angry at the police for trying to restrict even regular movements by seeking people’s identity cards. The police are not allowing outsiders to enter the villages unless they show some proof of their purpose to visit the area.

The presence of heavy police forces disturbed peaceful environment in the villages in the capital city. However, the locals participated in dharnas in Velagapudi, Thullur and Mandadam villages on Sunday.

The local farmers are spending sleepless nights since chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy declared his intentions to trifurcate the capital city last month. The farmers are worried that shifting of the secretariat and other departmental headquarters from Amaravati would stall development of the region.

“The political parties should confine their fighting with each other to the elections time and focus on development once the elections are over. Unfortunately, YSRC is indulging in revenge politics seven months after coming to power,” said Dhanekula Ramarao, a farmer in Thullur.

He asked how land value would appreciate if the administration was shifted to elsewhere. “It is unfair to play with the lives of the farmers who parted with their green fields to see a massive capital city for the state at least in the future. Was giving land for the capital city our crime?” asked Rajani Priya of Mandadam.

The people in the capital city villages were not in a mood to celebrate Sankranti keeping in view of the ongoing protests. Continued police restrictions and curbs on protests have had an impact on the festivities in the area as the police were not allowing them even to visit temples.

“We are only doing our duties and trying to protect law and order. We are not interfering in the normal life of the locals,” said rural SP Ch Vijaya Rao.

He said people should take note of the restrictions imposed in the area and cooperate with the police. He said they have never used force on the locals unless they breached the restrictions. “Our men are in fact most restrained and composed. They are only responding to the situation,” said Rao.

In a press release, CPM Visakhapatnam district secretary K Lokanadham said, “How can the same state government, which is mulling to return the pooled assigned lands to the farmers in Amaravati, start pooling 6,100 acres in the district? It was learnt that 2,700 acres will be allocated to housing projects and another 1,000 acres to the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority, out of the proposed 6,100 acres. What will the state government do with the remaining 2,400 acres?” Lokanadham wondered.

“The state government is planning to forcibly pool lands from farmers, depriving them of their livelihood. We demand the government to withdraw the land pooling exercise,” Lokanadham said. tnn

Expressing his anguish over the shifting of the capital, Kumar said the YS Jaganmohan Reddy-led government has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC to suppress the voices of the farmers.

Police have sought details of the DTC buses that entered the JNU campus on January 5 before the violence

NEW DELHI: The nine suspects identified in the January 5 violence at JNU have been served notices by the special investigating team and asked to join the probe. They will be questioned at any place of their choice.

The addresses of all 37 members of the WhatsApp group “Unity against Left” have been retrieved and even they have been sent notices. They will be asked to identify the masked youths next to them caught on CCTV. Sources said though the notices were accepted by a few students, they failed to turn up for questioning. Their hostel wardens have been asked to convince them to appear before police.

Akshat Awasthi and Rohit Kumar , the two ABVP activists who claimed to be involved in the violence during a sting operation by a TV channel, are being tracked. They were send notices by police, but they failed to turn up. Another suspect, Komal Sharma, who was seen with her face covered in a mobile phone video, was found to be a DU student. Even she has been asked to appear before police on Monday.

Police have sought details of the DTC buses that entered JNU on January 5 before the violence. It is suspected that the masked miscreants might have travelled in bus number 615 that plies within the campus. At least two buses had entered the campus between 3pm and 6pm. The passengers are usually not checked by the security guards. Footage of the cameras in the buses would be scanned to identify the passengers.

The entry registers of the JNU gates didn’t give much details of outsiders who had entered the premises, source said. Police are now working on two theories — either the outsiders involved in the Sabarmati hostel violence had come in buses or used the broken portions of the boundary walls to enter the campus.

After scanning through several WhatsApp groups, it was found that at least 20 outsiders had entered the campus. CCTV footage of the gate near Khajan Singh swimming pool is crucial since one of the group members had suggested that it remains unguarded on Saturdays.

Jaipur: After declaring to boycott panchayat polls, residents of a Dalit basti, named Rangaura (Ambedkar Colony) under Sundarpura village in Kotputli, submitted a representation to Kotputli MLA and minister Rajendra Singh Yadav and demanded that a public road to connect their basti with Sundarpura village be built for their convenience. The MLA has assured them of a solution soon.

“We met the minister and submitted a representation urging him to take appropriate action in the matter. Even on Saturday, when a 65-year-old man, Ram Saran Arya, died due to cancer, we had to carry his body for about a kilometre on our shoulders to Sundarpura village,” said Kailash Chand Arya, who runs a private school in the basti.

“But, this time the local administration helped us in removing the wire fencing that blocked the way entering the basti,” he added.

Earlier, at least 88 families, with a population of nearly 500 of Rangaura basti under Sundarpura village in Kotputli had declared to boycott the panchayat elections scheduled on February 1.

The residents complain that neither ambulances nor midday meal, meant to be distributed among children at the angawadi centre, could reach their basti because of connectivity issues.

A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in Rajasthan High Court last year pleading with the court to direct the state government to construct a public road/aam rasta to connect Rangaura Basti with Kripa Ka Tibara Village, Sundarpura link road, by acquiring private land for the public purposes.

A division bench of the high court had asked the petitioners in August 2019 to approach district collector, Jaipur, by way of filing detailed representation mentioning all the facts mentioned in the petition along with all the relevant documents, who shall have the grievances of the petitioners examined by deputing SDO or tehsildar concerned to enquire into the matter and do the needful in accordance with law or otherwise decide the representation by passing speaking order within a period of three months from the date of filing of the representation.

The deceased was identified as A Karuppasamy of Siraj Nagar on Sirumugai Road in Mettupalayam. “A retired Indian Army man, Karuppasamy was addicted to alcohol and used to attack his wife Amuthavalli.

On Saturday around 11.30pm, Karuppasamy, who was in an inebriated condition, called Amuthavalli on her phone and abused her. Her 17-year-old son, a I Year BCA student at Karamadai who came to know about it, reached Karuppasamy’s house and attacked him. Karuppasamy took a sickle from the kitchen and tried to attack the boy. But the boy got hold of the sickle and attacked Karuppasamy, who suffered injuries on his neck. He died on the spot,” a police officer said.

The Mettupalayam police sent the body to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) for postmortem and registered a case against the minor boy under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code , and arrested him.

The incident took place around 5pm on Saturday, when tourists staying at the hotel spotted the leopard strolling in the yard.

The guests and staff were alarmed and informed the forest department. However, the animal fled before the forest officials reached the spot.

Forest ranger Amit Gwasakoti said that the forest department had sent its team to the area and increased patrolling. “We have sent two teams to the area. Though the leopard is yet to be captured, we have increased our presence in the area in order to keep the locals safe,” Gwasakoti said.

Even as they were terrorized, residents of the hotel did not fail to shoot videos of the leopard.

“Those who were first scared after spotting the leopard later came back to shoot videos of it. It was also captured in the CCTV,” said Amit Negi, a local.

VADODARA/ ANAND: Wetlands in lush green Charotar belt of Central Gujarat are home to 160 crocodiles . This is what the 7th Charotar crocodile count conducted by the Voluntary Nature Conservancy (VNC) has revealed.

VNC had carried out the crocodile count between January 3 and January 5 with the support of Charotar University of Science and Technology (CHARUSAT) and Ahmedabad-based Naja India.

“The latest Charotar crocodile count has revealed that the twin districts of Anand and Kheda continue to have healthy population of muggers in their wetlands,” said Aniridh Vasava, research coordinator at VNC.

The count was done at 21 villages of Anand and Kheda districts including Deva, Petli, Changa, Malataj, Dabhou, Marala, Nagharama, Heranj, Khandhali, Laval, Bhadkad, Traj, Tranja, Kathoda, Devataj, Sojitra, Gada, Dali, Navagam, Pij and Vaso.

“We recorded maximum number of crocodiles at Deva, Heranj, Malataj, Petli and Dabhou,” he said, adding that population of crocodiles has remained stable in the region which has rarely witnessed any human-crocodile conflict.

The count has revealed that the total spread of the crocodiles is 900 square km area, considering the wetlands that are spread in these 21 villages.

VNC uses citizen science approach for the crocodile count. “Citizen science is an exciting, multifaceted way to bring people from all walks of life together for research and conservation. It is where the public volunteers time to assist scientists in their research,” he said, adding that 125 participants belonging to nine states of the country and two union territories volunteered for the count.

The volunteers mostly were college students of biological science field, especially zoology, forestry and engineering and also from arts and commerce background.

The count was guided by Dr Raju Vyas, joint vice chair of the IUCN/SSC crocodile specialist group (South Asia and Iran), herpetologist and wildlife rehabilitator Soham Mukherjee and scientist and nature educator Dr Pranav Trivedi.

Dr A J T Johnsingh, one of country’s leading naturalists and field biologists, who after serving for 20 years retired in 2005 as dean of Faculty of Wildlife Sciences from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, was chief guest at the valedictory function of the crocodile count.

N Chandrababu Naidu

GUNTUR: Former chief minister and TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday slammed the police for preventing the party cadres’ bike rally from TDP office in Mangalagiri to Narasaraopet .

Naidu questioned the rights of the police to prevent the rally. He asked the police to follow the Supreme Court advise on imposition of Section 144.

Naidu started his journey from the TDP state office in Mangalagiri to Narasaraopet in his convoy which was preceded by a bike rally of youth wing workers.

He, however, got down from the car after the police stopped the bike rally citing prohibitory orders. The police removed the keys from two-wheelers and asked the youth to drop their rally plans.

Naidu joined the cadres in their protest. He warned of serious action against all those present at the spot if they did not allow them to go ahead. He said it was against the rules to remove the keys of the vehicles. He said that the police should not become puppets in the hands of the ruling party and resort to undemocratic acts.

He said the Supreme Court has made it clear that the imposition of Section 144 without any valid reason was incorrect.

A little later, the police allowed Naidu and his men to go ahead with the bike rally. Earlier in the day, Naidu visited a private hospital and enquired the health condition of the women injured in the police lathi-charge during the protests over the capital city.

He asked the doctors to provide the best medical aid to the women who were championed the fighting to protect Amaravati. He lashed out at the police for their brutality against women.

TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh said the state government had deployed more than 1,000 police constables in each of the capital city villages. He said a peaceful Amaravati was now resembling Kashmir due to the deployment of the police.

Bhagaram of Kitnod village

JAISALMER: Locusts have not only affected crops in Barmer and Jaisalmer but are now also becoming a cause for farmers’ deaths. A farmer, identified as Bhagaram (38) of Kitnod village in Balotara, was so shocked by the locust attack that he suffered a heart attack on Thursday. He was taken to the hospital but died during treatment. A police case was registered after this incident. On Friday a team of revenue officers visited the fields and took stock of the damage.

According to the deceased farmer’s family, Bhagaram had taken a loan of a few lakhs and had sown jeera in 50 bighas of his land. On January 5 and 6 locusts attacked his field. On seeing the damage, he suffered a cardiac arrest . He was taken to government hospital in Balotara where he died. However, according to other farmers, the locusts could not damage all the crop.

VADODARA: A senior citizen living on New Sama Road lost Rs 99,994 to cyber frauds .

The victim, Amogh Dharmadhikari (70), was duped by a man who claimed to have called from a mobile service providing company.

According to Dharmadhikari, he received a call on August 27 last year from the accused asking whether he recharged his mobile phone twice. When Dharmadhikari confirmed, the accused informed him that he will be able to get the refund after filling a form. Dharmadhikari received the web link for the form on his mobile phone. Along with the amount details, Dharmadhikari was also asked to fill the last four digits of his bank account number and his personal identification number (PIN).

After submitting the form, the victim called the accused to inform about it. He was told that due to low internet connectivity, the transaction is taking time and asked him not to hang up the call. After a while, Dharmadhikari became suspicious so he hung up the call and went to his bank. On checking his account’s details, the bank executives told him that Rs 99,994 had been debited from his account through Unified Payment Interface (UPI).

Dharmadhikari then went to the Cyber Crime police station and gave an application to register the offence. Police registered an FIR based on the victim’s complaint on Saturday. Cops said that Dharmadhikari had recharged his mobile phone twice on August 24 last year so he was convinced by the accused on the call and fell in the trap.

187,['13/01/2020'],Shaheen Bagh protest: Hundreds of south Delhi residents on road to demand opening of Kalindi Kunj stretch,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Aware of the protest plans, police erected barricades to ensure traffic wasn’t blocked on Mathura Road

NEW DELHi: Sunday was witness to a protest against a protest: agitated with the closure of the road connecting Kalindi Kunj to Noida, hundreds of residents of Shaheen Bagh and Sarita Vihar staged a demonstration, demanding that the barricades be removed and the stretch opened.

The residents, seeking immediate police action, said office-goers and schoolchildren were facing the brunt of the closure. The agitators had decided to block Mathura Road , but after an assurance from senior police officers, they agreed to a meeting with the Shaheen Bagh protesters on Monday to find a solution.

The average travel time between Noida and south Delhi has more than doubled after the closure of Road No. 13A due to anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters occupying it. According to an estimate, Mathura Road and Ring Road are currently bearing vehicular volume almost four times their capacity.

Traffic police said that vehicles from south Delhi destined for Noida were being diverted to Mathura Road to reach Ashram and, then, to DND Flyway . Police are forced to manually control the traffic signals to prevent chaos. Even those taking the Barapullah elevated road are finding that there is no easy way out.

The stretch gets choked at peak hours, and insiders say that a 50% increase in the number of vehicles plying between Delhi and Noida is creating big jams there.

Sunday’s march was carried out from Madanpur Khadar to Sarita Vihar. Residents of Noida, whose children study in schools in and around Sarita Vihar, also joined in. The protesters also raised slogans against chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and local MLA Amanatullah Khan.

The residents started gathering in large numbers around 11am to block Mathura Road. Aware of their plans, police had erected barricades to ensure that traffic movement wasn’t blocked.

It’s been 28 days since residents of Shaheen Bagh have occupied both carriageways of Road No. 13 in protest against CAA and NRC. Ravi Yadav, a resident of Noida Sector 18, who had joined Sunday’s protest, said: “My son studies in a school in Sarita Vihar. He hasn’t been able to attend classes for two weeks now. My wife and I are both working, but as our son is at home, one of us has to take leave.” Yadav said the school was not plying a bus on the route because of the protests.

The residents finally squatted at Maharaja Agrasen Marg near Sarita Vihar A Block. “Delhi Police humara rasta kholo, hum tumhare saath hain” (Delhi Police open the road, we are with you),” they shouted.

Luvkesh Gautam, a Delhi University student, claimed: “Some days ago, an ambulance was stuck at Madanpur Khadar. We had to intervene and make way for it. The delay could have cost a person’s life.”

“The convenience of the common man should be kept in mind too. If they don’t get up, we can also block some other road (in protest). Police have assured us that they will try to find a way out. If nothing happens in the next 72 hours, we will have to do something,” said Dhir Singh Bhaduri, a former MLA who was among the organisers of Sunday’s march.

With the exam season approaching, parents said they were worried about the situation.

BAREILLY: The power department officials on Sunday filed 16 FIRs domestic power consumers, including a few e-rickshaw drivers, in Bareilly for alleged power theft. They were booked under section 135 and 138 (B) of the Electricity Act.

The penal action came during a special enforcement drive launched by the power department, in which the officials raided in parts of Old City, and nearby areas to check power theft.

Officials at the power department said the areas were selected for conducting raids based on the line loss and overloading reported particularly from these areas. The inspections were conducted despite being Sunday and no prior information or warning was issued to the erring power consumers.

“Inspections were conducted around 5 am in parts of Old City and areas including Jagatpur, Joginawada, Bukharpura, Shahdana, and nearby areas. Mainly residential areas were checked and around 16 people were caught drawing electricity illegally. FIRs have been lodged against them under section 135 (energy theft),” sub-divisional officer (SDO), Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (MVVNL), Bareilly, Satyarth Gangwar told TOI.

“These were the domestic power consumers, whose electricity connections were disconnected by the power department previously for not clearing their dues. However, they managed to hook up the cables and were enjoying free electricity supply,” he added.

During the drive, the officials found e-rickshaw drivers drawing current illegally from electric poles to charge their vehicles.

“During the raids, four electric rickshaws were spotted parked close to one another nearby an electricity pole. It was later found that these drivers had parked their vehicles in a certain way so that no one finds about them charging their vehicles illegally. FIRs have been registered in four such cases under section 138 B of electricity act,” the SDO said.

The raids were conducted by the power department’s enforcement team led by MVVNL director Vijay Kumar and CO (vigilance) JS Patani and other power department officials, including superintendent engineers, JEs and other staff members.

RUDRAPUR: The special investigation team (SIT) team probing the SC/ST scholarship scam arrested two persons for their alleged involvement in it on late Saturday night.

The accused have been identified as Sanjay Singh Rana and Sanjay Prakash, both residents of village Bidaura Majhola, in Sitarganj of district Udham Singh Nagar.

They had been absconding since a case was filed against eight people at Sitarganj police station last year.

The accused, who worked as middlemen in conniving with social welfare department officials, had collected certificates from students belonging to the SC/ST community, on the pretext of helping them with admission at Moradabad Polytechnic College, Uttar Pradesh .

Some students said that representatives of the institute had approached them, asking for their documents, on the pretext of providing them a scholarship and a degree. They got neither.

Senior sub inspector of police BS Bisht said that a joint team of SIT and police is still investigating the exact number of students whose certificates were used to siphon off scholarships meant for SC/ST students.

According to SIT officials, an investigation of bank details revealed that a major portion of the scholarship amounts was embezzled first by the institute and then the social welfare department department.

The rest of the money was transferred to fraudulent accounts created under the students’ name, which would later be transferred to the bank account of the institute.

Both the accused in the scam were booked under sections 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 467 (Forgery of valuable security, will, etc), 468 (Forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (Using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) and 120b (Punishment of criminal conspiracy) of IPC and sections 3/2 of the SC/ST Act.

192,['13/01/2020'],2k enthusiasts flock to Udaipur for bird fest,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Udaipur: The three-day Udaipur bird festival concluded on Sunday here with more than 2,000 people participating in the event. Hundreds of varieties of the avian species were sighted at several wetlands across Udaipur as part of guided bird watching sessions.

A key feature of the guided bird watching was that they were conducted by nature guides who travelled from different cities of south Rajasthan. Some of the special bird sightings included the steppe eagle, greater spotted eagle, yellow footed green pigeon etc. Enlightening bird lovers on the occasion, historian Shri Krishna Jugnu shared interesting facts of bird watching during the ancient times. “Bird watching is not a new trend, it was prevalent even during the Vedic period. Birds and animals can predict earthquakes and weather changes. Just before the onset of South West Monsoon certain kinds of birds are seen in Kerala,” he said.

He added that if animals behave strangely, then some natural catastrophe like earthquakes occur. This has also been documented by scientists. People in the western countries have some beliefs about at least 15 types of birds. In Tamil also there are plenty of proverbs on birds and animals. Crow is praised and insulted in Tamil proverbs, Jugnu said. Tamil Panchang (traditional calendars with Hindu festival days etc) has got two pages devoted to Pancha Pakshi Shastra (prediction by five birds) and lizard predictions. The bird astrology divides the day into five parts allocating one each to vulture, owl, crow, cock and peacock. The historian also said VarahMihir, the 6th century polymath in his Brihat Samhita has made astrological predictions based on birds behaviour and sounds.

Speaking on the closing ceremony, minister of sports and youth affairs, Ashok Chandana said bird conservation is important in maintaining the diversity of the planet. We should learn from the birds to adapt our own behaviours to live in this world rather than forcing it into an artificial and unsustainable one. He added that birds help greatly with seed dispersal and increase forest growth and conservation. They are an important part of the eco-system.

The minister also stressed on sensitising people, specially youth, for preserving birds and hence contribute in the expansion of the forest wealth. Birds have unique behaviours and personalities and the more we watch and observe them, the more we will grow to appreciate nature, therefore such festivals should be organised regularly, he concluded.

AMARAVATI: YSRC spokesperson Ambati Rambabu on Sunday alleged that TDP were trying to create unrest across the state over the proposal to have three capital cities.

Speaking to media here on Sunday, Ambati said videos circulating on social media were not related to Amaravati protests. “Former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu stoops down to any extent to create unnecessary controversies when in opposition,” said Ambati.

He asked why Naidu and his son Lokesh were spreading false information regarding Amaravati protests. He said Naidu should apologise to people for misleading them. “TDP circulated a video on social media in which a person was attempting suicide by touching an electric transformer claiming he was a farmer from Amaravati. The person who attempted suicide after his wife died is from Tamil Nadu and out of danger,” said Ambati.

He said in another social media post in which TDP said women were beaten by police was found to be fake. The same post was used to spread fake news on CAA protest. The post claimed that the women were from West Bengal and were injured in stone-pelting while travelling on train. “Pawan Kalyan, too, is depending on fake posts since he has become a TDP puppet,” alleged Ambati.

He said Naidu’s cheap tricks to provoke farmers would not win him any sympathy from people. He urged the police to take immediate action against all those involved in spreading false campaign to create unrest in the state.

VADODARA: An illegal mobile phone network running illegally inside the Vadodara Central Jain was unearthed by the city police. The network was being operated by the convict of the Godhra carnage Salim alias Salman Zarda.

Eight persons including Zarda were arrested by the crime branch sleuths.

Police said that Zarda used to charge anything between Rs 50 and Rs 100 from the jail inmates for making calls from his mobile phones. Police said that from one of the phones seized from Zarda, five sim cards were found to have been used in it. “All the five sim cards were activated from Godhra so we focussed our probe there. The sim cards were bought in the name of a person who is mentally challenged,” said a police official. It was later known that the mentally challenged person’s brother Shoaib Razaq had bought the sim cards. Razaq was then picked up and interrogated about the sim cards.

Razaq admitted to the police that the sim cards were bought on the instructions of Zarda. He met a murder convict Ashok Vasava who used to work at a temple in the jail compound. “Vasava agreed to carry a mobile phone and the sim cards for Rs 2,000. He had tied the phone to his feet due to which the jail sepoys could not find the phone,” the police official said.

Zarda then used to share the sim cards with other inmates to make calls for anything between Rs 50 and Rs 100 for a minute’s call. “Zarda used to take the money either in the form of jail’s token or ask the inmate to arrange a third-party payment outside the prison,” the official added.

Shashi Tharoor

NEW DELHI: Commending the spirit of Jamia Millia Islamia students in their fight against Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor called them the “hope of every democrat in the country”.

Addressing the gathering outside Jamia, where protests have been on for the past 31 days, Tharoor hit out at the BJP government for introducing religion into CAA. He also criticised police for the December 15 incident, when they had entered the Jamia campus and beaten up students.

There was a small section at the venue that flashed placards with “La ilaha illallah” and “We are suppressed and oppressed because of our identity. Islam is our identity” written on them. Around 10 people, who claimed to be Jamia students, shouted “La ilaha illallah” after Tharoor completed his speech and was leaving for Shaheen Bagh. Earlier, Tharoor had been criticised for commenting on the chant during CAA protests.

“What has happened to bring us to this point is the undemocratic and discriminatory efforts by the government to marginalise one community. I had opposed the introduction of CAA in Parliament as for the first time religion was being made a part of it. This is not something that we can accept,” Tharoor said.

The MP added, “The home minister had said in Parliament that CAA will be followed by NRC across India. The onus will be on just one community to prove their citizenship. That is not the India we had envisioned. We want an India where everyone is free to be who they are, to be a strong Muslim or Hindu as they want to be.”

In a veiled manner, Tharoor spoke of the Muslim identity. “Those friends who are concerned about their identity, we share your concern. Hindus want to live in India where non-Hindus are equally safe, he added. Quoting poet Dushyant Kumar, he called the students, teachers and citizens the “hope for the country” as they spoke against the idea of India envisioned by the BJP government.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra , who shared the stage with Tharoor, said the CAA destroys the idea of India, which Gandhi ji fought for.

Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank

DEHRADUN: Union human resource minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank on Sunday announced that Uttarakhand will get an Atal Innovation Academy very soon.

State higher education minister Dhan Singh Rawat had mooted an idea of opening cyber security course whose sub-centre will also be built in either at National Institute of Technology (NIT-Uttarakhand) or at Garhwal Central University.

The HRD minister, during an event organised at Graphic Era Hill University, also inaugurated three education-related portals of All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

These portals include the website of Educational Alliance for Technology (NEAT) which is meant to use technology for better learning outcomes in higher education. The AICTE is the implementing agency for NEAT programme whose objective is to use Artificial Intelligence to make learning more personalised and customised as per the requirements of the learner. This requires development of technologies in Adaptive Learning to address the diversity of learners.

“We believe that India will grow in technology education through the NEAT portal and MHRD would act as a facilitator to ensure that all facilities and solutions are freely available to a large number of economically backward students,” the HRD minister said.

Cavalcade of ambassadors of 17 countries during their visit to Jagat Migrant camp in Jammu (PTI)

WASHINGTON: The state department has described the recent visit of envoys of 15 countries, including that of the US, to Jammu & Kashmir as an ""important step"" but expressed concern over the continued detention of politicians and restrictions on internet in the region.

In the trip by foreign diplomats after August 5, envoys of 15 countries, including the US ambassador to India, Kenneth Juster, last week visited Jammu & Kashmir where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as top military brass. Principal deputy assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs Alice Wells, who will be travelling to South Asia this week, on Saturday expressed hope that the region will return to normalcy.

""Closely following @USAmbIndia & other foreign diplomats' recent trip to J&K. Important step. We remain concerned by detention of politicians and residents, and internet restrictions. We look forward to a return to normalcy,"" she tweeted. Wells will travel to New Delhi from January 15-18 to attend the Raisina Dialogue.

She will also meet with senior government officials to advance the US-India strategic global partnership following the success of the 2019 US-India 2+2 ministerial dialogue, and will discuss topics of mutual interest with members of the business community and civil society. From New Delhi, Wells will fly to Islamabad where she will meet with Pakistan's top officials and members of civil society to discuss issues of bilateral and regional concern. Pakistan has been unsuccessfully trying to drum up international support against India for withdrawing Jammu and Kashmir's special status.

Reacting sharply to India's decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian high commissioner.

Expressing his anguish over the shifting of the capital, Kumar said the YS Jaganmohan Reddy-led government has imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC to suppress the voices of the farmers. Coming down heavily on the three capital proposal, he questioned the police inspector as to why the chief minister was shifting capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam without doing justice to the farmers of Amaravati, who had voluntarily given their lands for the capital city. tnn

VADODARA: The director of Aims Industries Pvt Ltd, plant manager and operator-cum-supervisor were arrested in connection with the blast at the oxygen bottling plant in Gavasad village in Padra taluka that claimed six lives and injured four persons.

Cops charged director Satyakumar Nair, plant manager Akash Agrawal and the operator Raju Rathwa for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Police said that they are searching for owner Siddharth Patel and his son and director Swetanshu Patel.

Investigating team also took the trio to the factory on Sunday for probing matters on the ground. However, police refused to divulge details of what the three accused revealed. “Our other team is searching for the key accused. More details can be known only after the arrested accused have been questioned,” said a police official.

Meanwhile, the families of the six deceased have accepted the bodies on Sunday. The management of the company handed over cheques of Rs 21 lakh to family members of each deceased. The final rites were performed later during the day in their native places.

Sources said that the four injured persons identified as Ashok Padhiyar, Gulabsinh Rathod, Mafat Parmar and Fatehsinh Padhiyar continue to remain under critical conditions. They are undergoing treatment at BAPS Swaminarayan hospital in Atladara.

The blast on Saturday morning had sent tremors in the area. Investigators said that while bottling, the oxygen and hydrogen gases, due to high pressure in the cylinders, a few of them blasted killing all six on the spot and critically injuring others.

JNU VC M Jagadesh Kumar

NEW DELHI: A fact-finding committee of Congress investigating the violence in JNU has called the attack “state-sponsored” and accused JNU vice-chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar of being the “mastermind, working at the behest of RSS”.

The four-member team visited JNU and met students and faculty members on January 8. In the report submitted to Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday, the team sought immediate dismissal of the VC, an independent inquiry into all administrative decisions and faculty appointments made by Kumar since his appointment in 2016, and a criminal investigation against him, the faculty members involved in the violence and the security agency for its failure to rein in the attackers on campus.

Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, who referred to Kumar as a “cancer” that was “spreading fast”, said the Congress team attempted to speak to the VC for his side of the story but received no response from him. Dev also claimed ABVP students declined to speak to Congress saying the matter was sub-judice. Slamming Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik, the committee said, “Fix accountability of the police chief and other police officials because of their failure to act on emergency calls by students and faculty members and in light of the overwhelming prima facie evidence that they facilitated the criminal elements on campus.”

Congress demanded “complete rollback” of the JNU hostel fee hike. “JNU’s own annual report has said a large section of its students come from families with a monthly income of less than Rs 12,000. After the fee hike, JNU has become the most expensive varsity in the country and self-financing students will have to pay Rs 7,000 to stay and study. In effect, they are denying poor students the right to education,” Dev said.

JAIPUR: Health minister Raghu Sharma on Sunday launched a programme to discourage teenage pregnancy to bring down the number of maternal and infant mortalities in the state.At an event organised by the Rajasthan State AIDS Control Society (RSACS) with the support of social organisations to celebrate National Youth Day, Sharma launched the campaign by holding a placard for discouraging teenage pregnancy.Rajasthan is one of the states reporting the highest number of child marriages resulting in early motherhood. As per the National Family Health Survey-4 data, 35 per cent of girls in the state were married before the age of 18 and more than six per cent of these girls either had children or were pregnant at the time of the survey.Teenage pregnancies compromise health as well as education of adolescents. According to the health experts, maternal mortality rates for married adolescents in ages 15 to 19 years are higher than women in their twenties and early thirties.According to the details of the campaign, it is designed to engage the public, elected representatives, government officials and other community partners to recognise teenage pregnancy as priority for adolescent health and development in the state.The campaign stresses that adolescent pregnancies are more likely to be associated with low birth weight, prematurity, birth injuries, stillbirth, and infant mortality. Apart from the health risks, adolescent childbearing and the conditions associated with it are fundamental factors determining the quality of life and role of women in a society.“One-fifth of the population of Rajasthan are adolescents and their improved health will have a significant impact on the social and economic profile of the state. The aim of the campaign is to create greater awareness around teenage pregnancy in the state and encourage important stakeholders to make a strong commitment towards ending teenage pregnancy,” said Nikita Srivastava, senior state programme manager of national civil society organisation, Population Foundation of India.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73223872,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-428501,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/campaign-against-teenage-pregnancy-launched-in-raj/articleshow/73219354.cms

CHENNAI: Ten years after the civil war in Sri Lanka ended, books on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) and its slain chief Velupillai Prabhakaran continue to sell at the Chennai Book Fair . Multiple books with Prabhakaran on the cover were on display at several stalls.

The demand though is less than in 2009 when the war between the Sri Lankan military and the LTTE was in the final stages. Besides, this year there have only be a couple of new titles.

K Bhoopathi, a publisher, said he has stocked about 40 to 50 titles on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue numbering nearly 1000 books. “The interest on buying books about the Lankan Tamil issue continued this year, as well. Readers are also purchasing books that are critical about the LTTE,” he said.

Novels, travelogues in the strife-torn zone and fictional literature penned by those who experienced the war are up for sale. “But, we do not have new titles on Sri Lanka because the crisis is not on the scale about a decade ago. Publishers cash-in on boiling topics and Sri Lanka is not on the list, unlike the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA),” said writer and publisher Tirupur Guna.

Visitors said Tamil books on Sri Lanka attract the attention of both avid and casual readers. K Sambath Kumar, a visitor, said people interested in books on the neighbouring nation look for new titles every time.

The 43rd Chennai Book Fair at the YMCA grounds at Nandanam, which started on January 9, has recorded one lakh footfalls so far. Though the numbers are on the rise, visitors are complaining about poor maintenance of toilets that are stinking and situated in dingy places without lighting facilities. Senior citizens and women were especially inconvenienced.

When contacted, R S Shanmugam, president of Booksellers and Publishers' Association of South India, which is organizing the fair, said 60 toilets had been installed and manpower was available for their upkeep. “We will check the issue,” he added.

VADODARA: A retired Naval officer who dresses up like a clown to spread happiness among cancer kids, a former teacher who spends time meeting families of martyrs and spreading their stories in schools and colleges, were few of the unsung heroes who were felicitated at the national youth conference – Yugaantar 2020 – organised by MS University’s Institute of Leadership and Governance here on Sunday.

Armed with colourful clothes, exaggerated footwear and a red nose, Pravin Tulpule, has been going around hospital wards to delight children suffering from cancer for the last 17 years. With a string of jokes and magic tricks, he keeps his audience engaged for as long as 60 minutes in each show.

Tulpule, a President’s gold medalist, served in the Indian Navy as a lieutenant commander (communications specialist) for years, during the course of which he handled various challenging appointments. He stepped down from his position with the sole intention of making people happy.

“The year 2000 marked a turning point in my life. At my friends’ request, I dressed up as a clown for a group of children in Mumbai. While I was performing, a little boy kept tagging along with me till the end of the show, 48 hours later, my friend informed me that the boy, who was suffering from cancer, had died,” he recollected.

“I was quite depressed but at the same time experienced a sense of relief when I found out that one of the last wishes of that boy was to meet a clown,” he said, adding that from that day, his life’s mission is to clown around and spread happiness among people.

Vikas Manhas, a storyteller from Jammu & Kashmir, has been travelling almost 11 months in a year for the last 20 years. These travels range from houses in metros to remote rural villages across the country. Manhas undertakes his travel to visit families of slain soldiers and martyrs.

Manhas who had began his pursuit in 1999 after the Kargil War has visited more than 200 families of martyrs across the length and breadth of the country and he remains in touch with most of them. Since he has started sharing stories of bravery of the martyred soldiers and their courageous families, he has inspired nearly 100 youth to join the Indian Army.

Like the duo, Kunal Sir, who works for the physically challenged in the Naxal-hit areas of Chhatisgarh, Dr Shashi Rao, whose trust focuses on concept learning, Kotresh Bhahvihali, who works on school drop-outs among others were also felicitated.

Chennai: An eight-month-old boy has allegedly been kidnapped by a woman from Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on Sunday after claiming to feature the child in a movie.

John is the son of Johny and Ranthosh, a couple from Maharashtra, who make a living by selling balloons on Marina.

The suspect had approached the couple on Marina on Sunday evening expressing her desire to feature the child in a movie as he was cute. Believing her, Ranthosh and her mother-in-law took the child and went with the woman. She first took them to Omandurar Government Hospital, after which they were taken to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital claiming that the boy needs to take a medical test before he’s taken to a studio. The woman allegedly told Ranthosh that she needs to change the child’s clothes and get a skin test done at the hospital. She made them wait outside a room and took the child inside. Since she did not come out for a long time, Ranthosh enquired about the woman to a few staff. After they said that there was no such test being done at the hospital, she became alarmed and approached the police.

Police checked the CCTV camera footage and found the woman leaving the hospital premises with the child. A case has been registered and a search has been launched.

Police suspect that the woman could have kidnapped the child for trafficking. They are also questioning a few auto drivers in the locality to find out if the woman had boarded any vehicle.

Coimbatore: While all other cities selected under the Smart Cities Mission in 2016 have set up websites and regularly update information about the ongoing projects, the Coimbatore Smart City Limited (CSCL) is curiously lagging behind.

The city corporation has kept http://www.coimbatoresmartcity.in/ under construction for the last four years, raising serious questions about transparency.

As many as 20 cities including Coimbatore, Indore, Bhopal, New Delhi and Chennai were selected in the first round of the mission. The cities built websites to list the projects they were planning to implement under the mission and have been providing updates on a regular basis.

The Indore Smart City Development Limited has set a standard by uploading its annual finance report, which has detailed information about annual turnover of the company, company share and its shareholders. The website also has the latest information pertaining to tenders, board meetings and projects.

“When other corporations are transparent, what is happening here?” asked M Loganathan, a city-based activist. “When other corporations are maintaining their websites efficiently, the Coimbatore city corporation is yet to build one. The civic body is keeping public in the dark. We have to struggle to get even the basic information about the projects using the right to information (RTI) Act, that too only after escalating the issue several times.”

When the central government is emphasising the need for public participation, it is not fair to deprive public of basic information, said K Kathirmathiyon of Coimbatore Consumer Cause. “Under Section 4 of RTI Act, project information should be voluntarily given to the public as it is their right to know about the projects that are being implemented in the city using their money. Also, it would improve the relationship between the civic body and public.”

Lack of transparency sow seeds of suspicion, said activist SP Thiyagarajan. “The corporation might be hiding information from public to cover up corruption or they are scared of what people think about the projects. Most of the projects are useless.”

“Converting abandoned lakes into recreational spaces through lake rejuvenation and restoration project is a good one. But, why spend close to 50% of the fund for setting up recreating spaces when the city is deprived of basic amenities? The corporation should have sought opinion from public before designing the projects,” Thiyagarajan told TOI.

Meanwhile, a corporation official said that the civic body is working to build the website incorporating all information.

Angry passengers complain about flight delay to Air India staff at Goa International Airport

PANAJI: Air India flight AI 994 Dubai-Goa-Bengaluru was delayed by a little more than seven hours on Sunday leaving over 160 passengers fuming at Goa International Airport. The flight took off at 11.52am instead of the scheduled departure time of 4.30am, airport officials said.

The arrival of the aircraft from Dubai was delayed due to bad weather conditions over Dubai.

The popular Gulf destination has witnessed heavy showers, sporadic hailstorms and flooding. Passengers said that Air India failed to inform them about the delay and provided refreshments only after they complained.

According to sources, several passengers missed their connecting flights from Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru.

“We were not informed that our flight was delayed. It took us one-and-a-half hour to check-in and after checking in, they told us that the flight is delayed. There was a long line and only two counters were open for three flights,” Bengaluru resident David Carvalho said.

Carvalho and his wife Sylvia had come to Goa to attend a wedding and had decided to take the early morning flight to go home in time for their daughter’s third birthday.

Light rain and thunder were recorded over at Dubai. Flooding and thundershowers affected flight movements with heavy showers being reported all along the coastline of the United Arab Emirates. Weather reports indicate that heavy showers are expected in Arabian Gulf over the next two days.

A spokesman for Dubai Airports said operations at Dubai International Airport were hampered on Sunday by the knock-on effects of water-logging caused by heavy rainfall which in turn led to flight delays, cancellations and diversions.

On the other hand, around 300 Indian passengers, including Goans, were stranded at Dubai International Airport as Terminal 1 was flooded.

Vikky, a ministry of defence personnel was on his way to Bengaluru from where he was scheduled to board a flight to Delhi, but missed his connecting flight. “Urgent help required!

216,['13/01/2020'],"After survey, Centre’s health wing lists areas that need improvement to GCC","This story is from January 13, 2020

Chennai: After conducting a detailed ground survey in Thiru-Vi-Ka Nagar (zone 6) of Greater Chennai Corporation , the regional office of the directorate general of health services has given a list of suggestions to the civic body’s health wing on issues like treatment of leprosy, tuberculosis and child and maternal health.

Senior officials said the survey was part of a routine assessment by officials of the Union government, who monitor the implementation of the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) at GCC’s primary and secondary health centres. “It was done in zone 6, which has a higher percentage of socio-economic backwardness, in December. The findings were presented to GCC and a report will be submitted to the Union Health ministry,” said GCC sources.

Several specific issues were highlighted in the feedback. For instance, the survey found that deformity rate in cases of leprosy among children was 26%, while the deformity rate of affected people overall was 5.3%. Suggestions were made to fill the leprosy health inspector posts by director of public health (DPH), as 17 of the 91 posts are vacant. Regular surveys should be conducted among vulnerable sections like slums, homeless, beggars, construction and brick kiln workers to identify leprosy cases early, the officials suggested.

“Tamil Nadu has a robust leprosy screening process, even in schools. Skin checks of children in poorer areas of the city should be carried out for early detection,” the survey suggested, adding that the Mahila Arokya Samiti, a scheme to enlist community participation during health camps, was implemented.

The survey found a high default rate in treatment among tuberculosis patients, especially among those addicted to alcohol. “TB patients, especially men, stop treatment midway which affects their entire family as they may be breadwinners. This has to be corrected by ensuring presence of mental health counsellors who speak to patients,” the survey suggested.

The survey also detected an issue of a high number of low birth-weight babies in the area and suggested GCC to document the socio-economic conditions and hospital visits of moms-to-be. For maternal health, the survey noted that GCC health centres were not storing blood and labour rooms were not in the best of shape. “GCC has applied for license for blood storage and will soon start training staff,” said a source. The survey also found that there was a low utilisation of newer contraceptives such as weekly oral contraceptive and the 3-month injectable contraceptive.

For tackling blindness, GCC was asked to document diabetic screening of all patients, especially in polyclinics, by deputing ophthalmologists.

Representative image

JAIPUR: Unearthing more evidence against the accused in the Pratap Nagar double murder case, police have now confirmed the meeting between hired killer Saurabh Chaudhary and Rohit Tiwari using CCTV camera footage from the hotel where the conspirators had met on January 3 to finalise the crime.

Rohit and the Saurabh had met at a hotel near the airport to plan the murder of Rohit’s wife Shweta Tiwari and infant son Shreyam who were killed brutally on January 7. “We have ample evidence to prove that the two accused had pre-planned the murders and gone into minute details to execute the crime. The CCTV footage shows the duo entering the hotel on January 3 and coming out of it. It was there that Rohit had given Saurabh an advance amount of Rs 20,000.

“We have other evidences against Rohit as well to prove that he was the mastermind behind the killings. But they cannot be made public at this point,” said a police official heading the investigation.

According to cops, while the two accused had a pact to kill each other’s wives, Rohit was to pay approximately Rs 5 lakh to Saurabh for the murders of his wife and son.

Elaborating on the investigation, the official said, “The two were very smart operators and tried to leave behind minimum digital evidence. Rohit had switched off location settings on his phone so his whereabouts on days prior to the murders could not be traced. They both have engineering background and appear to be quite intelligent. The accused hardly kept in touch over the phone but would meet in person to discuss the plan.”

Though Shweta was only killed now, she had an inkling of the lurking danger over six years ago. “She had written a note in 2013 which was not addressed to anyone but stated that her husband Rohit was still in love with his girlfriend from before marriage. She also wrote that in case something happens to her then Rohit is to be blamed,” a police officer told TOI.

Rohit’s relationship with his girlfriend ended in 2007 and he got married to Shweta in 2011.

During investigation, cops found that there was a truth in what Shweta had written in 2013 as Rohit had created an account on social media in 2018 under the name of his former girlfriend. “Rohit appeared to be fixated with his ex-girlfriend and he created an account under name. Using this fake account, he would send messages to his own social media account talking about a future together. While on one hand he was doing this, we found that he was also paying for sex when he travelled to other cities,” the officer said.

Both the accused are in police remand till Monday and the cops are planning to request an extension.

Police had detained Rohit’s friend Hari Singh who had recommended the hired killer but till now have not found any evidence to suggest that he was in any other way involved in the twin murders which sent shock waves across the city.

An aerial view of the Srinivasapuram Foreshore Estate

CHENNAI: Work on demolition of the existing slum board tenements in Srinivasapuram , near the mouth of Adyar estuary in Foreshore Estate, and construction of new ones in the same location may not be taken up any time soon. More squatters demanding tenements and allowance have caused the delay.

A senior official of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board said the proposal included construction of 2,016 new tenements after demolishing the existing 1,356 tenements. An addition of 660 tenements with each flat measuring 400 sqft was proposed. In the existing system, each tenement has ground plus three floors, the new ones will have five floors.

The board had approached the Union government for funds. The proposal was scrutinized by the central sanctioning and monitoring committee. The committee then recommended to the Centre to sanction the funds for the project under ‘Housing for All’ scheme.

Following the Union government’s nod, the board held a public consultation in Srinivasapuram a fortnight ago. During the public consultation, around 2,400 encroachers demanded they should also get slum board tenement allocation. “They did not want to move out of the area,” the official.

A senior official from the Chennai River Restoration said ecological restoration of Adyar river is in its final stage. With squatters refusing to move out of Srinivasapuram area, the restoration work cannot be completed.

Another TNSCB official said after demolition of the existing tenements in Srinivasapuram, the board had to pay Rs 7,000 per family as an allowance for their stay outside. The proposal included only those living in the existing tenements and another 660 people in that area. But, the number of squatters is more than 2,400 and the board may not be able to construct tenements for all of them. Moreover, it would be difficult for the board to provide allowance to all these people from the date of demolition to the date of rehabilitating them in the new tenements, the official explained.

Another official from the board blamed some political party cadres for instigating people for vested interests.

NEW DELHI: The Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ) campus witnessed a flurry of activity early on Sunday with a group armed with binoculars and cameras assembling in the forested areas. The excitement in the air was the result of Big Bird Day , a daylong event of Delhibird held every year since 2004.

The group, which included seasoned birders as well as first timers, walked and watched various common and rare birds in different corners of the campus. The 20-odd avian enthusiasts entered through Pashchimabad Gate and started birdwatching from Department of Life Sciences with a flock of Alexandrian parakeet.

Surya Prakash, a zoologist from JNU and an ardent birder leading the group, said, “This land was developed in 1973. G Parthasarathi, the first vice-chancellor, had envisioned JNU to have a bird sanctuary and deer park. Today, there are 205 species of birds here and 80% of Delhi’s butterflies.”

Apart from the hundreds of birds, random peacocks could be seen all over the campus. There were murmurs of a tailor, an oriental white eye, a warbler or a hornbill being spotted. After a few minutes, a spotted owl was seen in a tree.

For 26-year-old Abhisekh V, a UPSC aspirant from Bengaluru, it was a unique experience. “I got to know about this through Facebook. I have never been on a count, but have visited Sultanpur,” said the Rajinder Nagar resident.

As the fog cleared out, mynas could be seen hopping and skipping near Central Library. At Parthasarathi Rocks, misty and myriad hues of green were visible under the morning sun.

After JNU, the group went to Sanjay Van and Neela Hauz, where they spotted Ferrogenous poachard. At Bhatti Mines small minivets and a flock of Egyptian vultures were sighted. “The rare sightings at JNU included Eurasian sparrow hawks and green warblers. All 60-70 teams will compile data and the final report will come on January 19,” Prakash said.

This year’s count saw people gather at 68 birding hotspots across the country, including 35 in Delhi-NCR.

Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at Yamuna Biodiversity Park, said, “Heavy smog at Yamuna Biodiversity Park resulted in poor visibility and fewer birds were sighted. Europe was warmer this year, so migration was delayed. There is a high possibility of seeing many migratory birds in the next few weeks.”

Dr Shah Hussain, scientist in-charge at Aravalli Biodiversity Park, said as the bird count was early this year, migrant species like grey-headed flycatcher, Rosy starlings, orange-headed, among others, were not sighted.

“We saw 56 bird species at Aravalli Biodiversity Park and 31 at Neela Hauz. Eurasian eagle owl, Yellow watled lapwing, Paddy field pipit, common wood shrike and house sparrow were seen at Aravalli and Ferogenous poachard, shovler, gadwal, green sandpiper, wood sandpiper at Neela Hauz,” Hussain said.

220,['13/01/2020'],"6 arrested for sodomy, assault; sent to 5-day police custody","This story is from January 13, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik rural police on Saturday arrested six people from different parts of the city on charges of attempt to murder , sodomy and sections of the Atrocities Act for attacking two people.

The suspects assaulted the victims, who had gone to play music at a birthday party, and sodomised them late on Thursday. The victims, who returned home on Friday morning, did not approach police fearing for their life. The duo later got admitted to Nashik civil hospital. When the news reached Nashik taluka police, a team reached the hospital and registered an offence against 10 suspects.

By evening a total of six suspects were arrested and on Sunday they were produced before a city court that remanded them in five-day police custody.

Police inspector Vishnu Avhad of Nashik Taluka police station said the victims, residents of Peth Road, work with a music system operator. On Thursday, one of the suspects had organised a party at a lawn in Dari village — around 14-km from the city — where two victims were called to play music.

After the party got over, the suspects picked up an argument with the victims over sound quality of the music system and started assaulting them with sticks and belts. They also administered electric shocks on the victims through a battery like equipment in order to kill them.

After stripping the victims, they were also forced to indulge in unnatural sex. Meanwhile, the suspects also made casteist remarks after they came to know that one of the victims belonged to scheduled caste.

The victims managed to escape from the place and returned home after the suspects had fallen to sleep. Later, in the afternoon they got admitted at the Nashik civil hospital.

“When information reached us on Friday evening, we rushed to the hospital to take the statement of the victims. However, they were too afraid to talk about the incident,” Avhad said.

“We visited the hospital on Saturday and got their statements after which an offence was lodged and a lookout was launched against the suspects. There are four more suspects involved in the crime, including the main suspect who had organised the party.

221,['13/01/2020'],Govt campaign for pregnant women gets tremendous response in district,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nashik: The number of pregnant women visiting the primary health centres (PHC) across the rural district for getting themselves checked and treated under the Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan ( PMSMA ) has doubled during the past couple of months.

Going by the figures with the district health office, in January 2019, 2,530 pregnant women had visited the PHCs for getting themselves checked and treated. On January 9 this year, the number of pregnant women visiting the PHCs increased to 5,171.

Senior health officials said that they have been noticing the rise in numbers in the recent months. Earlier when pregnant women would visit the PHCs, the doctors would not be available. Due to the dearth in the number of government hospitals, private gynaecologists have been appealed to assist the government staff in PHCs in treating pregnant women on the ninth of every month in lieu of an honorarium.

However, some rural parts of the district were still left out as private gynaecologists visited PHCs on any given day of their convenience only twice a month. However, this led to futile visits of expecting mothers to the PHCs when the doctors were not available.

On this backdrop, chief executive officer of the zilla parishad, Nashik, Buveneswari S instructed private gynaecologists to ensure that one of their visits should be fixed on the 9th of every month.

Buveneswari S said, “Pregnant women visited the PHCs for check-up, but the gynaecologist would not be present. Thus, the time, money and energy invested by these women in travelling to the PHC would be futile. On this backdrop, the private gynaecologists were instructed to make one visit compulsorily on the 9th of every month.”

“When pregnant women got assurance that gynaecologists would be available on the said day, they started visiting the health centres in large numbers,” she added.

Meanwhile, when the private gynaecologists faced shortcomings in implementing the PMSMA programme simultaneously across all PHCs on the 9th of every month, Buveneswari S held a meeting of office-bearers of the Nashik unit of Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) and appealed to the them for help.

Rahul Sharma

AHMEDABAD: This year, the “wow” sounded by a new generation of audiences has been amplifying the “wah” of Saptak old-timers. On Day 4 of the festival, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia had been thrilled to be surrounded by school and college children.

Young people like to “chill” and also want experiences that are “rocking”. On Saturday, Day 11, Rahul Sharma’s Rageshree fulfilled both cravings. “The evening raga is peaceful, joyful, and calming!” Sharma told TOI. “A person doesn’t need to understand the raga to enjoy it if the notes touch the heart. Many young people were at my concert till 1.30am.”

Ragas can strum the yearnings of even the first-time concertgoer. But that potency comes from the performer. TOI sought a musician’s perspective from tabla maestro Aneesh Pradhan, who had accompanied Shubha Mudgal on Day 10. “Ragas do not exist in a vacuum. Performers bring to a raga their interpretative abilities and create the mood,” Pradhan told TOI. “The Hindustani tradition demands spontaneity from performers. However, the spontaneity cannot lead to an anarchic display of melodic and rhythmic jugglery. It has to follow the architecture of the raga and the taal.” He went on to say: “The sense of balance that each performer establishes between discipline and freedom is what marks his or her individuality.”

As for drawing young people to classical concerts, Pradhan laid out the complexities of the challenge. “I think there are no formulae for this,” he said. “The demographic element of an audience depends on several factors — most importantly, I believe it is the quality of music. There could be efforts to demystify concepts and processes, but these have to be undertaken elsewhere and not during concerts.”

N Chandrababu Naidu

VIJAYAWADA: The Andhra Pradesh Police Officers’ Association slammed former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu for his comments on DGP D Gautam Sawang .

Janakula Srinivasa Rao, president, and Narreddy Chandra Sekhar Reddy, honorary president, said it was not befitting a former chief minster stature who ruled the state for 14 years to make insensitive comments against a highly respected officer who has received President's award.

While he was the chief minister, Naidu had commended Sawang for his work as Vijayawada police commissioner, they said.

Criticising an officer known for his integrity by his place nativity was nothing but inciting regional disparities and was nothing short of treason, they said. They warned Naidu that the police department will boycott Naidu if he continued to make allegations against the department and the DGP.

On the other hand, Naidu again alleged that the DGP was giving permission for YSRC rallies and curbing peaceful protests by farmers and Joint Action Committee (JAC).

Naidu said the police have beaten and detained women who were going to visit Kanaka Durga temple . The police were misusing the law to silence dissent, he said. Referring to the recent Supreme Court judgment on Section 144, Naidu said police action on women by invoking Section 144 was unconstitutional. He said the DGP should act in an impartial manner to protect the democratic rights of all citizens.

Bengaluru: The angst of city youth over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 got a musical twist in Cubbon Park on Sunday evening.

Rapping at the event organised by Hum Bharat ke Log forum, the volunteers believed music is one way to draw people. “Many people hesitate to join when we protest. But our rap songs on Sunday attracted several passersby,” said an organiser. The session lasted for nearly two hours, with 30 rappers, many of them full-time musicians, coming together for the cause.

Around the same time, the Karnataka Muslim Mahila Andolan gathered on the steps of Town Hall to hold their second protest against NRC, CAA and the recent violence unleashed on students in various parts of the country. Two hundred people gathered at the venue to stand in solidarity.

Nagma Sheik, who organised the protest, said, “So many people are coming out and protesting; some are sitting with their babies all day for justice. Parents who have sent their children abroad for studies are a worried lot. Why can’t the government show mercy?”

One of the protesters, Dasarathi, drew a lot of attention with his attire. He was wearing a taqiyah (a cap worn by Muslims), had a nama like the Hindus and wore a cross on his neck. He said, “I’m an Indian first and I think my attire speaks for itself.”

Earlier in the day, Rangasthala auditorium at Rangoli Metro Art Centre, MG Road, turned into a classroom with a session on introduction to the Constitution and law-making. Advocates Malavika Prasad and Gautam Bhatia spoke at the event hosted by the Centre for IT and Public Policy along with National Centre for Biological Sciences and Champaca Bookstore, Library, Cafe, Vasanth Nagar.

Though the organisers said the event had nothing to do with CAA per se, several questions were on the controversial legislation.

The talk included simplifying complex jargons related to the Constitution for commoners to understand it better.

Nashik: The efforts of the Election Commission (EC) to prepare a clean electoral roll has hit a roadblock in Nashik district. The district election office has not been able to complete a voters ’ survey of every household — as ordered by the EC — despite the deadline ending on December 20, 2019.

The Electors’ Verification Programme was organized by the EC with the aim to ensure that every voter in the country was identified and details related to the address, photograph, name and spellings were corrected to remove ambiguity.

So far, the DEO has been able to verify only 4.5 lakh of around 45.37 lakh voters spread across the district. The Malegaon Central assembly constituency has been the worst performer. Only 4.40% of the total voters here have been verified by teams of the booth level officers (BLOs).

Kalwan, Malegaon Outer and Sinnar also have completed the verification of just about 10% of voters in the respective constituencies. Assembly segments including Nashik East, Nandgaon, Chandwad, Yeola, Deolali and Nashik Central fall in less than 20% category while Igatpuri, Niphad, Nashik West, Baglan and Dindori fall in less than 30% bracket.

“The task is huge. Hence, it was always going to take more time. However, the pace at which the work is being executed is also not up to the mark. The work is expected to be completed by the end of February,” the senior officer from the election office said.

The officials would like to ensure that the work is completed before the upcoming examination period.

“If the voter verification exercise clashes with the examinations, the process will only get lengthier as most of the booth level officers are also teachers. Therefore, we would strive hard to ensure the entire survey is completed well before the exams,” the officer added.

The drive to distribute laptops to government first-grade college students was initiated on Sunday

BENGALURU: It was a day of inspirational talks for young college students who turned out in large numbers at Kanteerava Stadium on Sunday for the 157th birth anniversary celebrations of Swami Vivekananda. The occasion is observed as National Youth Day.

Chief minister BS Yediyurappa and deputy CM CN Ashwath Narayan honoured 35 youngsters, including cricketer Veda Krishnamurthy and bike rental firm Bounce’s co-founder Vivekananda Hallikere.

Veda Krishnamurthy, a member of the women’s cricket team, said: “I have only one message for students, especially girls. Earlier, the practice was to get girls married off after they reach their 20s. I have broken the system and I stand here. If you have the confidence, commitment to reach your goal and know your talent, no one can stop you. Live your life as you want it and not how others want it.”

Hallikere recalled how he started his company with a loan of Rs 10 lakh and now it has 20 lakh customers. “Do not give excuses. There may be several such things — I am from a small town, I studied in a government college, my parents do not have money. But if you work hard without stopping at these excuses, you’ll definitely reach there. Ask your friends and family for support, keep knocking on doors, keep trying.”

The next inspirational story came from G Kalpana, additional chief secretary of the youth empowerment and sports secretariat. “I come from an orthodox family. When I was doing my BA, a family member wanted to marry me off. I have never said no to my parents, but that day I vehemently protested. I did my MA and then appeared for UPSC. You should not stop till you reach your goal,” she said.

Among those honoured was Pranav Nutalapati, a class 12 student of Legacy school, who has won a silver at the world skills competition in web technologies. “I had to create the best website that met all the parameters within the stipulated time. It was a four-day event with two sessions each day,” he said.

On the occasion, the Karnataka government kicked off its programme to distribute 1,09,160 laptops to first-year students of government first-grade colleges in the state.

While cyclones were to blame for poor turnout of Olive Ridleys last year, foresters say there was no specific reason so far this year. They expect more turtle nestings in the coming months.

Olive Ridleys begin arriving at the coast between October and November. Females turtles start visiting the beaches from January onwards and lay eggs .

With it being mid-January, the forest department has identified only two nests so far, from which they have collected 183 and 161 eggs. Last year, more than 40,000 eggs were laid by the species along Chennai coast and as many Olive Ridley hatchlings were released into the sea .

C H Padma, wildlife warden for Chennai, said anti-poaching watchers (APW) from the department began turtle walks last Monday.

Volunteers from the Students Sea Turtle Conservation Network (SSTCN) are also going on turtle walks with the APWs. The forest department has set up hatcheries in Besant Nagar, Neelankarai and Pulicat where the collected eggs will be incubated. After 45 days, the hatchlings will be released into the sea after dark.

K Shanthanu, one of the SSTCN volunteers, said the team has spotted four dead turtles in the first week.

Of the released hatchlings, only about one thousand return to the same beach to nest, Padma said quoting researchers.

229,['13/01/2020'],BBMP holds mirror to those urinating in public,"The large mirror installed on Church Street next to Coconut Grove on Sunday

Times View While one can only hope that the civic body’s attempt to install mirrors to deter those urinating in public will be effective, its intention to guide people to the nearest public toilet by means of a QR code is laudable. But addressing the challenge of public urination is less a matter of intention and more of implementation. The city doesn’t have adequate number of public toilets, while the state of existing ones is abysmal. While hoping that the civic body holds a mirror to itself to realise where it is going wrong, there is a need for Bengalureans to think twice before answering nature’s call in public spaces.

65 more e-toilets in the offing

BENGALURU: Faced with the arduous task of discouraging those taking a leak on busy stretches, the The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike ( BBMP ) has hit upon a new solution: install huge mirrors where miscreants answer nature’s call.Determined to strengthen Bengaluru’s Open Defecation Free credentials, the civic body on Sunday evening put up huge mirrors at five spots in busy areas across the city to prevent people from urinating in public .While the mirrors are expected to hold a mirror to those creating a public nuisance, CCTV cameras nearby will catch them in the act and provide police leads to arrest them. Each mirror is 8ft x4ft in size and costs over Rs 50,000.The drive has been taken up as part of Swachh Survekshan 2020 campaign and the spots chosen are where miscreants are often seen urinating.The five locations where the Palike has installed the mirrors are — KR Market; near ESI Hospital, Indiranagar; near Coconut Grove, Church Street; near Jyoti Nivas College, Koramangala and near Indian Express, Queen’s Circle.BBMP official, however, are silent on how they got the mirror idea. “We want to ensure people stop urinating in public as it’s an ugly sight and also spoils the beauty of the city,” said BH Anil Kumar, BBMP commissioner.The initiative is not only about deterring those urinating in the open. The mirrors also have a BBMP logo and QR code at the centre, which, on scanning, will show you the location of the nearest toilet.Gaurav GS, a college student, who found the mirror on Church Street interesting, scanned the QR code and found that the closest toilet was located about 850 metres away. Gaurav thought the toilet was too far to walk to for someone in an emergency.When this reporter scanned the QR code, the nearest toilet was shown to be 6km away in Chamarajpet. It appeared the QR code was responding differently to Android and iPhones.Asked why the location was different for IoS and Android, Kumar said, “The mapping has not been done properly, I suppose. We will get this fixed immediately.”“We are working towards resolving the open urination problem in the city, but people also need to participate actively by making violators aware of the rules,” Kumar added.The BBMP currently owns 419 regular public toilets and 162 e-toilets. The facilities can be easily located on Google Maps. “We are planning to construct 65 more e-toilets based on availability of funds. For better rankings, people need to vote for their city, instead of just complaining,” Kumar told TOI",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220187,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-843344,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-holds-mirror-to-those-urinating-in-public/articleshow/73218799.cms

231,['13/01/2020'],India in 2020: When ‘Irritation Economy’ becomes the growth driver,"This story is from January 13, 2020

By Shivaji Dasgupta

In 2020 , the urban Indian will be more irritated than ever before, courtesy political, environmental and socio-economic factors. Apart from influencing consumption in predictable ways, this can also decisively seed the ‘ Irritation Economy’ — a set of branded experiences poised to convert this organic negativity into positive outcomes that are meaningful, scalable and profitable.

A significant number of such products and services already exists, but this fresh perspective will allow us to strengthen their value propositions. Equally, there is room for inspiring innovation that can lead to sustainable opportunities. Quite interestingly, certain remedies are designed to navigate the irritation constructively, while others are curated to give much-needed relief.

In every aspect of irritation, the customer requires three kinds of engagement platforms. Firstly, a structured forum to share opinions and perspectives, which can add up to a collective whole. Secondly, products and services (usually short-term) to counter the irritation and get on with normal living. And finally, long-term visionary solutions that hopefully offer a very lasting impact. The Irritation Economy must cater to all three in equal measure.

A great starting point is environmental irritation, most alarmingly the AQI scores that plague us every day. Customers share opinions in general forums, or in specific outlets like school groups. They buy pollution masks, air purifiers and holiday packages as short-term fixes. Long-term, they are sending their children to boarding schools in the hills, and saving money to emigrate to Canada.

Now, imagine applying standard filters of imagination to the above scenario and customising experiences. Like, online forums where citizens are induced to express daily solutions, leading to awards and recognition. Or, fashion and make-up products that acknowledge the face mask (notably, scarves, eyelashes and skin creams). Also, pollution insurance that covers customised ailments, real-estate projects that are 100% breathing-friendly (in technology and policy), Google Maps suggesting the ‘cleanest’ and not just the fastest route, low AQI nations/cities upping citizenship fees, and automobiles with inner-clean-air technology. The Irritation Economy connected to the environment itself could be unimaginably valuable.

In a similar vein, citizens are increasingly getting irritated by political developments, views flying faster than tennis rallies. Thus, the unification industry has enormous potential in 2020, courtesy music, books and movies that bring folks together. This may well lead to a Great India Theme Park, or online places that positively heal such irate feelings. Or, a resurgence of Amar Chitra Katha, classical narratives slotted to restore emotional equilibrium. Fashion may well emerge with a ‘New India’ saree, with a draping technique far more spontaneous than the current, inspired by Raja Ravi Varma’s work.

Urban commuting is creating its own organic Irritation Economy, the metro and fuel-efficient automatic vehicles bearing helpful testimony. The affluent Indian is forsaking traditional markers of affluence to avoid being stuck in traffic or paying mindlessly for fuel. At-home services, from food and healthcare to e-commerce, are booming as a result, with scope aplenty for remarkable innovations – online group tuitions, merged-reality family meetings (digital chats with samosas in hand), car delivery of pizzas (accurately timed by Google Maps), or driver chain services quite like railway engines (as opposed to relying on a solitary employee).

Every day there are newer sources of irritation, the economy of course being a recurring culprit. Financial advisors must jump into the party, helping customers achieve the necessary balance between indulgence and restraint. Healthcare providers must factor this in for critical diagnosis and wellness, and not just medication. Entertainment agents can easily thrive, provided they define the product perfectly. You will agree that the possibilities are endless, as long as they genuinely benefit society.

The big news for 2020 may well be the high-potential Irritation Economy, a driver of genuine growth for the national economy. To win, we must design such experiences from this new-age and not any age-old lens.

Coimbatore: The forest department on Sunday rescued an eight-month-old female elephant calf that was roaming around Agaram village in Krishnagiri district after it drifted away from its herd.

On Sunday morning, the herd was found roaming near Sanamavu reserve forest area near Uddanapalli in Hosur in Krishnagiri district.

Residents of Agaram informed the forest department but not before attempting to chase the animal to the reserve forest and clicking photos of the calf entering an agriculture field. Veterinarian Prakash, anti-poaching watchers and field staff of the forest department arrived at the spot and tranquillized the calf by darting with sedatives.

The captured calf was boarded onto a mini-truck and translocated to Sanamavu reserve forest.

“Officials are also monitoring the movements of the herd at Sanamavu forest. We are trying to reunite the calf with its mother,” said Deepak S Bilgi, district forest officer, Hosur forest division.

In July 2016, an elephant calf fell into a gorge in Krishnagiri district. Villagers rescued the calf and released it into the reserve forest. In May 2017, a female elephant was electrocuted in Denkanikottai in Hosur forest division and its calf was found roaming near the carcass of its mother. Later, the calf was rescued by the forest department and the officials attempted to reunite the calf with other herds but in vain. Finally, the calf was sent to Vandalur zoo.

On January 9, 2018, a calf separated from its herd at Uddanapalli was found dead inside the reserve forest and another calf that fell into a well was rescued by the forest department at Rayakottai. But the officials attempt to reunite the calf with its herd went in vain. Finally, the officials tried to reunite the calf with other herds. However, other elephants attacked the calf which died of injuries.

CHENNAI: At a time when environmentalists are encouraging to increase and conserve green cover, more than 50 saplings along Kalikundram Main Road in Taramani have been left without care with only 10 of them managing to survive.

A visit to the area on Sunday revealed that saplings were planted on both sides of the road. They have been provided with tree guards. But, due to poor watering, many of them have wilted. The remaining ones need to be watered properly for them to survive and thrive. In most cases, it’s the tree guards that come under attack, either they are stolen or get damaged by vandals and the trees become preys to cattle. However, in Taramani, the tree guards stand intact while the saplings are dead inside.

Tailor and tree lover D Vijayabaskar of Teynampet, who has planted several saplings and nurtured them, laments that people talk about planting saplings, but nobody wants to take care of them. “No one extends a helping hand,” he said.

Vijayabaskar used to buy plants/saplings with his savings. “When I bring the saplings to my house in Alwarpet, nobody comes forward to help me. People have the misconception that I make money by planting trees,” he said.

He has suggested to corporation officials to appoint one volunteer for each division across the 15 zones in the city. These volunteers can be given the work of watering plants and replacing the dead ones with new saplings. However, his suggestion has fallen on deaf ears, he said.

235,['13/01/2020'],"Centre yet to realize importance of FTA, say apparel exporters","This story is from January 13, 2020

Tirupur: The Apparel Export Promotion Council (Aepc) on Sunday said the central government was yet to realize the importance of signing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the European Union (EU) and US, or Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with Canada and Australia.

Aepc chairman A Sakthivel said, “The absence of FTA and CEPA is one of the main hindrances to the country’s readymade garments (RMG) exporters in the international market. While we are exporting RMG worth $16.5 billion annually, our main competitors Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia are exporting RMG worth around $38 billion, $28 billion and $12 billion, respectively. All the three countries have signed FTA and CEPA deals with various RMG importing countries and they are thriving in the exports.”

For instance, he said, Cambodia’s RMG exports were worth only around $3 billion a few years ago. “But now, it has tripled. Despite having required infrastructure, raw materials and skill set, we are losing orders in the international market.”

For signing FTA with EU, Sakthivel said, the country would have to compromise on free trade in automobiles and wine products. “The main talking point is on how to have such compromise in terms of our economic policy. It can be done because the textile industry is one of the self-sufficient industries in the country and it suits ‘Make in India’ bill well. Around 120 million people, including 60% women, are employed in the sector. Moreover, if FTA is signed, our RMG exports would be doubled and it would also benefit allied sectors like agriculture,” he said.

Emphasizing that signing FTA was a realistic and an inevitable solution, the Aepc chairman said “The UPA-II government had taken steps to sign FTA and taken the automobile industry into confidence. It was about to enact a law in the parliament as well. But it did not take off due to change in government. Canada had recently shown its commitment to sign CEPA with us. But the BJP-led government did not take things forward.”

He said it was important to have FTA with UK on the lines of Brexit. “Various textile bodies have urged the international buyers to push their governments to sign FTA with India. Because of the quality goods exported from India, many UK buyers have agreed to take up the matter with their government. An umbrella federation of nation-wide textile associations has been formed in New Delhi and we have decided to put pressure on the central government to act in favour of signing FTAs soon,” Sakthivel said.

236,['13/01/2020'],Employees at SIPCOT parks near Chennai to get better security,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Patrol vehicles have been introduced at SIPCOT IT Park in Siruseri on OMR as part of measures to heighten secu... Read More

CHENNAI: Security is being upped for employees of factories in the industrial parks near Chennai of the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (SIPCOT). Soon vehicles with security guards will patrol the parks round-the-clock and CCTV cameras will be installed. This follows complaints that employees are frequently being waylaid and robbed of their money and phones near their work places. A uniform toll-free number for a centralised response system is also being considered.

SIPCOT has floated tenders for enhancing security in 19 industrial parks across the state, of which seven are within 50km of the city. These are located at Sriperumbudur, Irungattukottai, Pillaipakkam, Orgadam and Vallam-Vadagal in Kancheepuram district, and Gummidipoondi and Thervoykandigai in Tiruvallur district. About 1.5 lakh workers, 30% of them women, are employed in 800 industries — mostly automobile and auto components and electronic units — in the seven parks, which cover an area of 12,750 acres.

The tenders call for a patrol vehicle to be on duty 24/7 at each of the industrial parks. The seven parks together are to have 300 CCTV cameras installed at vantage points.

Several industrial units had made representations to the government to increase security inside the parks, where the roads are also used to access adjoining villages. “We cannot have multiple check posts, as well. So, we are improving the security measures such as patrol vehicles and CCTV cameras,” a SIPCOT source said. The security guards would also file complaints with police in case of any violations, untoward incidents and offences.

The patrol vehicles will have GPRS integration with the systems in the administrative office of the industrial park and SIPCOT headquarters.

SIPCOT managing director J Kumaragurubaran said that a common toll-free number would be provided for all the patrol vehicles so they can be contacted easily in an emergency. “This would be a centralised facility. People calling the toll-free number would be directed to the respective patrol vehicle, on the lines of 108 emergency services helpline,” he told TOI.

On Friday, a patrol vehicle was launched at the information technology park at Siruseri on OMR. The 800-acre facility houses 90,000 workers, nearly 40% of whom are women.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: Tihar authorities conducted the dummy hanging of the four convicts of the Nirbhaya case at the jail premises on Sunday. The authorities used bags of similar weights to check the strength of the ropes that would be used for the actual hanging on January 22.The dummy hanging was declared successful by experts and the ropes have been sent for safekeeping until the date of the real execution. Jail sources said that doctors have advised the authorities to keep a check on the health — both mental and physical — of the four men since they had to maintain adequate body weight required for hanging a prisoner.Meanwhile, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court will hear on January 14 curative petitions of two of the four death-row convicts in the Nirbhaya case. A bench of Justices N V Ramana, Arun Mishra, R F Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan will hear the curative petitions filed by Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh at 1.45pm. The other two convits in the case are Akshay Thakur, and Pawan Gupta.Jail sources say that during the dummy hanging, four sacks filled with sand and gravel weighing as much as the body weight of the four convicts taken a day before, and hung from the ropes. They are left suspended for three hours after which an expert checks the condition of the ropes.Tihar authorities have asked for a dozen ‘Manila’ ropes from Buxar central jail that would be kept on a standby. They have also taken the measurements of the necks and heads of the convicts. The hangman would prepare the noose according to the measurement.Jail authorities allowed the family members of Mukesh Singh, one of the convicts of the Nirbhaya case to meet him on Friday after he had started behaving erratically ever since the death sentence was read out to the four men. The family members of the other inmates would be allowed to meet them for the last time in the coming week. They would be informed about the last meet before the hanging well in advance, so that they can prepare for it. During this, they would be allowed to take the personal belongings of the convicts and record a will in the presence of a superintendent.In Video: Tihar conducts dummy hanging in Nirbhaya case",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220054,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-564165,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-conducts-dummy-hanging-in-nirbhaya-case/articleshow/73219449.cms

Coimbatore: Days after the second-level of Gandhipuram flyover was opened, many motorists are taking the route just to get a feel of it.

Excited about the 19-metre-tall structure, motorists, especially two-wheeler users, stop at the highest point to click selfies. But there are others, who are not so happy with it.

When the construction began, the state highways department had received a lot of criticism because of the height of the flyover and the steep ramps. As it is the first second-level flyover in the state to be opened for public, officials decided to get feedback from commuters before inaugurating it. The flyover was opened for motorists from 8am to 6pm last Wednesday.

“When construction was going on, the ramps appeared very steep and the flyover looked intimidating. But, it was not at all scary while using it. It is like any other flyovers in the city. We get a sense of the height only when looking down from the top. Fortunately, the department had set up fences,” said Mahalingam, a commuter.

A lot of people are using the bridge just to get a feel of it, said Shalini. “It was a thrilling ride. Those on light vehicles, especially two-wheelers, should exercise caution and reduce speed while on the structure as wind is very strong up there,” she told TOI.

The flyover is accident-prone as it has only two lanes that are narrow, said Prasanna. “There is not enough space even for two-wheelers to overtake four-wheelers. As there is no median, vehicles can get into the other lane while overtaking and cause accidents. It should have been wider.”

Agreeing that the travelling time from Gandhipuram to Avinashi Road has been considerably reduced, Vinoth, a resident of Avarampalayam, said that the number of overspeeding motorists has suddenly increased. “They tend to overspeed as there is not much traffic. It has become very difficult to cross the road. Some motorists take U-turn either from the flyover or to the flyover. Officials should take proper steps to streamline traffic,” he added.

Prudhvi Raj asks people to beat him with chappal if they could prove the allegations against him

TIRUPATI: Chairman of the Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel ( SVBC ) Prudhvi Raj faces allegations of inappropriate remarks made to a female employee during a conversation recorded by her.

Following the revelation on Sunday, the TTD ordered a vigilance probe and chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy was briefed about the incident. SVBC is a 24-hour devotional channel established by the TTD in 2008.

Honorary president of SVBC employees’ union Kandarapu Murali said the female employee at the channel who recorded the conversation was allegedly being harassed by the chairman. In the audio clip, which was obtained by TOI, a male voice, allegedly the SVBC chairman’s, can be heard making sexual advances to the woman.

Representatives of political parties and women’s groups in the city demanded the state government act immediately and remove Prudhvi Raj from chairmanship of SVBC.

Meanwhile, Prudhvi Raj resigned from the chairmanship on Sunday evening but denied the allegations and said the audio clip was doctored. Speaking to TOI, he said, “As I am trying to streamline the administration, this is an attempt to target and defame me.”

The chairman released an open letter, appealing to the public to not fall prey to rumours. “If the vigilance enquiry proves me guilty, I am ready for any punishment. I will return to SVBC only after I get a clean chit,” Raj said.

This is the second controversy the actor-turned-politician finds himself mired in within a week, days after he passed controversial remarks against farmers agitating against relocating the state capital.

Trees on MGR Medical University campus in Guindy get a coating of lime to prevent termite infestation

CHENNAI: More than 150 trees of various species found on MGR Medical University campus in Guindy received medication on Saturday.

Sudha Seshaiyan, vice-chancellor of the university, said the campus has termite hills. White ants from these mounds enter the tree via its roots and slowly build a mound around the tree and kill the tree. In order to avoid termite attacks, with advice from experts, the trees were coated with sodium (sunnambu) from the bottom to a height of four feet.

Last year in January, two trees were infected by termites. Despite treatment, only one survived.

Landscaping expert B Ilango said normally, lime mixed with water is painted on the trees to avoid termite attacks. Nowadays several lime-based ointments are also available to protect trees from termite attack.

A few decades ago, trees along the highways used to get a similar coat of lime mixture to avoid termites. With the emergence of new medicines and ointments, this practice was stopped, he explained.

Now, one can mix copper oxychloride with lime and apply it on the tree, he said.

With a fresh coat of lime, the trees will survive long on campus and reduce pollution levels and provide shade, said Seshaiyan.

Mangaluru: Balasubramanya Hanagal Manjunath, a mechanical engineer from Arkalgud in Hassan , has developed a harvester which has come as a boon to plantation owners during times of labour crisis.

He was in Dharmasthala recently to demonstrate the high-tech harvester also known as dhoti or kokke.

Balasubramanya has been in the US for the past 12 years. A graduate from National Institute of Engineering (NIE), Mysuru, he has been managing his areca farm in Arkalgud, despite spending most of his time in the US.

Speaking to TOI, he said, “According to an estimate, India reports at least 500-1,000 accidental deaths while climbing trees. One windy day, I saw a man on top of a tree in my farm. It was scary. I wanted to help the community and address the issue of labour crisis.” Areca trees are slender and grow about 80-90 feet tall.

“I analyzed the existing available tools such as drones and tree bikes and found that they are not feasible. I started working on a prototype initially for 30 feet and later for 80 feet trees. Last year, I sold two equipment and increased the sales to 200 in Karnataka and Kerala this year,” said Balasubramanya.

He has used composite material that is exceptionally light weight and 10 times stronger than bamboo. If the total weight of a bamboo stick is about 50 kg, this stick weighs six kg. Within a minute, the farmer can adjust the height from six feet to 80 feet manually and there is no use of battery or fuel. Farmers including women can learn to use the device. It can be used for harvesting by attaching a sickle to it and spraying fungicide by fixing a nozzle to it. Generally, during fungicide spraying, wastage is high, which can be controlled using this device. A motorcycle handle attached, makes operation easy, he explained.

The device can be used on other tall trees too including coconut and can help create jobs, thus helping individuals earn at least Rs 50,000 per month.

The cost of the stick is around Rs 80,000 depending on the height. Balasubramanya is working on developing low cost sticks in the price range of Rs 10,000-Rs 20,000 that is expected to be released later in the year, after patenting the product.

242,['13/01/2020'],HC dismisses plea of man convicted of raping niece,"This story is from January 13, 2020

New Delhi: The testimony of the child is quite clear and there is no doubt that the appellant had sexually assaulted her, Delhi high court recently said while rejecting the appeal of a man serving a five-year jail term for sexually assaulting his minor niece in 2014. The uncle was convicted after the trial court relied on a crayon sketch made by the survivor, as reported first by TOI in June 2017.

Before Justice Vibhu Bakhru, the man argued that the child had accused him of rape as he would often scold her for not doing her homework. “The contention that the child had implicated the appellant because he used to scold her is unpersuasive,” the court noted.

Highlighting that the child had “clearly” described her ordeal, the court was unable accept the contention that the minor girl, who was of a “tender” age, conceived a “devious plan” to implicate a close relative only because he scolded her and compelled her to finish school work.

The minor, who was seven years old when she was assaulted in 2014, was abandoned by her alcoholic father when her mother died, and the aunt who brought her to Delhi had made her work at another house. Besides the work and the ill-treatment, she also suffered sexual abuse by her uncle, and eventually fled home.

The man’s counsel raised the point of the sketch made by the minor and argued that that its consideration by the trial court was “erroneous”. It was submitted that the sketch could not have led to the any such inference. The court had said, “The child had drawn a house, a girl carrying balloons and a dress. This did not, in any manner, indicate that she had an intermingled relation, or any inference of commission of a sexual assault could be drawn by the said sketch.” The high court said that the trial court’s reasoning with regards to the sketch was in the “realm of conjectures and surmises”.

The case had taken an unexpected turn when the girl, given paper and crayons to keep her occupied during the trial court hearing, sketched an abandoned house, a girl holding balloons attached to entwined strings, and a dress lying beside her.

The trial court had in its April, 2017 judgment said that if the elements of the minor’s drawing were to be considered in the light of the case, then commission of sexual assault upon her by somebody in her house after undressing her, and it leaving an impression upon her mind, was evident. It had also noted that it was enough to explain the girl’s suffering to someone having no knowledge about the facts of the case.

243,['13/01/2020'],2 cellphones thieves caught at train station,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nashik: Personnel of the government railway police (GRP) and the railway protection force (RPF) have nabbed two cellphone thieves caught in the act.

The GRP personnel were patrolling the Nashik Road railway station when they caught the thieves in action.

According to the police, Uddhav Jige, a 24-year-old resident of Jalna district, was travelling from Dadar to Manmad by the Darbhanga Express on December 31, when his cellphone was stolen. Jige was seated in the general compartment. As the train left the Nashik Road station, he noticed that his cellphone, which he had kept in his pocket, had gone missing. Since the incident occurred just minutes after the train left the Nashik Road station, the complaint was registered at the Manmad railway station and transferred to Nashik Road for investigation.

The GRP and the RPF personnel then studied the CCTV camera footage at the station to identify the people boarding the coach there. They zeroed in on five people and tried to track them down. Though there were no leads, one of the ‘shortlisted’ people was spotted in the general compartment of the Darbhanga Express again on Saturday. The security teams rounded him up and detained him for further investigations. The accused continued to avoid the queries by the police, but finally spilt the beans as the GRP intensified the investigation.

The accused explained his modus operandi and the fact that he had an accomplice. The two accused would follow each other and the moment one laid hands on the goods, he would signal the other and pass on the stolen item to him.

252,['13/01/2020'],Chennai: Faculty not for renaming of Anna University,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Anna University

CHENNAI: Academics and its own faculty are against the move to rename Anna University , saying the institution stands to lose its identity built up over four decades.

The state higher education department proposes to change the university's name to Anna Institute of Eminence after getting the ‘institute of excellence’ status from the Centre. Anna University and its four campuses are to be known as Anna Institute of Eminence. A new technical university with affiliating powers will be known as Anna University.

Institute of Eminence status is meant for only five years. How can that be part of the university’s name, asked professors.

“When there is no bar on the university affiliating engineering colleges even after getting IoE status, the state government wants to bifurcate the university. We are not opposing the bifurcation. If the government wanted to favour the private engineering colleges by creating a new technical university, they should find a new name for the new university,” professors said.

In a letter to chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, Anna University Teachers Association urged him to retain the name Anna University for its four campuses. “The brand name Anna University is already well established in regional, national and global academic societies. Numerous global rankings and accreditations are in the name of Anna University,” AUTA said in the letter.

“Any rebranding of the university results in automatic loss of our hard-earned brand value besides losing our established identity, and reputation in the academic world. The name Anna University has so far helped us to grow to this great level,” the letter said.

M Anandakrishnan, former vice-chancellor, said the university was formed with four campuses — College of Engineering, Guindy (CEG), Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), Chrompet, Alagappa College of Technology (AC Tech) and School of Architecture and Planning (SAP).

“The university’s name should not be changed . There is no link between giving IoE status and changing the name of the institution,” Anandakrishnan said.

“Institute of Eminence is a status or recognition for a time-bound period, it is not a name. It should not be part of the name of the university and Anna University should remain Anna University,” said E Balagurusamy, former vice-chancellor of Anna University.

“Anna University was formed with only four campuses to start with and affiliated colleges came under it much later. Now, you cannot take away the name that originally applied to only these four campuses,” said M K Surappa, vice-chancellor of Anna University.

253,['13/01/2020'],Tech the real influencer in demolishing ‘entry barriers’,"This story is from January 13, 2020

By Babita Baruah

Sujita came to our house as an attendant from a medical-services organisation to support a family member who had recently undergone surgery. It was towards the end of November (with the first signs of winter). She walked in wearing a well-worn purple sweater that clearly couldn’t keep her warm enough from the light chill. Her sandals had seen better days.

Sujita won us over with her work and her smile. In the two weeks, we shared notes. At times, I used to walk her down after 8pm. Told her how important it is to be confident. To never give up her dream. She taught me a lot, too. The power of being simple and loving.

What broke the ice between us was a smartphone and a short-form video platform. She clicked a video one day and I loved it. With my permission, she posted it on the platform. I marvelled at the ease and confidence with which she did this. She also showed me video recipes that she watched and then tried out when she visited home. I connected her to some groups and sites that I felt would help her in her career, in speaking and skilling herself up.

Digital disruption, helped by mobile-phone penetration, has created an infrastructure of connectivity and confidence that few could have imagined a decade earlier. The lesser privileged, who could barely afford two meals a day, leave alone education and exposure to the wider world, now have the licence to access and the strength of inclusion that transcends deep-rooted social divides.

The early adopters saw the benefits of economic upliftment; of staying informed, connected and accessible. For daily-wage workers, this means earning opportunities like never before. By taking on multiple assignments, optimising time and creating new efficiencies, through allowing employers to access them when required. I partnered a leading mobile-phone brand a decade ago, when the dual SIM had just been introduced. People found innovative ways of switching between the SIMs to call their families back home at affordable rates, helping them stay in touch and removing the pain and setbacks of separation.

Technology inspired mobility, and not just for men. For women, it paved the way towards an independent future with economic and social freedom. Most new migrants who came to cities in search of a better, progressive life, now receive support through digital communities and groups connecting them to each other.

Then, there’s the power to express. Posts and pictures, video uploads and selfies sit on a springboard of confidence, an overcoming of the hesitation and self-restraint in giving voice that was inherent down the generations.

But more than all this, the confluence of data, mobile and digital has changed the cultural and social fabric. Technology has no entry barriers, thanks to near-free lifetime data, low-cost hardware and a plethora of new digital brands that have inclusivity at their heart.

This is the world our children are growing into. One of equality and shared vision. Eating off the same table, so to speak.

But how does this stack up against real life today? Are we still a few steps behind what technology has achieved when it comes to respect and restoring dignity? Do we still have entry barriers in our physical world when it comes to opportunities and communication? Are we more trusting and accepting in a virtual world? Can Sujita walk with pride every day?

The pillars of marketing and consumer engagement have been evidenced as voice, video and vernacular. Brands are now transacted on screens, starting with voice and ending with online payment, obliterating the very factors, like the inability to communicate, that created many bridges. Digital influencers play a very powerful role in marketing, which is not dominated by Bollywood and sports alone but by anyone who has the potential to share a differentiated point of view, skill or value.

Business models are being built in a shared economy. On generosity. On asset-poor but experience-rich solutions that people invest in and engage with.

Maybe, we won’t have a choice to play it differently for long. Until then, wish all young girls like Sujita a safe and successful journey in life, as they inch towards their North Star.

(Sujita’s name has been changed in this story. It’s not about one name, but about the many who lead the same life)

Nashik: The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum has ordered a private tour operator to refund Rs 10.30 lakh to a consumer along with a 10 percent interest rate from May 15, 2017, for dishonouring two cheques.

A three-member forum headed by Milind Sonawane found tour operator ‘Venus Tours’ guilty for failing to abide by the commitments made to the consumer and also dishonouring the amount to the client. “It amounts to cheating and hence it should not only return the amount with interest but also pay Rs 15,000 as compensation for mental harassment,” Sonawane said.

The complainant Praveen Sable, a 27-year-old businessman, and resident of Ashok Stambh Nashik had decided to take his parents and relatives on a tour of Europe in the year 2017. Accordingly, he chose to travel by Venus Tour through the agent letter Vishnu Sanap having a registered office in front of Chopra launch at old Gangapur Naka.

Sable deposited Rs 10 lakh through bank transfer and thirty thousand rupees by meeting the tour operator in person. All the funds were given by Sable to the operator in the month of January 2017 but it was around March 29, 2017 that Sanap’s wife informed that the tour was cancelled.

Accordingly, two cheques were given for the total value of Rs 10.30 lakh on April 5 and April 17, 2017, which was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds in the account.

The complainant informed the forum on oath about the happenings and even produced all the bank records about the transactions and the failed transactions to the forum. “Both the cheques of the accused presented by the complainant in the month of May was dishonored by banks for lack of insufficient funds. The complainant tried to get in touch with the accused but to no avail to the extent that the complainant had to even registered a complaint with the police station,” the forum observed.

It further said that this amounted to cheating and noted the forum summoned accused on several occasions but failed to respond and hence decided to ex-parte’ the case. It found the operator to guilty of cheating the customer and hence has ordered to return the entire amount to the customer along with a 10 percent rate of interest from the day first dishonoured cheque.

Udhagamandalam: Ooty experienced freezing cold on Saturday night, as mercury levels dipped to 1celsius for the time this winter season. Enveloped in a white blanket of frost, the hill town, however, looked stunning.

According to a horticulture department official, the thermometer located in the government botanical garden in Ooty recorded 1celsius on Sunday morning. “This is the lowest temperature that the hill retreat has recorded this winter season, while the maximum temperature recorded is 9celsius.”

It is to be noted that last Wednesday mercury levels had dipped to 2celsius in Ooty.

Generally, temperature drops to 0 Celsius in the hill town anytime between November 15 and February 26. About nine years ago, the temperature had touched -2celsius in Ooty in winter.

Shiva Subramaniam Samraj, joint director of horticulture department, said, “The severity of winter season depends on the rainfall that the hill retreat receives every year.”

He said the government botanical garden had recorded the lowest temperature of 1celsius on Saturday night.

The officer said precautionary measures have been taken to protect the flower saplings that were planted recently in the government botanical garden from frost. “We have covered the saplings with shades of green figs. The lawn, the main attraction at the frontage of the garden, is protected by using sprinklers. A watered lawn won’t be affected by frost,” the officer said.

Samraj said there was no report of tea gardens in and around Ooty getting damaged due to frost formation. He said except carrot, vegetable cultivation was yet to begin in the district.

“This time, the winter season was delayed in the district due to erratic rainfall in August, September and October last year,” Samraj said.

K Lakshmanan, an Ooty resident, said, “Every season is a must for the hills. In fact, a proper winter season will favour a good monsoon in June and July.”

Each season brings in various changes to this tourist destination’s mood. During summer, the temperature normally ranges from 10celsius to 22celsius, while in winter, it ranges between 0celsius and 19celsius.

Coimbatore: A 23-year-old woman postgraduate student committed suicide at Periyar University’s students hostel in Salem on Friday. Students who found about the incident on Saturday night stopped police from taking her body to a hospital for postmortem. They demanded a fair investigation into the death.

Police identifed the deceased as T Niveditha, 23, of Gopalapuram near Pappireddipatti in Dharmapuri district. She was studying MSc botany. “Niveditha had been staying in her room alone for the past 10 days as her roommates were away on project work. Other students at the hostel last saw her around 7.30pm on Friday. When she did not come out of her room whole day, they checked on her and found her hanging from a ceiling fan on Saturday night,” a police officer said.

Police are yet to find the reason for the death. They found a letter and collection of poems in her room.

Meanwhile, students in the hostel besieged police personnel and stopped them from taking her body to the Salem government hospital for postmosterm. Students said another woman student in the botany department lodged a complaint with the university authorities against a professor in her department for trying to misbehave to her. But she later withdrawn the complaint. In this background, Niveditha, who was also from the same department, committed suicide. Students sought a fair investigation into the death and urged the university authorities and police to question the professor.

Later, the college authorities and police pacified the students. The body was sent to the hospital for postmortem.

Meanwhile, the state higher education minister K P Anbalagan said proper action would be taken after the police investigation.

The minister, who was at a private college function at Thalaivasal in Salem on Sunday, said the reason for the suicide will be known only after the detailed investigation.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In a major development in the probe into the murder of Tamil Nadu special sub-inspector Y Wilson, as many as six men were detained from Palaruvi near Kerala-Tamil Nadu border on Sunday.

The men were detained by the Thenmala police in Kollam district and handed over to Q Branch officials of Tamil Nadu police, who are investigating the crime. The police have also confiscated a sedan, Nissan Sunny, in which the suspects were travelling.

According to sources in the police department, the detainees were suspected to be men having close links with the two main suspects, Abdul Shameem and Thoufeek. They were held while on their way to Tamil Nadu from Thenmala.

“The Tamil Nadu Q Branch officials had shared with us the registration number of a vehicle in which some suspects were travelling and requested our assistance in tracking them down”, said a senior police officer of Kerala police. The vehicle was detected when it passed Thenmala following which a team of officials from the local station led by station house officer inspector K Manikantanunni started tailing it. They also alerted the team of TN Q Branch officials, who were stationed at Thenkashi, on the other side of the border. The suspects took a break when they reached Palaruvi to visit the waterfalls here. As they were returning to their vehicle, the officials of both Kerala and TN police intercepted them and took them into custody. The detainees were soon taken to Tirunelveli, where they are being interrogated.

The official added that it was too early to confirm whether the group of detainees include anyone who had a direct role in the crime. They were being suspected for the offence of conspiracy.

It was on the night of January 8, the crime related to the case took place. The two main suspects, Abdul Shameem and Thoufeek walked into the border check post at Kaliyakkavila and opened fire at special sub-inspector Y Wilson on duty. They also allegedly hacked him using sharp weapons before fleeing in a car. The two suspects and the vehicle remain to be traced. The suspects are reportedly members of an extremist organization that was involved in murders that are being probed by the Q Branch of TN police. The murder is suspected to be a retaliation for the arrest of six of their members by the TN Police over a week ago.

Volunteers of Clean Coonoor initiative had stumbled upon 12 British-era postal leather cash bags while segregating garbage.

Dr Vasanthan, a member of Clean Coonoor initiative told TOI, “While four bags have been handed over to the government museum in Ooty, two each have been given to the government museum in Coimbatore and the postal department in Ooty. The remaining four would be handed over to the government museum in Chennai, if it wants them for display and preservation.”

259,['13/01/2020'],Admin for special measures for Nirmal Wari,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nashik: Collector Suraj Mandhare said that the district administration will give priority to cleanliness and sanitation during the Nivruttinath Yatra to be held at Trimbakeshwar from January 19.

“There will be about two-five lakh people on each day of the three-day Yatra at Trimbakeshwar and the state government will ensure that they get the best sanitation and cleanliness facilities along with necessary hygiene. The government will also ensure hygienic practices when it comes to delivering food and water to the pilgrims during the religious fair organised under Nirmal Wari ,” Mandhare said.

Underlining the challenge in organising Nirmal Wari, the collector pointed out that the sanitation for pilgrims under Swachh Bharat and Nirmal Wari is a major challenge – especially when people turnout is huge.

“At Trimbakeshwar, there is an influx of more than 3 lakh pilgrims while the town’s permanent infrastructure is designed for accommodating just 13,000 people. In no way can one establish a system that will suffice these huge numbers,” Mandhare said.

Mandhare, therefore, decided to use his experience as the then chief executive officer of zilla parishad, Pune, and come up with a unique initiative under which the local residents can volunteer to let pilgrims use the toilets at their homes. He said that the organisers can put up white flags in front of the houses of those people who volunteer for the initiative.

“These toilets can be marked with a white flag that can be made out by the pilgrims who can with permission use them and maintain cleanliness. Earlier, when Warkaris (pilgrims walking towards Pandharpur) came the villagers would simply lock their homes and desert villages to avoid the filth and return after cleanliness measures were taken. Now, the situation has changed and the villagers welcome pilgrims and allow them to use restrooms at their houses,” Mandhare said.

Mangaluru: The fifth edition of the NITK Karavali Marathon organised by the NITK Alumni Association on Sunday saw the participation of over 3,000 people from across the country, including alumnus of the country’s premier technical institution.

The marathon was flagged off by this year’s Karavali Marathon ambassador, international athlete Arjun Devaiah, Karanam Uma Maheshwar Rao, director, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal and K Balaveera Reddy, chairperson of the board of governors of NITK, Surathkal. The marathon commenced at sharp 5am and ended at 9.15am.

Arjun Devaiah, addressing the gathering, which comprised mostly of youths, said that India has about 60 per cent youths, the highest in the world. “But the irony is that out of 60 per cent youths, almost 80 per cent suffer from hypokinetic diseases. Apart from it, 90 per cent of youngsters have aged10-12 times their biological age, and some of them have even aged 20-25 times their actual age, which is a sign that one is getting into the grave soon. All these youth are the best brains of India, and they need to be physically fit,” he advised youngsters. He added that today China is speaking about only physical revolution, as it know that India has more youngsters. “Swami Vivekananda has said that instead of reading holy scriptures, it is better to play football for 45 minutes, which gives one nerves of steel,” he said.

The 2020 edition of the Karavali Marathon was to create awareness on combating climate change, and drive call to action in the Karavali region. This marathon was a special edition as part of NITK’s diamond jubilee year celebration.

The event was supported by Rotaract Club and the NITK Students’ Council. It is perhaps the only full marathon (41.2 km) in India that is entirely conducted by students. Organisers said that as many 1,500 participants were registered in advance for the marathon, and many others joined the marathon on Sunday. The unique feature of the run was that a part of it was through the scenic NITK Surathkal Beach, along the beach side temple and lighthouse.

The events included full marathon (42.2km), half marathon (21.1km), 10 km, 5 km races and a 3km fun run.

261,['13/01/2020'],4 trains affected due to Rajya Rani,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Aurangabad: The South Central Railway has announced cancellation of the Manmad-Nagarsol train along with partial cancellation of three other trains owing to start of Rajya Rani Express.

Nanded-Manmad and Kacheguda-Manmad trains have been partially cancelled between Nagarsol and Manmad, while Manmad-Kecheguda train has been partially cancelled from Manmad to Nagarsol.

“A total of three existing trains have been permanently affected due to Rajya Rani express. The decision to this effect has been taken after considering the optimum use of the track availability and effective synchronisation of the signalling system,” an SCR official said.

The aforesaid decisions, which are likely to affect the train connectivity to Manmad, are likely to evoke sharp reactions from a section of passenger community.

Meanwhile, following widespread criticism from the passenger community, the SCR has reduced the halting time of newly started Mumbai-Nanded Rajya Rani Express at Manmad station from 30 minutes to five minutes.

As per the initial time-table, Mumbai-Nanded Rajya Rani Express used to arrive at Manmad at 11.25 pm and proceed for further journey towards Nanded via Aurangabad by 11.55 pm.

The revised schedule mandates the train to arrive at Manmad at the earlier timing, but it would leave the station by 11.30pm.

In another major decision, the SCR have revised the arrival and departure timing of Nanded-Duad passenger train at Manmad.

The train will now arrive at Manmad station at 5am instead of the earlier timing of 5.15am and leave the station after a halt of five minutes.

VIJAYAWADA: Organisers of cockfights are continuing with arrangements for the sport ahead of Sankranti, in spite of directions of the Krishna district administration. In the absence of monitoring by the police, arenas for the sport have been set up in the district.

Earlier this year, the district administration and city police had warned organisers of cockfights that cases would be filed against those who went against their directives. The sport, instead, has become a matter of sentiment in the region. “Sankranti is a traditional festival and cockfights are part of the celebration. While Tamil Nadu celebrates the festival with jallikattu, why can’t we organise cockfights. We are not against laws on animal cruelty but hurting our sentiments is not correct,” said K Narayana Rao, a resident of Edupugallu.

Meanwhile, cost of roosters have touched a record high this year. “We purchased a Kaki variety of rooster last year for Rs 45,000. But the cost of the same variety has touched Rs 65,000 this year. Demand for roosters has increased and buyers from Telangana also raising the demand,” said Vegesna Rambabu, a resident of Kalidhindi of Krishna district.

263,['13/01/2020'],Chennai: Insurance firm told to pay Rs 9 lakh to kin of boy run over by truck,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Photo used for representational purpose only

CHENNAI: A city tribunal dismissed an insurance firm ’s claim that a fake policy was created by the owner of a truck involved in an accident and held that it was up to the firm to have taken swift action and that it cannot absolve of the liability of paying compensation and deny a third party of compensation. The tribunal directed the firm to pay Rs 9 lakh compensation to the family of a 11-year-old boy.

The tribunal’s observation was in response to a petition by parents of the boy, who was killed after a rashly driven truck hit the boy’s bicycle and knocked him down in Nagapattinam in September 2016. The boy, E Abhishek, suffered a fall and came under the rear wheels of the truck and was killed on the spot, according to the petition by his parents Elangovan and Premalatha.

The petitioners sought a compensation of Rs 20 lakh from the insurer of the truck. In response, the insurer countered that the insurance policy for the truck involved in the accident is a fake one and that the QR code led to the policy of another vehicle. The counsel for the insurance firm argued that the policy template was misused to create a fake insurance policy. The counsel also argued that the accident was because of the negligent act by the deceased boy and that the firm cannot be held liable to pay compensation.

The tribunal after perusing the FIR, chargesheet and other documents, concluded that the accident occurred only due to the negligent driving of the truck driver and that the parents of the deceased boy are eligible for compensation.

On the submission by the insurance firm that the policy was fake, the tribunal said, “The insurance firm has been quite lethargic about the fake policy. No swift action was taken against the person who created the fake policy and they have also not produced enough evidence except for a statement by the company’s manager.”

Taking into account the age of the deceased and other factors, the tribunal computed the quantum of compensation to be Rs 9.25 lakh.

264,['13/01/2020'],"Agra, Mathura city buses do not have fire extinguishers","This story is from January 13, 2020

A UPSRTC bus in Agra

AGRA: Passengers risk their lives every time they travel in a city bus operating in Agra and Mathura as they do not have a fire extinguisher, which is mandatory for safety purposes. It is also a violation of the safety guidelines laid down by the Union ministry of road transport and highways.

The lack of safety gear assumes significance after 20 people were burnt to death when their private bus rammed into a truck in Kannauj and caught fire. Following the accident, Uttar Pradesh State Roadways Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) officials on Sunday replaced old fire extinguishers with new ones in several buses. First aid kits were also provided to the bus conductors.

The Agra-Mathura city transport service, that operates a total of 230 buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme, has not adopted the basic safety measures, thereby putting at risk the life of the passengers. Of the of 230 buses, 170 are operated in Agra and 60 in Mathura.

On Sunday, TOI checked over a dozen city buses operating on MG road. None of the bus had a fire extinguisher. In fact the condition of the buses was poor with missing window panes, broken window frames, torn or broken seats, no side mirrors and damaged indicators. Besides, the buses were very dirty with no signs of cleanliness.

Subham Verma, a B.Sc student and a regular commuter in Agra, said, “I travel in the city buses almost every day. I have never seen a fire extinguisher in any city bus. Officials keep on hiking the fare every year but are not concerned about the safety of the passengers.”

Veena Kushwah, another regular traveller, said, “Bus travel in Agra is a risky business. Besides no fire extinguisher to douse a fire, you never know when you might fall off a bus. Their steps are rickety and damaged. Last month, I sustained injuries in my leg while climbing the bus steps.”

Shopkeeper Gaurav Agarwal said, “It buses have not been maintained properly for a long time. One can find heaps of rubbish on the floors. Most of the seats are broken and supported by stones or some other means. Safety of the passengers should be a priority of the authorities. Fire extinguishers must be installed in buses without any further delay.”

RBL Sharma, managing director of the Agra-Mathura City Transport Service, said, “Soon fire extinguishers will be installed in all the city buses. We are assessing the condition of the buses. Required repairs and maintenance works will be done in a time-bound manner.”

Kozhikode: Lashing out at the Union government and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) over the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Kerala would remain a ‘secure fort’ for all people and the state cannot be cowed down by any threats.

Addressing a mega rally against CAA, organized by the Constitution Protection Samithi at the Kozhikode beach here on Sunday, Pinarayi said that no person born in the state should harbour any doubt or fears about their citizenship.

“You should remember that we are living in a secure fort. There is no need for anyone to run around looking for the place and date of birth of your aged parents or grandparents. All who have born here are citizens of our country. None of us have come from Afghanistan, Pakistan or Bangladesh. We don’t need certificates from anyone,” Pinarayi said.

The chief minister said that the National Population Register (NPR) was the first phase in the implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) and reiterated that the state will not take up the activities of NPR .

“No steps for collection of details through house visits for NPR will be undertaken. We will be collecting data as part of Census only, which has been going on for long and nothing beyond that will carried out in the state,” he added.

Stating that the strength of the state in the fight against CAA was its unity, Pinarayi said that the people of the state will move ahead in unison to resist the moves to divide people and make religion the basis of citizenship.

“We will have to keep distance from communal and extremist elements. If we include them they would try to take the movement in a different direction,” he added.

The meeting was also significant for the participation of leaders of the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama, with Samastha general secretary K Ali Kutty Musaliyar presiding over the meeting.

268,['13/01/2020'],Hema Malini backs Deepika Padukone: Visiting JNU was her personal choice,"This story is from January 13, 2020

BJP MP from Mathura Hema Malini

AGRA: Amid calls to boycott Deepika Padukone ’s film ‘Chhapaak’ for her visit to the JNU to join anti-CAA protest, BJP Mathura MP Hema Malini on Sunday came out in support of the actor and her film.

While many BJP functionaries have questioned Padukone’s motive behind showing solidarity with the protesters and several saffron outfits have called for boycotting the movie about an acid attack victim, the veteran actor said that everyone should watch the film. “Deeika has performed a ‘complicated’ role,” she told reporters in Mathura.

Hema said that going to JNU was “Deepika’s individual choice” and it was up to her to decide what to do. The MP, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a function organised by the Bullion Association in Mathura on Sunday, said, as an artist, she would say, “artists want that people should see their performance and hence boycotting Deepika’s movie wasn’t a right thing”.

She further said Deepika doesn’t know what is happening in politics as she is an artist not a politician.

Deepika’s movie is facing protests from saffron outfits in different part of the state, including Aligarh, where warning banners were put by activists, asking viewers to come only after getting their insurance done. Amid warning by activists, the movie was not screened in the district on Friday. According to reports, Bajarang Dal activists allegedly tore the posters of the film at a cinema hall in Muzaffarnagar district and also prevented viewers from entering the theaters screening the film on Friday.

Though Deepika had recently visited JNU, she did not address the students. She just stood, as former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar raised slogans and she left by the time the present union president Aishe Ghosh, who too was injured in the attack, started speaking. Soon after news of Deepika making an appearance at JNU broke, people from various saffron outfits across the state started posting on social media, calling for the boycott of her movie.

269,['13/01/2020'],Fear of missing out? Nothing 21st century about it,"This story is from January 13, 2020

By Kaushik Prasad

In 18th-century Europe, potatoes were considered a leprosy-inducing invention of the devil and this belief was particularly pernicious in France. So, no-one ate them. Yet, the humble tuber might not have attained its preeminent status in European cuisine if not for a French pharmacist named Antoine-Augustin Parmentier.

As a prisoner-of-war in Prussia, Parmentier was starved for long periods and when fed, it was boiled potato mash, considered slops by his jailers. This was his moment of epiphany, when he realised that potatoes were cheap, healthy and tasty, and could be the solution to the massive famines that swept through France. He decided to make popularising potatoes his life’s mission.

Upon his return to France, Parmentier embarked on a series of experiments to prove that potatoes were perfectly nutritious. He published a treatise and presented it to the scientific academy. But, then as now, in the face of deeply held preconceived notions, scientific evidence meant nothing. The potato remained accursed.

So, Parmentier decided to woo the court, and reached out to Louis XVI, the monarch, who agreed to support his cause and offered land for his experiments. Soon, Parmentier started throwing dinner parties with 20 different dishes on the menu – all made with potatoes. While the Versailles aristocracy took to the latest fashion and ate potatoes at his parties, the common people could not be converted to the spud.

And that’s when Louis XVI and Parmentier devised an elaborate con to get the French populace to eat potatoes.

In those days, much of the King’s wealth came from the loathed gabelle, the onerous and unfair salt tax. Consequently, salt fields and salt convoys were heavily guarded by the military. When the peasants saw that Parmentier’s potato fields were similarly defended by the king’s guards, they figured that potatoes must be valuable and not leprosy inducing. And besides, why should only the royalty enjoy what grew in those fields?

So, one day, as the guards took a break, the peasants stole some of the tuber and very soon potato fields started cropping up across the country. People even found potato recipes in cookbooks (written, helpfully, by Parmentier himself). The ruse was a success and Antoine-Augustin Parmentier finally managed to popularise the humble potato.

Preconceived notions, Parmentier discovered, cannot be breached by throwing science at them. Scientific claims may become reasons to believe but not reasons to buy. However, many marketers continue to confuse these. Only creative solutions, stemming from an intimate understanding of how people behave, can drive behaviour.

Today’s marketers may describe the tactics employed by Parmentier as influencer marketing, or content marketing. But at the core of his success was the way he tapped into a behavioural bias – the less there is, the more you want it.

Robert Cialdini’s landmark book, ‘Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion’, lists scarcity as one of the key principles that can make a product appear more valuable. If you reflect deeply, this is an age-old technique, deployed by saree salesmen in Chandni Chowk and hawkers in Dadar market. From De Beers diamonds to Hermès’ Birkin bag, brands have successfully mined this bias. When stores limit the number of items you can buy, it sparks a buying frenzy. Introduction of limited editions and countdowns on shopping websites (the latter showing how long special prices are likely to last), are all variations of the same basic insight.

Unfortunately, there are also examples of industries and brands employing dodgy sales techniques built on these very insights. Earlier this year, the UK’s competition commission clamped down on and fined travel websites for making false representations of a hotel’s popularity – among them claims like ‘one room left at this price’. These websites engaged in ‘pressure selling’ techniques, misled consumers over prices and gave prominence to hotels that paid the most commissions.

If you hear someone say how Gen Z is unique when it comes to experiencing FOMO, remind them of Parmentier’s story. Stripped to its essentials, FOMO is fundamentally the same behavioural bias exhibited by the 18th-century French peasantry. As the legendary Bill Bernbach said, it took a million years for man’s instincts to develop; it will take millions more for them to vary. It is fashionable to talk about the changing man but a communicator must be concerned with the unchanging man, with his obsessive drive to survive, to be admired, to succeed, to love, to take care of his own.

273,['13/01/2020'],"Day after stir, Agra varsity bars 13 NSUI and SCS members from entering campus","This story is from January 13, 2020

Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University

AGRA: A day after minor scuffle between rival student bodies and cane charge by police at Paliwal Park campus, Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University administration on Sunday has decided to bar 13 students of National Students Union of India ( NSUI ) and Samajwadi Chatra Sabha (SCS) from entering the campus.

However, NSUI members cried foul as no action was taken against any Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) worker so far.

The decision against NSUI and SCS students were taken during a meeting of varsity’s proctorial board on Sunday. Taking cognisance of semester exams and frequent protests by different groups, the board also decided not to allow any protests on the campus, for now.

Slamming the board’s decision, NSUI called the chief proctor an “ABVP agent”. While the chief proctor said that some of the protesters were ex-students and “they have no business on the campus”.

Manoj Srivastava, the chief proctor of Agra University , said, “Prior appointment would be needed if representatives of any student organisation want to meet any official. They will not be allowed to have direct access in our offices.” The 13 individuals who have been barred were largely responsible for causing frequent disturbances on campus, Srivastava said, adding that, “Those who are students can present their case by making a clarification.”

Meanwhile, Agra university’s former student union president, Gaurav Sharma, alleged, “Chief proctor does whatever RSS leaders ask him to do. On Saturday, NSUI workers were brutally beaten up by the police. Now, we are not being allowed to enter the campus. We are not going to back off, though. We will continue to protest against the injustice.”

NSUI district president Vilal Ahmed claimed, “The protest at Agra University on January 6 and 11 were first started by ABVP. Their motive was to create a disturbance on campus. NSUI and SCS workers had gathered to counter them. But, both police and university administration found it suitable to target us. We will be taking legal action for this injustice.”

The 13 “barred” student union members were Gaurav Sharma, Satish Sikarwar, Ankush Gautam, Apoorv Sharma, Lalit Tyagi, Vilal Ahmed, Harsh Upadhyaya, Ashish Kumar of NSUI and Ravi Yadav, Prabhakar Jadaun, Amit Pratap Yadav, Rajan Thakur, Jayant Yadav of SCS.

On Saturday afternoon, ABVP activists had assembled at the Paliwal Park campus of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University to stage a protest against the recent violent clashes in Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University and demanded a ban on left-wing organisations on campus.

Later, NSUI and SCS members also gathered to counter the ABVP. Both sides soon started indulging in high-pitch sloganeering for around 40 minutes. Later, there was minor scuffle between members of ABVP and NSUI which resulted in cane charge by the police.

274,['13/01/2020'],AMU students ask V-C to come clean on police action in varsity on December 15,"This story is from January 13, 2020

AMU students hold a protest on the university campus.

AGRA: A day ahead of the opening of the varsity, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students took out a unity march on the campus on Sunday to continue their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAA) and demanded the resignation of vice-chancellor (VC) and registrar.

The students have threatened to boycott classes, if the VC and registrar do not take action in December 15 violence. “Either they should lodge an FIR against the security forces for the brutality against the students or they should quit their posts,” said former students’ union president Faizul Hassan, who is also the member of AMU Coordination Committee.

Questioning the VC Tariq Mansoor, the students asked him to come clean and explain if he considered the police action on the night of December 15 unjustified, excessive and brutal or not? And if he does so, he should explain what actions he has he taken so far to accord justice to the innocent students, or be ready to face the students’ anger.

Another member of AMU Coordination Committee, Imran Khan, told TOI that the committee has decided to hold indefinite protest from Monday if the VC and registrar are not ready to meet their demands. The university will be reopening in three phases from Monday.

Meanwhile, Prof Emeritus in AMU history department, Irfan Habib, who came to address students on CAA, NRC and NPR organised by AMU medical college students, said that government should promote “composite” culture. He said, “CAA is a threat for poor people”. He added that everyone should get freedom to express their views and hold demonstration in a democratic nation.

He said, “Preamble of the constitution should be applied and not chief minister Yogi Adityanath ’s view. He is anti-national, if he doesn’t give freedom to the citizen of the country.”

Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) activist Medha Patkar, who also addressed students on CAA, told mediapersons that targeting educational institutions is not good. “Even after notification of CAA, they have lost their case in the public court,” she said, adding that National Peoples Resistance stands against National Population Register (NPR) and National Resistance against Communalism, Corporatism, and Corruption stand against NRC (National Register of Citizens).

“We will support students, if they need any legal support from us,” said Patkar, adding that it doesn’t matter that if the VC supports them or not.

CHENNAI: A police constable who tried saving a man from being attacked by four assailants was knifed in the bid on Saturday night at Gummidipoondi.

Constable Ranjith, 26, and the other victim, Rajesh, 29, were treated at a government hospital. Police have launched a search for the assailants.

Police said Rajesh, who works at a flower shop in Gummidipoondi, had an enmity with Munusamy, 34, a history-sheeter from the same locality. The latter held a grudge against Rajesh as he refused to pay mamool on many occasions. After receiving several threats, Rajesh had lodged a complaint against Munusamy in the area police station, acting on which police are said to have warned Munusamy.

Against this backdrop, Rajesh was intercepted by Munusamy and three others on Saturday evening. The four pulled out a knife and cornered Rajesh when he tried to escape, police said. Ranjith, who was patrolling the area, saw Rajesh being attacked and tried to intervene. The attackers slashed Ranjith’s left shoulder and fled the spot.

Passersby tried to catch the assailants but they escaped. They rescued Ranjith and Rajesh and sent them to a hospital. A special team has been formed to nab the suspects.

Police sources said Munusamy had several attempt to murder cases, assault cases pending against him and that he held kangaroo courts to settle disputes.

Nashik: During a recent visit to Harihar Fort in the district, Virag Sontakke, assistant director of the Department of Archaeology, Nashik, said that the fort is in bad shape and needs restoration.

“Harihar Fort is popular for its steep trek. It is mostly visited by youngsters who like trekking and this fort gives them a thrill,” said Sontakke.

The fort — about 40 km away from Nashik — has a steep trek that an be completed in two phases. “First you have to walk up to the hill, then you have to climb to get to the peak of it. This climb is very thrilling as it is steep at almost 80 degrees,” Sontakke told TOI.

“The fort must be over 200 years old. There is only a room of 20*10 at the top. It must have been built as a watch tower as it is a pass centre between Mumbai and Nashik,” added Sontakke.

There are a total of 85 forts in the district, of which only 7 are protected. The archaeology department has identified 18 forts that need to be protected, said Sontakke.

“As thousands of trekkers visit the fort every week, there should be some inscription on a board about its history. We are in discussion with the Durg Samvardhan Pratishthan and are considering a tie up with them. We also want to put up a board stating do’s and dont’s for the safety of the trekkers,” Sontakke told TOI.

Once the fort is protected, the responsibility of its maintenance becomes the government’s concern. The poor state of the fort without the inscription of the detailed history and unavailability of guides often disappoints trekkers. The historical asset of the state should be conserved and the 1.5 hours trek should be safe for the climbers, said Sontakke.

Rajesh Pardeshi, a frequent trekker, said “I have been to Harihar Fort multiple times. The most beautiful thing at the fort is to reach the top of the hill. It has rock-cut steps and there are holders to maintain your balance while climbing up.”

“Most of the youngsters chose this fort for trekking for thrill and adventure. This has become a trend now to complete difficult treks,” added Pardeshi.

277,['13/01/2020'],Experts suggest fibre rich food for overweight temple elephants,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Coimbatore: Almost all the temple and mutt elephants at the annual rejuvenation camp at Thekkampatti elephant camp are found to be overweight. A special team of veterinarians has suggested a high-fibre green fodder diet over carbohydrate diet to control the elephants’ weight.

According to Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department officials, a team of elephant specialist veterinarians from Kerala and Tamil Nadu had visited the ongoing camp at Thekkampatti in Mettupalayam last week. They did an overall check-up of the 28 temple and mutt elephants and suggested interventions and health measures. The officials said it was a first of its kind measure since the rejuvenation camp for temple elephants was started by the state.

K Rajamanickam, joint commissioner, HR&CE department, Coimbatore, confirmed that three experts had visited the elephant camp last week and conducted check-up for two days.

A veterinarian with the department of animal husbandry, who is deployed at the camp, said, “One of the veterinarians was from Kerala and the other two were from Tamil Nadu.” He said as almost all the elephants were found to be overweight, the team had recommended fibre diet for them. “As the elephants are mainly given rice and ragi, which is a carbohydrate diet, they put on weight. To address this, the experts have suggested a high-fibre food such as green fodder.”

While some elephants might get green fodder as the same would be available near temples, others don’t have that luxury, the veterinarian said. “But, of late, temples are becoming sensitive to such things.”

An average adult female Asian elephant weighs around 2,500kg to 3,500kg. Based on the age and height of an individual elephant, it is determined whether the animal is overweight or not, he said.

The specialist team had also advised pedicure for the temple and mutt elephants. Their toenails should be trimmed and maintained properly. “As wild elephants walk long distances, their toenails would wear and stay in size. But for temple elephants, this is not the case. So, their nails would grow big and could get cracked. So, they have to be trimmed regularly.”

The 48-day rejuvenation camp for the temple and mutt elephants was inaugurated on the Bhavani banks at Thekkampatti on December 15.

AHMEDABAD: A woman from the Satellite area on Sunday registered a complaint of theft alleging that jewellery worth Rs 4.50 lakh was stolen by a 28-year-old woman who was given shelter at home.

In her FIR with the Satellite police, Geeta Malik, 50, a resident of Pruthvi Tower in Satellite, said that the suspect, Supriya Tandon, was her daughter’s friend whom the complainant always treated as her daughter.

She stated in the FIR that she had come to know about the theft of ornaments at her house on October 17, 2019 when she opened the cupboard to get ready for Karwa Chauth festival.

Malik said she strongly suspects Tandon, who was her daughter Anushka’s friend in Jalandhar in Punjab when Anushka was studying there.

“Tandon used to visit our place with her three-year-old son and she was being treated as our family member. Tandon told me repeatedly that her husband was not treating her well and she was being harassed by her husband,” said Malik.

Malik said that they showed sympathy towards Tandon and gave her shelter whenever she wanted in the Malik family’s presence and also in their absence.

“Tandon was also given keys of our homes and she was very well acquainted with each and every detail of our house,” said Malik in the FIR.

280,['13/01/2020'],NMC destroying yet another city playground,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nagpur: After concretization of Priyadarshini Colony playground, Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has allegedly destroyed another one, also known as Lingo Maidan, at Kachipura. In the name of development of playground, the civic body has covered it with big-sized gravel (gitti) making it unsuitable even for walking, much less playing.

Following complaints from residents, activist Akshay Samarth visited the playground and alerted NMC officials about destruction of the playground.

“I had played football and cricket on this playground for years. It was in a very good condition. It began to be destroyed with parking of school buses and commercial vehicles in the last couple of years. An NMC contractor began using a large chunk of it for making concrete manhole covers. It became undulating and unsuitable for playing. I am shocked to see NMC has now covered entire playground with gravel. It seems NMC is converting it into a parking place as done at Priyadarshini Colony,” he said.

Samarth said, “It is also contempt of Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court and violation of NMC norms. Playground should be kept open to sky and should be playable. No one can even walk here.”

A resident of Kachipura Anil Wadpalliwar said it was sheer waste of public money. “City is running out of open spaces. This playground is only one in Kachipura. Now, where will children and sportspersons play. Stringent action should be taken against NMC staff. It should recover loss from engineers,” he said.

An engineer from NMC Dharampeth Zone told TOI he was not aware of playground being covered with gravel. “Sudhakar Deshmukh had approved Rs 18 lakh for development of the playground during his tenure as MLA. Work has been allotted to a private agency for developing it in a systematic manner. Work also covers construction of walking track. I will inspect and take necessary action,” he said.

Wadpalliwar said it was a practice of NMC engineers to sit in offices and clear bills without visiting sites. “Contractor is bound to execute work as per specification given by the NMC. Engineers have to be present at site and ensure right quantity of materials is used. How can engineer says he is not aware and will revert after inspection,” he asked.

As per norms, gravel is not to be used in developing a playground. A layer of soft stones (khadak) is laid and crushed through road roller to level the ground. Then, a thick layer of black soil (mitti) is laid for growing grass and softness.

Samarth and Wadpalliwar said gravel should be totally removed. “NMC should not put soil on gravel. Citizens especially children will get hurt. After sometime, gravel having sharp edges will come to the surface and cause injuries,” they said.

TOI had done a series of reports on destruction of Priyadarshini Colony playground in April last year. NMC is yet to take any action against engineers and restore the playground.

COIMBATORE: Around 1,100 cases were filed before the Lokpal of India so far, but most of them did not come under the purview of its jurisdiction, so they were disposed of, said justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose , chairperson, Lokpal of India, on Sunday.

Speaking to reporters after taking part in the 31st Convocation of Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women, in the city, justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose said the Lokpal rules were ready and would be given effect quickly.

“There is no difficulty now to carry it on full swing,” he said.

At present they were working out of a makeshift office and by the end of January or the beginning of February, they would start working from a new permanent office, he said.

The cases which didn’t come under Lokpal’s jurisdiction were disposed of after all the members discussed it, he said. “We have given them the opinion that they can be processed in front of that particular committee or institution where all these allegations are made for their own benefit,” he said.

Ghose said they had disposed of the cases, as they didn’t want to keep any matter pending. “I even personally spoke to a person who had allegations to tell him this was not the forum and asked him to go to other fora where he can sort it out,” he said. “But any other allegation or grievance which comes before us, we are ready to take it up.”

When asked whether Lokpal has the power to take up a case suo motu, he said those particulars were yet to be formulated.

To a question on whether the case where a Congress MLA from Puducherry has accused his own government of corruption, he said the Lokpal doesn’t have jurisdiction over that.

Earlier, at the convocation, a total of 2,095 candidates, including 25 PhD scholars, 56 MPhil scholars, 532 post graduates and 1,482 under graduates received degrees.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: App-based cab aggregator Uber is going to add more safety features , including a facility that will allow both passengers and drivers to record audio through the ride-sharing app during a ride.

The features, announced by Uber recently, will also include RideCheck, a feature that will enable the cab aggregator flag certain trip irregularities such as long, unexpected stops or midway drops that may indicate an increased safety risk, especially for women riders. If an anomaly is detected, the aggregator will initiate a RideCheck by reaching out to both the passenger and the driver, a spokesperson said.

Uber will also have PIN verification, a feature already available on some other cab aggregators. On getting into a cab, a passenger will receive a four-digit PIN and the trip will start once the driver punches it in his app.

The audio recording feature will be a pilot project to be introduced soon in India, said Sachin Kansal, senior director of Global Safety Products, Uber. This will give a passenger or a driver the choice to record audio through their phone while on the trip. When the trip ends, the user will have the option to report a safety incident and submit the recording. The audio file will be encrypted and the user will not be able to listen to the recording, Uber said, adding that if submitted, the company’s customer support agents will use the clipping to understand an incident better and take appropriate actions. Only Uber will have access to the submitted audio.

“Our global safety product team has a simple but critical mission: to help set benchmarks for ride-sharing safety. Over the past three years, we have introduced several features to enhance safety standards on our platform,” said Kansal.

Fifty handloom weavers from the Samathur cluster participated in the skill development programme

COIMBATORE: M Vasudevan of Samathur in Pollachi has been a handloom weaver for 26 years.

But a skill development programme conducted by the National Skill Development Corporation - Textile Sector Skill Council through Kumaraguru College of Technology (KCT) here last week gave him a glimpse of the latest developments in his trade. The 42-year-old man, who has been weaving cotton saris along with his wife and brother-in-law, learned that a variety of products, such as curtains and mats, can also be made using handloom fabric. He also got to know handloom trends around the world and how to market his products online.

Fifty handloom weavers from the Samathur cluster participated in the first batch of the programme funded by the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana held from Thursday to Saturday.

Programme co-ordinator B Poongodi, an assistant professor at KCT Business School, said as the weavers were in the field for six generations, they didn’t need to be taught skills. “The focus was on bridging the skill gap. On the first day, we exposed them to technicalities such as common terminologies in handloom sector across the globe. On the second day, we exposed them to the concept of team building and its benefits, digital marketing and entrepreneurship. There was an assessment on the third day, where experts from another agency assessed the participants,” she told TOI.

The Coimbatore Center for Weavers under KCT has been approved as the training partner by the National Skill Development Corporation, Poongodi said. “We are authorised to train 500 weavers in the region. The second batch from Samathur will be trained this month-end. We will conduct sessions for Coimbatore weavers in February.”

Chairman of the Textile Sector Skill Council T Rajkumar said the sessions aim at upgrading the weavers. “They will be exposed to the latest trends and trained on how to stay competitive in the market. The idea is to preserve the art of handloom,” he said.

Vasudevan found the session encouraging. “Handloom weavers in Samathur have been making cotton and silk saris, and cotton-silk blend saris. We were taught about other handloom products such as curtains. We also were told how we can sell our products online,” he said.

289,['13/01/2020'],Dust screens mandatory at construction sites: NMC,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) has finally made dust screen mandatory at construction sites in the city in a bid to curb air pollution.

The move aims to reduce the dust created at construction sites. Builders have also started erecting dust screens at their sites.

The initiative is part of several measures suggested in the action plan of the municipal corporation to reduce air pollution. This new condition has been included in the construction norms of the NMC.

“Air pollution is one of the major issues the city is dealing with. Pollution caused due to construction activities is also a major concern. Therefore, permissions for constructions of the buildings are to be given against the condition of erecting dust screens at construction sites,” said an official from the NMC.

The decision in this regard was taken in December 2019 during a meeting of the committee formed for the implementation of the action plan to reduce air pollution. The committee is chaired by municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game.

The committee includes officials from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, regional transport office and the traffic police department besides officials from the municipal corporation.

Accordingly, permissions are being given on the condition of making provisions of the dust screen at construction sites. Moreover, ongoing sites have also been asked to erect dust screen, added the official.

In addition, sprinkling of water at construction sites to suppress the dust has also been made mandatory.

Around two years back, Nashik was among top 100 air polluted cities in the country. Thereafter, the NMC was asked to prepare an action plan to tackle air pollution in the city.

Around three months back, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) of the municipal corporation approved the action plan to reduce air pollution in the city.

Kolhapur: The city and district presidents of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be elected on Monday and Tuesday respectively.

The BJP organisational functionaries claim that the local party workers will vote for their choice of candidate. This is the first major organisational election taking place in the BJP after the massive defeat in the assembly elections where both the MLA’s lost.

Also, the BJP lost power in Kolhapur Zilla Parishad in which Shiv Sena for the first time aligned with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The BJP local functionaries claimed that the organisational elections are crucial since the Sena-Congress-NCP alliance which has come together and formed the government at the state is challenging the BJP in every local level election.

As per the schedule, the city president of the party will be elected first on Monday and the district president will be elected ion Tuesday. The election will take place in presence of the observers sent by the state party unit and state party president Chandrakant Patil.

According to the sources in the party, Rahul Chikode — a a close confidante of state party president is likely to be the top choice to head the party in the city and Samarjit Ghatge will be the top choice to lead the party in the district.

Ghatge had joined BJP recently and after not getting party ticket in the recent assembly election he contested as an independent. When he has declined the ticket he resigned as the chairman of a housing board, the appointment which was made by then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. However, he continued to be the primary member of the party.

A local leader of the party said, “For the local units we have elected our party functionaries. These party functionaries will elect the city president and district president. The nominations will be declared on the day of the election. Sixty members will cast their votes and we have asked them to remain present during voting.”

The party leaders are ensuring to maintain the balance between the old members and the recently joined members from other parties. Suresh Halwankar and Dhananjay Mahadik are already given the organisational responsibilities at the state level. They will also have their significant impact on electing new presidents. Especially, Mahadik’s will have greater say to elect city president as the elections for the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is nearing.

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu had the second highest custodial death cases in the country in 2018 recording 12, just one less than Gujarat, but not a single charge sheet has been filed nor any arrests made. In contrast, Gujarat ordered magesterial inquiries in 7 of 13 cases and also arrested 10 people. However, Gujarat registered cases for only three incidents, while Tamil Nadu has registered cases for all 12 incidents, according to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ).Lawyers and civil rights activists point out that the safety of any person in custody is the responsibility of the police. This is why the law mandates a judicial inquiry when a person dies in custody. Activists blame cops accusing them of using force to extract confessions, say activists.Senior advocate Sudha Ramalingam says the NCRB data highlights a disturbing trend, which clearly shows that police hush up things during custodial deaths . This, she says, emboldens other cops. There is no agency to pull them up for not registering a case or filing a charge sheet, she points out.“Since most the victims are from economically weaker section, they fear to raise their voice against police personnel. Though laws are good in our system, its execution is poor,” she said.“It is high time that an external agency is empowered to pull up cops for offences and scrutinise their actions properly to punish the accused. Enquiry and prosecution by the same department will not render any justice,” she added.While a senior retired police official, who asked not to be named, admitted force was used while apprehending a criminal or suspect evading arrest for long and when there were no aids such as CCTV cameras to support the process of investigation.Lawyer V S Suresh said the police would file a case and later go in for a compromise with the victim's family by compensating them with money. They would not follow up the complaint further.“Most of the prisoners who are produced before magistrates will not reveal that they are being beaten up by the police,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220940,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157537,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/tn-saw-second-highest-custodial-deaths/articleshow/73219508.cms

BENGALURU: Police and Mahadevapura corporators visited Kariyammana Agrahara in Bellandur on Sunday to nab undocumented Bangladeshi immigrants suspected to be living there. The search came after a video alleging that illegal migrants were living there went viral.

Police inspected the spot and enquired about the dwellers’ antecedents. A raid was conducted there earlier too but residents either had an Aadhaar card or voter ID or both. “Many of them claim to be from West Bengal or Assam. We are in a fix. About 70% of these sheds are on private land and many work for builders or developers as construction labourers. Some segregate waste dumped in the area. The women work as domestic helps in neighbouring apartments,” a police officer said.

Mahadevapura MLA Arvind Limbavali tweeted that a few illegal immigrants from Bangladesh had taken shelter in Kariyammana Agrahara and their sheds had become a haven for illegal activities.

294,['13/01/2020'],Aggrieved sr citizens move court for release of pension,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nagpur: Aggrieved senior citizens knocked Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court’s doors against Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government for arbitrarily stopping their pension without any concrete reasons.

A division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Milind Jadhav on Friday issued notices to the Union Ministry of Labour and Employment secretary, along with Provident Funds’ (PF) regional and assistant commissioners in the city. They were directed to file a reply within eight weeks.

RTI activist Abhay Kolarkar and 15 other petitioners, who worked with private institutions like were Nagpur Nagrik Sahakari Bank, Inox Limited and Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) contended that they had duly remitted their contribution as per Section 11(3) of the EPF Act, 1952, and Pension Scheme, 1995, to the government, still their pension was arbitrarily stopped.

Quoting a Supreme Court verdict of RC Gupta versus the Centre, the petitioners, through their counsel Tushar Mandlekar, pointed out that employees of such employers can exercise their option to contribute for PF and pension scheme on their entire salary. Arguing that they’re being deprived of their constitutional right, they prayed for directives to the secretary to conduct a departmental enquiry of the concerned officials, who stopped their pension without prior notice from May 1 2019.

According to them, the EPF Act mentioned the creation of the PF account of every employee of the private establishment covered under it. The fund was to be constituted by depositing an employee’s share at 10% or 12% of the basic wages, including dearness allowance. The employer also has to contribute an identical amount which together made a contribution of PF. Initially, the Act didn’t have any provision of pension. Later, Section 6-A was inserted for starting Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) in 1995.

Accordingly, the maximum pensionable salary was Rs6,500 per month and contributions to PF were to be made only on that amount. The PF corpus was to be constituted by transferring 8.33% out of the employer’s contribution under Section 6. The maximum pensionable salary was initially fixed at Rs5,000 per month and later increased to Rs6,500.

After SC’s verdict, the PF Commissioners were directed to accept the difference of contribution from retired employees along with interest from January 1, 1995, for providing higher pension. The petitioners have already completed all the formalities and deposited one time contribution of several lakhs as demanded by the PF Commissioners in 2018. The higher pension was calculated and started by authorities after completing the administrative process. However, the PF commissioner issued letters to State Bank of India to withhold the withdrawal of pension from May 1, which the petitioners termed as illegal.

295,['13/01/2020'],N Maha ginners likely to export cotton directly to B’desh,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nashik: Cotton ginners in North Maharashtra are in talks with cotton importers from Bangladesh to export the produce directly to the neighbouring country.

Currently, cotton ginners in North Maharashtra are exporting cotton to Bangladesh via Mumbai-based export houses.

The Bangladesh Cotton Association has shown interest in directly buying cotton bale from ginners in North Maharashtra and has invited office-bearers of Khandesh Ginners/Pressing Factory Owners’ Association for a meeting in Bangladesh next month.

The ginners will get Rs 2,000 each more for every 1.78 quintal a bale if they export directly to Bangladesh.

“We will pass on the benefits to cotton farmers if we start exporting cotton bales directly to Bangladesh. We procure raw cotton directly from farmers and process in our ginning and pressing units. We make a cotton bale from five quintal of raw un-ginned cotton,” Pradeep Jain, president of Khandesh Ginning and Pressing Factory Owners Association, said.

“The farmers may get Rs 200 per quintal more if we export directly to Bangladesh. The Bangladesh Cotton Association has invited us for a meeting on February 29,” he added.

Bangladesh is the major importer of Indian cotton. Around 40% of the total cotton from India is exported to Bangladesh. North Maharashtra includes four districts — Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nandurbar. But three districts Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar are known as Khandesh known for producing good quality cotton.

On an average the area under cotton cultivation in North Maharashtra is 8.5 lakh hectare. Cotton acreage in Nashik district is only 50,000 hectare, while over 8 lakh hectare is spread in Khandesh.

While country exports around 50 lakh bales of cotton, North Maharashtra’s contribution is around 5 lakh bales. This year owing to incessant rainfall cotton yield in North Maharashtra reduced by 5%, but production was same as last year due to rise in acreage by 5%.

The areas under cotton in North Maharashtra increased from 8.5 lakh hectare to 9 lakh hectares this year.

“China’s internal reserves of cotton have reduced. Hence, China is likely to import around 20 lakh bales of cotton from various countries. Of which, it may import around 10-12 lakh cotton bales from India. Hence, demand is likely to increase. The rate of raw cotton has also increased by Rs 200 per quintal to Rs 5,300 per quintal on Sunday, against Rs 5,100 per quintal on Monday,” Jain said.

Kolhapur: To create aware about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), BJP has started a campaign to inform people by visiting them at their doorsteps and at the same time progressive outfits launched a meeting to oppose the CAA .

BJP launched the campaign in presence of Rajyasabha MP Amar Sable where the party workers raised slogans at Bindu Chowk. The party leaders appealed to the citizens to give a missed call on a number to show their support to CAA.

Sable said, “Misinformation about CAA has spread. The CAA does not take away the citizenship of any Indian, rather it gives one to the minorities affected in neighbouring countries.”

The party workers visited several families from Bindu Chowk area. The party leaders said that the CAA is not anti-Muslim and alleged that the Congress and other parties are spreading false information about the CAA.

Meanwhile, hundreds of activists and workers gathered at Town Hall to oppose the implementation of CAA. The meeting was called by the progressive outfits and was attended by the artists who painted, sang and performed plays. Most of the speakers said that the CAA is discriminatory and against the ethos of Indian Constitution.

Dutta Desai, leader of Communist Party of India said, “The CAA is imposed on us after the exercise of National Register for Citizens failed in Assam. The CAA is against the minorities and also against the poor people of the country. The government through its agencies has started oppressing the voices of dissent. The CAA is against the secular idea proposed in the Constitution.

The meeting was attended by senior historian Jaisingrao Pawar, professor and activist Megha Pansare, Vyankappa Bhosale, Dilip Pawar, and Milind Yadav. All attending the meet read the preamble of the Constitution together. A wall of expression was raised at the town hall and everyone attending the event wrote the message on it.

Also, another anti-CAA meeting was held at Rendal village of Hatkanangle tehsil. It was attended by hundreds of people of all communities. A decision to hold a mega rally in coming weeks in the district was taken in the meeting.

Kolhapur: Despite being given a grant of Rs 80 lakh monthly by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), the Kolhapur Municipal Transport (KMT) is dealing with losses to the tune of Rs 2.5 lakh per day.

The daily revenue target of the KMT buses is expected at Rs 10.50 lakh. Contrary to the figure, the municipal transport system is generating revenue of about Rs 8 lakh per day. The shortfall is mainly due to the less number of passengers travelling against the expected numbers.

The passenger fares are the only major source of revenue for the KMT administration. Recently, the corporators in the standing committee slammed the transport administration for demanding more grants. They demanded the KMT administration to work on lessening the losses as early as possible. Contrary, they do not expect the KMT to be a profitable organisation.

A senior KMT official requesting anonymity said, “We are trying hard to increase the passenger count by not changing the fares for a long time and providing prompt service to them. We have inducted several new buses which will help us to increase the passenger count in the next few months. We have also managed to bring down losses to some extent, however, we have to ensure that the daily losses are reduced further. We are getting the monthly grant of around Rs 80 lakh, most of which is spent on the salaries and pensions of the KMT staff.”

The KMC has recently transferred some parking lots to the KMT administration to run and earn the revenue. At present, the parking slot at CPR Hospital is handed over to the KMT. However, for running the major parking lots such as Bindu Chowk, the KMT is relying on private firms.

The officials claimed that if they start running the parking lots of themselves, the KMT staff have to be deployed which is not feasible at the current available strength. “We are exploring other options to increase revenue. These days the fuel prices have increased which is eating up much of the expenses made daily. We have been asked to draft a report of the current financial situation which will be tabled before the transport committee and standing committee. Based on the report, we are expecting the suggestions from the elected representatives to make the transport service financially feasible,” said the official.

Aurangabad: A Jalna-based trader, who was under investigation in cases involving alleged hiring of contract killers, was shot by two assailants on Saturday night.

The deceased — identified as Rajesh Nahar (45), a resident of Partur tehsil of the district — recently had got out on bail after being arrested in two cases. According to sources, Nahar was involved in monetary dispute running in to several crores.

In one of the cases he got arrested for, police had recovered a video clip that shows him with alleged contract killers. Citing content of the clip, police said that the deceased was seen and heard paying Rs 5 lakh out of Rs 50 lakh for eliminating a leading private moneylender from Jalna, with whom he reportedly had a monetary dispute.

“Nahar left home in his car with registration number MH-21-BH-3312 on Friday evening at 7pm. Considering his business rivalry, apart from a threat he reportedly received few months ago from gun-wielding unidentified suspects who had waylaid him on a deserted road, it was unusual for him to leave home without a driver or any acquaintance,” one of Nahar’s family members told police.

After Nahar did not return home for some time, his family members started calling him, but the calls went unanswered. Worried about him, a manhunt was launched by family members only find his body in a locked car — parked on Partur to Vatur of Jalna Mantha road near Dambri village.

He was rushed to Jalna based private hospital where he was declared brought dead. Autopsy report revealed that he was hit with couple of bullets including one piercing his cheek and exiting from other side.

After learning about the incident, senior police officers including additional superintendent of police Samadhan Pawar rushed to the spot and carried out a detailed spot panchanama.

Local crime branch inspector Rajendrasingh Gaur told TOI, “The bullets entered his body after puncturing the driver-side wind shield of the car. A couple of suspects have been rounded up for questioning. The size and make of the bullets suggest that they were been fired using country-made firearm.”

Nashik: Minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant on Sunday saod the government will soon issue a government resolution (GR) for development of Savitribai Phule Pune University ’s (SPPU) Nashik sub-centre.

The minister was speaking at a press conference at SPPU during his maiden visit to the varsity after being recently appointed the minister for higher and technical education.

“Out of nearly 7 lakh students at the varsity, over 2 lakh study at the sub-centres in Nashik and Ahmednagar who will be benefited if the sub-centres are developed,” Samant said.

The minister has also directed the SPPU authorities to speed up the work of Nashik campus as soon as possible. Confirming the developments, SPPU registrar Prafulla Pawar said things are now moving in positive direction.

“Vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar apprised the minister about the activities that are conducted at the sub-centres. We also told him about issues that are pending for the development of the two sub-centres along with the need for a vibrant campus,” Pawar said.

Amit Patil, a senate member of Nashik sub-centre, has been in touch with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and environment minister Aditya Thackeray over the issues that the Nashik sub-centre has been facing over the years.

“Students from nearby villages already find it difficult to reach the sub-centre at Nashik and it becomes a nightmare for them to travel to Pune for various things. If the campus is built soon on the 63 acre land of the varsity lying idle at Dindori, the students would be relieved and learn more from the lively campus at their disposal,” Patil said.

“The minister has assured us that a GR will be issued within two weeks regarding the same and the bhoomi pujan of the Nashik sub-centre should start within three months,” he added.

The minister also said that if the sub-centre is developed, a total of 111 teaching posts and several non-teaching posts will be generated.

Currently, the Nashik sub-centre is running from a rented space in the municipal market. It started Masters of Business Administration (MBA) two years ago and wishes to open two more varsity courses at the sub-centre from the upcoming academic year.

304,['13/01/2020'],"In a first, pre-emptive capture of two tigers on cards in Chandrapur","This story is from January 13, 2020

One of the tigers has settled close to the shrubby patch of Irai river

Chandrapur: In a major fallout of the man-animal conflict in the region, the forest department is preparing to capture four tigers from different places in Chandrapur district. Chief conservator of forest (CCF), Chandrapur, SV Ramarao said orders have been given to capture two tigers prowling on the outskirts of Chandrapur city, and a third one — responsible for killing two humans — in Nagbhid forest range, while the warrant was awaited for the capture of the fourth tiger — responsible for three human deaths — in Rajura range.

This may be the first such instance in the country, where the forest department has termed two tigers — a male and a female — as dangerous to human life and ordered their pre-emptive capturing, anticipating the serious risk they pose by their presence near the city.

NTCA guidelines say problem felines that have killed at least two humans and pose imminent threat to others can be captured. The department has gone beyond the ambit of the rules this time, in the light of the grave threat the tigers pose to the citizens of Chandrapur.

The two tigers in question are offsprings of the tigress in the Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS) area, and have now settled in the Irai river skirting the city. Both tigers have made multiple cattle kills and have been regularly sighted by citizens close to the river.

“They pose a serious threat to humans, as there is dense habitation on either side of the river. An attack on humans is imminent if they continue to stay close to human settlement. Hence, we have obtained permission for their capture,” said those involved in the operation.

One of the tigers has settled close to the shrubby patch of the river, near Wadgaon ward, and prowls from Padoli bridge to Datala bridge. The other tiger has settled ahead of Datala bridge in Irai river valley, and prowls along the river patch skirting Binba ward and Pathanpura ward of the city.

The existence of these tigers in proximity to human settlements has brought a new kind of urban man-tiger conflict to fore. The shrubby stretches of CSTPS and those along Irai river are not the natural habitat of tigers. Any attack on humans in the city can create an ‘unprecedented conflict situation’ and can adversely affect tiger protection and conservation movement in Chandrapur, claimed honorary wildlife warden Bandu Dhotre, explaining the urgency behind the move of their capture.

Over a dozen localities, including Rashtrawadi Nagar, Tulsi Nagar, Vrundawan Nagar, Wadgaon Ward, Haveli garden locality, Jagannath Baba Nagar, Sister Colony, Thakkar Nagar, Rahmat Nagar, New Chandrapur, Datala village and a bunch of other settlements fall within range of the tigers that have settled in Irai river valley.

CCF Ramarao claimed the department had constituted multiple teams to capture the two urban tigers. Tracking and search operations were launched to map their prowling areas and trace their location, before making the final capture move.

There are plans to translocate these two tigers elsewhere once they are captured, sources said.

306,['13/01/2020'],Karnataka: MLA moots plan to name road in Bejai after George Fernandes,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Former defence and railway minister George Fernandes (File Photo)

MANGALURU: Namma Kudla is all set to perpetuate the memory of one of its tallest sons of the soil – George Fernandes – whose first death anniversary falls on January 29.

Taking the lead in this regard is MLA D Vedavyas Kamath , who has mooted a plan to name a prominent road in Bejai after the former defence and railway minister. Bejai is the place in this coastal city that George Fernandes grew up and spent his childhood days.

Kamath told TOI that this move will be initiated once the council of the newly elected members of Mangaluru City Corporation is set up. “We will adopt a resolution in the council and send it to the state government for approval,” the MLA said. Given George Fernandes’ towering personality, the resolution will be adopted unanimously. This will also be a true tribute to a politician who is the mastermind behind Konkan Railway, Kamath said.

In a Facebook post, Kamath said, “Planning to name a road in Bejai as it was his birthplace in Mangaluru. Renaming a road is a tribute as he had achieved several landmarks in Indian political history. This has been a thought process since long as I want future generations of coastal city to know about him. Let his name be intact in memory of Mangalureans for centuries to come. Apart from this, I even plan other things to get his achievements recognised.”

The Facebook post also has a footnote on George Fernandes and it reads thus: “Tribute to the Legend: About Shri George Mathew Fernandes was an Indian trade unionist, statesman, journalist, freethinker, and member of Rajya Sabha from Bihar for a short while, and a member of Lok Sabha for a very long period, starting from Bombay in 1967 but mostly representing Bihar. Born: 3rd June 1930 - Death: 29th Jan 2019 (sic).”

307,['13/01/2020'],Three booked for supplying ganja in Kalamba jail,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Representative image

KOLHAPUR: The Juna Rajwada police have booked three suspects, including an under trial prisoner from the Kalamba Central Prison, for their alleged involvement in ganja trade inside the jail premises.

Police said that they recovered 50 gm ganja from the suspects and are investigating the case in details.

“Two people, including the father of under trial prisoner Akshay Rajendra Suryavanshi and his friend, went to meet Akshay in the Kalamba Jail on Saturday. They told the jail authorities that they have brought some medicine and clothes for Akshay as per his demand. The guards at the prison gate checked the material and found two sticks weighing 50 gm kept in the clothes covered in a polythene bag. The jail authorities suspected that the material was ganja and informed us about the incident. A team of policemen was immediately sent to the Kalamba Jail and the two suspects were detained for further investigation,” said a police officer attached with the Juna Rajwada police station.

Police said that they have registered a case against all the three suspects, including Akshay, his father and his friend under section 20 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS), 1985.

“We are investigating the case in details to find out if drugs were supplied to Akshay as per his demand or someone was using him to get the drugs from outside into Kalamba Jail,” the officer said.

He added that the issue is sensitive as similar incidents had rocked the Kalamba Jail premises in the past with some officials transferred and others suspended over lacunae in the security at the Kalamba Jail.

“We will soon find out the motive behind the supply of ganja and investigate from where the duo procured it,” the officer added.

308,['13/01/2020'],Tadoba tigers likely to get more space,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Nagpur: The kingdom of Tadoba tigers is likely to expand by over 700 hectares as Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is in the process to compensate for the forest land that is to be diverted for Gargai dam project in Oghade village in Palghar district.

The Rs1,100 crore Gargai project has been conceived to augment drinking water supply to Mumbai keeping in mind the growing population there. The dam project will submerge 700 hectares of rich forest land of Tansa wildlife sanctuary, spread in 300sqkm, in Thane district.

Under the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, any user agency which wants to utilize forest land must procure equal area of non-forest land and pay for afforestation on it, besides paying cost of the forest land to be diverted. If the land the agency is procuring is degraded, then double the amount of land must be given, the Act says.

BMC municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “The project has been only conceptualized. We are yet to submit proposal for clearance under Forest (Conservation) Act and to the State Wildlife Board (SWBL).”

Even as the SWBL had approved the project in 2012, standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) had rejected it in June 2013. Villages inside the sanctuary are not opposing the project as each family has been promised a job in the BMC, post-rehabilitation.

By finalizing handing over of the land in lieu of diverted one in Tansa, the BMC seems to be doing its groundwork before submission of the proposal for final approval.

“The decision to hand over 650 hectares revenue land to the forest department is part of the process. The land will be mutated in the name of forest department. Though there are nistar rights on the said land, these rights will be settled by the forest settlement officer (FSO),” said Dr Kunal Khemnar, Chandrapur district collector.

“The sub-divisional officer (SDO) has already submitted a positive report and we are acting on it,” he added.

In 2014-15, Maharashtra government had issued guidelines favouring procurement of non-forest lands by project proponents near national parks and sanctuaries to ecologically strengthen these protected areas (PAs).

This is for the first time such a decision has been taken. Earlier, user agencies that needed forest land diversion in Vidarbha region used to procure land in Western Maharashtra.

TATR officials, who did not want to be named, said, “The 650-hectare land BMC has procured is in Chimur range and is contiguous to Tadoba’s buffer zone from Kolara side. Another 50-hectare will be bought from private parties.”

Last year, BMC procured 19.50 hectare private land near Kolara in two patches in lieu of the forest land being diverted for an underground tunnel through Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), Borivli, for Goregaon-Mulund Link Road.

BMC’s move to procure non-forest land near Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) will boost tiger habitat and virtually means expansion of Tadoba, where big cats are crying for space. According to Wildlife Institute of India (WII), there are 88 tigers in Tadoba and its landscape.

“The same patches of land procured by the BMC will be notified as reserve forest and can be declared notified as conservation reserves in future,” a top wildlife wing official said.

Conservation reserves are government-owned land where conservation efforts are taken up by local community only. Conservation reserves, covered under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, are usually found around protected area networks like national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.

Even as BMC is expediting the Gargai project, greens view it differently. “There are huge encroachments inside Tansa and no wildlife. Locals even use dynamites to kill fish. The BMC should focus on water reclamation instead of submerging the sanctuary by the dam project,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust (CAT).

Alappuzha: The construction of Alappuzha Bypass , which was stalled after the Southern Railways recommended some structural changes, will be further delayed as the public works department whave to get the railway’s permission to halt train movements when the construction is under progress.

“The railways has given the permission for setting up five girders of the rail over bridges (RoB) at Malikamukku. Now, we have to send an application requesting them to halt trains when the construction is underway. In our application, we will specify the time when the movement of trains need to be stopped. If our application is accepted, we will resume work,” officials of the Public Works Department (National Highway) said.

Two RoBs need to be set up at Malikamukku and Kuthirapanthy to open Alappuzha bypass for traffic. The construction work of the bypass was put on hold after contractors had not received permission from the railways for installing girders of the RoB.

On Saturday, public works minister G Sudhakaran announced that the railways has given permission to install girders of Malikamukku RoB.

Following this, the PWD is planning to move railways seeking permission to halt trains at the time of construction.

Earlier, railways officials had inspected the girders brought for the construction of the RoBs and had recommended structural changes and denied permission for starting the work.

Sudhakaran in a press note said changes were made in the girders as per the direction of the railway authorities.

“The officials also conducted a second inspection of the girders. After that they gave permission to place five girders at Malikamukku. Necessary changes are also being made on five girders of the second RoB at Kuthirapanthy. After completing those work, the railway authorities will visit those girders as well, ” the minister said in the press note.

The minister has also written to Union railways minister Piyush Goyal urging him to initiate steps to conduct the inspection of remaining girders at the earliest.

Published by Bloomsbury India, the book has already made it to the list of the top 50 books on e-commerce websites. The stories in the officer’s debut book offer a realistic portrayal of everyday policing as well as how criminals, victims and complainants influence the life of a police officer and vice-versa.

Explaining that penning a non-fictional book in this format would have been controversial, the officer told TOI, “While balancing work and personal life, it took four years for me to pen the book. The stories in the book, which is a fictional one, depicts not only the seedy underbelly of our society but also tries to portray the motives of people around us.”

Confirming that the stories in the book are the result of his experience over the years, the officer said that all the characters in the stories — be it the grandmother who finds a dead body in her house or the farmer whose crops are burnt down or even a petty thief — have layers to their personalities in which truth and fiction can barely be discerned.

Each story portrays various shades of human behaviour — guilt, rage, love, greed, vengeance and fear — and offers many versions of the truth,” said Roushan, who has won several awards, including the Union Home Minister’s Medal for Excellence in Investigation, the FICCI Award for Smart Policing. The officer already has several Hindi poems to his credit which have been published in different magazines.

The book comprises different short stories yet they are interconnected in different ways. There are various layers to stories, some overt and some covert..

312,['13/01/2020'],"Blame game raises stink: Corporations say starved of funds, government claims corruption behind mess","EDMC

NEW DELHI: It is difficult to ascertain the last time the lanes of east Delhi’s Ganesh Nagar were swept properly. The locals despair of any improvement.By promising a ‘Shining clean Delhi with improved sanitation’ if it is elected for a successive term, the Aam Aadmi Party has now shifted attention to the functioning of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, whose primary responsibility it is to keep the localities clean. But sanitation is such a problem that BJP, which is in a majority in all three municipal corporations of Delhi, admits to a management mess — a fact validated by the poor rankings of the city’s civic bodies in the annual Swachhta rankings. The party, however, chooses to blame the state government, saying its stingy financial grants affect proper sanitation services.In the past five years, the garbage management infrastructure has seen major mechanisation and several waste processing plants have come up. Yet, for the most part, it is a story of an unending struggle. The capital is only able to process 55% of the 10,500 tonnes of garbage generated every day, as admitted in the Supreme Court by the Delhi chief secretary. While the mayors and the Union urban affairs minister have blamed paucity of funds for the sanitation crisis in the city, Delhi Government has attributed it to the “inefficiency” of the municipalities.In particular, the underbelly suffers. Jogeshwar Yadav, a resident of Bhumiheen Camp, a JJ colony in south Delhi, said that while water and electricity had improved in recent years, there was no end to their woes about their surroundings. “Open drains flow by our houses, and they are choked and stinky,” said Yadav. All the houses in cramped lanes there dump their domestic waste on Ravidas Marg, where at least cows get rid of the green garbage.The garbage removers of the non-bovine kind, though, have to fight for their salaries. There were 15 strikes by sanitation workers in the north and east corporations in the past five years. Prime Minister Narendra Modi chose to launch the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan from Valmiki Mandir on Panchkuian Road, but according to workers’ unions, this signified little because over 80,000 sanitation workers of Delhi are the most neglected of the work force. Rajendra Mewati, general secretary, United Front of MCD Employees, said that even if a fraction of money used on the Swachh Bharat campaign had been demarcated for the welfare of sanitation workers, things would have been happier.Vikaspuri resident Ajay Gupta grumbled, “The civic bodies claim to have hired private concessionaires to collect, segregate, compress and transport municipal waste, but people, whether in unauthorised or regularised colonies, continue to face problems due to erratic garbage collection.” In SDMC’s recent House meeting, the councillors too complained about missing silt vehicles and not enough tippers to collect garbage. “What is the point of investing so much money on machinery for processing or compressing waste when the civic body is unable to manage regular collection of waste?” asked Narendra Kumar, AAP councillor from Manglapuri ward. “We took over Dwarka and other DDA areas without increasing the strength of sanitation staff. In fact, the employed list continues to bear names of those who have died or retired.”Around half the garbage generated daily goes to the three waste-to-energy plants and the rest end up at the landfills. The three landfills at Okhla, Bhalswa and Ghazipur are at danger levels, though some headway has been made in reducing them through bioremediation. Mohammad Anwar, who lives in Bhalswa Dairy, is an exasperated man. “Not only isn’t our garbage removed regularly, but we also cope with the pollution created by landfill fires and the contaminated groundwater,” Anwar remarked.Sandeep Kapoor, EDMC standing committee chairman, assured, like officials in all the corporations, of a commitment to clean roads and garbage dumps (dhalaos) at least once a day. “Despite the finance crunch, we have looked at alternative arrangements,” Kapoor said. For its part, Delhi government has consistently claimed to have released the requisite funds to the corporation. It recently cited the CAG audit reports to underscore this point.According to residents in nine zones under the north and south corporations, the initiative to engage concessionaires for door-to-door collection of garbage is not a long-term solution, particularly because the collector only segregates stuff that can generate income for him, such as plastic, sending the rest to the landfill. Deepak Sood, a resident of IP Extension in east Delhi, pointed out, “Community bins too are in a mess and little attention is paid to clean the drain in the area. The dhalao near Mother Dairy on Narwana Road is often overflowing with garbage and attracts stray animals in large numbers.”Kamaljeet Sehrawat, leader of the House, SDMC, said the community needs to change habits for the desired results. “We have observed people leaving garbage on roadsides after the collectors have left the area. If we had more funds, we could have handled this,” she said. Clearly, garbage is a big problem. And voters will certainly remember this when their fingers presses the EVM button on February 8.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220044,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-143755,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/blame-game-raises-stink-corpns-say-starved-of-funds-govt-claims-corruption-behind-mess/articleshow/73219521.cms

Nashik: Road safety is currently in focus in the city, While the city police inaugurated the Road Safety Week on Saturday, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) too is set to begin the district-level Road Safety Week from Monday.

The authorities are especially stressing on spreading awareness on the use of helmets among bikers. In 2019, of the 98 bikers who lost their lives in road accidents , 81 were found to be riding without any safety headgear.

Over the past few years, the police have taken various steps to encourage the use of safety headgears among two-wheeler riders. While awareness was spread through various programmes, things improved only when the city police started cracking down on helmetless riding last year.

According to data available with the traffic branch of the city police, 21,392 bikers were fined for not wearing a helmet in 2018. However, the number of such violations in 2019 increased to 31,697. The continuous action by police became evident in the fact that currently, more than 90% of two-wheeler riders are seen wearing helmets in the city.

Senior traffic officials said this also led to a drop in the number of bikers dying in road accidents. In 2018, 126 bikers had died and of them, 112 were not wearing helmets. Last year, the number of biker fatalities dropped to 98 — 81 of them helmetless riders.

The police said their aim is to ensure that no motorist died due to lack of safety gear, including helmets (for two-wheeler riders) and seat-belts (for other motorists).

In 2019, there were 169 fatal accidents in the city which claimed 177 lives. This includes 98 bikers, 15 car drivers or passengers and 42 pedestrians. Moreover, 385 people suffered grievous injuries and 155 escaped with minor injuries.

To bring down the number of road fatalities in the city, the police visit every accident spot to check the cause of the accident. If there is some infrastructure-related issue, the cops note it down and inform to their senior officers. Subsequently, the police write to the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to take up infrastructural works like putting up road signals or blinkers, signboards, speed breakers etc.

With the continuous action, road accidents in the city came down to 177 in 2019 from 217 in 2018.

MOHALI: Taking a step forward for better care of animals, the Chhatbir zoo management has installed closed circuit televisions (CCTVs) to monitor the condition of animals in enclosures.Previously, the zoo authorities would monitor only the new-born animals, but now every enclosure has been fitted with a CCTV, said zoo field director M Sudhagar.

Nagpur: Guardian minister Nitin Raut plans to develop the city by taking the BJP leaders of the city along with him. His priority is development of the city, not settling political scores. On Saturday, Raut interacted with staffers of TOI-MT and spoke about his plans for the city’s development.

Excerpts...

Environmentalists are opposing setting up of new 660MW units in Koradi. As energy minister what is your stance?

I fully respect the sentiments of environmentalists. However, we have to take the other aspects into consideration. This district does not have many job opportunities and the two units can provide employment to 4,000-5,000 people. Moreover, the units are zero environment load units. So I feel the project should not be scrapped. Mahagenco has floated a tender for flue gas desulphurizers (FGDs). They will be installed soon. New technologies will be used for the state’s thermal power stations.

What is your priority for the city and district?

The previous government tried to attract industries but was not very successful. I think the city has lot of tourism potential. Most of the tourists who visit India are from South and South-East Asia. They are Buddhists. If we make it attractive for them, they will come here. We have the legacy of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Lord Buddha. By combining ecotourism, Nagpur will become a top tourist destination and provide jobs to thousands of people. Gorewada zoo has not been developed as per expectations. I will try to revive the project. A tunnel will be built on Kalmeshwar Road. I will also try to revive Mihan. I will find out what went wrong with the efforts of other governments and then take new steps. I also plan to start a steel plant in the National Industrial Manufacturing Zone (NIMZ) in Kuhi.

What will you do for the education sector?

When Prithviraj Chavan was the chief minister, he had sanctioned a post graduate medical institute for the city. The Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital off Kamptee Road was to be developed and Rs290 crore had been sanctioned. The institute was to offer 23 PG courses, nursing courses, treatment of sickle cell disease and thalassemia. It was to have a trauma centre and a helipad, too, for emergency cases. Unfortunately, the BJP government did not take it forward. The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has issued a contempt notice against the state government in this regard. I will revive the project.

The local authorities claim that Nagpur is a green city but there is no data. Will you conduct a tree census?

We have not done anything to earn the tag of green city. The last government claimed that it had done a lot of plantation but nothing was done in my area. I will review the plantation work. Tree census will also be conducted. I will try to plant trees in open spaces of the city such as the university and PDKV land. Maharajbagh’s greenery will be conserved.

JICA has sanctioned a loan for rejuvenation of Nag River. The project just needs a nod from the state government.

I know that and I will try to put the project before the state cabinet at the earliest. I want people of Nagpur to be free from pollution of Nag and Pili rivers. These water bodies should have clean water.

The Dr Ambedkar memorial at Yeshwant Stadium is a long pending demand.

Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has prepared a plan and I have reviewed it. I will solve the issues of land lease and user change. Work on the project should begin soon.

Any other priorities?

I will construct a VVIP guesthouse in place of Nag Bhavan. Vasantrao Deshpande Hall premises will also be developed. The mud track at Japanese Garden is the longest in the world. It will be developed.

318,['13/01/2020'],Granules recalls over 2.3 cr Ranitidine tablets from US,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Hyderabad: City-based pharma player Granules India Ltd has initiated a voluntary recall of over 2.3 crore tablets of Ranitidine 150 mg in the US market because of the presence of carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used for making the anti-acidity medicine.

Granules India has recalled the Ranitidine tablets citing “CGMP deviations: impurity NDMA found in API” as the reason for the recall.

The recall, which was initiated on December 13, 2019, and is ongoing, has been classified as `Class II’, the US drug watchdog, US Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) said in the latest enforcement report uploaded on its website.

USFDA classifies a Class II recall as one in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote. In such a recall the firm removes the product from the market or corrects the violation, as per the USFDA website.

Granules had received approval for its abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) for Ranitidine 150mg from the USFDA in mid 2018.

The US drug regulator had, in September 2019, sounded an alert on the presence of NDMA, classified as a probable human carcinogen, in some Ranitidine medicines. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant that is found in water and foods, including meats, dairy products and vegetables.

USFDA had advised companies to recall their Ranitidine products if testing showed levels of NDMA above the acceptable daily intake (96 nanograms per day or 0.32 parts per million).

Since then, several pharma companies including Hyderabad-based players like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma have initiated voluntary recall of Ranitidine from the US market. Ranitidine is an H2 (histamine-2) blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach. Over-the-counter Ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid ingestion and sour stomach. Prescription Ranitidine is approved for multiple indications, including treatment and prevention of ulcers of the stomach and intestines and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

BENGALURU: Locked out of their lifetime’s savings, aggrieved depositors of Sri Guru Raghavendra Sahakara Bank Niyamitha on Sunday were left to make sense of RBI ’s notice capping the withdrawal for account holders at Rs 35,000.

“I wanted to break a part of my fixed deposit in SGSBN and raise a loan for my wife’s surgery. She is facing kidney issues and I don’t know if I will be able to save her life,” said Venkatesh, 62. A retired private company employee, he had put Rs 4 lakh of his retirement benefit in an FD in the co-operative bank .

Most of the bank’s depositors are retired employees and depend on the interest. Planning to spend a peaceful retired life with the Rs 4,000 interest that he was getting on the FD and his pension money, Venkatesh had taken a flat on rent in Kengeri. However, his 58-year-old wife, Devika’s condition deteriorated and doctors advised a surgery to save her life.

Venkatesh said he was to visit the bank on Monday morning, hours before an appointment was scheduled with his wife’s doctors. But late Friday evening, he received the message about RBI capping all withdrawals.

Venkatesh and Devika lost their only 18-year-old child to cancer. “We couldn’t save him though we spent a lot for the treatment. Now, I am left with no option,” he said.

“I had put my father’s and my savings — around Rs 35 lakh — in the bank and was planning to withdraw the amount partially for my son’s higher studies. If banks are not safe, where should we keep our money,” wondered a woman depositor of the co-operative bank.

The cap on withdrawals is for six months but subject to review, according to the central bank.

PMC 2.0?

Started in 1997, the Basavanagudi-headquartered SGSBN has nine branches. The bank is tightlipped about its customers and deposits.

While the management claims it is yet to ascertain why RBI issued such directions citing financial issues, customers said a few bad loans had led to the situation. “We suspect loans were sanctioned to a noted entrepreneur flouting bank rules,” said a customer who didn’t want to be named, drawing parallels with the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank.

Bank officials will hold a meeting with customers at 6pm on Monday at a convention hall in Netkallappa Circle, said an official. Responding to a TOI questionnaire, the bank said all fears will be addressed at Monday’s meeting.

320,['13/01/2020'],CCP exempts government vehicles from pay-parking charges in Panaji,"This story is from January 13, 2020

For four-wheelers the rate will be Rs 20 for the first hour and Rs 15 for every hour beyond that

PANAJI: Government vehicles will be exempted from pay-parking in Panaji once it is implemented.

Nine stretches of roads have been notified for pay-parking in Panaji.

Both two and four-wheelers will be charged the set fee on these stretches for 24 hours on all days. Also, once charged, the fee will be considered valid for the vehicle for any other parking locations within CCP boundaries for that time slot.

Vehicle owners will be issued electronically generated pay-parking tickets. This, Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar, says will accurately record the duration that a vehicle has parked for.

“The pay-parking contractor will not issue manual tickets. Instead, a hand-held device will record the exact time that the vehicle has parked. The device will store all records,” Madkaikar said.

The contract to implement pay-parking has been awarded to Sohan Juwarker at the rate of Rs 1.62 crore for three years.

CCP has given the contractor a time limit of 15 days to paint pay-parking slots on these stretches and affix sign boards. Madkaikar said that as soon as this is completed, CCP will sign the agreement with the contractor and receive the security deposit after which pay-parking will be implemented.

Once it begins, those engaged in collecting parking fees will have to compulsorily wear a uniform and carry photo identity cards bearing unique numbers, issued by the civic body.

The attendant will also carry a certified copy of the rate chart notified to show citizens as and when demanded, Madkaikar said.

The pay-parking slip/ receipt issued to motorists will have to bear the letter head of the civic body and the contact number of the responsible officer of CCP. This is being done to ensure that grievance, if any, are expressed to the authorities concerned.

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Road accident fatalities in Aurangabad city rose by 24% in just one year. In terms of a surge in accident-related fatalities in the state, it is placed second — just behind Satara, which has seen a massive 50% swell since 2018. With 18% rise in accident fatalities, Latur takes the third spot.

Aurangabad and Latur are among a few other cities that have shown an increase in road fatalities, contrary to the state-level trend which has reflected a decline. Significantly, Pune city has improved its safety record in 2019. In comparison to 2018, Pune city had 41% fewer road accident deaths in 2019.

An official report of the state home department, which is out coinciding with the ongoing annual Road Safety drive, reveals that 12,565 individuals lost their lives in road accidents in different parts of Maharashtra in 2019. This is 5% less when compared to 2018. The state, as a whole, had witnessed 32,876 accidents last year, which is around 8% less than 2018.

However, in Aurangabad city, 199 persons were killed in road accidents in 2019. A senior official from the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Aurangabad, said there were no regular road safety committee meetings held. This was one of the reasons for increased deaths in the city.

“The RTO, traffic police and top officials from the PWD and NHAI are part of the road safety committee. The meetings assume significance as they help evaluate the safety issues and suggest solutions,” he said, preferring anonymity.

Aurangabad regional transport officer Satish Sadamate said unofficial entries made by locals — by breaking road-dividers on the Ahmednagar and Jalna Roads — were affecting road safety. “We have proposed that some of these unauthorized entries be regularized, but only after creating the necessary infrastructure, such as Z-lane crossing,” he said.

Aurangabad assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Dinesh Kolhe said the poor condition of roads and lack of infrastructures such as signboards, road-dividers and civil engineering works at chowks had an impact. “We have initiated some measures to ensure proper safety in Waluj and Satara-Deolai areas. Many accidents took place in these areas. The number of road accidents has come down in that past six months and we hope to get more favourable results,” said Kolhe, who has recently taken charge of the traffic department.

On no regular meetings of the road safety committee, authorities pointed finger at the past MP who are the ex-officio heads of these panels.

Shortage of manpower at the traffic cell of the police and RTO is also blamed. “For the vehicular population of 12 lakh, we have only around 340 traffic police personnel. The city has around 152 signals where manning is required with at least a couple of cops,” a senior official said.

The TSRTC has hiked ticket fares by 20% to 30% while a few private bus operators are charging around Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 for bus tickets between Hyderabad and Vijayawada .

The TSRTC Garuda bus ticket from Hyderabad to Vijayawada, which used to be Rs 592 per head has been increased to Rs 876. Sources said that the TSRTC has set a target of earning Rs 6 crore additional revenue this festive season.

Moreover, even though the TSRTC has announced that they will run over 4,000 extra buses for Sankranti, passengers are having to wait for the buses for hours on end. “We wanted to go Eluru so we waited for a bus to Vijayawada. We ended up waiting for about two hours to catch the bus. A bus to Vijayawada from Hyderabad usually takes only about a minute,” said VS Suresh Kumar, a resident of Sanathnagar.

Further, the number of buses being provided are insufficient to meet the demand. Sources allege that private bus operators are creating an artificial shortage. “Many people began booking tickets online much ahead of the festival, but a few operators have purposely kept their websites dysfunctional in order to sell the tickets at high fares,” said a source on condition of anonymity.

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Alleging that BJP-run municipal corporations had become “hotbed” of corruption, Congress on Sunday released a report on alleged deficiencies in the functioning of the three civic bodies.

Calling Delhi’s civic bodies “most corrupt” among 205 municipal corporations of the country, Delhi Congress chief Subash Chopra alleged that the BJP-led dispensation did not table the Comptroller of Auditor General (CAG) report to hide its corruption.

“The extent of corruption in the MCDs is evident from the fact that the CAG report has not yet been tabled in the three Houses. The CAG report has pointed to corruption of over Rs 5,000 crore in house tax, building department and disbursement of pensions,” Chopra alleged, demanding a CBI probe into the functioning of the three civic bodies.

The leader of the opposition in south, north and east corporations — Abhishek Dutt, Mukesh Goel and Rinku — also alleged that of 1,472 deficiencies found in civic bodies, internal audit was done only in 77 cases in which a Rs 33 lakh corruption had been detected. “If internal audit had been done in all 1,472 cases, corruption of Rs 2,000 crore would have been unearthed,” Dutt alleged.

South Delhi Municipal Corporation leader of the house, Kamlajeet Sehrawat, denied the allegations. “We never promoted any corruption and always worked in a fair and impartial manner. With limited budget and least support from Delhi government, we tried to provide maximum benefits to people living in our areas. As far as an internal audit report is concerned, we dropped a few cases, which were pending for decades, after thorough investigation and in compliance of all norms. The issue was even discussed in the standing committee and house meetings. But a few people are trying to unnecessarily politicise the matter,” she said, adding some points raised in internal audits were either in purview of Delhi government or pending in court.

Mohali: A brick kiln near Mohali’s only seven-star resort was allegedly levelled illegally by a resident of Majra village in December, following which police have registered a case against a local and his accomplices.

Majra is located right next to the Punjab government’s ambitious New Chandigarh project and property prices here have risen manifold over the past five years. Chandigarh resident and brick kiln owner Sukhsehaj Singh, in his complaint on December 23, alleged that Majra village resident Hari Singh trespassed into his property on December 22 and used a JCB machine to destroy his brick kiln to take possession of his land illegally.

In his statement to the police, Sukhsehaj alleged a threat to his life and business. He claimed that he and his father Pritam Singh’s firm, Majra Brick Manufacturing Company, had been in possession of the property since 1981 and Hari did not take any sanction from a court or competent authority for razing the brick kiln.

Hari has been charged with Sections 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of Rs 50 or more), 447 (criminal trespass), 506 (criminal intimidation), 511 (attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life) and 34 (criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code in the first information report (FIR) registered at Mullanpur police station on December 29.

The police are yet to make any arrest in the case.

When contacted, Hari's son, Swaran Singh, claimed that his father bought a part of the land on which the kiln was located in 1984 and extended the lease of land given to the brick kiln owner. However, Sukhsehaj refuted the claim and said his firm had been in possession of the property since 1981 and it had never signed any land agreement with Hari.

Sukhsehaj has demanded that he be compensated for the damage caused to his property. “Because of Hari’s actions, the foundation of my brick kiln’s chimney has weakened and it could fall on the road which passes it any time,” he alleged.

When contacted, Mullanpur police station SHO Harmanpreet Singh Cheema said they were going through revenue records. “We will detain the accused if the need be. Investigations are still underway,” he said. The police were yet to act on Hari’s claims.

Not 1st instance of lawlessness

This is not the first time that an instance of lawlessness has been reported from Mullanpur area of SAS Nagar. In October 2018, TOI had reported how illegal mining was being carried out through the night in Majra and neighbouring villages, helping bring into focus the illicit practice in rural Punjab. Before this, TOI had reported how the land mafia had flattened an entire hillock in the neighbouring Nada village of SAS Nagar district in violation of land and forest laws

329,['13/01/2020'],Four-laning of road in the pipeline,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Aurangabad: Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari has promised that the road between Aurangabad and Shirdi would soon be four-laned.

He made this announcement on Sunday while speaking at the concluding ceremony of Advantage Maharashtra Expo 2020, where he was the chief guest.

Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel, who also attended the event, had raised the demand for improved road connectivity to Shirdi.

“Once the ongoing road projects in and around Aurangabad wrap up, the four-laning project will be taken up,” said Gadkari.

In November last year, Jaleel had raised the demand for constructing a super-expressway connecting Aurangabad with Shirdi before Parliament. He had also formally raised the demand with Gadkari, highlighting that a large number of devotees, even from the southern parts of India and abroad, went to Shirdi via Aurangabad by road.

Although the distance between Aurangabad and Shirdi is just over 100km, it takes a long time to reach Shirdi due to bad roads.

The announcement of four-laning was cheered by the tourism sector as the improved road connectivity is expected to increase the number of tourists in the Aurangabad, Shirdi and Ajanta-Ellora circuit.

Jaswant Singh, the president of the Tourism Promoters’ Guild, said, “The four-laning of the road will definitely give an edge to local pilgrimage and tourism in both the cities. The air-connectivity in both Aurangabad and Shirdi is also gradually improving, which is likely to increase the tourist footfall.”

Gadkari also chaired a special meeting with NHAI and other government officials to review the progress of different road works being carried out in and around Aurangabad. He promised speedy completion of the road work between Aurangabad and the world heritage site of Ajanta Caves.

Plan to get water to

Marathwada ready

A plan to bring water from Tapi, Damanganga and Pinjar rivers to Marathwada through Ahmednagar and Nashik districts is ready and will help end the water woes here, Gadkari said on Sunday. “A plan is ready. Signatures of the Gujarat and Maharashtra CMs are remaining,” he said.

Chandigarh: Having resentment over the municipal corporation and the UT administration for not taking the residents welfare associations (RWAs) in confidence before taking decisions, members of Chandigarh Residents’ Associations Welfare Federation (Crawfed) urged the administration to consult RWAs before imposing new taxes.

The members said Crawfed and RWAs were kept in the dark by the UT administration and the MC while deciding imposition of new taxes or tariff hike.

The members demanded that Crawfed or RWA representative must be nominated as councillor in the Chandigarh municipal corporation to raise public voice effectively.

Hitesh Puri, chairman, Crawfed, said the proposed enhancement of water tariff and property tax should not be implemented in one go, rather any future increase in cess or taxes should be consulted with residents or RWAs or the federation before implementation.

He said proper and effective sterilisation of stray dogs should be done and this issue would be on priority.

Puri said, “The city is home to either retired officers, senior citizens or salary-class people. Imposing new taxes is like putting extra burden on senior citizens and salaried class. We are being forced to shell out more from our pockets in the form of new taxes. We demand that equivalent amenities must be provided by the administration. We must not be comparted with Punjab and Haryana as they are states and have separate legislature, but here we have MP and she is already overburdened with work. Property tax, electricity and water tariff must not be compared with the neighboring states of Punjab and Haryana as they have independent governments, but Chandigarh is governed by the Centre.”

Rajat Malhotra, general secretary, Crawfed, spoke on new garbage collection rates.

He said, “The MC should take into confidence representatives of RWAs before finalising any hike in garbage rates. The residents are already paying a good amount for the same and there is no need to enhance it.”

HYDERABAD: Former minister and national disaster management authority ex-vice chairman Marri Shashidhar Reddy on Sunday urged chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to not allow Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy to increase the capacity of Pothireddypadu head regulator from 40,000 to 80,000 cusecs and divert more water to AP.

Referring to AP chief minister YS Jaganmohan’s proposal to double the water intake from Pothireddypadu head regulator, Shashidhar said that the farmers of south Telangana districts would be adversely affected if the AP CM has his way. “Why is KCR silent on this issue. KCR should raise the issue during his proposed meeting with Jagan on Monday and assure people of Telangana that the interests of Telangana would be protected,” Shashidhar Reddy said at a media conference.

He urged KCR to disclose to the Telangana people the present status of Pothireddypadu head regulator and the quantity of water that has been drawn ever since the works were completed.

“When the then-CM YS Rajasekhar Reddy proposed to increase the capacity of Pothireddypadu head regulator in 2004, Late P Janardhan Reddy and I had fought with our own Congress government to safeguard the interests of Telangana,” he said.

New Delhi: “It is nothing less than a festival when political leaders come asking for votes. They make tall claims but sadly, every time we convince ourselves to believe them we find ourselves being let down,” said Asha Khanna, a resident of D Block in Tagore Garden. Indeed, when you look around, we see why the people grumble. Debris from construction sites is carelessly dumped around, there is garbage in public view and the resident swear the sewerage is no good either.Khyala can be seen as emblematic of this neglect. It has for long been a blot on the Rajouri Garden assembly constituency. Yet despite promises for improvement made by political parties at every poll , no tangible changes have come in the area.Tagore Garden’s Khanna added, “We are suffering, to say the least. The only good thing that has happened is that our water and electricity bills have gone down to zero.” So even with the skewed development, the voters believe that the Aam Aadmi Party is best placed to bring about changes if re-elected. But BJP is not a write-off and will probably put up a tough fight in many prominent areas in the constituency.The Rajouri Garden constituency has rural and urban voters ranging from different economic classes. Dominated by a Sikh populace, the concerns of the people, however, are common: poor road infrastructure and abysmal sanitation, both of which the political contenders had claimed to better during the last election campaign but in vain.In the 2015 assembly polls, AAP’s Jarnail Singh got 54,916 votes to forge ahead of Shiromani Akali Dal’s Majinder Singh Sirsa (44,880) contesting as a BJP candidate. Congress candidate, Meenakshi Chandela, was third with 14,167 votes. However, since 2017, after Singh resigned to contest in the Punjab assembly elections, necessitating a bypoll, Sirsa has been the sitting MLA.Fear looms over the streets in the constituency. “We do not feel safe here. Whether it 8 in the morning or 8 at night, I cannot step out of my house without being apprehensive about cat-calls or harassment,” said Vandana Singhal, who lives in J Block at Vishnu Garden. “There is a need for more CCTV cameras. Police patrolling also has to increase so that women can at least step out of their houses without this constant worry.”This foreboding also bothered Ranjana Sharma of T Block, Rajouri Garden. She said that the reduced electricity and water bills do not make much of a difference to her and her family, but the fear of walking outdoor without the company of a male is a burden. “If this major problem is solved, any party that makes such a difference will get voted again and again,” asserted Sharma.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73227221,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-663010,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/safety-is-prime-concern-in-wild-west-in-this-election/articleshow/73219548.cms

Chandigarh: Irked over the negligent attitude of the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) and the UT administration for delaying in notifying policy for need-based changes, the Chandigarh Residents’ Associations Welfare Federation (Crawfed) assured members that they were making efforts for one-time settlement with the UT for construction violations in need-based changes made by residents.

Crawfed chairman Hitesh Puri, while addressing representatives of more than 83 RWAs across the city, said talks were on with the CHB to work out modalities for one-time settlement over need-based changes made by residents.

Puri, while advising the RWAs, said, “We advise that residents must not make any constructions in their houses till the UT administration notifies policy for need-based changes. We are making efforts to go in for one-time settlement with the CHB for residents who have made need-based changes in their flats or houses so that they don’t face any notices from the CHB.”

He also took up the issue of regularisation of need-based changes in CHB flats. He said in a recent meeting with the member of parliament Kirron Kher, he was hopeful that something positive might come up for the long pending demand of regularisation of need-based changes.

He appealed the residents to not make any new construction in their dwelling units as on one hand it would attract demolition or cancellation of dwelling unit, and on other, it would be difficult for any political solution to the problem. Dr Anish Garg, chief spokesperson, Crawfed, said strict action was needed on people who were into begging in the name of religion. There were people who collected clothes in name of Pingalwara and other such sects. He said CCTVs should be made mandatory in the new registry or any new construction or commercial property.

PANAJI: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Sunday urged party workers to prepare themselves for the zilla panchayat, municipal council and assembly elections.

He also asked party workers to set a target of winning 30 seats at the next assembly election in 2022. While the ZP polls are scheduled this March, municipal council polls will be in 2021.

Sawant told karyakartas in Panaji that the people have seen the rise and fall of BJP. He said that from four MLAs, the party reached 10 MLAs, from there, 17 MLAs, then 14 MLAs, then 21 MLAs, and then again 13 MLAs.

“We always say that even after having 13 MLAs, we formed the government and were able to increase the number from 13 to 27,” he said. He said that they were able to form the government with 13 MLAs only because Manohar Parrikar was with them.

Sawant said that now, the responsibility lies on each and every karyakarta to win the next election. “We have to win both the zilla panchayat elections,” Sawant said, adding that the party now has to work with new state president Sadanand Tanavade to achieve the target.

Sawant also said that these will be the first elections for which former CM Manohar Parrikar will be absent.

“We have seen Parrikar as a leader, and he became chief minister,” he said. “We have also seen former CM Laxmikant Parsekar , Ayush minister Shripad Naik, Rajendra Arlekar and Satish Dhond as leaders.” Sawant said that even a second-generation karyakarta like himself has become chief minister, and this is what BJP is known for.

HYDERABAD: With scarce knowledge of multiple myeloma , a type of blood cancer that affects the bones, most of the cases reaching tertiary care centres are in the advanced stage, in which complications like kidney failure set in and bone marrow function gets completely affected.

Experts at a three-day conference —Indian Myeloma Congress 2020— at Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) that concluded on Sunday pointed out the need to spread awareness among family physicians over the disease for better treatment outcomes. They said that multiple myeloma is often misdiagnosed because of its symptoms which can be easily confused with other health complications, and patients end up seeing general physicians, nephrologists and even haematologists.

“Since the cancer cells accumulate in the bone marrow, the hematogical function is impaired, which results in low haemoglobin (anaemia), pain in bones, extreme weakness and kidney failure. As patients usually report these symptoms to general physicians, many cases go undiagnosed until it’s in advanced stage,” said Dr Sadashivudu Gundeti, head of department, Oncology, NIMS and organising secretary of the conference.

Among the latest procedures available across the globe, India currently does not have CAR T-cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy in which the stem cells from the patient are altered and returned to the patient. “The cells then go and attack the cancer cells. The method may take a year or two to be developed in the country,” added Dr Gundeti.

During the conference, it was also announced that NIMS, which sees 80 to 100 new patients each year, would extend free bone marrow transplant to poor patients.

CHANDIGARH: The UT-administration is all set to move non-starter crucial engineering works worth more than Rs 200 crore to the next financial year. Projects worth Rs 115 crore out of this are stuck in legal tussle with private contractors and the remaining worth more than Rs 85 crore in tender technicalities.

The battle with contractors continues in the Punjab and Haryana high court, while they must meet technical parameters to win the contracts. The next hearing is scheduled this month but sources in the engineering department said even in case of an early decision, it will take another two months to complete the paperwork and allotment process, by which time the next financial year would have started with April.

These crucial works include building a regional Sports Injury Centre in Sector 32 for about Rs 22 crore and 144 police houses at Dhanas village for Rs 32 crore. Then there is lighting up of bicycle tracks for Rs 14 crore, besides the construction of hostel blocks in the Sector-46 Government College (Rs 16 crore) and Sector-12 Punjab Engineering College (Rs 32 crore).

A senior official of the Chandigarh administration said: “Besides the work halted due to litigation, the engineering department is also unable to allot work worth more than Rs 85 crore, as the norms and parameters of allotment are the same. If we jump the gun, even these works might get stuck in court. The bidders must fulfil technical, financial, and safety conditions. The engineering department doesn’t want to take any risk by initiating the tender process. Despite litigation, we have managed to spend about 70% of the department’s budget. Major projects require hectic paperwork and thinking.”

All UT wings have submitted expenditure report to the finance department to help it make budget recommendations to the Centre for the next financial year. Based on these reports, the UT administration has started the next budget planning.

341,['13/01/2020'],Survey to identify missed out beneficiaries under Bhagyalakshmi bonds,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Bhagyalakshmi bond scheme

Mangaluru: The department of women and child development is keen to ensure that gaps that arose in the implementation of Bhagyalakshmi bond scheme between 2013 to 2017 are filled . This was one of the flagship schemes that the BJP government in the state under B S Yediyurappa implemented. Under this, fixed deposit would be made in the name of girl children from below poverty line (BPL) families and these girls would receive Rs 1,00,097 each when they turn 18.

While the government kept Rs 19,350 as FD in the name of first girl child in a family, this was Rs 18,350 for the second girl child and the maturity amount was the same. Expressing concerns at the gap that arose in implementation of the scheme during above years, minister for women and child welfare Shasikala Jolle has since directed the department officials to carry out a survey to find out the number of girl children who have missed out on its benefits.

The gaps arose because families of these girl children did not have a BPL card for various reasons, the minister said. The move by department to relax age for enrolling name of a beneficiary girl child from one to two years also created some gaps. Earlier, the parents of a BPL card holding family had to register the name of their girl child within the first year of the birth of the child and this was subsequently relaxed to two years, the minister said.

Usman A, deputy director, department of women and child welfare, Dakshina Kannada district told TOI that the child development project officers in the respective taluks of the district will carry out the survey once the department issues a formal order to this effect. Scheme is limited to two girl children in a BPL family, he said, adding issues cropped up since BPL card was the sole identification document for the department to dispense the bonds.

The above move, the minister hinted, will be one-time settlement to ensure social justice to girl children from BPL families who missed out from its benefits due to a technicality. Pointing to the same at a department review meeting here on Thursday, Shashikala said she will flag this issue with the state cabinet and ensure that the beneficiaries get their due. The survey process will be taken up in the state once the cabinet approves it, she pointed.

343,['13/01/2020'],Bengaluru airport’s walk-in aviary to have 40 species,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Bengaluru airport

BENGALURU: Most airports tend to fend off birds to avoid accidents, but Kempegowda International Airport has decided to develop an aviary at its upcoming Terminal 2.

Spread over 1.5 acres, it will house over 40 species of birds, many of them exotic. The walk-in aviary is proposed to be located just after the terminal security-check area. It will be designed in such a way that it’ll be accessible to departing international and domestic passengers from all four levels/floors at the terminal. The design has been submitted and approvals are pending, said the agency in charge of designing the aviary.

The design entails vertical pavilions that will be constructed with staircases and lift for easy access to the aviary. “Designing an aviary in the airport is a challenge. On the one hand, we have to ensure birds do not pose a threat to aircraft and on the other, we’ve to shield them from sound and light pollution. So, we have included hiding spaces for birds to help them avoid pollution. To keep them far away from the runway, we have proposed a wire mesh to cover the top of the aviary,” said the designers.

It, however, may not be part of the first phase of Terminal 2. “Authorities are currently focused on finishing construction and kicking off first phase of operations. Approvals for the aviary are still pending. Work on setting it up may start only in the next phase,” said a source involved in the project.

Bangalore International Airport Limited (BIAL) currently studies and tracks 153 species of birds that fall within a 13-kilometre radius of the airport. This includes studying their patterns, movements, body mass and wing spans to assess risk.

Macaws, parakeets, cockatoos, flamingos and pelicans are some some of the species that passengers may be able to spot at the aviary.

Chandigarh: Police claimed to have busted a gang of robbers and solved two cases, with the arrest of four persons on Saturday.

The accused are Ravi (21), and Deepak (21), both residents of Ram Darbar, and Anil and Rohit, both from Sector 25.

Police said the accused admitted to robbing one Dhirender Ray of Dhanas at gunpoint in January 2019. Ray had reported that a Tata Indica car had stopped near him and three people alighted. One of them pointed a country-made pistol at him and snatched Rs 5,000 and a mobile phone from him and sped away, he had alleged. On December 30, 2019, the accused broke into a milk booth in Sector 41 and stole cash and 64 kg desi ghee.

Police claimed to have recovered the snatched mobile phone and stolen pouches of ghee from them.

Police said Ravi is a habitual criminal and booked in six cases of kidnapping, snatching, burglary and theft at sectors 11, 31 and Industrial Area, Phase I, police stations. Deepak was involved in a case of dacoity, while Anil in two cases of snatching and robbery, police said.

Police said the four accused are drug addicts and committed crime to fulfil their habit. Police expect more cases of robbery would be worked out with interrogation. A court on Sunday remanded the four in two-day police custody.

DJB vice-chairman Dinesh Mohaniya (ANI photo)

NEW DELHI: High ammonia levels due to industrial waste being discharged in Yamuna by Haryana has affected the city’s water supply by 100 million gallons per day (MGD), Delhi Jal Board (DJB) has alleged.

DJB vice-chairman Dinesh Mohaniya said because of the high level of ammonia, the production of water in Delhi had decreased by 100 MGD.

“Water comes to Delhi from other states and Haryana is the largest source. Since the announcement of elections, the amount of ammonia in the water coming from Haryana has increased a lot. This has affected water supply in many parts of Delhi. As Haryana is ruled by BJP, these developments during the elections seem to be a political conspiracy,” Mohaniya alleged.

Mohaniya added, “The level of ammonia steadily increased from 1.2ppm on Wednesday to 1.8ppm on Thursday and 2.7ppm on Friday. One of the major reasons behind the frequent complaints of dirty water in Delhi is the supply of contaminated water mixed with waste, sewage and filth from Panipat Industrial Area.”

Delhi BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said that industrial waste is being released in Yamuna by factories in the capital. “Arvind Kejriwal and DJB are trying to mislead residents. Delhi government has done nothing to clean Yamuna. The AAP government should stop levelling frivolous allegations against BJP,” he added.

The two water treatment plants at Chandrawal and Wazirabad are currently running at half their capacity. “Because water is not being produced at optimum capacity, DJB has not been able to supply it to some areas in central and south Delhi,” Mohaniya said.

DJB has the capacity to treat up to 0.9ppm of ammonia levels in raw water. However, neutralisation of ammonia with chlorine gas on a regular basis at such high levels leads to creation of toxic byproducts. This should be avoided for human consumption.

Chandigarh: Panjab University (PU) should set up a separate helpline number to register sexual harassment complaints instead of depending on the centralised toll free number, PUCASH has demanded.

In a recent senate meeting, Dr Ameer Sultana, convener, PUCASH, raised two issues — proper place for PUCASH office and setting up a of separate helpline number for students to lodge their complaints.

Sources said although the university has allocated space in Guru Teg Bahadur Bhavan to PUCASH, it is yet to be handed over to the committee.

Officials said there was a practice that the person appointed as PUCASH chairman used to operate from her department only. Last year, the demand was made that committee be given space elsewhere so that any student can walk in freely and secrecy maintained. A PUCASH member had suggested that the office should be located at Student Centre as DSW and student council office are in the area.

Rajat Sandhir, member of PUCASH, said that the committee office should be at central place which every student can access. He said they would take up the matter of their contact number being mentioned on the official website of PU.

Dr Sultana said the university should include the names of PUCASH members with their contact number in the handbook of information. She said assurances were given that the rooms would be ready for them.

Interestingly, one of the members of PUCASH was clueless about the fact that there is a centralised toll free number for students. Officials said PU set up the toll-free number (1800-111-656) following a circular issued by the UGC on October 25, 2019, requesting all higher educational institutions to do so but the students were not much aware about it.

Shankarji Jha, DUI, PU, said the anti-ragging helpline number can be use to made sexual harassment complaints. He said they have no plans to set up helpline for sexual harrassment cases of campus. He said the authorities are working to strengthen the PUCASH for students and professors.

NEW DELHI: Light rain is expected on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday in the city. According to a Met official, two successive western disturbances will hit North-West India in the coming days.

“The first western disturbance (WD) will show its effect in Delhi-NCR on Monday with light rain and wind speed of around 20 km per hour. The second WD will show its impact between Wednesday and Friday. Very light rain or drizzle is expected towards Wednesday night. Light or moderate rain would occur on Thursday while very light rain or drizzle is expected on Friday in the forenoon,” the official said.

Track the pollution level in your city

Due to change in the wind direction from North-Westerly to South-Westerly and cloud cover, minimum temperature will rise by 4 degrees by Friday, which is 3 notches above normal. Maximum temperature will be nearly 22 degrees Celsius on Monday, which may dip to nearly 17 degrees Celsius between Tuesday and Saturday — slightly less than normal, the official said.

On Sunday, the minimum temperature was 7.1 degrees Celsius, normal for this time of the year, while the maximum was 23.4 degrees Celsius, 3 notches above normal.

On Monday, partly cloudy sky is expected along with moderate fog in the morning.

“Very light rain or thundershower might occur towards afternoon or evening. Strong surface winds with a speed of around 20 km per hour are also expected. The maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 23 and 9 degrees Celsius, respectively.”

Delhi’s air quality deteriorated to ‘very poor’ on Sunday, with an overall AQI of 348,fouler than Saturday’s ‘poor’ AQI of 288, according to the CPCB’s index.

An AQI between 0-50 is considered ‘good’, 51-100 ‘satisfactory’, 101-200 ‘moderate’, between 201 and 300 is classified as ‘poor’, between 301 and 400 is classified as ‘very poor’ and between 401 and 500 is ‘severe’ on CPCB’s index.

According to SAFAR, marginal deterioration in air quality is forecast for Monday.

“Under the influence of the approaching western disturbance, isolated rainfall and increased wind speed are forecast for Monday night. On Tuesday, the AQI likely to improve towards the poor category and is likely to stay the same the next day, too,” a SAFAR report stated.

According to Met, lack of surface winds and change in wind direction has led to the air fouling up in the city. “The surface wind speed on Sunday was 6-8 km per hour compared to Saturday’s 12-15 km per hour. The change in wind direction from North-Westerly to South-Westerly also impacted the air quality,” a Met official said.

The schools will begin draw of lots. As per the common admission schedule, by January 16, all schools must display the list of eligible candidates on their websites as well as notice boards.

The first phase of the entry-level admission ended on December 16 which was the last day for parents to submit the registration forms for admission to entry-level classes in Chandigarh schools.

TOI had reported that almost every top school had received three times more forms than the seats available, which was driving worried parents to apply in more schools.

For instance, Bhavan Vidyalaya School, Sector 33, had received approximately 1,811 forms for 40 seats for general category in pre-nursery. St Kabir School, Sector 26, received more than 1,400 forms for 90 seats in Nursery class. Delhi Public School in Sector 40 got more than 850 forms for 113 seats for general public.

Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School received 1,085 forms for 160 seats.

After seeing long queues in schools for form submission, many parents decided to fill forms in multiple schools to be on a safer side.

Parents have also been a worried lot because schools have announced that some seats will be reserved for various categories like siblings, management, alumni and staff.

However, except a few schools, none of the schools have made it clear that what percentage of seats will be reserved and how many will be open for general public.

PUNE: The Railway Protection Force (RPF) is in the process of introducing woman escort staffers on long-distance trains.

The aim is to create a sense of security and safety among women travelling in trains, RPF officials said. RPF staffers are currently escorting 26 trains, besides six suburban locals between Pune and Lonavla, on a daily basis.

“RPF’s woman staffers are escorting the ‘ladies’ coaches during the peak hours between Pune and Lonavla. The administration is in the process to introduce them on the long-distance trains too,” Pune’s divisional security commissioner Arun Tripathi said.

Close to 180 trains — local, suburban and mail/express — originate from the Pune division every day. An RPF officer said its current strength of woman staffers in Pune was around 30.

“Their number has to increase if they have to escort the long-distance trains. However, the central authorities have to approve the increased strength,” the officer said.

“Plans are afoot to provide the woman escort services on long-distance trains such as the Pune-Patna Express. There is also a plan to have CCTV cameras in the coaches of the trains,” a senior RPF officer said.

Tripathi said the Pune, Miraj, Kolhapur and the Shivajinagar stations have round-the-clock surveillance with the existing CCTV cameras.

“There’s a proposal to have additional cameras at the suburban stations with the Nirbhaya Fund. Frequent announcements though the public announcement system have started in different stations, including Pune, on women’s safety. We are also coordinating with other security agencies,” he said.

NEW DELHI: To help draft its manifesto for the upcoming polls, which is likely to offer more freebies and welfare schemes, Congress has roped in some former bureaucrats who have worked at senior positions in Delhi government for several years.Party sources said these former civil servants held key positions during the Sheila Dikshit regime for 15 years and advised the government on several important initiatives during that time.While the political part of the manifesto has been readied by a committee chaired by former Union minister Ajay Maken , who also held important portfolios in Dikshit’s cabinet, the bureaucrats are helping with the “technical” part.“These former bureaucrats are advising us on how some of the schemes, which we are keen on launching, can be implemented in Delhi, the budget required to run such initiatives and how we can fund those programmes,” a senior Congress functionary, requesting anonymity, said.With initiatives, such as free electricity , water, travel for women in public buses and Wi-Fi, AAP has upped the ante, forcing rival parties to counter them with more “freebies”.Out of office since 2013 and failing to win a single seat in the 2015 polls, Congress faces a tough battle of survival in the capital. While the upcoming polls are being pitched as a contest between AAP and BJP, Congress is being seen as a distant third. Party functionaries say the manifesto would be a major tool to bring back the vote bank, which gravitated towards AAP in the last two polls.Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra has already announced that if elected, his party’s government would give relief to domestic consumers on up to 600 units of electricity consumption every month. He also promised zero bill for small traders and farmers on consumption of up to 200 units.Chopra also promised to double the pension for senior citizens, widows and people with disabilities.

Ajay Maken

NEW DELHI: To help draft its manifesto for the upcoming polls, which is likely to offer more freebies and welfare schemes, Congress has roped in some former bureaucrats who have worked at senior positions in Delhi government for several years.

Party sources said these former civil servants held key positions during the Sheila Dikshit regime for 15 years and advised the government on several important initiatives during that time.

While the political part of the manifesto has been readied by a committee chaired by former Union minister Ajay Maken , who also held important portfolios in Dikshit’s cabinet, the bureaucrats are helping with the “technical” part.

“These former bureaucrats are advising us on how some of the schemes, which we are keen on launching, can be implemented in Delhi, the budget required to run such initiatives and how we can fund those programmes,” a senior Congress functionary, requesting anonymity, said.

With initiatives, such as free electricity , water, travel for women in public buses and Wi-Fi, AAP has upped the ante, forcing rival parties to counter them with more “freebies”.

Out of office since 2013 and failing to win a single seat in the 2015 polls, Congress faces a tough battle of survival in the capital. While the upcoming polls are being pitched as a contest between AAP and BJP, Congress is being seen as a distant third. Party functionaries say the manifesto would be a major tool to bring back the vote bank, which gravitated towards AAP in the last two polls.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra has already announced that if elected, his party’s government would give relief to domestic consumers on up to 600 units of electricity consumption every month. He also promised zero bill for small traders and farmers on consumption of up to 200 units.

Chopra also promised to double the pension for senior citizens, widows and people with disabilities. Sources said the party was also considering announcing free travel for women, senior citizens and students in Delhi Metro and city buses. These promises will be a part of the party’s election manifesto, likely to be released next week.

Party functionaries said the manifesto would also explain where the money would come from to fund these schemes. In its last year in office in 2013, Congress had presented a budget of Rs 37,450 crore, which increased to Rs 60,000 crore in 2019-2020.

Lucknow: A month has passed since LLB (semester III) paper leak rocked the campus but Lucknow University authorities are yet to form a panel to probe the role of teachers whose names figured in audio clips that blew the lid off the scandal.

Soon after the audio clips of two law teachers purportedly dictating question paper to a high-profile student went viral, the university administration suspended the teachers and lodged an FRI against them on December 11.

The then officiating vice-chancellor SK Shukla also formed a committee to conduct an inquiry into the matter. Later, the state government asked special task force (STF) of UP police to conduct a parallel probe.

However, when law faculty teachers raised a banner of revolt, LU took a U-turn and deferred action against teachers saying the final decision would be taken after STF and internal committee submit their reports.

The LU committee submitted its report on January 1 concluding that the sanctity of examination had been compromised as 40% questions mentioned in audio clips matched with the original paper. The STF, in its report submitted to the government on January 2, found that voices in audio clips were of accused teachers and student. In the meantime, new vice-chancellor Prof AK Rai, who took charge on December 30, cancelled the examination taking cognizance of the committee’s report on January 5. LU spokesman Sanjay Medhavi had then said that the university has decided to constitute another committee soon to probe the role of teachers because the first one was mandated to find out whether a leak took place or not. However, nothing has been done even after a week.

When asked about the delay, Medhavi said LU was waiting for the government to share the STF report with the university administration. “The committee to probe the role of teachers will be formed after studying the STF report,” he added.

Nagpur: The BJP has lost Nagpur Zilla Parishad (ZP) but out of the total 332 seats in six ZPs where the election was held, the party has increased its tally from 53 earlier to 102 this time. On the other hand, Congress’s seats have reduced from 99 to 72. Shiv Sena’s tally has gone up from 21 to 46 while NCP has won three seats less this time.

A senior BJP leader told TOI that while media and rival parties were making a lot out of BJP’s defeat in Nagpur ZP, the seats had reduced only from 22 to 15.

“On the other hand, BJP seats in Dhule ZP increased from 13 to 39 this time. In Nandurbar ZP, the seats increased from 1 to 23. Nobody is taking about this. While our tally has gone down in Akola, it has improved in Washim,” he said.

The leader further said that Congress had won in Nagpur but its tally in Dhule is down to 7 from 30 in the last election. In Washim, Congress’s seats have reduced from 16 to 9, in Nandurbar from 29 to 23 and in Akola from 5 to 2,” he said.

NCP has won 46 seats but its tally last time was 49 seats. The party had won 25 seats in Nandurbar last time but this time it came down to just 3.

In Dhule also the tally is down to 3 from 7. The BJP leader feels that media is not highlighting these facts.

“The loss of Nagpur ZP caused a lot of adverse publicity because RSS headquarters is located in the city. But this is not a factor for voters. We were in power for seven years and naturally there was a strong anti-incumbency factor,” said the leader.

BENGALURU: Four friends travelling in an SUV drowned near Tavarekere on Sunday after their vehicle fell into a lake when the driver was trying to avoid hitting a stray dog.

The four were going to Tumakuru district’s Kunigal taluk to visit a temple in their friend’s Ford Ecosport when the vehicle plunged into Bychaguppe Lake.

Sunil Kumar, 35, a resident of Subramanyanagar, was at the wheel, while Santosh, 28, from RT Nagar; Raghavendra, 34, from Cholurpalya; Manjunath 36, from Agrahara Dasarahalli, were accompanying him. Vehicle owner, also called Manjunath, did not accompany the quartet.

Sunil Kumar worked in a food joint, Santosh in a private firm and Raghavendra and Manjunath were employed in a jeweller’s shop.

The quartet took Magadi Road to reach Huliyurdurga. At 4.45pm, the SUV was negotiating a right curve when a stray dog came in its path. Fearing that he may run over the dog, Sunil swerved to the left. But he lost control and the SUV first hit a stone, flipped and fell into the lake on the left side of the road.

With the windows closed, the occupants couldn’t come out of the car and met a watery grave in a matter of minutes. There was only about six feet water in the lake but the SUV landed top down, making it difficult for the occupants to escape, police said.

Passersby alerted cops and fire personnel, who rushed to the spot and fished out the bodies. The autopsy will be conducted on Monday.

Chandigarh: The third edition of TEDx Chandigarh gathered 18 global innovators, change-makers, and intellectuals for ‘The Future Reimagined’ session on Sunday at Tagore Theatre in Sector 18.

They gave the audience tomorrow’s glimpse today and put them in the direction of sustainable living to leave a better planet for future generations. Their stories were inspirational.

The city’s first major event of 2020 was a confluence of futuristic ideas. Robotics expert Daniel Fitzgerald said: “The robots of the future will be a lot different. A new technology may seem mysterious and amazing but we should see its practicality in daily life.”

The youngest participant, climate activist Ridhima Pandey, 11, said: “Natural disasters give us two things—a moment to react and a decision to overcome the odds. The time to take that sufficient action is now. We cannot rely on just change-makers and politicians. My generation will be affected the most, so we the children have taken upon us to push for environment-friendly laws, policies, and practices.”

Actress Kalpana Rao recalled how she began her career at 51 and starred with legends such as Ranjnikanth and Shah Rukh Khan.

Her message: “Never stop believing in yourself. Every one of us has a hidden talent waiting to come out and shine. At any age or stage of life, you can pursue your passion and live your dream.”

PUNE: The state irrigation department has been blaming the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) for failing to plug loopholes in its water distribution and lifting more water. But the PMC has countered it by saying that it saved about 1.75 TMC water in the last one year by commissioning the pipeline from Parvati water works up to Cantonment water pumping station.The pipeline was made operational in January 2019. The civic body has said in the span of one year it has saved 1.75 TMC water, which was wasted because of leakages in the Mutha canal. The water saved in the year is equivalent to the city's water requirement of one and half months, the civic administration said.The PMC’s pipeline project was under consideration for years and aimed at completely stopping the old practice of lifting water from the irrigation canal that flows across the city. The administration was lifting about 250 MLD water from the canal to supply it to the Cantonment water works where it was treated and released for drinking. Ever since the pipeline was made operational, the PMC no longer depends on the canal.The city gets its daily quota of water from Khadakwasla. Until last year, the city was getting water from two sources---through a pipeline from Khadakwasla up to Parvati water works and through the irrigation canal which was providing water to Cantonment pumping station.A civic official said, “It was essential for the irrigation department to maintain continuous flow of water to meet the requirements of the Cantonment pumping station. A considerable volume of water was wasted while maintaining the water flow in the canal at adequate pressure. Now, with a pipeline in place, we can supply the exact quota of water to the Cantonment pumping station without incurring transportation losses.”Sources in the PMC said the water pipeline project got a major push after the September 2018 canal breach at Janata Vasahat. The water discharge in the canal was stopped completely which had affected water supply to Cantonment water works. A large population in city’s eastern parts had faced severe water shortage following the canal closure.“The remaining work of the pipeline was taken up on a war footing after the breach and completed within three months by January 2019,” the official said.Commissioning the pipeline has also helped the irrigation department carry out repairs and maintenance of the canal which was not possible earlier because water had to be released for the cantonment.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73225835,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-960323,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/pmc-saves-45-days-of-water-after-switchover-to-parvati-cantonment-pipeline/articleshow/73218853.cms

Ponnani: Muslim ulemas were not confined to spiritual spheres alone but they gave sense of direction to fights against social injustice, said Salih Kottappalli, state president of Students Islamic Organisation (SIO).

Speaking at the Dignity Caravan organized by SIO and Solidarity Youth Movement against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) here on Sunday, he said scholars like Shaikh Zainuddin Makhdoom and Veliyankode Umar Quasi were the main sources of inspiration for the anti-imperialist agitations in Kerala and it is time to recall the legendary figures.

Salih said Ponnani was the centre of knowledge that provided intellectual and ideological base for the fight against the Portuguese and the British.

“You will not find another community which is deeply rooted in history and tradition and the Sangh Parivar is asking the community to prove their citizenship,” Salih said.

Campuses have become the centre of agitations against the CAA in the country. “It is the reenactment of the history because the Ponnani dars (religious school) founded by Makhdooms was the source of inspiration for the freedom fighters. The legendary Variankunnath Kunjahammed Haji who fought against the British in 1921 was a continuation of this tradition,” he said.

In his inaugural speech Jamaat-e-Islami Kerala Amir’s M I Abdul Aziz challenged the Sangh Parivar to name at least one their leader who took participated in the freedom struggle. He hailed the struggle waged by different sessions of the society sinking their differences.

Solidarity Youth Movement state president Nahas Mala, Muthukoya Makhdoom Thangal, C V Jameela, Shihab Pookkotoor, Salim Mambad and others spoke.

Earlier, hundreds of people took out a rally from Veliyankode to Ponnani. Floats representing various incidents in the freedom struggle were presented at the rally.

In Maharashtra, for the last two years, many students had been fighting for the CSAT paper qualification to be granted,” Bade said.The online poll revealed that 63.9% voters wanted the paper as qualification for the state examination.Regarding the issue of combined exam being conducted for the police sub-inspector (PSI), assistant section officer (ASO) and state tax inspector (STI) posts, around 80.8% students voted for separate papers for each examination.Regarding the third issue of the cancellation of Mahaportal, 87.2% voters stated it should be shut down, while the remaining voted for changes to be made and the recruitment of government posts continue through it.Nimbhore said that the aspirants had been demanding to revert to the earlier practice of recruitment of government department posts through the civil services commission instead of the Mahaportal, which was a facility created by the BJP-led government.The candidates had held many protest marches in order to urge the government to conduct the recruitment through MPSC as the portal was inconvenient.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73225504,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-484494,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/over-44000-vote-in-online-poll-for-mspc-aspirants/articleshow/73218860.cms
368,['13/01/2020'],Could have inducted few more MLAs in BJP: Former BJP Goa chief Vinay Tendulkar,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Vinay Tendulkar

PANAJI: Outgoing BJP state president and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar said on Sunday that he had wanted to increase the strength of BJP’s legislature wing to 30 MLAs before completing his tenure.

However, he said he changed track at the last minute as he thought “people would get angry”. There were recently speculations in political circles that three of Congress’ five MLAs would join BJP. State Congress chief Girish Chodankar had said that BJP was trying to induct leader of opposition Digambar Kamat. Tendulkar, addressing karyakartas in Panaji , said that he was happy that the party has 27 MLAs. “I told organising secretary (Satish Dhond) that we shall hit a six before my tenure is over and increase the number to 30, but then I decided to leave it as people would have gotten angry.” He said that 27 MLAs are enough to have a stable government.

Tendulkar said that when the 2017 assembly election was announced, he had said that BJP would win at least 26 seats. “We all worked for the party but were only able to win 13, and Manohar Parrikar became CM,” he said.

He said that he then approached BJP national president Amit Shah with the proposal to induct a few Congress MLAs for the stability of the government. “I took permission from Parrikar too, and he also agreed. Thus, Dayanand Sopte and Subhash Shirodkar quit Congress and joined BJP,” he said. Tendulkar also said that during his tenure, BJP inducted two MGP MLAs, Deepak Pauskar and Manohar Ajgaonkar. “These decisions were taken with Parrikar’s blessings,” he said.

He also said that the induction of 10 Congress MLAs in BJP last year was a decision taken after the central leadership gave him the green signal.

PUNE: The forest department has reopened the approach road to the historic Sinhagad fort , a popular tourist destination, after installing rockfall safety nets along the ghat section.The route was closed to traffic for nearly a month to enable road repair work and installation of safety nets to prevent accidents.A team of experts from the College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP), Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay and the Public Works Department (PWD) had identified about seven areas prone to landslides and accidents.“Based on the expert team’s recommendations, we have installed safety nets at three locations, covering a 1km distance on the route, in the first phase of the project,” Dhananjay Deshpande, PWD executive engineer, told TOI on Sunday. “The installation of the safety net at the remaining locations will be carried out in the subsequent phases in the coming months.”The route had witnessed around 15 instances of rockfall in the past few months, raising safety concerns for commuters. The government had recently sanctioned Rs1 crore for the second phase of the work, the PWD official said.“Our endeavour is to initiate the second phase before this year’s monsoon. We will complete the tender process and other procedures soon so that the maximum area gets a safety net cover,” Deshpande added.Last year, a 1km portion of the road, which was frequently damaged by the rains, was resurfaced using cement-concrete. “This work was necessary to improve the road condition,” another official said.Officials from the forest department advised visitors against taking part in risky activities. “Often, we have come across instances where people go to risky spots to take photos. They need to avoid this, and to ensure compliance, we have decided to deploy extra security guards,” a senior forest officer said.Regular visitors to the fort said tourists to the site need to be clearly warned against this. “Students and youngsters come to the fort and get adventurous without paying heed to their safety.

371,['13/01/2020'],"AP Capital News: Andhra Pradesh divided, clamour from all regions","This story is from January 13, 2020

HYDERABAD: The proposal to shift Andhra Pradesh capital from Amaravati has triggered fresh demands from various districts for locating the new capital in their respective regions.

It has also brought about a wedge among politicians within all parties, with leaders divided into regional lines over the capital issue.

Since chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy announced in the assembly on December 17 his three capital idea — administrative capital in Vizag, judicial capital in Kurnool and existing capital city of Amaravati to host assembly sessions — local politicians cutting across party lines have come up with their own set of demands. People, including students, have also hit the streets — some for retaining Amaravati and others for shifting it to their area. The YSRCP government has had to deploy hundreds of cops to quell clashes triggered by farmer protests.

In the last 26 days, the demand for capital city has come in from Kurnool, Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur, Prakasam, Nellore and Visakhapatnam districts. On the regional front, local leaders want the capital city to be located in Rayalaseema, north coastal Andhra and south coastal Andhra respectively.

The state had witnessed a similar demand six years ago during the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh. Some leaders want another bifurcation of the state to carve out what they call Greater Rayalaseema.

Leaders from Rayalaseema were the first to renew their demand for the capital city. Former legislator Byreddy Rajasekhar Reddy, who recently joined the BJP, has renewed his demand for the state capital in Kurnool (Rayalaseema). “The capital should be in Rayalaseema. The government has given head (administrative capital) to Visakhapatnam, torso to Amaravati and tail to Rayalaseema,” he said.

Rajya Sabha MP TG Venkatesh wants high court apart from Secretariat (administrative capital) in the region. PV Sidda Reddy, YSRCP legislator from Kadiri, has demanded that Rayalaseema should be given judicial as well as legislative capital cities. While former minister and TDP leader B Akhila Priya wants the capital to be shifted to Rayalaseema if the government was not in favour of Amaravati.

Former MP Chinta Mohan is in favour of Tirupati as the state capital while ex-minister Ganta Srinivas Rao supports shifting of capital to Visakhapatnam. Former MP and TDP leader JC Diwakar Reddy has renewed his demand for Greater Rayalaseema in case of shifting of capital from Amaravati.

Assembly speaker Tammineni Sitaram supported the proposal for three capital cities saying that it would arrest the demand for separate states. Earlier, he had described Amaravati as a desert.

While the opposition blames the ruling YSRCP for the capital trouble across the state, the ruling YSRCP has blamed the TDP for the “political conspiracy”. “A planned political conspiracy is being executed in the state to create unrest and disturb law and order,” a YSRCP official statement said on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: To maximise voter turnout in assembly segments that had fewer people coming out to exercise their franchise in Lok Sabha polls, the Delhi election office has launched a special awareness campaign in association with district election officers.

Officials said about 30 assembly segments have been identified where the voter turnout was much below expectations. The awareness campaign will run simultaneously in all such assembly segments.

A quiz was also organised in which various questions related to the election process and schedule were asked.

“Eligible voters, who are still not registered, are being told about the enrolment process, which can be done online or by personally visiting the voters’ registration centre.

Mullappally Ramachandran

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran has reiterated that he does not favour a jumbo committee at the KPCC and also he is not in favour of MLAs becoming party office-bearers.

The discussion for appointing the new office-bearers for the KPCC will begin in New Delhi on Monday with the KPCC leaders reaching the national capital. The KPCC president will be meeting AICC president Sonia Gandhi before finalizing the new office-bearers.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala and AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy have also reached New Delhi for discussions with the party high command. The restructuring of the organization has been delayed since there is lack of consensus among the state leaders on appointing the new party leaders.

Meanwhile, the KPCC president said there will be no more delay in appointing the new officer-bearers since he has been doing a one-man show for the past one year. “The party committees have to come in place since we are going to have local body election this year and assembly election next year. Hence we cannot move on like this,” he said before leaving for New Delhi.

Even though the ‘I’ group in the party headed by Chennithala is demanding party positions for the MLAs, the KPCC president and Chandy have opposed to it. “The MLAs have to concentrate on the work in their respective constituencies since the state is going to have elections. They will not be able to do justice to their work if they are given party positions. Hence I am opposed to MLAs being given the party posts,” said Ramachandran.

The decision on the new state president for the Youth Congress is also likely to be taken this week. Shafi Parambil, MLA, is pitched for the new state president post and K S Sabarinathan, MLA, is the frontrunner for the vice-president post.

Navnath and Pravin Kaspate

PUNE: After he drew success with NMK-1 Golden, a variety of custard apple, and pushed up its annual production up to 250 tonnes this year, Solapur-based farmer Navnath Kaspate recently got a patent certificate for it under the Protection of Plant Variety and Farmers’ Rights Act.

Kaspate said his application for the patent was under scrutiny with the central government for the last three years. Sixtyfour-year-old Kaspate, from Gormale village in the arid area of Barshi taluka in Solapur district, used to cultivate grapes in his early days of farming.

Later, his experience revealed that cultivating custard apples was cheaper than growing grapes. “Through research and experience, I have now developed more than 40 varieties of this fruit in my field,” Kaspate told TOI.

He worked NMK-1 Golden variety for almost ten years from 2001 to 2011. “I would spend most of my time in my fields. After successful trails, rigorous work based on experiences we were able to launch the variety which brought success. I have been cultivating custard apples of this variety from 201. Every year, there has been an increase in production. Of the 45 acres, 25 acres have NMK-1 Golden plants. The average annual production has now reached up to 250 tonnes which fetches returns up to Rs 1.25 crore,” Kaspate said.

Pramod, Kaspate’s son, said NMK-1 Golden variety has proved to be superior than local other varieties on many fronts. “The size of fruit and per acre production is high. Besides it is more tasty, sweet and enhances the digestive power. Spending around Rs 60,000 for an acre can give returns up to Rs 2 lakh to Rs 5 lakh after two years,” Pramod said.

A nursery on their farm has been developed on the remaining 20 acres for research and cultivation of saplings of NMK-1 Golden variety. About 10 lakh saplings are cultivated at the nursery annually and supplied to 18 states, Pramod said.

Pune: The demand to make civic body-run Late Bindumadhav Thackeray Hospital in Gosavi Vasti and Sutar Hospital in Kothrud fully-functional has gathered force again.

City-based activist and medical practitioner Abhijit More said he would relaunch his agitation if the latest talks with Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities failed to yield results in the next few days.

More had withdrawn his hunger strike on August 26 last year after civic health officials assured him of 'doing something' to revive Thackeray hospital, a major portion of which had been lying unused for over eight years now. He had also agitated for starting caesarean section (C-section) facility at the civic body-run Sutar maternity hospital.

“When I began the hunger strike on August 26, the PMC health officials had assured me they would make the hospital operational. But, nothing has happened yet. I met the municipal commissioner, Saurav Rao, recently, and submitted my written demands to him. I have requested him to start a maternity hospital on the premises of Thackeray hospital and start C-section facility at the Sutar hospital,” More said.

“The commissioner assured us he would move the proposal of maternity hospital before the general body in a meeting scheduled next week. The commissioner also informed us that he had written a note to the chief of the health department to start C-section facility at Sutar hospital,” More said.

HYDERABAD: The Rangareddy District Consumer Dispute Redressal Forum has ordered Bajaj Electronics to refund a customer Rs 67,000 with interest along with Rs 10,000 as compensation and another Rs 10,000 towards cost of complaint for selling an out-of-warranty laptop.

The complainant, K Srinivasa Chary, had filed a complaint against Bajaj Electronics in Miyapur from whom he had bought the laptop in 2017.

“My son took it to his college in Odisha ...after using it for a few days he complained about a display problem. When I visited the service centre, they informed me that the warranty of the laptop has expired in 2016 December itself... I approached the opposite party to replace the laptop and return the money but they didn’t show any interest..,” the petitioner said.

Bajaj Electronics, in its counter, accepted the sale of the disputed laptop but denied the allegations made by the complainant saying that the liability of the dealer or retailer was limited.

In its order the consumer forum said: “Bajaj Electronics is certainly liable for the deceptive practice of selling (an) out-of-warranty product to the consumer. It cannot take shelter under the name of dealer or retailer as they have collected full amount from the complainant...While selling the out of warrant products, the retailer deemed to have acted as principal and not as a dealer. This certainly amounts to unfair trade practice. The opposite party has to compensate for the mental agony of the complainant.”

Lucknow: In the wake of frequent clashes between resident doctors and patient attendants, Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) has decided to invoke the Mahatma to soothe frayed nerves.

Message boards featuring Gandhi’s principles of peace and service will be placed on the premises while lectures about him will be organised for faculty members and students from time to time. As many as 20 framed quotes of Bapu have already been installed at the OPD and banners hang at prominent spots, including the emergency ward.

The peace campaign is not uncalled for given that RML hospital witnessed five ugly clashes involving resident doctors and patient kin in the past six months. In most cases, the doctors were accused of negligence following the death of a patient. In some, alleged misconduct triggered a conflict.

“These (Gandhi’s messages) are lessons that we hope will make medicos better human beings,” summed up Bhuwan Tiwari, the chief medical superintendent of RMLIMS.

MUMBAI: Maharashtra recorded the highest number of corruption cases for three years in a row—2016 to 2018— but the conviction rate in 2018 was abysmally low at 15%, shows the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. And pendency of corruption and vigilance cases in court was as high as 93%.As far as departmental action is concerned, corrupt public servants seem to have got away with just a rap on the knuckles—NCRB data shows that 18 officials were dismissed from service and only two awarded major punishment in 2018.“Corruption has become a way of life and nothing to be afraid of or frowned upon. We are all collectively responsible as we have been silent spectators,” said retired IPS officer Meeran Borwankar.NCRB figures should be treated as a wake-up call for citizens,” said retired IPS officer Meeran Borwankar. “That the conviction rate has fallen to 15% in Maharashtra is a rude shock; it used to be higher in the 90s. That the post of ACB chief is kept vacant, officers of choice and not of merit are posted, cases registered and closed at the direction of politicians have all affected ACB Maharashtra,” she said.Going by the data, complainants are not being discouraged from reporting corruption cases in Maharashtra as compared to other states. Over 930 cases were registered in 2018 in Maharashtra, while Uttar Pradesh registered just 84 cases. But while trials were completed in 374 cases in Maharashtra, there were only 56 convictions in 2018. Madhya Pradesh, which completed trials in 310 cases, handed out convictions in 224 in the same period—a conviction rate of 72.3%.Delay in prosecution is a key factor that hampers conviction. “In graft-trap cases, a sanction is required from a competent authority for initiation of prosecution. If this sanction is not taken, the judicial officer will not take cognisance of the case and discharge it right away,” said former DGP Pravin Dixit, who had earlier served as chief of the anti-corruption bureau (ACB). “Who would be the competent authority for the sanction depends upon the class of the officer trapped. If it’s a class I officer, sanction is required from the government, which either takes a really long time or may even be rejected. This makes it tough to prosecute,” he added. Maharashtra had the highest number of graft-trap cases—891—in 2018.Pointing out that forensic reports hold a lot of significance, Dixit said: “But if the report gets delayed, the chargesheet too is delayed. Then there are times when, even after a chargesheet is filed, it could take a decade for the case to come up for hearing. By then, things change. The sanctioning authority may or may not be available, the investigating officer may have retired and the complainant may become hostile.”Departmental inquiries seem to have lost gravity, he added. “An inquiry may not begin or conclude on time. Even if it does conclude, there will be several appeals made against the order passed by the initial officer,” Dixit said. “Perhaps the only dampener for a corrupt public servant is his naming and shaming in the media following arrest. It would bring down his morale from indulging in corruption.”According to the NCRB data, Rajasthan has fared the worst in departmental inquiries with not a single corrupt public servant being dismissed or awarded punishment.“Most corruption cases relate to petty traps of junior officers, who often get acquitted in the final stage. In instances where seniors are involved, a corruption case is usually not registered and if it is registered, then it is closed based on untenable pretexts,” said lawyer Y P Singh, also a former IPS officer. “With the substantial dilution of the Prevention of Corruption Act and the control that the government holds on the ACB, it is clear that nobody is serious about tackling corruption and the public is completely ignorant of these developments.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-161349,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/maha-tops-in-graft-cases-but-logs-only-15-conviction-rate/articleshow/73219787.cms

Lucknow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said the youthful approach of the government drove it to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir, resolve vexed Ram Janmabhoomi issue and bring in a new citizenship law.

In a video message telecast at the 23rd National Youth Festival organised at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan, Modi said his government was with young generation.

“By 2022, the dream of freedom-fighters will turn into a reality. Your pledge will take India to new heights. Swami Vivekanand used to see youth as an important link to energy. India’s youth understands this and is moving ahead,” he said.

“Today, young generation is giving a push to innovation and start-ups. Before 2014, the country had 4,000 patents which has now gone up to 15,000. It is because of the youth. The 26,000 new start-ups are because of youth,” the PM added.

Making a pitch for ‘Make in India’, he urged the youth to buy local products so that their brethren get benefited. “Indian youth has linked their dreams with the requirement of the country. They are working to make India proud. It is the youth which is giving solutions, starting new ventures, taking risks and providing jobs to others,” Modi said, adding that the youth was not concerned which government started the scheme.

“We need to take advantage of the fact that a majority of population is under 35 years. Be it skilled development or Mudra Yojana, all schemes are framed keeping youth in mind,” he said, adding the ‘New India’ was coming up as every person was important.

The PM said VIP culture should be shunned.

The ambiguity around what areas fall under GHMC and LMA and jurisdiction limitations have emerged as a major concern for residents.Among the many issues plaguing the area, sanitation is a major problem faced by residents. For example, there is a part of road leading from Bolarum railway station to Kompally X roads, which is defence land. The garbage dumped on the roadside is often not cleared citing jurisdiction limitations. While one side of the road belongs to GHMC, the other side is defence land. Although GHMC cleans the area sometimes, lack of clarity and LMA’s failure on clearing debris on its land continues to be an issue.“If there is a jurisdiction problem, the officials must sort that out with the Secunderabad Cantonment Board .

Thiruvananthapuram: Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau ( VACB ) officials on Friday conducted surprise raids at Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) development offices under various local body offices, including city corporations, municipalities and block panchayats, and unearthed massive irregularities related to financial aids meant for members of SC/ST community. The raids were launched simultaneously in offices across the state under the code name ‘Operation Rights’.

In the raid conducted at Sasthamcotta Block Panchayat in Kollam district, it was revealed that people, who already owned ancestral lands, and those who received land through Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awaas Yojna in the year 2010-11 had been granted financial aid to purchase land. In Kollam Corporation office too, irregularities related to sanction of financial aids for construction of study rooms were found.

At Parakkode Block Office in Pathanamthitta district, VACB officials found that people, who constructed houses in 2003 using financial aid from the municipality, had secured the financial aid again in 2017-18 citing the same purpose.Similar irregularities were detected in Kozhikode, Malappuram, Alappuzha , Kottayam and Thiruvananthapuram districts too.

VACB director Anil Kant ordered the raids after receiving numerous complaints about massive corruption involved in sanctioning of financial aids for SC/ST community members because of which deserving people missed out on getting the funds.

NEW DELHI: Alleging a scam, AAP on Sunday claimed that Delhi Development Authority had arbitrarily inflated the prices of flats offered for the economically weaker sections under the 2014 Housing Scheme.Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh said he had written a letter to Central Bureau of Investigation and Central Vigilance Commission, claiming that DDA raised the cost of the flats by almost three times.Talking to reporters, Singh alleged that while Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri went around Delhi promising houses to the poor, DDA — which comes under the Centre — had “committed fraud and cheated” poor people.Singh said that under the 2014 housing scheme, people in the EWS category — those with annual income of not more than Rs 1 lakh — were offered more than 700 flats.“The brochure said that they would get the flats in the price range of Rs 6.9 to 11 lakh and on easy instalments. It also said that the flats were newly constructed, which means that these were ready,” Singh said.“And if the building is ready, there is no way its cost can go up,” he added.Singh claimed that successful applicants submitted all document that DDA had asked for in 2015, but they had to run “from to pillar to post” for fixing the instalments or getting the promised flats.Singh said that, later, DDA sent them demand notes, but demanded anywhere from Rs 19 lakh to Rs 24 lakh. He said the instalments fixed by DDA were more than Rs 10,000 per month, which meant the minimum an allottee would have had to shell out annually was more than Rs 1.2 lakh. “If their income is not more than Rs 1 lakh annually, where would they get more than Rs 10,000 per month to pay the instalments?” he asked.Singh alleged that after protests and letters written to the PM and Puri, DDA sent a revised note and asked for Rs 15 lakh. “When the brochure said Rs 6.9 lakh and the buildings were ready, why should they give you Rs 15 lakh or Rs 24 lakh?” he said. “This is corruption.”DDA said the EWS flats being referred to by Singh had been built by a private developer. Private developers have to build EWS flats mandatorily whenever they develop a housing colony. The agency tweeted: “50% of EWS flats developed by private developers are transferred to DDA at price linked with CPWD index. Thereafter, these flats are offered by DDA to eligible beneficiaries. The price charged by DDA is based on actual cost and the formula is approved by the authority (sic).”DDA said the price indicated in the brochure in 2014 was tentative and after a detailed calculation in 2019, the new cost was worked out and the beneficiaries were informed.“Thereafter, on request of beneficiaries, DDA decided not to charge interest and, therefore, the price was reduced. The flats are of different sizes and parking is also included. It is multi-storey construction, the costing has been done in transparent manner and shown to beneficiaries. Most of the beneficiaries have taken the flats (sic),” DDA tweeted.DDA said its accounts were subject to audit and could be verified.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73222406,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157470,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/aap-alleges-a-scam-in-dda-scheme-for-poor/articleshow/73219614.cms

HYDERABAD: The upcoming civic polls will be a litmus test for BJP and Congress’ in the state. It will give them a chance to prove their claim of being the main opposition party in the state and an alternative to the current TRS government was not simply a political statement.

After their performance in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP, which won four seats in the state as compared to Congress’ three, has claimed itself to be the alternative to the TRS. Both Congress and BJP have taken up the civic elections as a prestigious issue. Both parties are confident of wins in their parliamentary constituencies.

“TRS and BJP are sides of the same coin and the people of Telangana have realised it. The TRS government has not given sufficient funds to municipalities due to which sanitation is in poor condition, roads have turned from bad to worse...With what face will TRS seek votes,” said state Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy.

Meanwhile, state BJP president K Laxman claimed that several Congress functionaries leaving the party to join either BJP or TRS was a sign that they had lost confidence in their own party. “The municipal elections will prove beyond doubt that it is BJP which is going to defeat TRS in the next assembly polls,” Laxman said.

While the BJP and Congress fight it out to claim main opposition status, the civic polls also prove to be major test for TRS working president and MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao, the minister himself admitting that the polls will be a test for the work done by him as the municipal minister.

Revanth: What happened to KCR’s development promises? Telangana Congress working president A Revanth Reddy on Sunday demanded that minister KT Rama Rao should explain what happened to the promises made by CM K Chandrasekhar Rao of developing Karimnagar and Warangal along the lines of London.

“KTR is telling lies that hundreds of crores of rupees have been released to Nizamabad, Ramagundam, Karimnagar, Khammam municipal corporations. These ULBs are starved of fund,” Revanth said.

HYDERABAD: It’s a double whammy for 15 workers from Telangana wanting to return from Erbil in Iraq. They have not only overstayed for three months but their ‘aqama’ (work permit) has not been renewed by the Iraqi authorities. Sources said these workers will have to pay Rs 5 lakh each before the Iraq government allows them to leave.

The workers are at their wits’ end as the authorities are not renewing the work permit because of an internal scam that was unearthed recently. This would mean they cannot return without paying the penalty for their overstay.

As per the Iraqi laws, workers are branded ‘illegal’ without the aqama and will have to pay a penalty for every extra day of overstay even if they wish to leave the country. The workers hail from Nizamabad, Jagtial, Adilabad, Karimnagar and Mancherial.

According to sources, the Iraqi authorities have stopped renewing work permits after it was found that the system had been misused by some local advocates in connivance with the officials leading to a financial fraud and loss to the government.

At a meeting with officials of Consulate General of India (CGI), Erbil, on Thursday evening, the Telugu Gulf Employees Welfare Association highlighted the plight of Telangana workers and brought it to the notice of consulate. “We have been assured by consulate officials that they would help the workers return to India,” said Ramchander Rayalwar, vice-president of the association.

He told STOI over telephone that the situation in Iraq following the attack by the US and also firing of missiles by Iran on US bases in Erbil was also discussed. Consulate officials told the workers that it did not appear that the situation would get escalated and therefore there was no need for the workers to worry and ask to be evacuated.

“If at all the situation worsens, the consulate will assist all Indian workers in leaving the country,” an official said at the meeting, assuring the workers that at this moment there was no cause for worry.

Secunderabad: The executive council of the Students Bar Council, Nalsar University opposed the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and the exercise of National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) on Sunday.

In a statement issued by the Students Bar Council, members termed the CAA, to be blatantly discriminatory against Muslims. Stating that the Act goes against the fundamental values enshrined in the Constitution of India and is in violation of Article 14 (Right to Equality) and Article 21(Right to Life and Personal Liberty), the statement read -- “The Act demonizes the Muslim community and ignores their victimhood as persecuted minorities. The Act is arbitrary in nature in that it targets the Muslim community and propagates Islamophobia thereby disturbing the secular fabric of the nation.”

The executive council expressed its concerns over Telangana government's silence on the matter. “We strongly condemn the state’s silencing of all forms of dissent while specifically targeting and inflicting violence on the members of the Muslim community,” the statement read.

400,['13/01/2020'],Maradu flats demolition: How photojournalists managed to take a perfect shot,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Several photojournalists took position in an abandoned building opposite Alpha Serene on Saturday

KOCHI: His words gave us hope after a futile search that lasted nearly ten days following the announcement of the demolition dates. The middle-aged man who introduced himself as a former sub-inspector of police said, “Come with me, I will take you to the best vantage point.” As we reached the building and made it for the stairs, we ran into a man saying, “They cannot shoot here. By order of the assistant collector.’’

Yet one more hope of getting the perfect shot vanished in front of us. A vantage point that allows us to view the demolition scene in its entirety was crucial for us, and as visual journalists we had to take into consideration several factors including angles and lighting and shade falling on the building before zeroing in on the spot.

Though we were given the option of renting a room at a nearby five-star hotel, we kept that as our plan B and took up the challenge of finding a vantage point ourselves. But it turned out to be a real goose chase. One day while scouting for a location opposite the lake near Golden Kayaloram , we made our way through marshy land and stumbled upon a cosy empty corner covered with bushes. Discarded car cushions, water bottles and cigarette butts lent a sense of eeriness of us being watched and we made a quick exit.

We finally zeroed in on an abandoned building in Nettoor and an under-construction highrise near a prominent hotel. After the district administration mandated a 200m exclusion zone we feared that one of the buildings on our radar would be out of bounds.

Visual journalists made several representations to the district administration and police officials for use of the building but the permission did not arrive until 90 minutes of the planned demolition on January 11. In all our efforts, one person we recall with gratitude is Sreerag C Kaimal, project chief of twin towers coming up at Maradu , who agreed to accommodate many of us in the building at Kundanoor. Many of the majestic visuals you saw on print and on television would not have been possible if not for him. Both these buildings together accommodated close to 150 of us on Saturday and Sunday.

But after two days of scampering around, on Sunday afternoon we walked by an abandoned building with a view of Golden Kayaloram without much hope. But surprisingly without much persuasion the security guard opened the gates and ushered us in with a welcoming smile. For hours many of us had been literally jostling against others for a wee bit of space for the perfect angle and suddenly we found ourselves in a spacious heaven, with a balcony each for all photographers and camera persons.

CM Yogi Adityanath with Kiren Rijiju in Lucknow on Sunday

Lucknow: Union minister of state for youth affairs and sports Kiren Rijiju on Sunday expressed concern over under-performance of Indian sportspersons in international events like Olympics and said people should not be satisfied with only one or two medals.

Speaking at the National Youth Festival at Indira Gandhi Pratishthan, the minister said: “Reports have shown that 70% population does not exercise to stay fit. I believe that actual potential of the country is yet to be realized.”

Rijiju said his government was working on a 10-year plan which would help sportspersons bag enough medals to figure among top ten best performing countries by 2028, when Olympics are scheduled.

“We have approached the ministry of human resource development to make a provision for ‘fit school flag’ for best school. There will be star ratings for schools. We also plan to bring universities under the ambit of the programme,” he said.

“Everyone needs to join Fit India movement. We will celebrate August 29, which is the birth anniversary of hockey wizard Dhyan Chand, as ‘Fit India Day’,” he said, assuring that youth would get all help from the central government.

Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh minister for youth affairs Upendra Tewari said stadiums would be constructed in every city and villages of the state.

“At least 49 sports complexes are already under construction. The department of youth affairs was virtually lying defunct since 1995. It was revived only after Bhartiya Janata Party came to power,” he said.

Lucknow: In what may be another hurdle for the SIT probe into the Umbha case, 14 documents from 2012 to 2019 went missing from the Ghorawal tehshil office on Saturday.

Sonbhadra district magistrate S. Rajalingam has ordered an investigation under Ghorawal SDM and has also lodged an FIR. Sources privy to the case told TOI that CCTV cameras installed at the tehsil office do not function.

Ghorawal tehsil had hogged headlines when 11 members of the Gond tribe, reportedly farming on a disputed plot of land in Umbha village, were allegedly killed by then gram pradhan Yagya Dutt and his henchmen on July 17 last year.

The state government later formed an SIT to probe the land dispute. The team is still on the job under a DIG-rank officer and its report is awaited.

During an inspection on Saturday, SDM Chandra Prakash found the 14 documents missing. He quizzed tehsildar Vikas Pandey before reporting the matter to the DM.

Rajalingam told TOI that he had asked the SDM to conduct a thorough probe and instructed the tehsildar to lodge an FIR. “We are yet to know exactly what kind of documents went missing. The probe will ascertain the same,” he said.

Ghorawal SHO Chandra Prakash Pandey said nazir (court official) Rajendra Prasad and peshkar (reader) Akhilesh Chandra had been booked for criminal breach of trust by public servant. Pandey added that police would assist the SDM in his probe as well.

Illustration used for representational purpose

HYDERABAD: The draft regulations for implementation of the Clinical Establishment Act have been drawn up by a state-level committee, which may result in cancellation of registration of many hospitals and diagnostic centres.

The draft rules seek to fill in a number of grey areas that allow hospitals, nursing homes and diagnostic centres to flout norms. These regulations have been prepared in consultation with government and private hospitals.

One of the key rules is to put up a board in all the hospitals, displaying fee for various treatments. All the diagnostic centres, which so far did not have uniform pricing structure or uniform testing method, will have to follow these regulations.

The dimensions and space requirement for running a clinic have also been laid down in the draft rules. As per the rules, reception and waiting room in a clinic should be at least 35 sqft. Also, the doctor’s consultancy room is required to be at least 10 sqft in size, as per the minimum standards prescribed.

“Several hospitals and nursing homes are mushrooming and many have ignored the existing regulations. Apart from lack of infrastructure, the quality of services is also compromised due to lack of experienced medical staff. The central government had introduced the Clinical Establishment Act and it was approved by Telangana government it the Assembly. As the state governments are free to formulate regulations, a state-level committee has now finalised the necessary provisions for implementation of the Act. The orders will issued soon,” said a highly placed source in state health department.

The hospitals will be divided into four categories for the implementation of the new rules, specifying infrastructure, equipment, medicines, staff and quality of services.

As the handcart-puller was moving, one of the cylinders fell and a suspicious material came out of it

NEW DELHI: A 24-year-old man has been arrested for concealing drugs in iron cylinders and transporting them from West Bengal to Delhi via train. The drugs were transported through the parcel department of the railways.

According to police, 96.5 kilograms of cannabis packed in six iron cylinders was seized from New Delhi Railway Station. On Friday night, around 11pm, a Railway Protection Force (RPF) officer who was on patrolling duty on platform number 16 spotted a man carrying cylinders in a hand cart.

As the handcart-puller was moving, one of the cylinders fell and a suspicious material came out of it. When the patrolling officer checked the material, he found that it was ganja . The man was taken into custody and a thorough examination of the cylinders revealed that they were all filled with the drug .

“The accused was identified as Usman, a resident of Samaypur Badli. Investigation revealed that the parcel was issued in his name for taking possession of the cylinders and he also got a gate pass issued for him to transport the cylinders from the railway station. A case was registered and the accused was arrested,” said Harendra Singh, DCP, Railways.

Usman told police that the drug was packed in the cylinders and properly sealed with iron lids on both sides. The bearings with handles were attached to the lids of both sides of the cylinders and they were smeared with grease to give the impression that the equipment was part of the machinery. Then the cylinders were booked in his name in Howrah for New Delhi, and he received them for further delivery.

“The accused told police that he met a man in north Delhi who asked him to deliver the cylinders to him for a good amount of money. He took his ID and also provided him a mobile phone for the purpose. The consignment was booked in his name by a person in Howrah for transporting it to Delhi. After taking the delivery from the railway station, the parcel had to be delivered to his associate in Burari. Police are looking for his associate and trying to find out the source of the ganja,” added the DCP.

GUNDLAPOCHAMPALLY: A five-minute walk from the Gundlapochampally municipal office will bring you to the Gundla Cheruvu, where a pervasive stench reveals the sad state of the lake. Once a main source of drinking water to the erstwhile village (now municipality), the century-old Gundla Cheruvu has now turned into a cesspool.Though the civic body has put up an iron mesh along the periphery of the lake to keep the area clean, people still dump garbage there.According to records, there are seven water bodies under Gundlapochampally municipal limits, and four of them are in a pathetic condition with sewage water from nearby houses and colonies being released into them.The situation of the decades-old Kandlakoya Cheruvu is worse than that of Gundla Cheruvu. Located at the entrance of Kandlakoya village (now merged into Gundlapochampally municipality), the lake has turned into a dump yard. Sanitation workers and locals dump garbage on the shore, and the entire water body is covered in weed.The situation at Sutariguda Cheruvu and Narayana Cheruvu is not different. Hyacinth, polluted water, garbage and illegally dumped debris are the common problems at these water bodies.Of course, voters in Gundlapochampally municipality were relieved of their water woes after Godavari water, under Mission Bhagiratha scheme, gushed into their taps. However, they are fed up with the civic body and state government’s apathy over laying sewerage network.“We have lost hope that the TRS-led government will provide basic amenities such as underground drainage,” said KL Ramana, a retired government teacher, and a resident of Kandlakoya. “Elected representatives give empty promises during elections, and then turn a blind to these issues.”T Eswaramma, a homemaker, said: “Thanks to the pressure mounted by locals on officials, the civic body has laid single-lane, cement concrete roads in all 15 municipal wards. We have given representations for a sewerage network, however, they have been ignored.”When TOI contacted municipal commissioner, Gundlapochampally, K Amarendar Reddy, he said: “Though we do not have a sewerage system, we have been lifting garbage on a daily basis to avoid seasonal diseases.

408,['13/01/2020'],Focus back on bringing more villages under MCC,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Mysuru: Nearly two years after a survey was carried out by Mysuru City Corporation on expanding its limits , the chorus for inclusion of some villages in the periphery of the corporation is increasing as the gram panchayats have failed to address many civic issues.

The green tribunal order directing the state government to set up sewage treatment plants in all the villages by March-end has forced the authorities to think about bringing the villages near the MCC border within the corporation limits to streamline garbage management. However, the gram panchayat members feel that such a proposal may not be realised soon.

In 2012-13 itself, a proposal was mooted for the formation of Greater Mysuru by bringing 110 villages into the corporation limits. In October 2017, when G Jagadeesha was the corporation commissioner, the MCC had carried out a survey in 44 villages around the city to bring them to the corporation fold as per the directions of then chief minister Siddaramaiah who hails from Mysuru. However, till now, no decision has been taken in this regard.

According to sources, with the green tribunal making STPs mandatory in all the gram panchayats before March 2020, it has proposed to bring the GPs in the MCC border inside the corporation limits to avoid penalties and find a solution to the land required to set up the STPs. “The gram panchayats are facing a lot of pressure on the construction of STPs as land is not available. One of the solutions under consideration is to bring them inside the MCC to avoid penalties and proper waste management,” said an official in MCC.

According to the residents of the newly formed layouts in the villages adjoining the MCC, the biggest problems they face are the poor garbage collection and the drinking water issues. “Even though STPs have been made compulsory in the private layouts, in a majority of the layouts, the developers don't follow the norms. It results in the residents depending on local gram panchayats. They don't have any modern system to dispose the garbage or collect them at the door step. So the government must consider the demand of forming the greater Mysuru City Corporation,” said KC Sharanya, a resident of Roopanagar.

Krishnaraja MLA SA Ramadas said the state government may not take any decision in this regard any time soon. “In 2012-13, there was a central scheme to form the greater Mysuru City Corporation. But it was not realised due to various reasons. Now it is difficult to expand the MCC limits. No proposal to expand the corporation borders” he said.

Ramesh, member, Srirampura gram panchayat, said that for past 10 years he is hearing about the merger of GPs with MCC. “However, nothing has happened till now. It will not happen in the next few years also,” he said.

Thiruvananthapuram: All contract carriages and water tankers in the state will have a uniform colour scheme soon. The decision to introduce uniform colour to contract carriage vehicles and water tankers was taken in the State Transport Authority meeting on Thursday.

There are around 45,000 to 50,000 contract carriages, operated as tourist buses in the state. Following complaints, MVD had recently began inspection of tourist buses to check unauthorised use to sound system, lights and other alterations like graphics and colourful images on its body.

“The decision to implement uniform colour scheme in contract carriage vehicles was taken following a high court directive as colourful graphics and posters of films stars are being used on vehicles, distracting other motorists. The proposed colour for the contract carriages is white, but the final decision will be announced by the authority. The freshwater tanker will be given blue colour and tanker transporting waste water will have brown colour,” said an official from STA.

“The contract carriage operators too have agreed to bring in uniformity in colour of buses. The contract carriage vehicles will have to follow the STA direction before the next fitness test. But, the tanker operators will have to change the colour of the tank soon after STA’s decision is released,” added the official.

According to T K Abdul Majeed, vice-president of Contract Carriage Operators Federation, fluorescent colours and graphics painting costs around Rs 5-8 lakh, and it creates an unhealthy competition among contract carriage operators.

“We welcome the decision to introduce uniform colour in contract carriage vehicles, which will avoid the unhealthy competition. We have demanded for an international standard colour code which will attract people, instead of graphic and colors which may lead to untoward incidents. The contract carriage owners should not be permitted to display fancy names on the vehicles which distracts other motorists,” said Majeed.

The government added abutting villages to the area, which figured at the national level after country’s leading real estate firms started crowding the area. Several high-rises, villas and group housing schemes connected by wide CC roads have come up in the area within two years.

This isn’t the only thing why Gundlapochampally is in he news. The civic body collects Rs 7 crore annually as property tax from commercial godowns, seed companies and logistic firms. “This is a huge source of revenue for our municipality,” said municipal commissioner K Amarendar Reddy. “Apart from property tax, we are also getting a revenue of Rs 4 crore a year through stamps and registration process, due to the round-the-year booming real estate business,” he said and added: “ We are ready to provide infrastructure such as flyovers, sewerage treatment plants to keep water bodies clean, and other basic amenities.”

LUCKNOW: Around 26,000 teachers of 4,500 government-aided secondary schools will join 5 lakh teachers of government primary schools during a statewide mass leave on January 21.

While primary teachers have a slew of demands that include a headmaster in every school, an assistant teacher in every class, benches for children and pension, teachers of aided schools are protesting against the scrapping of Section 21 of the Secondary Education Service Selection Board ( SESSB ), which protected them from any action by their respective school managements.

The government had scrapped the section and instead introduced Section 18 in the UP Education Service Commission Act in December. A day after the decision, teachers began taking classes with black ribbons tied around their arms. On January 21, they will shut schools and burn a copy of Section 21 outside respective district collectorates.

RP Mishra, president of UP Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh, said there was always a tussle between teachers and management on various issues, which in the majority of cases was not healthy.

“Now, scrapping Section 21 and introducing Section 18 has left teachers at the mercy of school owners. Teachers can easily be removed from their posts. How can we teach when our jobs are not secure? Hence, we have decided to demonstrate outside collectorates. Teachers will sport black ribbons till January 20 after which the protests will intensify,” Mishra added.

The first siren was sounded at 10.30am, 30 minutes prior to the razing of the 55m-high Jains Coral, which was the first to go down on Sunday.They welcomed the siren, following which the exclusion zone was cordoned off, with loud cheers. After two more sirens, at 10.55am and 11.01am, the building was demolished at 11.02am when Joe Brinkmann of Jet Demolition triggered the blast from the blastman’s shed around 70m away from the apartment complex. The 16-floor building came down in a waterfall model in eight seconds. At 372kg, the amount of emulsion explosives used in Jains Coral was the most over the two days.Though the demolition of Golden Kayaloram was scheduled for 2pm, authorities postponed it to 2.30pm due to the delay in shifting the control room from Nettoor to the office of Inland Waterways and the hold up in raising the wind curtain around the building. But within a minute of the third sounding of the siren at 2.29pm, Kayaloram split into two vertically and crumbled inward as planned. The Anganwadi building, situated less than 10m from the block, remained intact. Just 14.8kg of explosives were used and the building tumbled in five seconds after the explosion was initiated.“Kayaloram’s 16-storey portion fell to the west side and the 11-storey portion crumbled to the east. We had to split the building into two so it would not affect the small school, which was our challenge. We are glad that we could achieve it,” said Brinkmann after the demolition.Sub-collector Snehil Kumar Singh, who headed the technical committee, said the panel was the backbone of the entire process. “Without its support, this would not have been possible. The police and district collector stepped in for the final stage. Let us hope that debris removal will be hasslefree. For Edifice Engineering and Vijay Steels and Explosives it is a job well done.”The large cloud of dust that was kicked up settled within 15 minutes. Sources said debris removal will begin on Monday itself.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73221316,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-246307,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/done-and-dusted-now-for-the-clean-up/articleshow/73219000.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala State Commission For Protection of Child Rights has urged all local bodies to devise child-friendly schemes when projects for the utilization of plan fund for the period 2020-21 are prepared. Commission chairman P Suresh informed all local bodies in the state that the chief minister has proposed that child-friendly schemes should be initiated by them.

Taking a cue from this, the child rights commission has written to all local bodies that “when the new plans for projects are being prepared there should be child-friendly initiatives”.

With an aim to make the local bodies child friendly, a pilot attempt was done in six local bodies where children were involved in charting out the projects. The representatives from these local bodies were trained and given a roadmap on how they could plan their programmes in tune with the needs of the children. They were given the broad guidelines to ensure that the four major rights of children —survival, development, protection and participation— are incorporated as per the United Nations Child Rights Commission (UNCRC) convention.

As a first step, initiatives were taken to organize at least a couple of balasabhas in which children were trained to understand the functioning of the panchayats and also about their rights in the society. During the balasabhas the kids had raised several issues like alcohol and substance abuse.

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Only 25% of the total real estate projects sanctioned in Telangana between 2017 and 2019 are RERA-compliant, reveal records . While the state saw over 6,000 ventures being green signaled during this period 80% of them in Hyderabad the Telangana State Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TSRERA) data shows only 1,550 of them have the mandatory Rera registration number.

The Rera regulations in Telangana formulated in July 31, 2017, made it compulsory for all projects “whose building permissions were approved on or after January 1, 2017” to register with the state Rera authority. It also included ongoing projects that were not issued an Occupancy Certificate or Completion Certificate, at the time of rollout.

Yet, many projects continue to thrive without the Rera stamp. The most common violations: advertising and selling without registration number, denying compensation to customers as mentioned in the act and employing marketing agents who are not Rera-certified.

“I have at least three clients from Telangana who have invested in DLF’s Garden City project (Mahbubnagar) and are yet to receive possessions of their plots. While we have filed complaints in two of these with the RERA authority my last letter was as recent as January 4 no action has been initiated against the developer,” said Kailash K Ahuja, a Supreme Court advocate.

Confirming that the implementation of Rera across many states and Union Territories continues to be “patchy”, Satish Vadaga of Anarock said: “Even now, in most states including Telangana it does not provide watertight solutions to problems plaguing the real estate sector such as construction delay. No doubt, homebuyers in many states are still waiting incessantly for their complaints to be addressed and continue to suffer due to delayed adjudication. Despite repeated deadlines given to register projects, a large section of developers has not yet registered their projects with state Rera. Developers are being let off with a penalty of just Rs lakh for late registration .”

Rera officials, however, maintain that they are dealing with violations strictly. “We take action each time a matter is brought to our notice. So far, we have issued 60-70 showcause notices to various projects and imposed fine on 160 of them – of between Rs 50,000 and Rs 3 lakh. In one case, we imposed a fine of Rs 14 lakh while two others were penalised for Rs 25 lakh,” said an official.

Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant briefs the media on Sunday

PATNA: A 45-year-old chartered accountant (CA) Kishan Kumar Agarwal, who was kidnapped from Siliguri in West Bengal on Tuesday, was rescued from Motipur police station area in Muzaffarpur district late Saturday night. The kidnappers had demanded Rs5 crore as ransom from the victim’s family for his safe release.

The police arrested four kidnappers and recovered Rs47.74 lakh out of the Rs50 lakh they had received as ransom from the family for his release. Eleven mobile phones, one pistol and three live cartridges were also seized from their possession. An SUV in which the CA was being shifted to another safer place after receiving part of the ransom money somewhere in Gopalganj district, was also recovered during vehicle checking on the NH-28 in Muzaffarpur district.

Muzaffarpur SSP Jayant Kant said on Sunday that police swung into action following a tip-off that the abductors were planning to shift the captive to other hideouts. A police team led by City SP P K Mandal was assigned the task to check the vehicles. The police spotted the SUV and rescued the captive. Four persons in the SUV were also nabbed.

During preliminary investigation, the kidnappers revealed that Agarwal was kidnapped from Siliguri. The kidnappers kept on changing their locations and visited Bhagalpur, Gopalganj and Muzaffarpur districts to avoid police action. The ransom was demanded from the victim’s family twice using Agarwal’s mobile phone he was carrying with him at the time of kidnapping, the SSP said.

The kidnappers had contacted the family twice on Tuesday evening and on Wednesday morning and demanded Rs5 crore as ransom. A case was lodged with Siliguri police station after the family failed to trace Agarwal, who had left his home at Punjabi Para in Siliguri on a two-wheeler on Tuesday. While the victim’s family resides at Guru Nanak Sarni (ward number 13), his office is located at Hill Cart Road.

An inspector of Siliguri police, Sudip Chakravorty, who came to Muzaffarpur, said the kidnappers were keeping a close watch on Agarwal’s activities. On Tuesday morning, the kidnappers started following him soon after he returned from a local temple with his wife. He left home on a two-wheeler after receiving a call on his mobile phone. Since then he was traceless and his mobile was switched off.

Chakravorty said they contacted their counterparts in Muzaffarpur after the kidnappers’ location was traced in Gopalganj district. The members of the special cell and the district police were keeping a close surveillance on the movement of the kidnappers.

The arrested kidnappers were identified as Ranjeet Gimire of Siliguri, Robin Orang and Anwar Hussain from Assam and Faiz Ahmad of Gopalganj in Bihar . The police were verifying the arrested kidnappers’ connection with the local criminals, if any. “Raids are underway to arrest the other gang members,” Muzaffarpur City SP incharge Mandal said, adding that raids were also conducted in Gopalganj district.

HYDERABAD: India's cleanest district Peddapalli in Telangana added another feather to its cap on Sunday. Peddapalli district has won the Swachhata Darpan award by the Union Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation after it received a 100 per cent score on wide-ranging parameters of sanitation.

This is the 4th national award under Swachh Bharat Mission that Peddapalli has won in a row. Bollywood actor Aamir Khan, who is also the founder of Paani Foundation, was present at the award ceremony. He shared his experience on working on water and sanitation issues through his foundation and the TV show Satyameva Jayate

Speaking on the occasion, Peddpalli collector Devasena said, “Irrespective of political, financial and other challenges if we can capture the imagination of people and get the message across the people on the ground and tell them that sanitation initiatives can change their lives, they will participate and make them a success,”

The parameters that Peddpalli scored high on include construction and maintenance of individual and community toilets, people's participation, information, education, communication and, solid and liquid waste management interventions.

“Our is the first open-drain free district which has led to 65 per cent reduction in dengue. Plastic use reduction and use of cloth and non-woven bags were provided through self-help group production units were taken up,” Devasena told TOI.

Peddapalli has been following Panchasutralu five principles that promote a sustainable lifestyle through circular waste management system, household sanitation and health strategy.

“Once a house is compliant with these Panchasutras, we put up a badge of honour in the form of a sticker on the door of the house. Thirty villages have been made Panchasutra compliant, so far. Sustainability is ensured by appointing Sakhis for every 20 households to monitor the process of waste segregation. Our target is to cover the whole district in two months,” said Devasena.

Trichy: A field trip taken out by a group of citizens involved in restoring the polluted Uyyakondan canal passing through the city has identified spots where sewage discharge and littering into the canal is maximum apart from the poor state of bathing ghats along the 1,000-year-old water body. The study also found out that open defecation was still prevalent in the city.

The study, called ‘Sarpanadhiyin Padhaiyil Orunaal’ (A day in tracking the course of the serpentine canal) rallying on the nickname ‘sarpanadhi’ of Uyyakondan canal owing to its serpentine course while passing through the city, was carried out by the Citizen for Uyyakondan group.

Thirty members from the group began their trail at Uzhavar Sandhai ground in Thennur and covered Palakkarai, Duraisamipuram, Irudhayapuram, Senthanneerpuram, Ariyamangalam, Kattur and Koothaipar. The three-hour-long survey found out that maximum littering and discharge of sewage were spotted at Duraisamipuram and Irudhayapuram.

“Beyond the city limits, Uyyakondan appears comparatively cleaner and free from litters. During the survey, we interacted with farmers who rely on the water body for irrigation. They also acknowledged the presence of sewage in the water,” one of the organisers of the event said.

Besides sewage discharge into the canal in the 8.7km stretch of Uyyakondan in the city, the trail also found out several bathing ghats including the wider one at Duraisamipuram in a dilapidated state.

“A poorly designed steel bridge across Uyyakondan in Palakkarai is fanning mosquito menace as the weeds often accumulate beneath the bridge. We need new bridges to connect either banks of Uyyakondan but should have a good and practical design,” the organiser added. Contrary to the open defecation free city claims of Trichy Corporation, open defecation is still being practised in a portion of Uyyakondan banks between Palakkarai and Kattur. The outcome of the trail is likely to be submitted to the PWD and Trichy Corporation for a cross-platform discussion to suggest solutions, the organisers added.

Representative image

NAGPUR: Police naik constable Ritesh Bhopre, 32, was killed on the spot near Kumar Mararwadi on the Nagpur-Jabalpur Highway , around 53km from city, in a bizarre accident on Sunday. Roadside eatery owner Pappu Pal, who was also injured in the accident, was declared dead at the Trauma Centre of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). At least another eight, including two police personnel, were also injured.

Bhopre, posted with Highway Patrol , was standing with his colleagues, constables Prakash Doye and Ravindra Kamble, near the divider, where Pal was serving them tea and snacks. The cops, attached to Ramtek Traffic Aid Post (TAP), had assembled at the place as usual to check vehicles. Pal had brought some snacks and tea for the cops on his scooter. He was seated on the parked scooter.

A Nagpur-bound Alto car was rammed from behind by a speeding Bolero pickup van some metres away from the group on the opposite of the divider. The car somersaulted across the divider and landed on the other side of the road, where the cops and the food vendor were standing. The Bolero later went on to ram another pickup van from behind.

While onlookers said Bhopre came under the wheels of another truck heading towards Jabalpur, when he tried to get away from the Alto car hurtling towards them, police said they were still verifying the version of various eyewitnesses.

Doye and Kamble were among the injured.

Police said Prakash Gajendra and two women, who were in the Alto car, were also injured. They were rushed to private hospitals at Kamptee and Nagpur along with the cops and Pal by a vehicle of Ramtek police. Gajendra and others too later shifted to hospitals in the city for treatment.

It’s learnt Pal, father of two children, was the sole breadwinner of the family. He was also looking after two children of his elder brother who had passed away earlier.

Ramtek police of Nagpur Rural have registered an offence against Shashi Kawde, driver of the Bolero, and arrested him.

Onlookers said the Bolero car was packed with labourers from Madhya Pradesh heading to farms at Mansar. Some of the labourers too were injured.

Villagers from Kumari Mararwadi held the Highway Patrol responsible for the accident, saying that police regularly stand perilously in the middle of the road to check vehicles. “We see everyday police personnel trying to stop vehicles to check on the highways,” said a villager.

“The national highway authorities have also not made a service road despite there being villages in the vicinity. So many students cross the highways endangering their lives everyday as there are no service roads,” said another villager, who had accompanied Pappu to a city hospital from the accident spot.

419,['13/01/2020'],Pongal sales pick up in city,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Madurai: Walking down the city’s lanes, surrounded by stacks of sugarcane rising high, the gentle waft of manjal kilangu and koorai poo, rangoli powders of vivid colours and beautiful pots, means only one thing, it’s time to get ready for this year’s harvest festival. Hundreds of city folk are flocking to shops for celebrating Pongal.

One of the main elements for Pongal celebrations is the pot used to make sweet pongal. Though the tradition of buying brand new pots every year is no longer as widely followed, shop keepers say the sale of both earthen and metal pots continue to be more compared to other times of the year. “I have been in this profession for decades. Use of earthen pots has decreased drastically over the years with the advent of plastic and metal pots. However, now many people are coming to me talking about medical benefits of using earthen pots and are buying again. During this season, I’ve always had more people buying earthen pots, especially to take them to temples,” said Periya Sundararasan, a 64-year-old potter.

The sales of metal pots too are seeing a general decline, say shopkeepers. “Nobody wants to buy metal pots anymore. It is being considered a waste of space, especially those from higher strata of society. Madurai is still a mixture of both a village and a city that is why our business is still surviving. For Pongal, I see more people buying for decoration and showing off than for genuine needs,” said Jawahar, shopkeeper of a metals store near Keelavasal.

Meanwhile, sale of sugarcane, manjal kilangu, koorai poo and rangoli powder are starting to pick up in the city with two days to go for Pongal festival. “It’s kind of hard to say. I’d say business is normal so far. It depends on the day. Last year, there was absolutely no sale for me on the last day. But, another year that was the day I had most profit. So I am hoping for the best,” said Murugeswaran, a sugarcane farmer from Melur, who has set up a shop in Simmakkal.

Many of those selling seasonal products like manjal kilangu, koorai poo and rangoli powder say they benefit from sales for Pongal every year. “Our family always follows tradition. Every year we buy sugarcane to eat and rangoli powder to put kolams. Our children also see it as something fun to do and it encourages us to keep up the tradition as well,” said Dinesh, a resident of Anna Nagar.

420,['13/01/2020'],‘Clean city’ image takes a beating,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Trichy: It seems that Trichy’s image of being the cleanest city in the state is deteriorating every day. As the door-to-door waste collection practice introduced in the city about two years ago is failing owing to the Trichy City Corporation’s inefficiency, garbage mounds on roads and vacant plots have become a common site these days. Waste collection is happening only on alternate days in several parts of the city. The decision of the corporation to reduce the number of vehicles involved in the door-to-door waste collection seems to have backfired as public littering is on the rise in the city.

Since June 5, 2017, residents have been asked to segregate waste at source and the corporation has been collecting waste from the doorstep. By installing micro compost centres, a decentralised waste collection and recycling centre in all four zones, the corporation has expanded the door-to-door waste collection in all 65 wards. Subsequently, public garbage bins were phased out in 2018-19 pushing residents to rely only on the doorstep waste collection to dispose garbage.

Meanwhile, as mini-trucks started skipping streets and houses, the civic body added around 76 mini-trucks to the fleet in June 2019 for effectively waste collection. It was initiated to enhance waste collection as each mini-truck would have to cover 1,000 houses a day instead of 1,200 houses. While the mechanism was going smooth, the civic body gradually decreased the strength of collection vehicles in the past few weeks as part of a cost-cutting measure.

The corporation had withdrawn around 10 mini-trucks in each zone, forcing each mini-truck to run to cover 1,200 to 1,500 houses every day. This has resulted in lapses again in waste collection. “Waste collection vehicle comes only once in every two days now. Those who lack space to store waste are dumping it on roads,” G Rangasamy, in-charge of an apartment on Benwells Road, Cantonment, said. In the absence of an effective door-to-door waste collection mechanism and public bins, residents and commercial establishments dump waste on roads and vacant plots.

“The number of waste collection vehicles in each zones is reduced due to administrative restrictions. Waste collection is happening on alternate days in a few wards,” an official source with the civic body said. However, officials maintained that the number of waste collection vehicles will be increased. But they blamed the residents for littering in the open.

Madurai: Pongal is around the corner, and the price of jasmine has shot up to Rs 5,000 per kilogram in Madurai due to its poor supply.

During peak seasons, the supply to Madurai flower market is about 10 tonne per day. But it has decreased by 30%-40% since October mainly due to rain in the agriculture belts.

Madurai Meenakshi Flower Merchants Association president Pookadai S Ramachandran said jasmine prices, which were around Rs 3,000 per kg on Saturday, went up to Rs 5,000 on Sunday. ""It may go up to Rs 7,000 or even Rs 8,000 in the next two days because supply is very low. Just half a tonne jasmine came to the market on Sunday,"" he said.

""Winter is usually a lean season for jasmine. The cold weather and the heavy fog in the morning affect the flowering as buds wither due to the moisture,"" said S Santhanam, a farmer from Usilampatti.

R Pandiarajan, a farmer from Eliyarpathi, says that the buds would grow bigger and there would be more flowers by the end of this month, which would bring prices down. Timely rain helped the plants to grow well last year, he said.

The price of all fragrant flowers including pitchi and mullai went up in the last few days as they are used largely in garlands and decorations. Pitchi sold at Rs 1,200 per kg on Sunday while mullai was selling at Rs 2,500 per kg. All these flowers were sold at less than 1,000 per kg last week.

Firecracker (kanagambaram), the orange flower used in garlands, sold for Rs 1,500 on Sunday (it was Rs 700 last week). Sampangi priced at Rs 150/kg, chrysanthemum at Rs 100/kg, and roses at Rs 200/kg were among the cheapest flowers at the market on Sunday.

HYDERABAD: Over 14 months after the RERA rules was rolled out, Telangana is yet to appoint a permanent chairperson for its Real Estate Regulatory Authority. The body does not even have two full-time members, as mandated by the central act. Worse, it hasn’t even constituted a selection committee that is supposed to recommend names to the government, for these positions.The Telangana Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Rules Act came into being in July 2017 – more than a year after the central RERA Act was formulated. While some senior bureaucrats have been given additional charge of the authority from time to time, none have been officially appointed to these posts through government orders.For instance, Somesh Kumar, who is incidentally still listed as RERA chairperson on its website, was only made incharge of the authority, about three months ago. Now, with him elevated as Telangana’s chief secretary, the post is vacant. The ‘leadership’ page also has Arvind Kumar, principal secretary, MAUD and K Vidyadhar, director of town and country planning’s names. But their roles aren’t defined. In fact, Vidyadhar is introduced as secretary of TSRERA, though there is no such post mentioned in the Act.Earlier, in January 2018 special chief secretary, Rajeshwar Tiwari was made in-charge chairperson. He was then in the revenue department. The TSRERA website that went live later in 2018 stated that Tiwari was “designated as Regulatory Authority to manage the affairs under the Act till the regular authority is established”. “The matter is pending with CM K Chandrasekhar Rao,” said a government source, adding: “While some names for selection committee have been forwarded to him, he is yet to take a call on them,” the source said.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220295,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-323953,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/rera-t-yet-to-appoint-its-permanent-chief/articleshow/73219017.cms

TRICHY: Two temporary bus shelters to cater to the Pongal rush have been opened in the city on Sunday. As the Central bus stand becomes congested due to the space crunch, the temporary bus shelters will function throughout festival days till January 20. Pongal will be celebrated on January 15 this year.

The Central bus stand witnesses at least a lakh floating population per day. During festival times such as Diwali and Pongal, the floating population travelling across the state via Trichy is estimated to become double. Keeping this in view, Trichy Corporation jointly with state transport corporation and city police have been installing temporary bus shelters, one on Williams Road in Cantonment and one near Mannarpuram roundabout during festival seasons since 2013.

Police said that the Thanjavur , Tiruvarur, Kumbakonam and Nagapattinam-bound government and private buses will commence their journey from the temporary bus shelter on Williams Road. Similarly, Pudukkottai , Madurai and southern districts-bound buses will start and end their services from the temporary bus shelter established near Mannarpuram roundabout. Buses for other districts will continue to operate from the Central bus stand, officials added.

Since the Mannarpuram temporary bus shelter is comparatively far from the Central bus stand, TNSTC, to enable the commuters to reach the temporary bus shelter, will operate adequate city buses (circular services) between Mannarpuram temporary bus shelter and Central, Chathiram bus stands till January 20. City police have also provided WhatsApp helpline to report traffic violations at 9626273399.

Greater Chennai Corporation

TRICHY: Ending the inordinate delay in commissioning proposals under the smart city mission in Trichy city, a couple of amenities and tourism development projects completed under the mission were inaugurated by Trichy City Corporation on Sunday.

The green space development project taken up by the corporation in Lourdhusamy Pillai Park on East Boulevard Road spending Rs 1.36 crore was completed recently. The renovated public park was the first smart city project in the city to be inaugurated. The park, sprawling across 38,676 square feet, has facilities such as a yoga hall, badminton court, open-air gym, walking track and granite seats.

Similarly, the redeveloped memorial built to commemorate the participation of the British Indian army soldiers belonging to Trichy in World War I (1914-1918) under heritage tourism development project of the smart cities mission was completed by the civic body last month. Having completed the trial run of the illuminating LED lights at an estimated cost of Rs 98 lakh, the civic body on Sunday inaugurated the revamped memorial, which houses a clock tower. Among the 18 proposals initially mooted by the corporation in 2018, these two are the only smart city projects that were commissioned so far. Later in the day, Trichy City Corporation also opened the city’s first smart toilet facility on Allithurai Road near K Abishekapuram zonal office.

The civic body sources said that the smart toilet equipped with sanitary napkin vending machine, incinerator, sensor-enabled automatic cleaning mechanism, CCTV camera was established at a cost of Rs 10 lakh. “After a voice announcement, the smart toilet will flush the floor and urinals once in every 30 minutes to ensure hygiene,” an official with the civic body added.

Four tigers were found dead at Golavali village in the past week

By: Afaq Khan

VALPOI: Condemning the arrest of persons from the Dhangar community after the death of four tigers, between January 5 and 8 in the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, Sattari villagers are up in arms against the forest department. They claim that the department is harassing poor Dhangar families.

The entire strip of the Western Ghats in Goa from Sattari to Netravali has been recognised as a tiger habitat by the 2018 National Tiger Census. Goa’s pastoral tribes, the Dhangars, have been predominantly living in these areas. Villagers say that the authorities’ recent actions after the tiger deaths display their priority of animals over humans. They are demanding strict action against forest officials, and said that they will soon hold a massive agitation against the forest department.

Nandakumar Kopardekar said that it was the negligence of the forest department that had led to the deaths of four tigers in Sattari. “Earlier, the forest department was not even bothered about the wild animals; they only opened their eyes after the deaths,” he said.

According to him, the Dhangar families had been complaining to forest officials about attacks on domestic animals by tigers, but that no action had been taken. “After the deaths, all officials came running to Golavali village,” he said.

Kopardekar said that the heads of some Dhangar families had been arrested by the forest department for their direct or indirect involvement in the killings of tigers. This, he said, had resulted in a financial crisis for the families; in the absence of their breadwinners and domestic animals such as cows. “Forest officials do not have any knowledge of the area demarcation and other forest laws,” he added.

President of the Goa Dhangar Samaj, Sattari, B D Mote told TOI that the government must protect the Dhangar families whose male members were still in the custody of the forest department.

“One girl missed her 12th class preliminary exam as she could not walk through the forest to the main road alone due to fear of wild animals. Her father, who is in the forest department’s custody, would accompany her on this walk,” Mote said. Mote has demanded a complete and transparent probe into the tiger deaths, as he said that the Dhangar community had been facing many hardships related to their livelihood and existence.

Valpoi Block Congress Committee member Krishna Nene said that health minister and Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane did not care about the Dhangar families whose members had been arrested. “If Rane was bothered he would have visited Sattari to talk to the affected families,” he said.

Kozhikode: Increasing number of local bodies in the state are making use of a directive from Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSBD) to declare biodiversity-rich areas in their locality as local biodiversity heritage sites ( LBHS ), thereby endowing the sites with an additional layer of protection.

Just within two months of KSBD issuing the directive, the biodiversity management committees (BMCs) of various local body institutions in four districts have declared as many as nine local biodiversity heritage sites (LBHS) and ground work for declaration of many others are underway.

Interestingly, the biodiversity rich spots which have now come under the cover of protection through the declaration include old heritage trees under the threat of felling in Pathanamthitta and bio-diversity rich ponds and heronries in Thiruvananthapuram and Kottayam.

For instance, the BMC of Vythiri panchayat in Wayanad has declared the famous Changala Maram (Chain Tree) of Wayanad which is steeped in the myth of Karinthandan — the Paniya tribal martyr who showed the way to Britishers to build a road through the Ghats to reach Wayanad and was later shot dead in an act of deceit — as a local biodiversity heritage site.

Kerala State Biodiversity Board member secretary V Balakrishnan said that there has been good responsive from the local bodies for the initiative to declare biodiversity rich spots under their jurisdiction as local biodiversity heritage site (LBHS). Declaring LBHS is part of adopting a local level strategy for conservation of biodiversity rich areas by the BMC considering the diverse landscapes and multitude of ecosystems in the state.

“Declaring a site as a LBHS would legally empower the local level bodies to take action as per Rule 20 of Kerala Biodiversity Rules which endows the BMCs with powers to take action for conservation of local biodiversity. Also, action can be taken against violators under Section 56 of Biodiversity Act, which states that if any person contravenes any direction given or order made by the Union government, state government, the National Biodiversity Authority or the State Biodiversity Board for which no punishment has been separately provided under the Act he/ she shall be punished with a fine which may extend to one lakh rupees for the first instance,” he added.

The state level steering committee for biodiversity has approved the initiative launched by KSBD on trial basis and a government order in this regard will be issued soon. Also, efforts are underway to prepare guidelines to government the declaration of sites and trees as LBHS.

Hubballi: Heaps of garbage have been uncleared for the past 20 days at Siddeshwar Park , a high-profile area in the city, posing serious health hazards to the residents. Foul smell emits at open sites were garbage has been scattered around the bins. HDMC authorities said garbage collection is stopped due to lack of auto tippers.

Dr Subhash Babruwad, a retired district surveillance officer and president of Siddheshwar Park Residents’ Association said stopping of door-to-door garbage collection is nothing new. Eight months ago, tippers collecting garbage were not seen in action for about one-and-half months. “When asked, HDMC officials are saying the tipper is at the garage due to brake problem and they will make arrangement for a tractor which too was not pressed into service,” said Babruwad.

Lata Ravikumar of Siddeshwar Park said residents are left with no other option, but to dump garbage at open sites on roadsides. “A few are dumping garbage to the nalas. The authorities should address the issue immediately,” she said.

“In most of the areas, we are finding it difficult to arrange tippers immediately after one stops due to technical reasons. This is need for 35 auto tippers. We want to keep 3-4 auto tippers in each zonal office. The matter has been discussed with the (HDMC) commissioner and soon procurement will be done. Alternative arrangements will be made for Siddeshwar Park,” said Vijaykumar, HDMC solid waste management executive engineer.

The HDMC has over 180 tippers for garbage collection.

Unscientific humps in Hubballi-Dharwad pose a serious threat to the health of motorists

Hubballi: The uneven speedbreakers on the roads of twin cities often makes travel a bumpy experience for motorists, and leaves them frustrated at the end of the day. Taking cognisance of the enduring problem, the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) has decided to clear the unscientific humps rising like small hills across the twin cities. However, roads without speedbreakers would result in rampancy of rash driving, and to avert such a possibility, HDMC has decided to lay 228 humps across Hubballi-Dharwad, but in a scientific manner, wherein they do not come in the way of a smooth commute.

Work on removing unscientific humps is under way, and is expected to be completed soon.

Along with the uneven humps, the lack of indicators warning motorists of the impending proximity of speedbreakers, and the failure of the authorities concerned to highlight them using bright paint, added to the danger of travelling on the roads of twin cities. Far from serving the intended purpose of preventing rash driving, these humps resulted in accidents. Worse still, doctors have pointed out riding on these bumpy roads can have an adverse impact one’s health .

Hubballi-based neurologist Dr Pradeep Kallolimath, while admitting to the necessity of speedbreakers, said that unscientific humps could aggravate existing problems in the spine and neck. “Those suffering from lumbar and cervical spondylosis are also very vulnerable. It is important to space humps appropriately, and ensure that they are visible during the night and are of the right height and shape,” said Dr Kallolimath.

Sadhbhavana Samiti, a Hubballi-based citizens’ outfit, had moved the court seeking removal of unscientific humps. The samiti president Dr KH Jituri sounded pleased with the fight led by his organisation bringing about its intended result. “All members and officebearers of the samiti have worked tirelessly to bring this change. The case was fought in the court by advocate GR Andanimath,” Dr Jituri told TOI.

HDMC commissioner Suresh Itnal told TOI that HDMC had invited tenders from private companies to lay humps in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Indian Science Congress.

“HDMC is bound by the orders of the court, which has issued directions to lay road humps in the twin cities in a most scientific manner. We have identified 228 black spots across the twin cities with the help of police. We will build these humps near schools, colleges and auditoria to ensure people can travel safely near these normally crowded places. We will also lay humps on roads presently under development,” said Itnal.

HDMC will be laying these humps on roads under its purview and not on those maintained either by the National Highways Authority of India and the public works department.

Grape is the horticulture crop most widely cultivated across Belagavi district

Belagavi: Amid increased interest in horticulture among the agrarian community, the horticulture department in Belagavi has decided to publish a book compiling the stories of those farmers who have managed to turn their fortunes around for the better by switching to horticulture.

Across the district, horticulture crops are being cultivated across 85,177 hectares, and the cumulative of these crops came up to 13,06,364 tonnes last year – the list of crops grown by horticulture farmers includes flowers, spices, vegetables and fruits .

“The officials in the department are now in the process of compiling the stories of more than 400 horticulture farmers across Belagavi. Government schemes launched to support the cultivation of these crops have helped these farmers reap good profits. Although the number of those who benefitted from these schemes is much higher, we have chosen 400-odd farmers for our book,” said Ravindra Hakate, joint director of the department in Belagavi.

Hakate said that they were planning on releasing the book on January 25 or 26 to coincide with the flower show. “We hope that, by distributing this book to farmers presently engaged in the cultivation of traditional crops to grow horticulture produce on their fields, since it could be very profitable for them,” he told TOI.

Pointing to the successful cultivation of grapes across large tracts in Belagavi, Hakate added, “According to figures from 2018-19, grapes are cultivates across nearly 5,000 hectares in the district, and annual production of the fruit comes up to nearly 79,771 tonnes. The second most widely grown fruit in Belagavi is the mango, cultivated in 4,629 hectares, with a production of 58,004 tonnes.”

Belagavi holds the distinction of having the largest parcel of agricultural land used for cultivation of horticulture crops in Karnataka, he said. He said that financial stability was the ultimate yardstick for the success of farmers. “Belagavi has also been registering a steady rise in the cultivation of mushrooms,” Hakate added.

Hubballi: A 42-year-old woman admitted to the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences ( KIMS ), Hubballi with an eye infection had as many as 40 maggots , insects that eat away decaying flesh, from her eyes .

The woman, a native of Tadas village in Shiggaon taluk, Haveri district, was admitted to KIMS on January 7. On screening her eyes, the ophthalmologists found that she suffered from a rare skin condition, lamellar ichthyosis – a genetic condition wherein the patient suffers from extremely dry skin – which afflicts one person out of three lakh.

Dr Rajashekar Dyaberi, an ophthalmologist at KIMS, said that ichthyosis resulted in the skin on the eyelids drying up to such an extent that they turned on their own accord, a phenomenon called entropion. “When this happens, the patient cannot close his or her eyes. When an eye remains open all the while, it is exposed to dust, germs and insects. These insects lay their eggs, which later develop into maggots,” Dr Dyaberi told TOI.

Dr Dyaberi said that timely medical intervention ensured that the maggots did not enter the patient’s brain. The team of doctors comprising Dr Uday Mulgund, Dr Pooja Kini, Dr Varsha Huralikoppi removed the maggots from the patients in time, he said. “The patient’s left eye was badly damaged,” Dr Dyaberi added.

Medical superintendent of KIMS Dr Arunkumar C lauded the efforts of the ophthalmology department, pointing to their expert handling of a rare condition. “They are thinking about the next course of action. Since the patient is differently-abled, we need to consult doctors in other departments before deciding on how to proceed,” he said.

Illustration used for representational purpose

HUBBALLI: Nearly 526 retired soldiers , from sepoy to honorary captain, were cheated by a gang headed by a retired soldier to the tune of Rs 32 crore in the name of investing in a cement company.

On Sunday, the ex-servicemen staged a protest at Indira Glass House demanding justice as they lost their hard-earned money to the gang of tricksters.

Ex-Subedar Major Shivaputra B Kadli told media persons that they fell to the sweet talking of a retired soldier. Kadli said the ex-soldier approached a few retired soldiers and told them that a cement company was seeking investment and offering great returns. He also told them that the offer was only for soldiers and retired armymen.

Initially, a few retired and working soldiers started investing in the so-called cement company and got returns on their investment as promised. Soon, the news spread like wildfire and many ex-soldiers who were seeking a job after retirement, or searching for a good investment on their retirement fund, invested in the company. In the initial days, they too got the returns. However, when the number of investors increased, the company all of a sudden stopped paying the returns, citing various reasons, he said.

Basavaraj Channahalli, a retired naik and a Shaurya Chakra winner, lost Rs 70 lakh by investing in the company. “I have invested Rs 70 lakh with expectations of good returns. I came to know about the company through one of my colleagues. Out of Rs 70 lakh, the majority of the money was loan. I am repaying it, my dreams of having a good post-retirement life has been dashed by this scam,” he said.

Vishnu Hegde, a retired soldier, said he invested Rs 10 lakh in the company. He got only Rs 1.91 lakh and after that he did not receive any money. Like him, many soldiers invested in the company and majority of them got nothing.

The protestors went to the suburban police station demanding to register a zero FIR, but the police did not register the case, suggesting them to approach the court since it’s a money issue.

On the way, he saw his brother-in-law Jayesh having an altercation with some locals over using water in their farms. The argument soon turned violent and Mahesh lost his life when the four locals attacked him and his brother-in-law.According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) publication ‘Crime in India 2018’ it was just one of the 18 murders over water disputes in Gujarat . The state topped the list with 21% of the total 91 murders registered in India due to ‘water dispute.’The state was worse than Bihar (15), Maharashtra (14), Rajasthan and Jharkhand (10 each) in this category, mentioned the report. For Gujarat, it was a near fourfold jump from 5 in 2017 to 18 in 2018 whereas neighbouring Maharashtra had recorded the same 14 instances of murder over water as in 2017. Madhya Pradesh, another neighbouring state, had recorded 14 murders over water in 2017 which went down to 2 in 2018.According to the report, petty quarrels led to 21% of the total murders registered in Gujarat — fourth in India with 211 incidents. The figure was the same in 2017. Love affairs and illicit relationships were other major motives with 158 and 71 murders.In Ahmedabad, murders from petty quarrels rose from 19 in 2017 to 35 in 2018. There were only six murders over love affairs in 2017, which rose to 11 in 2018.There were a total of 1,140 victims in 1,072 cases of murders in which 840 victims were males and 299 were females.

436,['13/01/2020'],Mumbai lost 23% of green cover in millennium’s first decade,"Surprisingly, some island city neighbourhoods like Matunga, Dadar, and Sion saw increases in green cover

Mumbai lost 22.6% of its green cover in the decade spanning 2001-2011, with losses crossing 60% in parts of the western suburbs, according to a new study from IIT Bombay. Some neighbourhoods “witnessed extreme levels of ungreening”, the study said.Sixty-eight of the city’s 88 census wards lost green cover in 2001-2011, found doctoral student V Sathyakumar and professors R.A.A.J. Ramsankaran and Ronita Bardhan, who analysed satellite imagery along with census data to map neighbourhood-level shifts in green cover. Per capita greenery also reduced by a median of 2.8 square metres per person, they found. The decline was not only in quantity, but also quality: most neighbourhoods saw fragmentation of their green spaces.The high losses in the western suburbs reflect the pace of commercial and residential development in the 2000s, said Sathyakumar. These areas are also relatively verdant, he notes, with its proximity to mangroves, the forested Aarey Colony, and Sanjay Gandhi National Park.The worst hit were: Goregaon, which had 62.5% of green space in 2001, but only 17.4% in 2011; Andheri (West), where the percent of green space fell from 63% to 20%; and Malad (West), which went from 62% of green space in 2001 to 19.5% in 2011.Kandivli and Vile Parle saw similarly steep falls in green cover, while eastern suburbs like Mulund and Ghatkopar also saw significant declines.By contrast, the historically densely-populated island city saw smaller reductions in green cover in the same period—Dadar, Sion, and Matunga even saw gains—but also did not have as much green cover to begin with, researchers noted. (In this study, green cover refers to any kind of vegetation, whether trees, roadside shrubs, or parks.) “These findings show the need for targeted greening programmes for different neighbourhoods, specifically to develop more spaces in the island city and conserve and improve those in the suburbs,” said Ramsankaran, an associate professor of civil engineering at IIT Bombay.Fragmentation emerged as a key issue. In most parts of the city, the mean area or size of green space shrank in that decade—the median decrease was 3.21 hectares—while the number of patches per square kilometre increased. Distance between green spaces also fell.Taken together, said researchers, these findings indicate that larger green spaces splintered into smaller ones. The trend was especially intense in suburban areas like Andheri (West), Jogeshwari (West), Goregaon, and Malad (West), where satellite imagery showed “large and aggregated green space patches had turned into isolated single-pixel patches”.Fragmentation indicates deterioration of ecological quality, said Bardhan, who is a lecturer on sustainability of built environment at Cambridge University. “Contiguous green spaces support more biodiversity, provide a larger habitat, and facilitate species dispersal,” she said. “Further, fragmentation makes green spaces more vulnerable to the ‘un-greening’ phenomenon.”Although a few areas in the island city saw per capita green cover rise—in Walkeshwar, for instance—these areas were also depopulating in that period. “Wherever per capita green cover went up, it is primarily because of population decrease,” said Sathyakumar. “But where it went down, it is mainly due to decrease in green space, not population increase.”Indeed, 23 census wards saw a reduction in per capita green cover despite a decline in inhabitants. In 2011, only 47 census wards had more than 9 square metres of green cover per person—an often cited standard compared to 56 census sections in 2001.Surprisingly, some island city neighbourhoods like Matunga, Dadar, and Sion saw increases in green cover. Researchers attributed the improvement in these areas to increased greening along roads and railway lines and the emergence of small green patches in a few residential pockets, as well as relatively stable traditional green spaces. Matunga also a saw a decline in population, Bardhan noted.However, further investigation of these areas is needed, researchers said. In addition, the green cover scenario in the island city areas may have changed in recent years as redevelopment stepped up.Researchers hope their work will help with urban green-space planning. “Traditionally urban green space standards focus only on quantity, specifically green space per inhabitant,” added Bardhan. “Yet, these standards do not reckon the level of fragmentation or accessibility, which have overarching influences on the benefits received by urban dwellers.”",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73219969,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1199769,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/mumbai-lost-23-of-green-cover-in-millenniums-first-decade/articleshow/73219965.cms

Though their belongings were clean, their movements and activities appeared suspicious.They were taken for medical examination during which they underwent an abdomen scan and x-ray. “The presence of foreign substances was detected in their stomachs during the test,” Malhotra said.The seven passengers of the flight have been identified as Yusufzai Rahamatullah, Faiz Mohammad, Nabizada Habibullah, Ahmedi Abdul Wadood, Turkman Abdul Hamid, Fazal Ahmed and Noorzai Kabir.Two others, Hayatullah and Masood Mohammad, are receivers based in Delhi.After a weeklong admission at the hospital, the suspects expelled 177 capsules filled with heroin.“The doctors recovered 28 capsules from Rahamatullah, 38 from Faiz, 15 from both Habibullah and Wadood, 18 from Abdul Hamid, 37 from Fazal Ahmed and 26 from Noorzai Kabir,” he added.During interrogation, the accused revealed their modus operandi. They said an elaborate process is followed for smuggling the drugs into India. Before taking the flight, the Afghan carriers coat large heroin-filled capsules with honey and then swallow these by drinking a special oil.They don't eat or drink anything during the entire flight and excrete the capsules after checking into hotels in Delhi.The operation comes in the background of NCB DG Rakesh Asthana’s directives to intensify the focus on the narco-terror networks, specially the Afghan heroin supply modules that are working in collaboration with Nigerian drug traffickers. “Delhi has become not only a market but also a transit point for Afghan cartels to pass on the drugs to faroff countries,” a senior officer of the bureau said. The NCB has now started a probe on the source and the network’s tentacles in Delhi. Many agents living in west Delhi and Lajpat Nagar are under the scanner.According to police, the arrested passengers were merely the couriers who flew regularly from Kabul and Kandahar to Delhi on medical and tourist visas to hand over the drugs to the agents in the capital. The carriers are paid between Rs 50,000 and 1.5 lakh per trip, officials said.Officials said the Afghan cartels operate in tandem with their African counterparts active in Delhi and Mumbai. The money paid by the African receivers is taken back by the Afghan carriers to be eventually used to launch terror attacks in the Indian subcontinent, the sleuths suspect.The NCB brass has formed a special team led assistant director Kuldeep Sharma and superintendents A K Tiwari and Sunil Kumar.The team includes three investigating officers.Read this story in BengaliRead this story in Marathi",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73221244,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-569490,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/delhi-seven-afghans-arrested-at-igi-airport-forced-to-excrete-rs-10-crore-heroin/articleshow/73219974.cms

MUMBAI: Data submitted to the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) shows that 59 animals and birds died at Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan ( Byculla zoo ) in 2017-18, many of them due to cardiac shock. The mortality rate in 2016-17 was 77 animals and birds.

There are hundreds of species from Schedule-I, Schedule-II and IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, apart from exotic species housed in the zoo. The zoo authority submits quarterly reports to CZA detailing the food provided to animals and birds and their health.

The report has referred to the staff shortage at the zoo. Currently, the number of exhibits on display are less as the zoo is under renovation. But the zoo is in the process of increasing the number of exhibits by carrying out an expansion of the facility. Work at the zoo will take two years to complete and BMC plans to have leopards, lions, giraffe and around 17 other exotic species on the premises.

Recently, the BMC brought a pair of striped hyenas-3-year-old Varun and 2-year-old Sowmya-from the Mysore zoo and a pair of leopards Drogone and Pinto from Mangaluru's Pilikula zoo. They are also in the process of bringing a pair of lions from Sakkarbaug Zoological Garden in Junagadh. Last October, BMC had floated tenders for procurement of zebras from a foreign zoo which are planned to be sent to Sakkarbaug zoo under an exchange programme.

439,['13/01/2020'],Small businesses may see tweaks in resolution model,"(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: The cabinet committee on investment and growth has asked ministries to consider modifications in the resolution mechanism for small companies and the real estate sector under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), apart from revisiting the norms for non-performing assets (NPAs) for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as part of discussions to help distressed segments of the economy and accelerate growth.The decisions have been communicated to ministries after the first meeting of the panel headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, sources told TOI. The committee, which has defence minister Rajnath Singh, home minister Amit Shah, MSME and highways and transport minister Nitin Gadkari , finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and railways, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal, had met over two weeks ago in the backdrop of economic growth sharply decelerating to 4.5% during the second quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal year.While some of the issues have been under discussion, ministries will now work out the details after analysing the issues. Clearly, sickness was one of the concerns, prompting the government to review the bad debt framework for small businesses, something that the Reserve Bank of India has not been open to although it has put in place a liberal set of rules for restructuring loans. The insolvencyrelated concern in the real estate sector is seen to have been largely addressed through amendments to the law.The issue of reference of small loans to the National Company Law Tribunal under IBC has also been discussed by bankers during a meeting with Sitharaman and her team officials. There were suggestions from the ministry of corporate affairs that lenders could look at referring cases above a threshold for insolvency resolution process. But the government had refused to issue any advisory or give a directive.The law does not allow the promoters of companies to bid for companies that are facing insolvency resolution, which often results in small businesses facing liquidation with the founders as well as the lenders not gaining anything from the exercise. Often SMEs face distress due to hold-up in payments from buyers, which could be large businesses or even the government, something that Gadkari had flagged during a meeting with Sitharaman, prompting the Centre to clear arrears and tax refunds.The other focus area seemed to be investment with the cabinet committee asking the department of financial services to initiate specific steps to tackle credit flow crunch that sectors or projects may be facing. Besides, the FDI rules are also being reviewed, an exercise that was independently initiated by the department for promotion of industry and internal trade several months ago.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73222979,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42935,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/small-businesses-may-see-tweaks-in-resolution-model/articleshow/73220018.cms

Wadia hospitals

MUMBAI: Civic authorities on Sunday levelled allegations of fund mismanagement and lack of transparency in the running of the Wadia hospitals , forced to trim medical services due to ""non-payment of grants"" by BMC. The hospitals' admin has called the allegations ""baseless"" and reiterated that BMC owes the mother and children's hospitals Rs 137.29 crore collectively.

Civic officials alleged that an investigation into the books of both Parel-based centres, Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children and Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital, has shown that 10-14 doctors and office bearers were drawing salaries from both hospitals. ""More significantly, our probe shows they have been extending free care to merely 3% patients, whereas as per the original pact it should be for 50 beds which roughly translated to 35-40%,"" said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani.

BMC said it has raised several objections to the hospitals increasing bed strength without keeping BMC or the state in the loop. ""We knew nothing of expansion plans or costs involved,"" Kakani said, adding that even when treatment costs were increased last year, BMC was not formally informed. Kakani said dues were clear till September and a sum of merely Rs 10-20 crore was due. ""We will be clearing that by Tuesday or Wednesday,"" he said. BMC has held back a nominal sum pending the hospital's explanation for money spent, he said, adding that the hospitals' board didn't have proper representation from the state.

In a statement, the hospitals' spokesperson said, ""As per Trust deeds... there are four members from MCGM (BMC) on the board... for children's hospital, and two members each from MCGM and (state government) on the board for maternity hospital, and it is up to MCGM who they want to appoint on the board. MCGM through its representatives on the (boards)... is party to all the decisions of the hospitals"".

MUMBAI: Rashesh Shah , chairman and CEO of Edelweiss , in a letter to media has said that neither he nor his group has any connection with Capstone — a forex firm under investigation with the enforcement directorate.

“Media reports suggest that Sanjay Nathalal Shah, Chartered Accountant and an independent director of a few of our group companies, is alleged to be connected to Capstone. Let me reiterate that he has no other association with the Edelweiss Group, nor is he in any way related to me; you will appreciate that Shah is a common name,” said Rashesh Shah.

According to Rashesh Shah all allegations of Fema violations are false. “We appreciate that regulators and agencies have an obligation to investigate; if any information is sought from us, as a responsible corporate citizen, we will of course provide the same,” he said.

“While it is unfortunate that I was unable to go in person to the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), our senior authorised representative did attend in person with the requisite information. Needless to say, if in the future any assistance or support to the investigation is requested from us, we will cooperate fully,” he said.

On Saturday, TOI had reported that Rashesh Shah had been summoned to appear before the enforcement directorate, in relation to a probe of Capstone Forex, a Mira Roadbased company for forex violations. Shares of the company had fallen 10% after the news.

The unfinished MRTS stretch between Adambakkam and St Thomas Mount. Litigants have highlighted anomalies in ca... Read More

CHENNAI: The land acquisition process of the last 500m stretch for the Velachery-St Thomas Mount MRTS project has hit a roadblock.

Four litigants whose land in Thillai Ganga Nagar is proposed to be acquired by the state government have served a contempt notice to government officials stating that the orders of the Madras High Court in its judgement on June12, 2019, have not been followed and that there was ‘deliberate disobedience of the order’ while calculating compensation for their land.

The notice was issued on January 6, 2020, and received by all offices including the special tahsildar (land acquisition), Chennai district collector, housing secretary and Southern Railway’s deputy chief engineer. A senior government official confirmed receipt of the notice and said they are studying it.

One of the primary issues raised by the litigants is that the state government has planned to acquire only 1,851 square feet of 2,460 square feet land parcel. The remaining 789 square feet would not be put to any use as it would not have any access and hence compensation should be fixed for the entire extent, the litigants stated, adding that the government officials agreed to acquire it after the High Court judgement.

However, when the notice was served recently, it did not mention how the compensation for this land parcel would be calculated.

Moreover, the tahsildar did not issue orders under relevant sections of the land acquisition act and did not conduct a personal enquiry, as mandated by the High Court.

The legal notice also raised an issue over the difference in the rates that the government said it would pay as compensation. While the Thillai Ganga Nagar residents would be paid ₹3,743 per square feet, the litigants across the road would be paid ₹4,500 per square feet, which was not agreeable. “This is arbitrary and discriminatory,” the notice said.

Responding to the legal notice, a senior government official told TOI that apropos the 789 square feet land, a request has been sent to Southern Railway and other state government officials asking for their permission to pay legal compensation for the same. “However, since a host of officials have to accept this, it would take its own due course,” he said, adding that the senior government officials were busy in preparation for the local body elections.

Madras high court

CHENNAI: Should sports broadcasting law be tweaked to enable Doordarshan to stream top sporting events on its Over The Top (OTT) platforms, in addition to its terrestrial and DTH networks on free-to-air basis?

The question will be answered by Madras high court , which is slated to deliver its verdict on the issue on Monday.

The first bench of Chief Justice S P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad has reserved its judgment on a PIL filed by a sound engineer, Aditya Modi, who has questioned the legality of certain provisions of the Sports Broadcasting Act that restrict Prasar Bharti to re-transmit live-broadcast sports events of national importance only through its own terrestrial and DTH networks but not through other mediums of broadcast available on free-to-air basis, including OTT (Over The Top) platforms and cable operators.

""In view of the obvious lacunae in the Act, users/viewers, who do not have access to or use of such networks, are either unable to watch these sporting events of national importance or compelled to watch such sporting events on highly priced sports channels, thwarting the very objective of the Act,"" PIL-petitioner Modi said.

Prasar Bharti does provide OTT services and telecasts Doordarshan channels on free-to-air basis. However, due to non-inclusion of OTT platform in the law, Prasar Bharti is unable to stream such sporting events on its OTT platform, thereby depriving millions of citizens access to live feed of such events, counsel for the petitioner Karthik Seshadri said.

""Due to widespread use of smartphone coupled with the availability of cheap internet data, especially in rural India, a person is able to keep abreast of ongoing events. One is also able to carry a streaming device wherever he travels, and he can also stream any event on the streaming device with ease at any place. However, due to heavy subscription charges levied by the private OTT players, who have rights to broadcast for big sporting events, millions of citizens are deprived of such entertainment due to the embargo placed on Prasar Bharti by the legislature,"" he added.

Therefore, Doordarshan should be allowed to re-transmit such events on its OTT platforms and through cable operators/other networks, Seshadri argued.

With as many as four films and two web series in her kitty, the Hyderabad girl says it feels like she’s hit a jackpot. “From the time I was child, I was very clear about what I wanted to become — an actor! I’m a trained classical dancer and a singer too, and just love to perform on the stage. That’s what drove me to try my hand at modelling after I finished my MBBS in 2017. But winning the Miss India Telangana title truly set me on the course to fulfil my acting dreams,” she says, sharing her excitement.Hailing from a traditional Telugu family that prioritised education over everything else, Kamakshi had her share of struggles to land her ticket to Tollywood. “Look, I don’t have a god-father in the industry. In fact my father had his reservations about my decision to pursue acting. So I knew I had to do all the running myself,” she says, adding, “I started doing theatre to learn the basics of acting and the technical nuances of emoting on stage. I also did few plays and gradually started giving auditions for various projects. That’s how I started meeting people and one thing lead to another and now I have six projects in hand — four films and two web series.” She is presently shooting for the upcoming Akhil Akkineni-Pooja Hegde-starrer directed by Bommarillu Bhaskar. “It’s a rom-com and I play the wife of Akhil’s close friend in the film,” Kamakshi says.She has also signed up an untitled film by Oka Manasu director GV Rama Raju. “It is a proper romantic drama featuring four characters. I play a Telangana village girl who comes to the city in search of work and ends up getting a maid’s job at a gated community,” she says.The character she is playing in Shiva Ganesh’s next, is perhaps closest to what she is like in real life. “I play a proper city girl in the movie. What happens when she falls in love with a ‘good for nothing’ guy who always pretends to be something he is not, is what the story is all about. We’ll start shooting for the film post Sankranti,” shares the actress, who is also acting in Hushaaru director Sree Harsha Konuganti’s next film.

It marks the end of the winter solstice and harvesting of the rabi crops. There is a tradition of donning colourful clothes and dancing and singing around the bonfire to welcome the warm summer days.As per some folklores, the word Lohri is made up of the word 'Lo', which means a big tava, which is used for preparing the feast for the community.The origin of Lohri can be traced back from the tale of Dulla Bhatti, who was a legendary hero of Punjab and led a rebellion against Mughal emperor Akbar. Bhatti received appreciation for his bravery and soon became a hero for the people of Punjab. He is even mentioned in every Lohri song.On this day, the people worship the Sun and the fire and thank them for the good harvest. This day is considered very auspicious for a new bride and babies. The festival is also important for farmers.On this day a huge bonfire is lighted in the yard in the evening and small idols of Lohri Goddess made with cattle dung are place beneath the fire.

Sadly, you are a shopping addict and this is for you. Shopping addicts suffer from a compulsive spending habit. Such people have no control over their spending and are impulsive buyers. They buy anything that catches their fancy, whether it is shoes, dresses or accessories. This uncontrollable desire to buy each and everything in sight plagues almost everyone, specifically the younger generation. And, if you are a shopaholic too, you need to read this piece, as we tell you about ways to control this insatiable demon.Take a firm stand about going to the mall. If you are not in dire need for anything, then you don’t need to visit the mall. When you are constantly hanging around the mall to kill the time then you will spend mindlessly. Everything looks tempting and you will end up making absurd excuses to buy certain products.Whenever you get hit by this sudden urge to something, calm down and then analyse it. Mostly shopaholics buy things when they are feeling emotionally charged. They are either very happy and want to buy something to express that happiness or they are feeling the complete opposite and want to forget whatever is bugging them. They should make a habit of writing down about the urges and how to handle them.We know this seems hard and will be impossible for many, but you gotta keep your cards inside, especially the credit card. Only keep cash as it stops you from spending extra. When you spend money, you know that it's the real cash which will make you think twice as compared to the cards. When you don’t have a card then you won’t be able to make any purchases which seems very harsh at first but works the best.This is one habit that should be embraced by everyone. This helps in keeping track of your expenditure. It gives you a clear picture of the money you have and how can you save it. This helps in stopping the mindless shopping as you are able to see the spending pattern clearly. It also gives you an idea about your funds which will help you a lot in future.To kill one addiction you need to substitute it with another one which is less harmful. Find something which will hold your attention and deviate you from that shopping urge. This alternate route will help you overcome your shopaholic instincts. This is not an ideal option but not a bad one either.There is no harm in asking for guidance and help from your loved ones and close friends. The support you will receive from these people will do wonders for you. You can go one step ahead and seek professional help as well to break this compulsive shopping habit.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73189187,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-993304/73189187.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/buzz/how-to-stop-the-shopaholic-in-you/articleshow/73189187.cms

Modi said the amended citizenship act would force Pakistan’s hand to answer for this persecution.

The PM chose the Belur headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission (RKM), associated with Swami Vivekananda’s life and work, to launch a defence of CAA. “CAA is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship,” he told a crowd comprising mostly RKM monks. The focus of his 30-minute speech was the “youth”. He repeatedly stressed the importance of reaching out to this section, often seen at the forefront of anti-CAA agitations all over the country.

“Had we not brought the amendment, there would not have been any controversy,” Modi said. “Had this dispute not arisen, the world would not have known how minorities in Pakistan are getting tortured and their human rights being trampled. It is the result of our initiative that Pakistan will now have to answer why they have been persecuting minorities for the last 70 years. Human rights have been demolished in Pakistan.”

About half an hour later, on the other side of the Hooghly, the PM trained his guns on the Trinamool government in Bengal during a 32-minute speech at a programme in Kolkata to commemorate KoPT’s 150th anniversary. Renaming the port after Syama Prasad Mookerjee, Bengal’s first and most notable Hindu-nationalist ideologue, he accused the Trinamool government of not implementing Central schemes like Ayushman Bharat and PM Kisan Samman Nidhi because its cadre would not be able to make “cut-money” out of them. “When there is no syndicate or cut money involved, why would someone implement Central government schemes? I don’t know whether they (the state government) would give approval for Central schemes such as Ayushman Bharat Yojana, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, but if they do, people of Bengal will be able to enjoy their benefits,” he said.

Attacking the Bengal Trinamool government, he said: “Eight crore farmers across the country are getting benefited (due to Central schemes). But there will always be pain in my heart (about the schemes not being implemented in Bengal). I will always pray to God for the welfare of farmers and poor patients. May God give them (the Bengal government) good sense.... However, I have a feeling that the people of West Bengal will not remain deprived of Central schemes for long.”

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who met the PM on Saturday, stayed away from the KoPT programme.

In Belur, Modi said that a section of youths was being “misguided”. “We should tell them the truth.... We’ve only done what Mahatma Gandhi had said decades ago. Should we send these refugees back to die? Are they our responsibility or not? Should we make them our citizens or not? Any foreign national belonging to any faith can seek India’s citizenship if he trusts the Indian Constitution. We brought a single change in the act to provide relief to only those who fled their countries due to religious persecution. They were tortured, women became unsafe and their existence was put under question due to their religious identities. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi have wanted India to help such people who are victims of religious persecution in Pakistan. Shouldn’t we give them equal rights as citizens of India? Won’t you support Modi if he does that? I am only doing what Mahatma Gandhi wanted us to do.

“The students can understand the facts, but politicians are not ready to accept that. There will not be any adverse impact of the act on the people of north-eastern states. We have made such arrangements. Despite such clarity, a section of people is spreading rumours about CAA.”

Later, at Netaji Indoor stadium, he said: “I announce that the KoPT will now be known as Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port. He was the father of industrialisation in India, a man who made sacrifices for one nation and one Constitution.”

Kolkata: Bengal BJP general secretary Sayantan Basu was arrested in Cooch Behar on Sunday after he allegedly defied Section 144 restrictions while leading a rally in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Basu, along with several other party functionaries, was going to Gosainhat at Sitalkuchi for the rally when police stopped him, citing Section 144.

Basu refused to obey and was arrested. “The way they have imposed Section 144 is illegal. We will move court against that,” he said. “There was no restriction till this morning. Police have shown us no reason for such a restriction,” Basu further said.

451,['13/01/2020'],PM Narendra Modi misused RKM platform: TMC,"This story is from January 13, 2020

Mamata Banerjee

KOLKATA: The Trinamool Congress issued a point-by-point rebuttal to PM Narendra Modi after his departure from the city, questioning the manner in which he used the RKM headquarters to defend CAA on Swami Vivekananda’s 157th birth anniversary.

“We strongly denounce the fact that the PM chose to make political statements from the RKM platform. This is against the mission’s ethos,” said Trinamool secretary-general Partha Chatterjee.

Party MP Mahua Moitra questioned why Modi chose to “use the stage of Ramakrishna Mission” on Swami Vivekananda’s birthday to “push for CAA”. “The PM chose to make a political statement from the RKM stage, which is not only an apolitical body, but has always raised its voice for inclusiveness,” she told TOI. She said the relationship between Ramakrishna and Vivekananda had been “one of disagreements, yet loving and respectful”. “The PM should learn these values,” she added.

“Ramakrishna Mission has always stayed away from politics,” said senior minister Rajeev Banerjee. “This is why senior monks do not vote. Using the platform of Ramakrishna Mission to further a political stance does not behove the Prime Minister. This is not the ethos of Ramakrishna Mission, which has always had its door open for everyone.”

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee chose not to react directly to the Prime Minister’s speech, but stressed the values and teachings of Swami Vivekananda. “Today, more than ever, Swamiji’s message of peace and universal brotherhood must guide us,” she tweeted. Referring to the fact that the monk’s birth anniversary is also celebrated as National Youth Day, she added, “The youth of the country should come together to dispel the climate of hatred and uncertainty and work for the greater glory of this great nation.”

Trinamool secretary-general Partha Chatterjee had a detailed riposte to the Prime Minister. “The PM and his party are confused,” he told the press. “The party says something, the PM says something else. We are against this effort to make Indian citizens refugees in their own country. We welcome a debate on this.”

MP Abhishek Banerjee said, “Bengal has no differences with PM Modi renaming the Kolkata port after one of the stalwarts of Bengal, as a part of his government’s renaming spree. Sadly, the name change brings very little relief or benefit to the lives of Bengal’s common people. Had the Prime Minister announced any port and/or waterways development initiatives, which created further jobs and investments, it would have been the perfect gift to the youth of Bengal on Swami Vivekananda’s birthday, which we celebrate as National Youth Day.

“The PM spoke on a range of issues. However, he has completely brushed aside the real issues, the needs and concerns Didi has raised with him on several occasions. Swiftly disbursing the approximately Rs 30,000 crore due to be paid to Bengal, a Rs 7,000-crore grant for Cyclone Bulbul, the iron bridge he had promised three years ago for Gangasagar Mela, among other things — all these burning issues, which needed the PM’s attention, were completely missing. Why didn’t he utter a single word about these things? ‪Why does he always discriminate between BJP-ruled states and non-BJP states? Why do all non-BJP-ruled states have to face this apathy from the Centre, similar to Bengal?”

Kolkata: With India eyeing a $5 trillion economy by 2024, the importance of revenue from the maritime sector could go up to $250 billion, defence secretary Ajay Kumar said in Kolkata on Sunday.

He was at a programme where Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) handed over two fast patrol vessels ICGS Amrit Kaur and ICGS Annie Besant to the Indian Coast Guard (ICG).

Kumar highlighted the importance of Coast Guard in safeguarding the country’s maritime assets while this growth happens. “It is this $250 billion economy that the ICG has the responsibility to protect and safeguard,” he said.

ICG director general K Natarajan spoke on how coastal surveillance has increased several fold since the Mumbai terror strikes. “We now have 145 ships, which will go up to 200 vessels by 2025, while 16 new advanced light helicopters will add to 62 surveillance aircraft already in service,” he said. According to Natarajan, ICG responded to 362 distress calls and saved over 1,000 lives in 2019.

Kolkata: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh’s purported statements at Ranaghat — that like Uttar Pradesh and Assam, anti-CAA protesters would be silenced — drew flak from all parties in West Bengal.

While Ghosh did not clarify, Trinamool secretary-general Partha Chatterjee urged restraint among party workers in the face of such provocation. CPM and Congress, too, were critical of Ghosh.

Video grabs of Ghosh speaking at a public rally suggested that he allegedly said: “Whose property do they think they are destroying? They think they will infiltrate our country and do whatever they want. How dare they destroy government property? In Uttar Pradesh and Assam, they have been silenced. They will be attacked by sticks, shot at and put in prison. This will not be tolerated.”

Phone calls to Ghosh late in the evening did not elicit any response. A BJP spokesperson said he was not aware of any such statement by Ghosh.

Chatterjee said: “They are deliberately trying to provoke people by making such statements.” CPM’s Sujan Chakraborty said: “These are the types of people BJP is nurturing.” Congress’ Adhir Chowdhury said: “It is all very apparent whom Ghosh wants to silence.”

The police have pulled down the posters

THANE: Residents of Thane woke up on Sunday to banners put up in public places, wishing gangster Chhota Rajan on his birthday. The banners, on bus stops in Kalwa and Naupada, bear the gangster's photo. The wishes have purportedly been conveyed by a woman and two men whose pictures are also on the banner. The three 'wishers' are from a social organisation that has been named on the banner.

Chotta Rajan, whose real name is Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje, is originally from Chembur. Around four years ago, he was deported from Malaysia. He was recently sentenced to life imprisonment for journalist J Dey's murder.

The police did not confirm if the three people and the organisation concerned had got the banners put up. One case each has been registered at Kalwa police station and Naupada police station against unidentified persons. No one has been arrested so far.

The banners had named Sangeeta Shinde, Raja Gole and advocate Hemchandra More of C R Samajik Sanghatana.

Thane Municipal Corporation's public relations officer, Sandeep Malvi, was not available for comment.

Senior inspector of Naupada police station, Anil Mangle, told TOI that their enquiries with the Thane municipal authorities revealed that no permission had been granted to put up these banners. ""So, we have pulled down the banners,"" said Mangle.

A resident of Ghodbunder Road, Asmith Kandhare, said, ""This attempt to wish the gangster in public is worrying, said Kandhare.

The police have pressed charges under Defacement of Property Act. Another officer said they cannot slap other charges in this case.

About 30 workers came to the plot on Palm Beach Road on Sunday

NAVI MUMBAI: Shocked at the sudden cutting of over 700 trees on a controversial plot on Palm Beach road where a golf course and 17 residential towers have been proposed, locals and activists on Sunday rushed to the police and contacted civic and forest officials to stop the hacking. By late afternoon, the police officials intervened, but significant damage had already been done by then.

“On Sunday morning, over 30 workers came with motorized tree-chopping devices. When locals asked why they are cutting trees even as a case is pending in Supreme Court, we were rudely told that they had permission from Cidco,” said environmentalist Sunil Agarwal.

He said that after citizens and activists showed legal documents, the police stopped further cutting. “A large part of this 35.5 hectare project land has mangroves while sections where residential towers and a country club house are to be built has hundreds of trees. In 2018, Bombay high court put this golf course and housing project on hold. However, Cidco and a private builder moved Supreme Court against the high court order. We will now seek contempt of court proceedings in apex court,'' said Agarwal.

TOI contacted Cidco spokesperson and its environment head, Pramod Patil, for comment on Sunday, but they did not revert.

“It is shocking that the murder of trees is allowed even as a case is pending in Supreme Court... We fail to understand the urgency with which Cidco has given permissions without considering the environmental issues and impact,'' said B N Kumar, founder of NatConnect Foundation.

According to the terms of the offering, the bank could buy the additional shares during the stabilisation period that ended January 9 and give support to the stock, but no such transactions were undertaken during that interval. The IPO relied heavily on individuals and high-net worth investors and funds from the Gulf, with the Saudi government institutions investing $2.3 billion.

CHENNAI: The Greater Chennai Corporation had not expected the overwhelming response when they announced the two-day (January 12, 13) swap shop in Adyar zone ahead of Bhogi Pongal .At the TNHB community hall in Besant Nagar, a steady stream of people came to the swap shop where items ranging from apparels to home appliances such as furniture sets, refrigerators, microwave oven were on display. Due to the surge in numbers, the corporation staff had to open the community hall an hour before the scheduled time and had to shut shop early as the items on display were all sold out.At the end of the day, about 1,800 items were sold at a nominal price of 23,000, with each item on an average priced at 12.75.""We were not very particular about the price. We let the volunteers from residents welfare associations, who helped us in collection of old unused items, fix the price. We wanted to promote the concept of reuse,"" said Alby John, regional deputy commissioner (south), Chennai, who came up with the idea of a swap shop.The civic body's appeal to the Adyar residents for public participation over the past two days had resonated well. ""What they might not need anymore can be of real use to someone else. We roped in members of residents associations. We even did a door-to-door campaign, at the end of which we received items ranging from furniture to home decor and kitchen appliances,"" said an assistant engineer who coordinated a collection drive in Kotturpuram.On Sunday, a refrigerator in working condition, was sold to a contract worker with the civic body for 200 while a sanitary worker took home a microwave for 100.

A few people who dropped off clothes also swapped some,"" an official at the swap shop said.The response has been positive, said John who believed that such initiatives will bring in a change in mindset and encourage people to reuse and recycle instead of shop.

MUMBAI: The toll in the blast at a chemical unit at Tarapur MIDC on Saturday rose to eight as two more bodies were recovered from the debris on Sunday. Meanwhile, it has emerged the chemical unit did not have permission to carry out testing of devices at high temperature.

Deputy director, Directorate of Industrial Health and Safety (DISH), Ashok Khot, said ANK Pharma Pvt Ltd, located on plot M2, had obtained a consent letter from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) on January 2. However, it could not test its equipment without obtaining the required licence and registration from DISH, said Khot. The ground-plus-twostorey building was under construction. The unit, spread across 1,900 sq metres, had been given a provisional noobjection certificate by the Fire Brigade.

The company that manufactures chemical products had not even obtained permission from the Food and Drug Authority (FDA) for bulk manufacture of drugs.

The testing of the autoclave device that uses steam to sterilize equipment and other objects had begun on Friday on the first floor, which was occupied by two families, comprising 11 persons. The owner, Natvarlal Patel (55), who has sustained serious injuries, will be booked, said Khot. The company has four directors, including Patel’s wife, son and daughter-in-law.

The bodies of a liftman, Trinath Dasari (35), and Kushi Yadav (13), recovered from the debris on Sunday.

Prachi and Ritika (3), daughters of Rahul Yadav, a labourer working at the construction site had a miraculous escape as they were playing outside. Their mother, Nishu (26), who was cooking dinner, perished underneath the debris.

Industries minister Subhash Desai and guardian minister Dada Bhuse visited the site. Desai said chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has convened a meeting on Monday to discuss the blast and steps that can be taken in future to prevent such a tragedy.

KOLKATA/BHOPAL: PM Narendra Modi said in Kolkata on Sunday that it was because of the Citizenship Amendment Act that the whole world knew about Pakistan’s “persecution” of minorities. “Had we not brought the amendment, there would not have been any controversy,” he said.“Had this dispute not arisen, the world would not have known how minorities in Pakistan are getting tortured and their human rights being trampled. It is the result of our initiative that Pakistan will now have to answer why they have been persecuting minorities for the last 70 years. Human rights have been demolished in Pakistan,” he said.Addressing a rally in Jabalpur, home minister Amit Shah said those who raised slogans against India would be put behind bars. “Some students raised anti-India slogans, ‘’ at JNU. Shouldn’t they be put in jail? Those who raise antinational slogans will be sent behind bars,” he said at the CAA outreach rally.Shah challenged former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee to point out a single provision in CAA that could take away an Indian’s citizenship.“Congress and opposition parties are misleading the nation on CAA and instigating minorities,” he said, adding, “After independence, Congress divided the country on the basis of religion.” Shah said the government “will not rest” until all the refugees from minority communities from Pakistan are given Indian citizenship.Significantly, Modi chose the Belur headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission, associated with Swami Vivekananda’s life and work, to launch a full-throated defence of CAA. “CAA is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship,” he told a crowd.The focus of his speech was “youth”. The birth anniversary of Vivekananda is celebrated as National Youth Day. The PM said a section of youth was being “misguided”. “We should tell them the truth... We’ve only done what Mahatma Gandhi had said decades ago. Should we send these refugees back to die? Are they our responsibility or not? Should we make them our citizens or not? Shouldn’t we give them equal rights as citizens of India? I am only doing what Mahatma Gandhi wanted us to do,” he said.Speaking at another event, Modi trained his guns on the Trinamool government. Renaming Kolkata Port Trust after Syama Prasad Mookerjee, he accused the state government of not implementing central schemes because its cadre would not be able to make “cut money” out of them.In Video: Youth being misguided by rumours on CAA, says PM Narendra Modi",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220565,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-156918,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/have-done-what-bapu-sought-decades-ago-pm-modi-on-caa/articleshow/73220142.cms

BENGALURU: About 5,000 activists representing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), Hindu Jagaran Vedike (HJV) and other right wing organisations took out a protest march at Kanakapura in Ramnagara district on Monday against the proposed installation of a 114-foot-high Jesus Christ statue atop Kapalabetta.Elaborate security arrangements have been made for the Kanakapura Chalo organised by the Sangh Parivar .Ramanagara superintendent of police Anoop A Shetty on Sunday said adequate police personnel were deployed for the march between 11am and 1pm to ensure law & order is maintained. ""Permission for a peaceful protest has been granted,"" Shetty said.Sources said about 1,000 police personnel, with teams headed by 10 police inspectors and 30 sub-inspectors, will be on the ground.Hindutva ideologue and RSS functionary Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat is expected to lead the march and address the gathering.Bhat said: ""The rally will be peaceful as our objective is to appeal to the government to stop the installation of the Christ statue on Kapalabetta as it goes against the spirit of communal harmony and encourages religious conversions carried out by Christian missionaries.""The issue row hit the headlines after former minister and senior Congress functionary DK Shivakumar, who represents Kanakapura assembly segment, laid the foundation stone for the statue on December 25.BJP leaders pointed out that 10 acres sanctioned for it are gomala land (reserved for cattle grazing).While revenue minister R Ashoka said the government would take the land back, the district administration has conducted spot inspections and slapped two notices on Harobele Kapalabetta Development Trust which will install the statue.""We have replied to one notice and will submit the second reply on Monday,"" said trust member Chinnaraju.Shivakumar appealed to the people of Kanakapura to maintain peace during the march.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73224941,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46910,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/karnataka-sangh-parivar-rally-today-in-kanakapura/articleshow/73220146.cms

Representative image

CHENNAI: Police on Sunday arrested a senior journalist, V Anbazhagan, on charges of threatening office- bearers of the Book Sellers and Publishers Association of South India (Bapasi), organisers of the ongoing annual book fair at YMCA grounds in Nandanam, after he was asked to remove his book stall.

Police said he had violated rules of the book fair and displayed books that were against the government. Anbazhagan had released the replies to his RTI queries as a book titled 'Makkal Seidhi Maiam', that allegedly exposed corruption in the state government's various departments, including the Smart City mission.

Bapasi office-bearers alleged he abused them when they asked him to remove the stall. Police were called in and they arrested Anbazhagan and booked him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including criminal intimidation. He was remanded in judicial custody by the Saidapet court.

According to Bapasi office-bearers, those wishing to set up a stall at the fair should abide by its rules. They should not display books banned or against the government. Anbazhagan, they said, agreed initially to all the conditions but violated the rule later. Bapasi president R S Shanmugam on Saturday sent a notice to Anbazhagan asking him to vacate the stall.

Opposition party leaders including DMK president M K Stalin, AMMK general secretary T T V Dhinakaran and MDMK general secretary Vaiko condemned Anbazhagan's arrest.

Taking to Twitter, Stalin condemned the action saying Anbazhagan's book exposed the prevailing corruption in the Edappadi K Palaniswami government. The arrest of the journalist showed the restlessness of this government, he said, and urged it to immediately release the journalist and give him permission to run the book stall.

Dhinakaran termed the arrest 'high-handedness' of the government and an attempt to curtail freedom of speech. He asked the government to release the journalist immediately. MDMK general secretary Vaiko too condemned the arrest.

BENGALURU: After coming full circle — from Hesaraghatta in 2008 to Mysuru, Ramanagara and Roerich Estate on Kanakapura Road and back to Hesaraghatta — the Karnataka government’s Film City project is on ecosensitive grasslands on the outskirts of Bengaluru.The government plans to develop it on the private-public-partnership model. As per a preliminary proposal, accessed by TOI, the Infrastructure Development Corporation of Karnataka (iDECK) said the project has been planned on 25 acres currently under the animal husbandry and veterinary sciences department. Sources in the government said it may be expanded to over 200 acres.The animal husbandry department has around 347 acres in the vicinity.However, environmentalists suggest it will put the state’s green cover and fodder bank inperil. They claim that in the last 20-25 years, Karnataka has already lost at least 4% of grasslands due to unscientific urbanisation and haphazard development.“If the Film City further erases grasslands, where will shepherds go to graze their cattle?” asked environmentalist Suresh Heblikar.Estimates suggest that around 75 lakh shepherds, also a large votebank, depend on grasslands for their livelihood. Officials claim there may be minimal damage to the grasslands as there will maintain a 2-kilometre buffer zone from the green cover. However, the buffer zone has disappeared in the region due to rapid development and construction.“It would be best to consider a location in North Karnataka as it will have a better impact on people in underdeveloped districts. It will provide more attractive locales for film shooting and spare Bengaluru more congestion,” Heblikar said. The proposed location is accessible to other film industries, apart from Sandalwood, and tourists by air, road or rail.The centrepiece of the Film City is the Government Film and Television Institute (GFTI) located on 2 acres in Hesarghatta.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73220174,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-738785,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/film-city-in-bengaluru-greens-worried-over-eco-impact/articleshow/73220175.cms
