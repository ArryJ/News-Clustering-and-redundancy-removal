0,2020/03/10,Coronavirus | Sports events hit worldwide by outbreak of COVID-19,"Santosh Trophy — AIFF postpones final round

The final round of the Hero Santosh Trophy 2019-20, scheduled to be played in Aizawl, has been postponed in wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. This comes after an health advisory issued by the government with regards to the Covid-19 outbreak.

Lockdown in Italy

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the suspension until April 3 of all sporting events in the country, including the top-flight Serie A football league.

Questions remain about getting the season finished. At least three rounds of matches will need to be rearranged after April 3 before the end of the season scheduled for May 24.

There is little room for manoeuvre because of Euro 2020 beginning on June 12. And there are also concerns that Euro 2020, due to be hosted across 12 countries including Italy, might face an unprecedented cancellation.

LaLiga too confirmed on Tuesday that first and second division matches in Spain will be staged behind closed doors for at least two weeks.

Fans banned

Barcelona’s Champions League round of 16 return match against Napoli scheduled for March 18 has been ordered to be played behind closed doors because of the coronavirus outbreak, both clubs announced Tuesday.

Wednesday’s Rhine derby between Borussia Monchengladbach and Cologne will be the first Bundesliga game to be played behind closed doors due to the coronavirus, local authorities announced on Tuesday.

German Football League (DFL) chief Christian Seifert warned Sunday that “the season must end by mid-May” in order to ensure clarity over promotion, relegation and qualification for international competition.

Sevilla’s match at home to Roma in the Europa League on Thursday will also be put behind closed doors.

Organisers of the Miami Open tennis said the tournament was still set to go ahead, a day after the ATP/WTA Indian Wells event in California was cancelled due to coronavirus.

A brief statement released Monday by the Miami organisers on Twitter said preparations for the March 23-April 5 event were “moving forward as scheduled.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/xydy9k/article31033626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Bahrain-Coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-sports-events-hit-worldwide-by-outbreak-of-covid-19/article31033611.ece
1,2020/03/10,"Vikas, Simranjit enter final of Asian Qualifiers","It was revenge for Hu, an Olympic and world bronze-medallist who lost to Amit Panghal in the Asian semifinals last year.

A resolute Vikas Krishan (69kg) and Simranjit Kaur (60kg) advanced to the finals with impressive victories but the legendary M C Mary Kom (51kg) and world number one Amit Panghal (52kg) signed off with bronze medals at the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman on Tuesday.

Also ending with bronze medals were Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) and Pooja Rani (75kg). All the six boxers have already secured their tickets to the Olympic Games by making the semifinals but Krishan and Kaur will come back with at least silver medals after entering the finals.

Krishan fought with a cut sustained on his left eyelid before claiming a split decision victory over second seed Ablaikhan Zhussupov of Kazakhstan, a two-time world bronze-medallist.

The 28-year-old Krishan will face feisty Jordanian Eishaih Hussein, who sent Asian gold-medallist and top seed Bobo-Usmon Baturov packing in a split decision.

Krishan, a former world bronze-winner and a Commonwealth Games gold-medallist, was the busier of the two boxers despite the injury he picked up in the second round and his right jabs were particularly effective through the bout.

Kaur, on the other hand, upstaged third seed and Asian silver-medallist Shih-Yi Wu of Taiwan in a terrific come-from-behind win. The Indian trailed in the opening round, roared back in the second with her precisely-placed combination punches before fending off a strong attack from Wu in the final three minutes.

She will take on Korea’s Oh Yeonji in the final on Wednesday.

In another good result, first-timer Sachin Kumar (81kg) remained in the hunt for an Olympic berth by defeating Manh Cuong Nguyen of Vietnam 4-1 in the first box-off. He will have to get the better of Shabbos Negmatulloev of Tajikistan in the last box-off on Wednesday to book a ticket to Tokyo as only the top five qualify in his weight category.

However, in a major disappointment for India, six-time world champion Mary Kom lost to China’s Chang Yuan, a former Youth Olympics champion, in a split verdict.

Also bowing out with a bronze was world silver-medallist and top seed Panghal, who went down to Jianguan Hu of China in a split 3-2 decision. It was revenge for Hu, an Olympic and world bronze-medallist who lost to Panghal in the Asian semifinals last year.

Panghal had endured exhausting contests in the run-up to the semifinals and he could not outpace the determined Chinese in Tuesday’s clash.

Earlier, two-time world bronze-medallist and second seed Borgohain lost to third seed and 2018 world silver-medallist Hong Gu of China in a unanimous 5-0 verdict after struggling to find her range against the experienced 30-year-old.

Rani too could not find her rhythm against world champion and top seed Li Qian, who is also a two-time Asian gold-medallist.

Eight Indian boxers have qualified for the Tokyo Games at the ongoing event so far, making India the most successful team here along with traditional powerhouse Kazakhstan.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kql8wr/article31033706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VikasKrishan,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympic-bound-amit-panghal-lovlina-borgohain-end-with-bronze-medals-at-asian-qualifiers/article31031224.ece
2,2020/03/10,"Sindhu, Saina chase glory as All England Championships get underway amid coronavirus outbreak","Concerned about over COVID-19 fears, seven Indian shuttlers, including former top 10 player H.S. Prannoy and world No. 10 men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy have withdrawn from the All England

Undeterred by the coronavirus outbreak, Indian shuttlers will continue to chase glory at the All England Championships beginning here on Wednesday, with reigning world champion P.V. Sindhu spearheading the campaign.

The season’s first Super 1000 event witnessed a dramatic build-up in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, which has claimed over 4000 lives and infected more than 100,000 people globally.

In the United Kingdom itself, the number of infected people has gone past 300 with five deaths so far.

A number of tournaments, including the German Open, was postponed since the deadly disease first broke out in Wuhan, China, affecting the preparation of the shuttlers for the Tokyo Olympics.

Concerned about their health, seven Indian shuttlers, including former top 10 player H.S. Prannoy and world No. 10 men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Satwiksairaj Rankireddy have withdrawn from the All England.

The $1,100,000 BWF world tour event offers 12,000 ranking points to the winner and with the Olympic qualification on the line, most of the top players will be seen in action at the Arena Birmingham.

While Sindhu, who is almost assured of an Olympic berth, will look to end a nearly two-decade-old title jinx at the All England Championship by adding the coveted title to her 2019 world championships gold, former silver medallist Saina Nehwal and Kidambi Srikanth will eye valuable points to squeeze inside the top 16 before the deadline for Olympic qualification ends on April 28.

Chief national coach P Gopichand was the last Indian to win the championship, in 2001. Sindhu will look to overturn a run of recent poor finishes and emulate her mentor with the top medal.

World No. 6 Sindhu, who had reached the semifinal in 2018, will need to cut down on unforced errors and strengthen her defence as she opens against USA’s Beiwen Zhang. The 24-year-old is expected to take on Korea’s Sung Ji Hyun if she crosses the opening hurdle.

Saina, who had made it to the finals in 2015, is in dire need of some ranking points to qualify for the Olympics and she will face a stern test against third seeded Japanese Akane Yamaguchi in the opening round.

Former world No. 1 Srikanth, who had reached the quarters in 2019, will have to get across Olympic champion and third seed Chen Long to have any chance of going deep in the draw and retain his ranking points.

World championships bronze medallist B. Sai Praneeth, who is also almost assured of a berth at Tokyo, will open against China’s Zhao Jun Peng.

Former Commonwealth Games champion Parupalli Kashyap, who is coming back after recovering from a back injury at Spain Masters last month, will be up against Indonesia’s Shesar Hiren Rhustavito in the opener.

Young Lakshya Sen, who had claimed five titles last year, will be making his debut in the prestigious tournament and he will begin against Hong Kong’s Lee Cheuk Yiu.

Among other Indians, Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Siki Reddy will face Australian pair of Setyana Mapasa and Gronya Somerville in women’s doubles, while Sikki will pair up with Pranaav Jerry Chopra to take on top seeded Chinese Zheng Si Wei and Huang Ya Qiong.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/gt4kst/article31030185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KASHYAP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sindhu-saina-chase-glory-as-all-england-championships-get-underway-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/article31030186.ece

4,2020/03/10,"I want to give the country an Olympic gold, says Vikas Krishan","Vikas Krishan acknowledges the support of BFI and its coaches

Despite shuffling between amateur and professional boxing, seasoned boxer Vikas Krishan has handled the challenges well to ensure an Olympic quota place in the 69kg category.

Vikas — a former World youth champion, youth Olympics medal winner, World championships bronze medallist and an Asian Games gold medallist — had switched to professional boxing in 2018, but returned to the amateur fold late last year to chase his ultimate dream of winning an Olympic medal.

After securing a quota place, in the Asia/Oceania Olympic qualifier in Amman, Jordan, for what would be his third Olympic appearance, Vikas was relieved.

“Am quite satisfied after achieving my first target of qualifying for the Olympics on the first attempt. I had trained very hard for this,” Vikas told The Hindu on Monday.

“It was difficult to switch from amateur to professional and vice versa. I trained overtime to make it look easy. I want to give the country an Olympic gold.”

Neeraj’s advice

The 28–year-old, who weighs around 70kg, followed his friend and professional boxer Neeraj Goyat’s advice to jump back from 75kg to 69kg. He acknowledged the support of the Boxing Federation of India (BFI) and its coaches, who took care of his switch-back to amateur boxing.

Vikas said his maturity worked to his advantage in Amman. “I have become more mature now and it helped me in the ring. I was never under immense pressure, which is generally seen in amateur boxers. “I have boxed at Madison Square Garden and other places in New York. So that helped me deal with pressure as boxing is a mind game.”

Past and present

One of the finest boxers India has ever produced, Vikas has enjoyed his journey for more than a decade. “I boxed with two generations — Vijender Singh, Jitender Kumar, Akhil Kumar, Dinesh Kumar and Jai Bhagwan in the past and Amit Panghal, Satish Kumar and Manish Kaushik now.

“The previous generation was tough and the present one too is tough. I love the boxing sense of both generations and the way Indian boxing has been growing,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/yh529d/article31025461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10VIKAS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/i-want-to-give-the-country-an-olympic-gold-says-vikas-krishan/article31025462.ece

Google has announced machine images, a new type of Compute Engine resource that contains all the information people need to create, back up or restore a virtual machine, reducing the amount of time people spend managing their Cloud environment.

Custom images capture the contents of a single disk, for example, a boot disk, which can be used to create new instances that are preconfigured with the apps that you need.

Machine images are a more comprehensive resource that can contain multiple disks, as well as all of the information required to capture and create a new instance.

According to Google, it will reduce the time network admins and data scientists spend managing their cloud environments by eliminating extra steps and streamlining operations.

“In addition to storing complete instance properties and data, machine images use the same differential disk back-up technology that powers incremental snapshots, giving you fast, reliable and cost-effective instance back-ups,” explained Ari Liberman, Product Manager, Google Compute Engine.

“The new machine images make it easy to create new instances at the heart of your scalability, backup and disaster recovery strategy,” he added in a statement.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/li4riz/article31031192.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETGOOGLECLOUD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-cloud-unveils-machine-images-to-simplify-work-flow/article31031193.ece

9,2020/03/10,Pope tells priests to go out and meet the sick,"The restrictions -- including checkpoints on roads and in railway stations -- are set to remain until April 3

Pope Francis urged Catholic priests on Tuesday to “have the courage” to go out and help those sickened by the novel coronavirus, hours after Italy was placed on a nationwide lockdown.

“Let us pray to the Lord also for our priests, that they may have the courage to go out and visit the sick... and to accompany the medical staff and volunteers in the work they do,” the pontiff said during a mass in Vatican City.

St Peter's Square in the Vatican — in the centre of the Italian capital Rome — was almost empty on Tuesday with only a few dozen people walking around, most of them without masks.

The Italian government has asked for people not to travel if they can avoid it and to avoid contact with the sick.

Officials passed a decree late Monday extending nationwide restrictive measures that had been put in place at the weekend in the hardest-hit northern regions.

The restrictions -- including checkpoints on roads and in railway stations -- are set to remain until April 3.

Italy is the epicentre of the European virus outbreak with more than 9,000 cases and 463 deaths so far.

Globally, more than 110,000 cases have been recorded in over 100 countries, although health experts are hopeful that the virus has peaked in China, where it originated late last year.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i2hjv6/article31033928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Pope,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pope-tells-priests-to-go-out-and-meet-the-sick/article31033929.ece
10,2020/03/10,Putin opens door to changes that would allow him to stay in power until 2036,"Mr. Putin is required by the constitution to step down in 2024 when his second sequential and fourth presidential term ends

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday opened the door to constitutional changes that would allow him to remain in power until 2036 if he chose to do so, despite saying he had misgivings about the legal amendments.

Mr. Putin, who in January unveiled a major shake-up of Russian politics and a constitutional overhaul, is required by the constitution to step down in 2024 when his second sequential and fourth presidential term ends.

But addressing the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Mr. Putin on Tuesday gave what he suggested was his reluctant blessing to a proposed change to the constitution that would formally reset his presidential term tally to zero.

“The proposal to remove restrictions for any person, including the incumbent president ... In principle, this option would be possible, but on one condition - if the constitutional court gives an official ruling that such an amendment would not contradict the principles and main provisions of the constitution,” Mr. Putin said.

The move, if adopted and backed in a nationwide vote on April, would allow him to serve another two back-to-back six year terms. If he chose to do that, and his health and electoral fortunes allowed, he could stay in office until 2036 at which point he would be 83.

A former KGB officer, Mr. Putin, 67, has served four presidential terms in total and also done a stint as prime minister, dominating the Russian political landscape for two decades.

Critics have accused him of plotting to use changes to the constitution to extend his rule beyond 2024. Mr. Putin has not spelled out what his plans are after that date however, but has said he does not favour the Soviet-era practice of having leaders for life who die in office.

Mr. Putin appeared before parliament on Tuesday after Valentina Tereshkova, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party and the first woman in space, told parliament she was proposing amending the constitution in a way that would reset his presidential term count back to zero.

The proposal came as parliament was examining and preparing to vote on Mr. Putin's constitutional shake-up in its second of three readings, something it later did, approving it.

Another ruling party lawmaker on Tuesday proposed holding snap parliamentary elections, currently scheduled for September 2021, once the constitutional reform was out of the way.

Mr. Putin was cool to that idea however, saying he saw no need to hold snap elections if there were no disagreements in the existing parliament.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/74itj8/article31032678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUSSIA-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/putin-opens-door-to-changes-that-would-allow-him-to-stay-in-power-until-2036/article31032679.ece

Only self-sufficient societies will be able to overcome such a serious challenge, leading to multipolarity as the only option,” says Alexander Dugin, a Russian author, also known as Russian President Valdimir Putin’s “brain,” in a conversation with The Hindu.

The precipitous overnight drop in oil prices — from West Texas Intermediate (WTI) down to $33 per barrel on Monday, after selling at $45 last Thursday — followed the collapse of the OPEC+talks with Russia over the weekend. When the Russians refused to cut back supply as demanded by cartel’s leader Saudi Arabia, apparently to stabilise prices in a shrinking COVID-19 hit market, the OPEC+alliance to coordinate energy flows outside the U.S. imploded.

Amid the bitter Russia-Saudi Arabia spat, Riyadh announced that it would step up supplies, to secure shrinking market share, despite the inevitable collapse in the prices in a world awash with oil, as none of the OPEC suppliers and Russia would now be constrained to curtail output by artificially defined quotas.

But behind the Saudi-Russia clash, a bigger back story was also unfolding, embracing Washington and Moscow, surrounding the geopolitics of the under-construction Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that is to transit Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) from Russia to Germany.

In December, the U.S. passed a provision linked to the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA), which would sanction any vessel serving Gazprom, the Russian energy giant, in laying the Nord Stream 2 pipeline along the Baltic Sea. That led Switzerland’s Allseas Group to immediately withdraw from the project,

The U.S. opposes this pipeline as it increases Europe’s energy reliance on Russia. The pipeline also bypasses Washington’s key ally Ukraine, on Russia’s doorstep, denying Kiev lucrative transit fee and political leverage over Moscow.

The Russians have argued that by denying Moscow energy access, the U.S. is securing its own LNG footprint in Europe, following the shale gas revolution . In June, U.S. President Donald Trump had exhorted Germany that instead of buying Russian piped gas, Berlin should purchase U.S. LNG.

But following the weekend decision to walkout of quota restrictions, the Russians have breached a giant hole in the U.S. energy fortress. By driving prices to $33 a barrel, the Russians have hammered the U.S. shale industry badly. “Not one company in our coverage can keep production flat for more than a few months while spending within cash flow at $35 WTI,” Bloomberg quoted Charles Meade of Johnson Rice & Co. as saying.

“There will be many bankruptcies in our industries and tens of thousands of layoffs over the next 12 months,” Scott Sheffield of Pioneer Natural Resources told the Washington Post.

Unsurprisingly, shale stocks plunged on Monday, with heavyweights such as EOG Resources, Whiting, Continental Resources and Apache sliding over 30%.

The Saudis too are expected to take a hit as oil prices tank. Analysts point out that without billions of petro-dollars of oil money, “Vision 2030” — a grand project-driven initiative of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) to transition the kingdom to a more sustainable economic future — is under threat.

“Multi-trillion dollar investments are needed so that these projects can both wean Saudi Arabia off its hydrocarbon addiction and also create more than 6 million jobs to employ Saudi Arabia’s youth. If the economy crashes on the back of an oil price war, then MBS may find his key projects and, by extension, his legacy under threat,” says Cyril Widdershoven, a global energy specialist in a post on the website oilprice.com.

Despite oil prices flattening, the Russians seem to be better prepared to confront the crisis. “Russia has got the best hand in the geopolitical oil game,” says Max Keiser, programme host on Russia Today (RT). He points out that Russian production cost is around $7 a barrel. Though this cost is higher than that of Saudi Arabia, Moscow, unlike Riyadh has no external debt, a major factor shoring up its financial stability. Besides, Russia along with China has accumulated large reserves of gold, the ultimate hedge in a stock market in free fall.

According to Mr. Keiser, along with the oil price crash, the world is witnessing “part-two” of the 2008 financial meltdown, with the likelihood of the credit bubble blowing up again.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i6edot/article31032487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001PR1Y8,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/analysis-coronavirus-pits-russia-saudi-arabia-and-the-us-worlds-top-energy-producers-in-a-destructive-price-war/article31032488.ece

A Jerusalem district court on March 10 rejected Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s request to delay the start of his corruption trial, ruling it would begin as planned next week.

Mr. Netanyahu’s lawyers had appealed for a delay, saying they needed more time to review evidence. State prosecutors responded that they opposes any delays and the court accepted their position.

Mr. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in connection to a series of scandals that include accepting expensive gifts from wealthy friends and offering to exchange favours with powerful media moguls. The long-ruling Israeli leader denies any wrongdoing.

His legal troubles stood at the centre of last week’s third inconclusive Israeli election in less than a year.

13,2020/03/10,London man second patient to be cured of HIV,"The patient made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months

A second patient has been cured of HIV after undergoing stem cell transplant treatment, doctors said Tuesday, after finding no trace of infection 30 months after he stopped traditional treatment.

The so-called “London Patient”, a cancer sufferer originally from Venezuela, made headlines last year when researchers at the University of Cambridge reported they had found no trace of the AIDS-causing virus in his blood for 18 months.

Ravindra Gupta, lead author of the study published in The Lancet HIV, said the new test results were “even more remarkable” and likely demonstrated the patient was cured.

“We've tested a sizeable set of sites that HIV likes to hide in and they are all pretty much negative for an active virus,” Mr. Gupta said.

The patient, who revealed his identity this week as Adam Castillejo, 40, was diagnosed with HIV in 2003 and had been on medication to keep the disease in check since 2012.

Later that year, he was diagnosed with advanced Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a deadly cancer.

In 2016 he underwent a bone marrow transplant to treat blood cancer, receiving stem cells from donors with a genetic mutation present in less than one percent of Europeans that prevents HIV from taking hold.

He becomes only the second person to be cured of HIV after American Timothy Brown, known as the “Berlin Patient”, recovered from HIV in 2011 following similar treatment.

Viral tests of Mr. Castillejo's cerebral fluid, intestinal tissue and lymphoid tissue more than two years after stopping anti-retroviral treatment showed no active infection.

Mr. Gupta said the tests uncovered HIV “fossils” — fragments of the virus that were now incapable of reproducing, and were therefore safe.

“We'd expect that,” he said.

“It's quite hard to imagine that all trace of a virus that infects billions of cells was eliminated from the body.”

Ethical dilemma

Researchers cautioned that the breakthrough did not constitute a generalised cure for HIV, which leads to nearly one million deaths every year.

Mr. Castillejo's treatment was a “last resort” as his blood cancer would likely have killed him without intervention, according to Mr. Gupta.

The Cambridge doctor said that there were “several other” patients who had undergone similar treatment but who were less far along in their remission.

“There will probably be more but they will take time,” he said.

Researchers are currently weighing up whether or not patients suffering from drug-resistant forms of HIV might be eligible for stem cell transplants in future, something Mr. Gupta said would require careful ethical consideration.

“You'd have to weigh up the fact that there's a 10-percent mortality rate from doing a stem-cell transplant against what the risk of death would be if we did nothing,” he said.

Commenting on The Lancet study, Sharon Lewin, an infectious disease expert at the University of Melbourne, said the findings could provide comfort to patients.

But she advised caution.

“Given the large number of cells sampled here and the absence of any intact virus, is the London patient cured?” she said.

“Unfortunately in the end, only time will tell.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i4ccrd/article31032191.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hkg3005919,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/london-man-second-patient-to-be-cured-of-hiv/article31032192.ece
14,2020/03/10,U.S. begins military pullout from two Afghan bases,"The United States is keen to end its longest-ever conflict, and under the terms of a deal signed in Doha last month has said all foreign forces will quit Afghanistan within 14 months

American forces have started pulling out of two bases in Afghanistan, a U.S. official said Tuesday, the day peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban were due to start despite widespread violence and a political crisis.

The United States is keen to end its longest-ever conflict, and under the terms of a deal signed in Doha last month has said all foreign forces will quit Afghanistan within 14 months — provided the Taliban stick to their security commitments.

Under the accord, the U.S. is initially supposed to cut its troop presence from about 12,000 currently to 8,600 by mid-July, and close five of its roughly 20 bases across the country.

Troops have started leaving one base in Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province in the south, and another base in Herat in the west, a U.S. official said on the condition of anonymity.

Even with the drawdown, U.S. forces retain “all the military means and authorities to accomplish our objectives”, Colonel Sonny Leggett, spokesman for U.S. Forces-Afghanistan, said Monday, referring to American counterterrorism operations and support for Afghan forces.

Helmand, which along with neighbouring Kandahar province is considered a Taliban stronghold, is where U.S. and British forces fought some of the bloodiest campaigns of the 18-year war.

Omar Zwak, spokesman for Helmand's governor, said that “20 to 30” foreigners had left Lashkar Gah since the weekend.

The initial drawdown comes as the Taliban, which see themselves as having achieved “victory” over America, test the Pentagon's resolve to protect local partners by conducting dozens of low-level attacks against Afghan forces. The U.S. has only responded to a few of these attacks.

Kabul chaos

Under the terms of the withdrawal deal, the Taliban are supposed to tackle jihadists such as the Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda, as well as hold talks with the Afghan government that were due to start Tuesday.

But Kabul is in disarray and appears unable to present a unified front to negotiate with the Taliban.

On Monday, President Ashraf Ghani was inaugurated for a second term following an election that was marred by fraud allegations while his rival, former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, also declared himself winner and swore himself in as premier in a parallel ceremony.

Washington has denounced Abdullah's self-inauguration, urging unity in Kabul ahead of negotiations with the Taliban.

“Prioritising an inclusive government and unified Afghanistan is paramount for the future of the country and particularly for the cause of peace,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday.

Peace talks were supposed to start Tuesday but have been thrown into limbo by a dispute over the release of Taliban prisoners — something the insurgents have demanded as a prerequisite ahead of negotiations, but which Mr. Ghani has so far refused to do.

Mr. Ghani was expected later Tuesday to announce a decree on the issue and reveal details of the negotiating team.

A member of the Taliban's leadership council — the Quetta Shura — said that the insurgents had delivered a list of the 5,000 captives they wanted freed to the Afghan government.

But he accused Kabul of acting in bad faith, alleging that “the government (planned) to release only those prisoners who are elderly, very ill, or those whose sentences have expired”.

The Taliban's political spokesman Suhail Shaheen tweeted Tuesday that any prisoners “handed over to us ... will be accepted (only) after verification by our delegation”.

“They should be the people whose names are in the list,” Shaheen wrote.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hgd6db/article31031819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-AFGHANISTAN-US-CONFLICT-MILITARY-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-begins-military-pullout-from-two-afghan-bases/article31031820.ece
15,2020/03/10,"South African court clears Cyril Ramaphosa of misleading parliament, money-laundering","Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane had alleged in July that the South African President deliberately misled parliament about the 500,000 rand donation for his campaign to succeed Jacob Zuma as head of the ruling African National Congress

South Africa's High Court on Tuesday cleared President Cyril Ramaphosa of lying to parliament about the source of donations to his 2017 campaign to lead the ruling party, setting aside a potentially damaging report by a powerful anti-graft watchdog.

The high court judges described the watchdog's approach as based on a mistaken and “fatally flawed” reading of the law.

The case was seen by many analysts as a proxy of the bitter power rivalry inside the ANC between supporters of Mr. Ramaphosa and his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma.

Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane had alleged in July that Mr. Ramaphosa deliberately misled parliament about the 500,000 rand ($32,500) donation for his campaign to succeed Jacob Zuma as head of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).

In her report she said there was also prima facie evidence of money laundering involving millions of rand in the handling of the donations, sparking an angry response from Mr. Ramaphosa, who swiftly challenged the legality and motivation of the report.

The high court, in a sitting of three justices, concurred with Mr. Ramaphosa's complaint.

“It is apparent from the report that the Public Protector was confused about the legal foundation of her finding,” said Keoagile Elias Matojane.

“The Public Protector's finding on the issue of misleading parliament is fatally flawed due to a material error of law.”

The court added that there was no evidence to support the allegation of money laundering and that it was also outside of the watchdog's jurisdiction to investigate the donations as they were of a private, and not public, nature.

The finding against Mkhwebane's conduct, which includes the award of costs for Mr. Ramaphosa's lawyers, is likely to bolster calls for her removal from office by opposition parties.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/na8ox2/article31031794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CYRILK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-african-court-clears-cyril-ramaphosa-of-misleading-parliament-money-laundering/article31031795.ece
16,2020/03/10,Trump not coming to Moscow for Victory Day: Kremlin,"Putin said it would be “a mistake” for world leaders not to attend the Victory Day celebrations this year.

U.S. President Donald Trump will not be coming to Moscow for Victory Day celebrations on May 9, the Kremlin said Tuesday.

Russia has repeatedly invited Mr. Trump to visit Moscow on the 75th anniversary of victory in World War II — the nation’s most important holiday. Mr. Trump said last year he appreciated the invitation, but wasn’t sure if he could go as the celebration falls “right in the middle of political season.”

“Via diplomatic channels, we have received information that the (U.S.) president will not be coming,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Tuesday, adding that it remains unclear who will represent the U.S. on the Victory Day in Moscow.

Mr. Peskov didn’t give a reason for Mr. Trump’s refusal to come.

In an interview with the state-run Tass news agency, a part of which was released Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it would be “a mistake” for world leaders not to attend the Victory Day celebrations this year.

“I think that, concerning former members of the antiitler alliance, the right thing to do would be to attend (our event), from both a domestic political stance and a moral one,” Mr. Putin said. “We look forward to seeing them and we will be glad if they come.

Iran said on Tuesday that COVID-19 killed 54 more people, raising the death toll to 291 amid 8,042 cases in the Islamic Republic.

Iran is the hardest-hit country in the Mideast by the new virus, which sickens but largely doesn’t kill those afflicted.

Elsewhere, Lebanese Health Ministry official said that a man has died from COVID-19, marking the first known death from the infections in the country.

The official says the 56-year-old man had recently returned from Egypt. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to give official statements.

The Mediterranean country has 41 confirmed cases of of the new coronavirus — most of them linked to Iran. At least one patient who returned from Iran has left the hospital after two weeks successful treatment.

Lebanon has been hit by a severe financial and economic crisis since October, particularly after mass protests against the country’s ruling elite broke out in October. But street demonstrations have been minimal since the outbreak of COVID-19.

Across the region, there are over 8,600 confirmed cases of the virus. Worldwide, there are over 110,000 confirmed cases of the new virus, with more than 3,800 deaths attributed to it. The number of people who have recovered is about 62,000.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

19,2020/03/10,Dutch king apologizes for colonial killings in Indonesia,"King Willem-Alexander, during his first State visit to the former Dutch colony, formally recognized the Southeast Asian country’s independence date

King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands apologized on Tuesday for his country’s aggression during its colonial rule of Indonesia and formally recognized the Southeast Asian country’s independence date, in his first State visit to the former Dutch colony.

The king’s apology was conveyed after he and Queen Maxima were hosted by Indonesian President Joko Widodo and his wife, Iriana, at an official ceremony in the ornate colonial-style presidential palace in Bogor, just outside the capital, Jakarta.

The Netherlands did not initially apologize for its 350 years of colonial rule and aggression until 2013, when the Dutch ambassador expressed remorse for a series of massacres carried out by the Dutch military to crush resistance against colonial rule in Java and Sulawesi islands after Indonesia’s 1945 declaration of independence. That apology came only after the victims’ widows took the Dutch government to court.

“In line with the previous statement by my government, I would like to express my regret and apologize here for the excessive violence on the part of the Dutch in those years,” the king said Tuesday at a joint news conference with Widodo. “I do so with full awareness that the pain and sorrow of the affected families will be felt for generations.”

Indonesia declared its independence from Dutch colonial rule on Aug. 17, 1945, but the Netherlands refused to acknowledge it and fought unsuccessfully to maintain control of the lucrative Asian outpost. It finally recognized the country as an independent nation in December 1949.

Indonesian authorities claim some 40,000 people were killed during the fighting, while most Dutch historians estimate the dead at about 1,500.

A 1968 Dutch report acknowledged “violent excesses” in Indonesia but argued that Dutch troops were conducting a “police action” often incited by guerrilla warfare and terror attacks. The Dutch government has never prosecuted any soldiers for the killings despite a U.N. report condemning the attacks as “deliberate and ruthless” as early as 1948.

Previous apologies

The 2013 apology by the Dutch ambassador cleared the way for the biggest-ever Dutch trade mission to Indonesia in November 2013, led by Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

Subsequent apologies were made by Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders in 2016 and Mr. Rutte late last year during visits in Indonesia. But unresolved demands from those affected by past war crimes still loom large over the monarch’s current visit.

“On Aug. 17, it will be 75 years since Indonesia declared its proclamation, claiming its place among free and independent countries,” the king said on Tuesday. “Today, the Dutch government explicitly acknowledged it both politically and morally.”

Four-day State visit

The four-day State visit by the royal couple, who arrived in Jakarta on Monday, aims to deepen economic ties with Indonesia. It’s the first trip to Indonesia for the king since he ascended the throne in 2013, and the fourth for the queen, whose previous trips were part of her role as U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development.

The king and queen started their busy day Tuesday by laying a wreath at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery to honor Indonesia’s war dead, especially those who fell during the War of Independence. In the afternoon, the royal couple laid a wreath at Menteng Pulo Cemetery, the resting place of almost 4,300 Dutch soldiers who died during World War II and the independence war.

The king and Mr. Widodo witnessed the signing of agreements for economic partnership in the areas of agriculture, health care, coastal protection and the maritime industry.

Under the Widodo administration, ties between the two countries have strengthened significantly.

“We certainly cannot erase our history, but we can learn from the past,” Mr. Widodo said. “We try to learn from history to strengthen our commitment to build an equal relationship that respects and benefits each other.”

Mr. Widodo’s visit to the Netherlands in 2016 was the first by an Indonesian leader since Abdurraham Wahid in 2000. In 2010, then-President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono canceled a visit at the last minute amid moves by a separatist group to have him arrested for alleged human rights violations.

The Dutch royal couple is scheduled to meet the Sultan of Yogyakarta on Wednesday. On Thursday, the king and queen will visit Lake Toba in North Sumatra province, one of Indonesia’s “10 new Balis,” an ambitious plan to boost tourism and diversify Southeast Asia’s largest economy. They will also visit Sebangau National Park on Borneo island on Thursday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6bdfor/article31031406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INETHK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dutch-king-apologizes-for-colonial-killings-in-indonesia/article31031407.ece

A 10-year-old boy and his mother have been rescued 52 hours after being trapped in the collapse of a virus quarantine site in southeastern China where 20 people have died.

Video released by rescuers showed the two being pulled from the debris of the hotel that collapsed on Saturday. The woman and boy were discovered late on Monday night and they were freed around midnight after three hours of painstaking digging.

The hotel in the city of Quanzhou had been a quarantine site for people exposed to the new coronavirus (COVID-19), which for most people causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The death toll in the collapse rose to 20 on Tuesday, with 10 people missing. A total of 71 people had been inside the hotel when it crumbled in mere seconds.

The building had been illegally reconstructed several times, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted an unidentified senior official saying Tuesday. Shang Yong, Deputy Head of the Ministry of Emergency Management, told reporters a comprehensive accident investigation would be launched to identify the cause of the collapse, and any official found responsible would be held to account.

Construction of the building began in 2013 and it was converted into an express hotel in 2018.

Two supermarkets on the first floor were being remodelled, and a pillar reportedly deformed a few minutes before the collapse, Xinhua said on Sunday, quoting a district official.

21,2020/03/10,"Biden, Sanders consider changing campaign plans amid coronavirus outbreak","The winner of the Democratic nomination battle will take on Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 general election.

Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders on Monday said they were consulting with public health experts about coronavirus risks in planning their next campaign moves, as election officials in upcoming primary states urged people to consider voting early.

Neither Mr. Sanders, a U.S. Senator from Vermont, nor Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has yet called off a major rally because of the outbreak that has sickened more than 110,000 people globally, although public health officials have urged people at risk for contracting the disease to avoid large gatherings.

The winner of the Democratic nomination battle will take on Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 general election. Mr. Trump has said he would not stop holding campaign rallies.

“Every organization in America is taking a hard look at what the coronavirus means for their operations, and yes, thats true of our campaign, as well,” Mr. Sanders said at a roundtable on the outbreak in Michigan, one of six states that vote Tuesday in the next round of the state-by-state nominating competition.

“We do not hold a rally without first conferring with local public health officials.

Mr. Biden told NBC on Monday he would consider calling off rallies if health authorities warned they were too risky

“I'm looking to the CDC for advice on that,” Mr. Biden said, referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We're going to follow the recommendations of the experts ... and if they conclude that there shouldn't be big indoor rallies, then we'll stop big indoor rallies.”

A “Women for Trump” bus tour set to be led by the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, was canceled on Monday, his campaign said. The tour was canceled due to scheduling issues, the campaign said. The New York Times reported that sources close to the campaign said the cancellation was spurred by concerns over coronavirus.

Several of the states holding primaries in coming days have adopted measures aimed at protecting voters from contracting or spreading the virus.

Florida's government urged voters to consider voting early for its March 17 Democratic presidential nominating contest, and Arizona braced for the possibility of poll workers staying home that day.

In Michigan, which votes Tuesday, officials told poll workers to step up plans to sanitize voting booths and other equipment. Washington state – the hardest hit state in the country – caught a break because its Tuesday contest is vote-by-mail.

Fears of the spread of the virus have led officials to cancel events and conferences across the country, including a planned Saturday event by Democrats in Washington state.

In Florida, election officials seeking to keep residents from standing on long lines, on Monday encouraged absentee and early voting in the state's primary on March 17.

Arizona officials are bracing for the possibility that poll workers will not show up on March 17 due to illness or fear. They are combing through a statewide volunteer database to identify potential replacements if needed, according to the Arizona Department of State.

In Cook County, Illinois, which includes Chicago, officials are seeking the power to extend voting hours on March 17, reassign early voting locations and even change voting days, according to Frank Herrera, a spokesman for the county clerk's office.

Florida, the nation's third most populous state and home to a large population of elderly people, has 19 confirmed cases of the virus and has declared a state of emergency.

State voters who have symptoms can designate someone to pick up their absentee ballots up until election day, Laurel Lee, Florida's secretary of state, wrote on Twitter on Monday.

Florida authorities have emailed local election officials recommendations from the CDC on how to prepare polling places amid the spread of the virus. The recommendations include advising poll workers to stay home if they feel ill and steady cleaning of voting locations throughout the day.

A quirk in how delegates are won under Democratic Party rules is raising the stakes for Tuesday’s elections, allowing a candidate to make up ground in the race quickly — or fall further behind.

Five states – Michigan, Washington, Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho – hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday, while North Dakota has a caucus. All told, there are 352 delegates up for grabs. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to win the Democratic presidential nomination.

That makes for only the fourth-largest delegate night on the primary calendar. But the intricate arithmetic of how delegates are won under Democrats’ rules makes it possible for a candidate to reap a bigger haul of delegates with a smaller margin of victory on this Tuesday than on any other night.

For Bernie Sanders, it’s an opportunity to catch up to Joe Biden, who enters the day ahead by 96 delegates. For Mr. Biden, it’s a chance to open up what could become an insurmountable lead.

Most delegates awarded Tuesday – 65% – will be won based on how the candidates perform in individual congressional districts. Think of each district as holding a bucket of delegates. There are also two buckets of delegates in each state awarded based on the overall statewide vote.

On Tuesday, that makes for 51 buckets of delegates across the six states. A candidate needs to win at least 15% of the overall vote in a bucket to be “viable” — or to qualify to win delegates. (That 15% threshold means it’s all but assured that only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders win any delegates from this point forward.)

First, the math. Party rules say each viable candidate wins a proportion of the delegates in each bucket based on his share of the votes cast for the viable candidates in that bucket.

Second, the quirk. Buckets that have an odd number of delegates are impossible to split evenly, meaning either Mr. Sanders or Mr. Biden is guaranteed to win at least one more than the other.

Say, for example, there are seven delegates in a bucket, and Mr. Sanders gets 51% and Mr. Biden gets 49% of the viable votes. In delegates, that’s 3.57 to 3.43 — a difference of just 0.14 delegates. But thanks to rounding, Mr. Sanders gets four and Mr. Biden gets three.

Nearly two-thirds of the 352 delegates at stake on Tuesday are in buckets with an odd number of delegates — more than on any other night with more than one primary.

Democratic National Committee member Elaine Kamarck, who was Walter Mondale’s delegate hunter during his campaign for president in 1984, said it’s “odd” how the odd-even districts work out, but it all adds up to whoever does best on Tuesday waking up Wednesday with “a comfortable haul.”

But wait, it gets better – or worse, if you’re the candidate who ends up behind. After the primaries on March 17, most of the delegates to be won come from buckets with an even number of delegates.

Why does that matter? It means Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders will need to win far more than 50% of the vote in a bucket to win more delegates than his rival. From a bucket holding six delegates, a candidate needs more than 58.3% to win four delegates. In a district with eight delegates, the leader needs 56.3% to get five.

Put another way, a candidate could keep coming in second in the overall vote, but so long as he keeps the race relatively close, he’ll still end up with the same number of delegates in an “even” bucket as the candidate who finishes first.

And that means whoever does best on Tuesday, and next week when Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois get their turn, could end up with a delegate lead that can’t be beat.

“It’s just funny how the numbers just work out,” Kamarck said Monday, and that means Tuesday night is “a big deal.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/p7rvba/article31030548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SANDERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/odd-quirk-raises-delegate-stakes-in-tuesdays-us-elections/article31030549.ece
23,2020/03/10,Six questions heading into next set of Democratic primaries,"Michigan and Washington, the states with the two largest delegate counts on Tuesday, are critical.

The newly formed two-man race for the Democratic presidential nomination debuts Tuesday, a week after Joe Biden benefited from a rapid consolidation of moderate and establishment voters, while Bernie Sanders outlasted Elizabeth Warren as the progressive left’s last hope.

Can Sanders actually catch Biden?

Fresh off Mr. Biden’s Super Tuesday surge, when he won 10 out of 14 state contests, the former vice president has 664 delegates to Sanders’ 573, according to Associated Press calculations, with some still to be allocated. Mr. Sanders’ deficit isn’t insurmountable, considering 1,991 delegates are needed for the nomination. But the Vermont senator’s hill is steeper than it might look given Democrats use a proportional system to award delegates, not a winner-take-all model like Republicans.

Michigan and Washington, the states with the two largest delegate counts on Tuesday, are critical. Mr. Sanders topped Hillary Clinton in both states four years ago, with his Michigan primary win giving him the momentum to carry on through the end of the nominating calendar in June. Even then, he never could catch Ms. Clinton.

Following Michigan in 2016, Mr. Sanders’ single largest net gains came in three caucuses — Idaho (plus-13 for Mr. Sanders), Utah (plus-21) and Washington state (plus-47). The bad news for Mr. Sanders — Utah switched this year to a Super Tuesday primary, so those delegates already are accounted for. Washington and Idaho hold primaries Tuesday, with a larger, more unpredictable turnout expected than in 2016. Even if Mr. Sanders wins in those states, it will be difficult to replicate the margins he managed against Ms. Clinton, and the later it gets in the process, the more a second-place candidate must run up the score to catch the delegate leader.

As former candidate Andrew Yang says- “It’s just math.”

If there’s no real path, will a Sanders protest campaign remain?

Top Sanders aides look back at 2016 and admit that the democratic socialist was running to make a point and didn’t expect his bid to blossom the way it did. This time, everyone in Mr. Sanders’ circle said he’s running to win. What does that mean if any reasonable path is closed? If Mr. Sanders remains, and his passionate base along with him, will they act more as advocates for his progressive preferences as an aggressive insurgency bent on attacking Mr. Biden?

Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have stuck mostly to differences on policy and vision. But Mr. Biden has made clear he’s aware of Mr. Sanders’ more outspoken supporters on social media. “I know I’m going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the ‘Bernie Brothers’ will run,” Mr. Biden told a group of donors over the weekend. “But we can’t tear this party apart and reelect Trump. We have to keep our eyes on the ball.”

Where do Elizabeth Warren’s backers go?

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren ran as a progressive in Mr. Sanders’ ideological lane, for months even avoiding her own single-payer health insurance proposal with a simple line — “I’m with Bernie.”

But Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden aides have always quietly argued that Ms. Warren had more overlap at the ballot box with candidates like Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris each more moderate and establishment than Sanders. Put another way, Ms. Warren’s cultural lane white college – educated urban dweller – was more important than her ideological lane.

That worked well for Mr. Sanders when the field was crowded. Now, it’s not quite so helpful, with Super Tuesday trends suggesting Ms. Warren’s backers don’t migrate cleanly to Mr. Sanders. In fact, there was evidence that some of her supporters chose Mr. Biden even before Ms. Warren dropped out, since Mr. Biden won her home state of Massachusetts.

Turnout: Will a November anti-Trump coalition continue to take shape?

More surprising than Mr. Biden’s win total on Super Tuesday was the coalition behind it.

In Virginia, about 500,000 more voters cast ballots in 2020 than in the 2016 primary, and it didn’t help Mr. Sanders, who watched his vote share drop from 35% in 2016 to under 25% this year. Mr. Biden, alternately, drew about 200,000 more votes than Ms. Clinton did four years ago, fueled by his expected base of African Americans but also by white voters in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.

In North Carolina, Democratic turnout increased by 180,000 votes, with similar tendencies among urban and suburban voters. Those trends in two November battleground states suggest an expanding Democratic electorate deeply dissatisfied with President Donald Trump.

The diversity in Michigan – with heavily African American Detroit, the racially and ethnically mixed Detroit suburbs and wide swaths of working-class voters – will offer another general election battleground measure for that coalition’s enthusiasm.

Will non-Southern black voters deviate from Southern trends?

African Americans showed up for Mr. Biden in a huge way on Super Tuesday, helping him win a competitive Texas primary and by wide margins in Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia. Whether that translates beyond the South could determine the outcome in Michigan and Missouri.

In Detroit, Michigan’s largest city, more than 78% of residents are African American. Black voters are key in St. Louis and Kansas City, as well. Mr. Sanders likely will be hoping for a younger black electorate — AP VoteCast data from Super Tuesday showed the senator about even with Mr. Biden among black voters younger than 45.

But older African Americans usually vote in higher proportions. Mr. Biden expects a big victory in Mississippi, where a solid majority of Democratic ballots will be cast by African Americans. In neighboring Alabama last week, more than 7 out of 10 black voters chose Mr. Biden.

Who consolidates Labour’s rank and file?

Michigan has more than enough union members to sway a presidential primary (about 600,000, according to federal statistics). Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both make a claim on being labor’s candidate, Mr. Biden more through relationships with union leaders and Mr. Sanders with direct appeals to the rank and file.

Mr. Sanders got the better of that mix in Nevada. The Culinary Union there nodded to Mr. Biden by criticising Mr. Sanders’ single-payer “Medicare for All” health insurance idea, but the union didn’t endorse, and caucus sites up and down the Las Vegas Strip showed Sanders got rank-and-file support.

Mr. Sanders will likely need a repeat in Michigan, where the most high-profile labor group – the United Auto Workers hasn’t taken a side.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/moltt7/article31030337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020BERNIESANDERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/six-questions-heading-into-next-set-of-democratic-primaries/article31030338.ece

Canada has recorded its first death from COVID-19, health officials in the westernmost province of British Columbia announced on March 9.

The victim, a man living at an elderly care facility, ""was infected with COVID-19 (and) passed away last night,"" the province's health officer Bonnie Henry told reporters. Officials have not released the victim's age.

Henry said he had been a resident of the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. Two other residents and two caregivers had also tested positive for the disease. The facility is designed to house around 200 elderly people.

Canada has recorded more than 70 confirmed coronavirus infections, nearly all of which are in British Columbia or Ontario, the most populated province.

25,2020/03/10,China quarantine hotel collapse toll jumps to 20,"The owner has been summoned by police while investigators work to determine whether the renovation or an original structural issue was at fault, according to the ministry

The death toll from the collapse of a hotel used as a coronavirus quarantine facility in eastern China has risen to 20, authorities said on March 10, with 10 others still feared trapped in the rubble.

Forty-one survivors pulled from the wreckage are injured, the Ministry of Emergency Management said at a press conference Tuesday.

The building in the coastal city of Quanzhou had been repurposed to house people who had recently been in regions hard hit by COVID-19, according to local newspaper Quanzhou Evening News.

The hotel collapsed on Saturday night, with footage published by local media appearing to show the building's facade crumbling to the ground in seconds, exposing the structure's steel frame.

The city has recorded 47 cases of the virus.

Footage from the Ministry of Emergency Management showed rescuers helping children put on surgical masks before pulling them from the remains of the six-storey Xinjia hotel.

A 12-year-old boy told rescuers his mother was still buried in the rubble. ""She was next to me just now,"" he said in the video. His mother was rescued alive hours later, according to the ministry.

Rescuers were also seen spraying disinfectant on each other as part of ""strict decontamination"" measures between shifts.

Besides the 61 people pulled out of the wreckage, nine others escaped on their own, the ministry said.

The first floor had been undergoing renovation since before the Lunar New Year holiday, and authorities said construction workers called the hotel's owner minutes before the collapse to report a deformed pillar. The owner has been summoned by police while investigators work to determine whether the renovation or an original structural issue was at fault, according to the ministry.

Quanzhou Evening News reported Sunday that all of the people quarantined in the hotel had tested negative for the virus.

The emergency management ministry said some 200 local and 800 Fujian Province firefighters had been deployed to the scene along with 11 search and rescue teams and seven rescue dogs, according to Xinhua.

The National Health Commission said it had dispatched to Quanzhou 18 medical experts from the nearby cities of Fuzhou and Xiamen.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ky1qb/article31029782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001PO7IL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-quarantine-hotel-collapse-toll-jumps-to-20/article31029783.ece
26,2020/03/10,COVID-19: Italy orders nationwide lockdown as new cases surge,"Italy's 60 million people will only be able to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies until April 3

The whole of Italy will be placed under lockdown until next month, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced on March 9, in an unprecedented and unexpected new attempt to beat COVID-19 in Europe's worst-affected country.

Conte told reporters that measures introduced just two days ago in much of the north were no longer sufficient after a jump in deaths tied to the highly infectious disease, and said the entire nation had to make sacrifices to stop its spread.

“The right decision today is to stay at home. Our future and the future of Italy is in our hands. These hands have to be more responsible today than ever before,” Conte said, adding that the norms would come into force on Tuesday.

Italy's 60 million people will only be able to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies until April 3. All schools and universities, which were closed nationwide last week until March 15, will now not reopen before next month.

The contagion only came to light near Italy's financial capital Milan on Feb. 21. Since then there have been some 9,172 confirmed cases and 463 deaths, putting the national health system under massive strain.

Conte said all outdoor public gatherings would be forbidden and announced that all sports events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, would be suspended, throwing the closely watched championship into disarray.

“We don't have any time. The numbers are showing that there has been a significant growth in infections, people in intensive care and deaths,” he said in a sombre address. “Our habits have to change right now. We must give things up for Italy.”

Struggling to contain the outbreak, Italy imposed strict controls on travel from the northern region of Lombardy and parts of neighbouring Veneto, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna on Sunday. Those restrictions were now being extended so the same rules would govern the whole country, Conte said.

The government has already ordered cinemas, theatres and museums to close and told shops and restaurants to ensure that patrons remained at least a metre (yard) apart.

All restaurants and bars will now have to close at 6 p.m. and all Alpine ski resorts must shut. However, public transport would remain operational throughout Italy.

Jail Riot

The curbs announced at the weekend had already taken their toll on Milan, with its streets much quieter than normal on Monday and many smaller shops and cafes closed. Even among those left open, most remained empty.

The most dramatic knock-on effect from the coronavirus crisis was seen in Italy's overcrowded prisons where inmates rioted in jails across the country after visiting rights were cut to fight the virus. Seven inmates died in the chaos, which started at the weekend, the justice ministry said.

With the country already on the brink of recession, the government's steps have come at a huge cost for the eurozone's third-largest economy, which also has the bloc's second-biggest debt pile after Greece.

The Milan bourse, which was down some 17% since the outbreak in northern Italy, lost a further 11% on Monday, underperforming its regional peers.

News that the lockdown would be extended to the whole nation was made after markets had closed and could trigger fresh selling, raising the spectre of past crises, with Italy's cost of borrowing already significantly higher than a week ago.

Government bond yields rose sharply on Monday, pushing the gap between Italy and benchmark German 10-year bond yields above 200 basis points for the first time since August 2019.

The government has already promised 7.5 billion euros ($8.57 billion) to alleviate the economic impact of the crisis, but Conte indicated that more money would be needed.

A government source said the Treasury was considering lifting the budget deficit to 2.8% of national output this year. It only announced last week that it planned to hike the deficit to 2.5% from a previous goal of 2.2%.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bl2f6v/article31029495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ITALYVIRUSOUTBREAKPATIENTN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-italy-orders-nationwide-lockdown-as-new-cases-surge/article31029496.ece

31,2020/03/10,Israel PM announces two-week quarantine for all arrivals,"Israel had already imposed major restrictions on travellers arriving from several countries

Israel will impose a two-week quarantine on all travellers entering the country, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday, toughening already significant travel restrictions.

“After a day of difficult discussions, we have taken a decision: all those coming to Israel from abroad will be placed in isolation for 14 days,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a video broadcast on his Twitter account.

All about COVID-19

“This is a difficult decision but it is essential to maintaining public health, which takes precedence over everything,” he added, according to a statement.

He noted that the measure would be implemented for two weeks and promised steps to support the Israeli economy.

Israel had already imposed major restrictions on travellers arriving from several countries.

On Wednesday, the Jewish state had barred entry to almost all non-residents arriving from France, Germany, Spain, Austria and Switzerland, declaring that arrivals from those nations could only enter if they could prove they had a place to stay in quarantine.

Those measures had come on top of restrictions previously imposed on arrivals from mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Macau, South Korea, Japan and Italy.

But restrictions had not until now extended to travellers from the United States, which last year contributed nearly 890,000 tourist arrivals to Israel — more than double that of France, in second place.

Israel has so far recorded 50 cases of the illness.

The Palestinian Authority, which on Thursday declared a 30-day state of emergency in parts of the West Bank it administers, has reported 25 cases.

The latest measures come a month ahead of the Passover festival, which usually sees tens of thousands of Jews head to Israel to celebrate.

The first passengers were taken ashore from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship after it docked Monday at California’s port of Oakland, in what officials called an “unprecedented and difficult” operation involving thousands on board.

The Grand Princess arrived shortly after noon (1900 GMT) in the San Francisco Bay after days stranded at sea with more than 3,500 passengers and crew.

Emergency workers equipped with gowns, gloves, respirators and face shields loaded those requiring immediate treatment into ambulances, while all port employees and residents were cleared from the fenced-off landing site.

More than 900 Californian residents will disembark next from the ship, in a stage of the operation expected to take most of the day.

“Individuals will be led off the ship in smaller groups,” and “anyone who is symptomatic... will be fitted with a surgical mask and disembarked via a separate gangway” to avoid disease spread, said a statement from Governor Gavin Newsom’s office.

The ship, which has 21 confirmed novel coronavirus infections, had been idling off the San Francisco coast since Wednesday.

Passengers gathered on balconies were “whooping and waving at dock workers onshore” as the ship drew into port, said Carolyn Wright, 63, of New Mexico, from on board the vessel.

Tents were set up on the Oakland quayside, with the surrounding floor doused in what appeared to be disinfectant, she added.

Buses and flights were lined up to transport passengers.

After initial screening, those who don’t require acute care will be quarantined for 14 days at U.S. military bases in California, Texas and Georgia — or flown to their home countries, in the case of foreign residents.

Those at U.S. bases will be given private single rooms with access to private bathrooms, said Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman.

Passengers will be fully tested at their onward destination to avoid delays.

Crew will remain onboard and the ship will leave San Francisco Bay, the company said.

The entire site will be decontaminated by pressure-washing with a bleach solution once the operation is complete.

Mr. Wright earlier Monday said the mood had been lifted on board by the prospect of finally reaching land, and guests were briefly allowed to leave their cabins.

Some couples danced on deck as others walked laps around the huge ship.

“It really feels wonderful to have gotten out and stretched our legs,” Mr. Wright told AFP.

“I feel kind of energized and happy. It just makes you feel like, OK, things are happening and things are now moving.”

She added: “Hopefully things will be smooth from here on.”

Newsom said Sunday the whole operation to bring passengers ashore was expected to be a “two-three day process,” but warned it could take longer.

“We are still working out the enormity of complexity of making sure we prepare the site and... prepare for a quick turnaround,” he said.

On Monday, Princess Cruises announced full refunds, scrapped onboard charges and offered free future cruises to affected passengers on the Grand Princess.

But Canada -- which had 240 citizens on the ship — became the latest country to warn people to avoid taking cruises, after the US issued a similar warning to vulnerable Americans Sunday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6wnja7/article31028900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Corona-ship,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/first-passengers-leave-virus-hit-cruise-ship-at-california-port/article31028901.ece

Republican Representative Doug Collins, who met and shook hands with Trump last Friday at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control, said on Monday he was just informed he had been in contact with a person who tested positive for the new coronavirus at a conservative summit last month.

A second representative, Matt Gaetz, who travelled with Trump on Air Force One on Monday, likewise announced his self-quarantine after being notified that he too had come in close contact with the infected person at the CPAC conference 11 days ago.

Neith Collins nor Mr. Gaetz reported any symptoms of the virus.

“While I am not experiencing any symptoms, I have decided to self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution,” Mr. Collins said.

“While the Congressman is not experiencing symptoms, he received testing today and expects results soon,” Mr. Gaetz’s office said on his Twitter account.

Mr. Collins was seen with Mr. Trump last Friday visiting the Atlanta, Georgia CDC headquarters where they were briefed on the virus’s spread.

A photograph published by the Atlanta Constitution-Journal shows the two shaking hands at what appears to be an airport during the visit.

The newspaper said Collins was also in close contact with the state’s governor, Brian Kemp, and Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler — who Collins is challenging for election in November.

There was no immediate comment from the White House.

Earlier Trump downplayed the threat of the disease, which has recorded more than 600 cases of the COVID-19 virus, and 25 deaths.

“So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths.

34,2020/03/10,35 killed in Ghana after two buses collide,"The police confirmed the toll and have launched an investigation into the crash

Thirty-five people, including women and children, were killed on Monday when two buses collided on a busy road in Ghana, officials said. The accident, which happened in the Bono East region around 430 km from the capital Accra, also left six people in critical condition.

“I can confirm that the death toll has risen to 35,” Bono East Regional Minister Kofi Amoakohene told AFP.

The minister said that 27 of the victims were “burnt beyond recognition”.

“Six of the survivors are in critical condition and are currently being monitored,” he said, adding that “one person escaped unharmed.”

The police confirmed the toll and have launched an investigation into the crash.

“What we know per preliminary investigation is that the driver of the bigger bus veered off his lane and collided head-on with the smaller one,” Francis Adjei Brobey of the Kintampo police motor traffic unit told local media.

He said the impact of the collision sparked a fire that tore through the other vehicle.

Crashes are common on highways in the West African country because of poor maintenance, disregard for traffic regulations and bad roads.

An average of six people are said to die daily on Ghana roads.

In January, 34 people died in a similar crash involving two buses on a road in the centre of the country.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/35-killed-in-ghana-after-two-buses-collide/article31026482.ece
35,2020/03/10,Virus-hit cruise ship docks in California port of Oakland,"Authorities said it would take two or three days to get the 2,421 passengers off the ship

A coronavirus-hit cruise ship has docked at California’s port of Oakland, where infected passengers will be the first of thousands to disembark in what officials called an “unprecedented and difficult” operation.

The Grand Princess docked on Monday shortly after noon (1900 GMT) in the San Francisco Bay after days stranded at sea.

Those needing medical attention will leave the ship first, followed by the rest of the 2,421 passengers on board.

“None of the passengers who disembark will be released into the general public,” said a statement from Governor Gavin Newsom’s office.

Fences have been put up at the port, and buses and flights were lined up to transport passengers. They will go into treatment, be placed in quarantine, or returned to their home countries in the case of non-U.S. residents.

The ship, which has 21 confirmed novel coronavirus infections among its 3,500 passengers and crew, had been idling off the San Francisco coast since Wednesday.

“Passengers with balconies are whooping and waving at dock workers onshore,” said Carolyn Wright, 63, of New Mexico, from on board as the ship drew close to port.

Tents and a line of portable toilets were set up on the Oakland quayside as officials prepared for the operation.

The U.S. Coast Guard sent teams “to assist with medical triage, screening and interviews, and prioritizing those who require the most acute care,” Princess cruises said in a statement.

Passengers will be tested at their onward destination to avoid delays, it added.

Those who don’t require acute care will be quarantined for 14 days at U.S. military bases in California, Texas and Georgia.

Crew will remain onboard and the ship will leave San Francisco Bay, the company said.

Canada on Monday became the latest country to call on its citizens to avoid cruises due to coronavirus, as Ottawa prepared to repatriate nearly 240 Canadians aboard the Grand Princess.

Wright earlier Monday said the mood had been lifted on board by the prospect of finally reaching land, and guests were briefly allowed to leave their cabins.

Some couples danced on deck as others walked laps around the huge ship.

“It really feels wonderful to have gotten out and stretched our legs,” Mr. Wright told AFP.

“I feel kind of energized and happy. It just makes you feel like OK, things are happening and things are now moving.”

She added: “Hopefully things will be smooth from here on.”

Newsom said Sunday the operation to bring passengers ashore would be a “two-three day process.”

“We are still working out the enormity of complexity of making sure we prepare the site and... prepare for a quick turnaround,” he said.

President Donald Trump said on Friday that he would prefer to keep the passengers confined on the ship because letting them off would increase the number of infections in the United States.

“I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault,” Trump said, but added he would leave the decision to Vice President Mike Pence, whom he has appointed to head the coronavirus taskforce.

36,2020/03/10,Facebook testing cross-posting stories on Instagram,"Currently, Instagram Stories can be shared to Facebook Stories, but the reverse is not possible. The feature comes as Facebook continues to integrate Instagram with the rest of its services

Social media giant Facebook is testing a new feature that would allow Facebook Stories to be cross-posted to Instagram Stories, TechCrunch reported on Tuesday.

Currently, Instagram Stories can be shared to Facebook Stories, but the reverse is not possible. The feature comes as Facebook continues to integrate Instagram with the rest of its services.

According to a Facebook spokesperson, the company is now formally testing the cross-posting feature to make it easier to share moments with the people who matter to the user, as people might have different audiences and followers on Facebook versus Instagram. Facebook will continue to explore options for simplifying and improving how Stories work across its apps.

The new option would allow Stories to be shared interchangeably from one platform to another.

The screenshot of the Facebook-to-Instagram cross-posting feature was posted by Jane Manchun Wong, who regularly discovers new social networking features ahead of their release.

The feature is accessible to testers via the Story Privacy settings page in the Facebook app, where one would find a new ‘Share Story to Instagram’ toggle.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/pcjjsy/article31031085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10NETFACEBOOKANDINSTA,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/facebook-testing-cross-posting-stories-on-instagram/article31031086.ece
37,2020/03/10,Coronavirus: How this Singapore illustrator’s comics fight misinformation in the age of COVID-19,"Weiman Kow and her comics have become popular on Instagram with kids — and adults — for being a simple, yet effective guide on staying safe during these worrying times

WhatsApp forwards ask you to stock up on N95 masks. Your friends are buying immunity-boosting supplements. Office colleagues recommend changing the soap you use. Meanwhile, your mother sends you bottles of nilavembu kashayam.

Life in the age of COVID-19 can be complicated. As the coronavirus scare spreads further with every passing day, so does the flood of (mis)information bombarding people from everywhere, and parents across the world are in a fix on how to educate their kids on staying safe.

But then, Weiman Kow’s comic happened.

The Singapore artist’s first 17-panel illustration has gone viral since January 31; she had put it out after Singapore recorded its first case of the virus. It begins by reading, “There’s only ONE thing you need to understand about how coronavirus spreads…” and has quickly become the go-to guide for kids — and adults — to take simple measures in fighting the spread.

“It all happened when I was recovering from a respiratory illness earlier this year,” says Weiman, “The news about the ‘Wuhan virus’ had just broke, and as I was doing research on it, I found that many informative articles about the topic were difficult to understand. Being an illustrator, I decided to simplify what I’d learnt from trustworthy health sources and break it down into a comic format, so that even children could easily grasp it.”

Today, Weiman’s illustrations can be found in adverts and posters — even translated into vernacular languages too, for more people to understand. Her work can be seen in the Chennai Airport as well.

How do you see the role of social media at a time like this?

Social media will be a mess of misinformation, and I don’t think there will be any stopping it, since fear-mongering is how social media companies make their money. Even I get caught up in it sometimes, and have to remind myself to verify facts, go to the WHO website or national health websites.

That’s why I’m launching a campaign called Comics For Good, to encourage everyone to look at those sites (and not social media!) to fight the misinformation. We will run campaigns to showcase comic work that highlights social issues, and encourage artists to create work along those lines at the page: https://www.instagram.com/comicsforgood/

We have also started an international Kids Draw COVID-19 Facts Challenge, to show that anyone can be an advocate for right health information, as long as they get their information from a reputable health source.

Has the virality of the comic revealed what kind of gaps exist in effective communication of such serious information?

Yes. Up until when I did the comic, all the messaging I’ve seen from health authorities were about “What to do” (handwashing, etc) but no one is explaining the “Why we do this?” I think that is why it is so popular: it gives people a reason, and a certain sense of power and safety comes from knowing.

Weiman’s popular comic on staying safe from the coronavirus outbreak

The goal I want to achieve with my comics is always to enable my readers to make the right decisions with the knowledge, rather than offer prescriptive actions. After all, most things are a matter of choice, individual location and situation, and personal inclination towards risk (like wearing or not wearing masks).

I’ve also committed to having future comics vetted by doctors.

My focus is now on making sure good information reaches people in Third World countries, where health systems are weaker, where governments are unable to put in extensive tracing measures and subsidies for the public to come forward when sick.

How did the idea of sourcing volunteer translators from different countries to make the comic more accessible come about?

It started very early on, within a week of posting the first comic. People commenting on the Facebook post in Singapore were asking for a Chinese version to show their parents, as some of them do not speak English. So I created one with some volunteers.

Then when requests started coming in from Indonesia, Korea, Vietnam, Mexico, India, Portugal, I had a ready set of images with no text that I could forward them, with translation guidelines.

A Malayalam transalation of the comic

My structure of sending out translator packs to volunteer translators was heavily influenced by the tech community’s open source communities. My philosophy is in giving people the tools to do the best they can for their communities, at a time like this, and to encourage collaboration between various groups so translation work gets done faster.

I’m creating free pdf downloads for various languages in India, with the help of volunteer translators at: https://gumroad.com/

Do you plan on continuing making vital PSAs in the future?

Yes, I have learnt that my first comic is lacking some WHO precautions, and is one of the contenders for the next topic to work on. I also have a draft of a comic on fighting misinformation, and how it can lead to further spread of the disease. The way I see it, it’s no longer a fight against COVID19, but a fight against misinformation, a fight against the infodemic. So I’ll be prioritising fighting misinformation over comics on new facts.

I’ve also committed to having future comics vetted by doctors.

My focus is now on making sure good information reaches people in the third world countries, where health systems are weaker, where governments are unable to put in extensive tracing measures and subsidies for the public to come forward when sick. (Singapore is lucky in that regard.)

Are you aware of the comic’s popularity in India?

I learnt that my comic became popular in India from a PDF with the Siemens logo. Unfortunately, I wasn’t aware that Siemens took my images, modified the text, removed my watermark, and put their logo on it until people started to share it to me. They actually sourced it from Taiba Hospital, who in turn also took my work without my knowledge. I also find that the Chennai Airport is using my images without my permission, and have removed my watermark as well.

While I am upset at not being contacted about these unofficial changes made to my comic, the edits to the text by Taiba Hospital are medically accurate and useful to the general public.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/mfbc1g/article31031979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MPCorona3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/coronavirus-how-this-singapore-illustrators-comics-fight-misinformation-in-the-age-of-covid-19/article31031982.ece

39,2020/03/10,‘Too early to predict COVID-19 impact on global hiring’,"Firms struggle to find people with right skills: ManpowerGroup

It is too early to predict the potential impact of COVID-19 on global hiring, says ManpowerGroup India, part of a U.S.-based workforce solutions firm.

The reality today is that unemployment remained low in many markets, the company said and added that organisations globally were still struggling to find people with the right skills.

An employment outlook study it conducted across 5,153 Indian enterprises revealed steady hiring trends for the upcoming three months. As per the study, mining and construction, wholesale and retail trade, and services sectors would lead the job market and small companies with employee strength in the 10-49 range are expected to hire more than others.

Most of these recruitments will take place in the east and north regions of the country.

Strong hiring trends

Workforce gains are anticipated in seven industry sectors during the coming quarter. Mining and construction employers report the strongest hiring intentions with a net employment outlook of 16% (growth). Respectable payroll gains are also forecast in two sectors with outlook of 15% in the wholesale and retail trade sector and 13% in the services sector.

New jobs in public administration, education, finance, insurance and real estate, transportation and utilities sectors are expected to grow as well. ”There is a dearth of talent and companies are ready to pay premium wages for the right talent with the appropriate skills.

Employers are also upbeat about upskilling their existing talent strength,” Sandeep Gulati, group MD of ManpowerGroup India said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/too-early-to-predict-covid-19-impact-on-global-hiring/article31033955.ece

41,2020/03/10,Revolt to set up ₹400-cr. e-motorbike unit,"Company scouting for a suitable location in south India

Rahul Sharma, co-founder of Micromax Informatics Ltd., is planning to set up a second manufacturing unit for production of e-motorcycles and is scouting for a suitable place in the South.

“There has been no disruption in the automobile sector for the last 30 years, so we decided to do something new about two years ago,” said Rahul Sharma, founder, Revolt Intellicorp. “That is when I switched over from mobiles to the mobility space,” he said.

“We conceived this e-motorcycle to offer better products to consumers who aspire for good-looking vehicles combined with power and performance.

Affordable price

“When we gave vehicles at an affordable price with lesser total cost of ownership, maintenance cost and less fuel expenses compared with conventional bikes, about 30,000 users booked it without seeing it,” he said.

Mr. Sharma also launched RV400 and RV300 e-motorcycles.

Chennai is the fifth city where Revolt Intellicorp began selling its motorcycles and the first batch of e-motorcycles were sold out within hours, he said.

“We never expected such a kind of response for our products from consumers. Currently, the waiting period for our bikes is three months and this will be brought down by the year end by increasing production,” he said.

Hitting full capacity

Going by the trend, Revolt Intellicorp would be hitting full production capacity by the year end. It was time to take a call for setting up the second manufacturing unit, he said.

Company officials were in talks with State governments in the southern part of the country, he said.

Mr. Sharma established the first plant in Manesar, investing close to ₹500 crore.

Investment in the second unit would be in the range of ₹400 crore to ₹500 crore.

“What we are asking the State governments is to provide support to consumers on the lines of the New Delhi government in the form of zero registration fee and help consumers adopt to emission free vehicles,” he said.

Asserting that the adoption rate of electric vehicles by the consumers would be faster, he said it would happen in the next three years against the planned 2030.

“Our goal is to capture a double-digit market share in motorbike segment in the country and be ranked among top players such as Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors and Honda,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/yvzrbn/article31033921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th11BUREVOLT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/revolt-to-set-up-400-cr-e-motorbike-unit/article31033922.ece

The firm had already raised $35 million through three rounds of funding.

The last round of funding was led by existing investor Nexus Venture Partners and IDFC Alternatives. The company is planning to raise $100 million to fund its expansion plans and investments in technology and talent.

The Bengaluru-based start-up serves as a market place for property solutions such as paying guest accommodation, service apartments and independent flats. It deploys Internet of Things for electricity and water billing in its properties.

45,2020/03/10,"As 22 Congress MLAs quit, Kamal Nath govt. on the verge of collapse","Three more lawmakers join 19 Scindia loyalists

As many as 22 Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh resigned from the Assembly on Tuesday, plunging the government into a crisis.

As soon as Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia resigned from the primary membership of the party early in the morning after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, 13 MLAs and six Ministers owing allegiance to him, sent-in their resignations to the Governor via email, Raj Bhavan sources confirmed.

Where does Jyotiraditya Scindia's exit leave the Congress | The Hindu In Focus Podcast

Later in day, BJP leaders handed over hard copies of the letters to Assembly Speaker N.P. Prajapati.

Following the resignations, Chief Minister Kamal Nath requested Governor Lalji Tandon to issue orders for the removal of the six Ministers, who had resigned as lawmakers, from the Cabinet. Three other MLAs also submitted their resignations to the Speaker.

While the State BJP office witnessed a flurry of activity, the Congress office in the State capital was shuttered and padlocked. Later in the afternoon, angry party workers broke Mr Scindia’s nameplate and burnt his effigy outside it.

‘Shah to blame’

As the government teetered on the edge of collapse, the Congress held a Legislature Party meeting in the evening that was attended by 92 MLAs, including four independents.

Four Congress MLAs were missing from the meeting, sources in the Chief Minister’s Office said. Omkar Singh Markam, one of the 16 Ministers who had resigned on Monday night to enable Chief Minister Kamal Nath to rejig the Cabinet, told reporters outside the Chief Minister’s residence, “Our mission is to serve the people, not go after power. Congress gave us democracy, fought for independence. It will continue fighting.”

He also blamed Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for scripting the on-going political turmoil in the government.

“They play pressure politics, the Congress doesn’t,” he added.

Following their resignation, the 19 Scindia loyalists wrote to the Director General of the Police, Karnataka, requesting protection during their stay in Karnataka.

In a photograph from the resort where the lawmakers have been lodged, former BJP Minister Bhupendra Singh was seen showing the victory sign along with others.

Meanwhile, former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who had helmed the BJP government for the past 15 years before the Congress wrested it in December 2018, distanced the BJP from the resignations, terming it an internal matter.

“Our priority at present is the Rajya Sabha election,” he clarified at his residence, where Bisahulal Singh, four-time Congress MLA and former Minister, announced his resignation and pledged support to the BJP.

Another State BJP leader Sanjay Pathak asked how Mr. Scindia could endure being disrespected within the Congress for so long. “Congress has always indulged in vendetta politics, targetted BJP leaders in the State. Whereas, we have worked for the State’s development,”

46,2020/03/10,Political vacuum in Congress after Scindia’s exit,"The turmoil in Madhya Pradesh may push other marginalised State leaders to speak out, say analysts

The festering resentment of being spurned for the post of Chief Minister and the State Congress chief, coupled with the Lok Sabha election upset, nudged Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, the second-most popular leader after in Madhya Pradesh during Assembly election campaigning in 2018, to abandon the party.

As election to three Rajya Sabha seats from the State close in, Mr. Scindia, anticipating another short shrift from the party, called the shots, with 19 MLAs loyal to him submitting resignations, plunging the Kamal Nath government into an imminent crisis and leaving behind a political vacuum for the Congress in the Chambal-Gwalior region, his stronghold.

Although former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan strode ahead in popularity by 10-12%, Mr. Scindia was behind him, explained Yatindra Singh Sisodia, Director, Madhya Pradesh Institute of Social Science Research. “Therefore, he should’ve been the natural choice for the Congress. The situation, our of control of the Congress, could have been addressed timely,” he said. ""While Digivijaya Singh was had a popularity of just 1-1.5 %, Kamal Nath was at least better,"" said Mr. Sisodia, who conducted a survey as part of the Lokiniti network.

If the remaining Congress MLAs resign enmasse, midterm election will become imminent, a possibility, believes Sanjay Kumar, Director at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, that may not go down well with most MLAs. “Going to midterm may cause more defections to the BJP. The tally of Congress may go down by half. Therefore, a large number may not be willing to resign, and be content with sitting in the opposition and work in their constituency, than face the election this soon,” he said.

“Most certainly the government is going out,” he said, although he described Mr. Scindia of leaving a big organisation like the Congress “immature”. Mr. Kumar said, “There are difference of opinions within any organisation. One should not be taking whimsical decision. He seems more interested not in the Rajya sabha seat but destabilising the kamal Nath government.”

After the Lok Sabha defeat, explained Mr. Kumar, Scindia sat idle with no official responsibility. “Though the party recognized him as a senior leader, he was not being considered so,”he said. Still he could have waited, as no urgent events like Assembly elections were forthcoming.

Mr. Kumar further cautioned the episode might encourage Congress leaders in an uncomfortable spot in other states to speak out. “If the high command doesn’t act in a fair manner, we might see something of this kind in other states as well,” he added.

Fourteen more people have tested positive for COVID-19 — eight in Kerala and three each in Karnataka and Maharashtra, State authorities said on Tuesday, as the total cases in the country went up to 61.

Of the eight positive cases in Kerala, six belong to the COVID-19 cluster that originated in Pathanamthitta district, all of which are linked to the family that arrived from Italy on February 29. The other two cases are that of the parents of the three-year-old boy who tested positive earlier and is already in isolation at the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam. This family too came from Italy but they landed in Kochi only on March 8.

Nine fresh COVID-19 cases were reported from Kerala and Karnataka on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases in the country to 56. The virus has now spread to over 100 countries across the world.

On Tuesday evening, Pune District Collector Naval Kishore Ram confirmed that two more persons had tested positive for the virus.

The daughter of a Pune couple, who tested positive on Monday, a co-passenger and the Ola cab driver who ferried the couple from the Mumbai airport to Pune on their return from Dubai on March 1, were the latest to test positive in Maharashtra, said State health officials.

While all the new cases reported on Tuesday are yet to be confirmed by the Union Health Ministry, Special Secretary (Health), Sanjeeva Kumar, said: “The total number of positive cases are now 50. Of these, 34 are Indian nationals and 16 are citizens of Italy. There has been no death in the country due to the coronavirus so far.”

Airlifted from Iran

On Tuesday, 58 Indians were airlifted from Iran. “Mission completed. On to the next,” Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar tweeted after the Indian Air Force aircraft, C-17 Globemaster, carrying the evacuated Indians landed in Ghaziabad.

Combination of drugs

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has said that it has, for the first time, used a combination of two drugs primarily brought in for HIV treatment. These drugs have been used for treating the elderly Italian couple at a Jaipur hospital.

The Drug Controller General of India has approved the “restricted use” of the combination of medications Lopinavir and Ritonavir — second-line HIV drugs — for treating those affected by novel coronavirus.

In Kerala, cinema halls will be shut till March 31 and about 270 people who came in contact with coronavirus patients have been traced. Ninety-five of them are in the “high-risk category,” according to officials.

Surveillance has been strengthened after fresh cases emerged in the State. “About 1,116 people are under observation, 976 are under home quarantine while 149 are in hospitals. They include people with symptoms as well,” Kerala Health Minister K.K. Shailaja said.

IMA’s appeal

The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday appealed to the government to classify the data of the epidemic and take appropriate action with clinical precision.

“Sharing of data on daily basis with the public who are clueless as to what is expected of them has created panic across the country,” the IMA said.

The association has also asked doctors to function as a source of credible information in their locality and instil confidence and trust.

“It cannot be denied that the high-handed, top-down response in China is part of the reason for this global panic. The nuanced and balanced approach of the Indian government is certainly better suited to handle the crisis in a country of 1.3 billion people,” the IMA said.

Visas suspended

The Central government has in a release issued late on Tuesday night noted that all regular Visas (including e-Visas) which have been granted to nationals of France, Germany and Spain on or before March 11, 2020 and where these foreigners have not yet entered India stand suspended.

“Visas of all foreigners already in India remain valid and they may contact the nearest FRRO/FRO through e-FRRO module for extension/conversion etc of their visa or grant of any consular service, if they choose to do so. A notification to this effect is being issued by the Bureau of Immigration (BOI),” it added.

Giving details of the confirmed 50 cases, the Health Ministry said that after the 44 positive cases declared on Monday, three positive cases were reported from Bengaluru (with travel history from the U.S. via Dubai); one more from Bengaluru with travel history from the U.S. via Heathrow; and two positive cases from Pune (travel history from Dubai).

The Ministry added that more than 1,400 contacts have been put under surveillance for these positive cases, till date.

48,2020/03/10,Former Pakistan Minister Kasuri recalls plan for Sir Creek pact,"He says Pakistan had invited then PM Manmohan Singh to sign the agreement

From the rise of nationalism and India’s place in the emerging world to the need to combat climate change, several subjects were discussed at the third edition of WION’s global summit held on March 5 in Dubai.

Also read: Comment | Is a new India rising?

With “Navigating and negotiating global imperatives” as its theme, the summit brought together policy-makers and global thought leaders for dialogues that offered insights on the way forward. The 2020 Global Summit served as a platform for global leaders to have a dialogue on a common global agenda.

Several topics, including balancing and recalibrating Pakistan’s diplomatic strategy and getting the youth to participate in democracy, were discussed at the summit organised by WION, India’s first International News Channel. The Hindu was the WION Global Summit’s print partner for India.

The dialogue partners included former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe; former Latvian President Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga; Defence Minister of the Maldives Mariya Didi; Bharatiya Janata Party national secretary Ram Madhav; climate activist Vanessa Nakate; and former Pakistan Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri.

The session on India’s place in the age of multilateralism and nationalism touched upon the rise of right-leaning politics, and stressed India’s place in a world opting for protectionism and reclaiming national identity. Mr. Ram Madhav said nationalism saw various phases in the history and it was defined in a narrower sense after the advent of Hitler and Mussolini.

“As far as India is concerned, we have looked at nationalism with a beneficial vision — it is for the benefit of an individual in the larger interest,” Mr. Madhav said.

In a session on climate consciousness, Greenland’s first woman Prime Minister Aleqa Hammond spoke on how climate change had impacted her country’s economy. Ms. Nakate, an Ugandan climate activist, said farmers, particularly women, in her country were the worst hit by climate change.

Paralysis in Pakistan

The third session attempted to underline the deep-rooted issues paralysing Pakistan and its diplomacy. It witnessed a debate on the country’s economy and internal political stability.

Mr. Kasuri said that Pakistan had invited former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to sign an agreement on Sir Creek in 2006. “We wanted to prove to the world that India and Pakistan could change things bilaterally...,” said Mr. Kasuri, suggesting that India and Pakistan were close to solving the Kashmir issue at one point.

While senior journalist and broadcaster Reham Khan said genuine leadership and party workers were lost in Pakistan, former Pakistani Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir suggested that religious tourism such as opening up the Kartarpur Corridor could ease tensions between India and Pakistan.

The fourth session had the spotlight on the global erosion of democratic norms and the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war. Mr. Wickremesinghe highlighted the role of the media and social media that opened up undemocratic countries. “Across the world, the level of literacy and standard of living are preconditions for individuals to be able to participate in decision-making,” Ms. Vike-Freiberga said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/45leyh/article31034026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-KASURI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-pakistan-minister-kasuri-recalls-plan-for-sir-creek-pact/article31034027.ece

Booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA), junior Abdullah’s sister Safia Abdullah Khan and mother Molly Abdullah went to see him in the Hari Niwas palace, an interrogation centre that was turned into a guest house and now serves as a sub-jail for the NC leader since August 5 last year on Srinagar’s Gupkar Road.

It was a quiet celebration for the Abdullahs, as NC president Farooq Abdullah remains in detention in his own house under the PSA.

“Wishing my brother, Omar, a very happy 50th birthday!” wrote Ms. Khan on Twitter.

She promised to carry the wishes expressed on Twitter to her brother. With 3.1M followers on Twitter, his timeline was flooded with birthday wishes by his fans and supporters.

“I remember your passionate defense of “Idea of India” to find building blocks of a new narrative between India and Pakistan. Happy Birthday - keep faith. India is bigger than any one individual,” wrote Congress leader Manish Tewari.

Junior Abdullah’s sister Sara Abdullah on Tuesday declared that she was temporarily looking after her brother’s Twitter account. “(It’s) to keep track of my brother’s mentions & DMs. Will restore the account to its original owner as soon as he’s out,” reads the massage from Sara.

NC statement

On the occasion, the NC issued a statement in Jammu, which called for “release of all detainees in Kashmir, including three former Chief Ministers.”

“Curbs on civil liberties don’t augur well for the largest democracy of the world,” it said.

50,2020/03/10,A shell-shocked Congress announces Scindia’s expulsion,"Before that, he posted his resignation letter on Twitter

Moments after rebel Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia drove down to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s residence on Tuesday morning, Congress president Sonia Gandhi summoned general secretary K.C. Venugopal to her residence and asked him to announce Mr. Scindia’s expulsion.

By then, Mr. Scindia had posted his resignation letter on his Twitter handle. In it, he said it was time for him to “move on and make a fresh start”.

His letter was dated March 9 (Monday), though the Congress insisted that it was hand-delivered at Ms. Gandhi’s 10, Janpath residence on Tuesday afternoon.

The former Lok Sabha member from Guna made it clear that Tuesday’s developments were the culmination of the events that played out over the past one year. “Having been a primary member of the Congress party for the last 18 years, it is now time for me to move on. I am tendering my resignation from the primary membership of the Congress and as you well know, this is a path that has been drawing itself out over the last year,” he wrote.

“While my aim and purpose remains the same as it has always been from the very beginning, to serve the people of my state and my country, I believe I am unable to do this anymore within this party. To reflect and realise the aspirations of my people and my workers I believe it is best that I now look ahead at a fresh start,” he added.

He also thanked Ms. Gandhi and his other former Congress colleagues for providing him “with a platform to have served the nation”.

“The Congress president has approved the expulsion of Sh. Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Indian National Congress with immediate effect for anti-party activities,” Mr. Venugopal issued a statement.

The breaking point came after all efforts to broker a compromise failed. Sources close to Chief Minister Kamal Nath indicated that the party was willing to offer Mr. Scindia the post of president of the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) and a Rajya Sabha seat. But peace efforts failed as Mr. Scindia refused to speak to him saying he had flu, said former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh.

Late on Monday evening, however, Mr. Scindia is learnt to have met Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot in Delhi. Mr. Pilot was reportedly the Congress high command’s emissary. But this meeting also failed to placate Mr. Scindia.

Once considered the most promising star of the party, Mr. Scindia lost out to Mr. Kamal Nath when the Congress chose the veteran for the post of Chief Minister in December 2018. Since then, it has never been an easy relationship. Though Mr. Scindia was the strongest claimant to the post of president of the MPCC, he was ignored because of the reported opposition from Mr. Digvijaya Singh and Mr. Kamal Nath.

From time to time, Mr. Scindia took position that was at odd with his party. From supporting the Centre’s decision to abrogate the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 to his announcement that he would take to the streets against the Kamal Nath government’s “failure” to keep the promise of farm loan waiver in 10 days.

MLAs close to Mr. Scindia told The Hindu that he was “pushed to take such a decision” because the central leadership was indecisive about making him the MPCC chief and Mr. Kamal Nath and Mr. Digvijaya Singh teamed up to marginalise him. Mr. Scindia’s supporters said the “Chief Minister neither had time to listen to their grievances nor did he put in place a mechanism to get their work done”.

Facing a similar challenge from his younger colleague, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot criticised Mr. Scindia. “Mr. Scindia has betrayed the trust of the people as well as the ideology. Such people prove they can’t thrive without power. Sooner they leave the better,” he wrote on Twitter.

51,2020/03/10,No spike in arrest of infiltrators along Bangladesh border,"In 2019, 1,351 persons were caught trying to enter India illegally

There has been no unusual increase in apprehension of illegal infiltrators along the Bangladesh border in 2019 compared to the trend observed in the past six years, government data in Parliament show.

The number of illegal infiltrators apprehended by the Border Security Force (BSF) came down from 3,426 in the year 2015 to 1,118 in 2018. In 2019, there was a marginal increase when 1,351 persons were caught trying to enter India illegally. Till February 22 this year as many as 183 such persons were caught.

In 2014, there was a major spike in number of apprehensions when 2,455 persons were caught entering India illegally, compared to the previous year when only 209 people were caught.

India shares 4096.7 km border with Bangladesh and all of it is guarded by the BSF.

On March 3, Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha that, “some infiltrators are able to enter in a clandestine and surreptitious manner, mainly due to difficult riverine terrain in parts of international border with Bangladesh which are not amenable to physical fencing.”

Fencing problems

As per the government reply, the fencing along the 900 km border along Bangladesh could not be completed due to various reasons which include “difficult terrain, riverine and marshy land, short working season, land acquisition problems, public protests and objections by Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB).”

52,2020/03/10,‘Hindu adoption not valid without consent from wife’,"Supreme Court cites two essential conditions for adoption.

A Hindu adoption is not valid unless the man takes prior consent from his wife and there is a “ceremony of giving and taking in adoption,” the Supreme Court has held.

A Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao said the mandate of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act of 1956 was that no adoption was valid unless the two essential conditions of the consent of the wife and the actual ceremony of adoption were established.

The March 6 judgment came on an appeal filed by M. Vanaja, who claimed she is the adopted daughter of the late Narasimhulu Naidu. She had filed a civil suit for partition of property. The suit was dismissed. The Hyderabad High Court had eventually upheld the dismissal, following which an appeal was filed in the apex court.

Justice Rao, who wrote the judgment, said Sections 7 and 11 of the 1956 Act are the consent of the wife before a male Hindu adopts a child and proof of the ceremony of actual giving and taking in adoption.

“The appellant [Vanaja] admitted in her evidence that she does not have the proof of the ceremony of giving and taking of her in adoption. Admittedly, there is no pleading in the plaint regarding the adoption being in accordance with the provisions of the Act. That apart, the respondent, who is the adoptive mother, has categorically stated in her evidence that the appellant was never adopted though she was merely brought up by her and her husband,” the court concluded, rejecting the appeal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oaaf6u/article30706068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-india,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hindu-adoption-not-valid-without-consent-from-wife/article31033980.ece

An important legislative body of Iran has called upon India to stop violence against Muslims. In a statement issued on Tuesday, the Assembly of Experts, an 88-member body considered close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged for quick measures to restore peace in Indian society.

“Similar incidents have taken place in India before but the latest one took place in the backdrop of the visit of the U.S. President. We call upon the Indian government to take immediate measures to ensure protection for the Muslim citizens,” said Ayatollah Ahmed Jannati, leader of the Assembly of Experts. Traditionally the Assembly of Experts is considered to be a powerful body of legislators as it has among its functions the task of electing the Supreme Leader.

The Assembly of Experts under Mr. Jannati is considered to be a bastion of the ultra orthodox clerics. The statement was part of a series of criticism by Iran’s top rung leaders after the killings of February 24-26.

54,2020/03/10,254 Kashmiri Pandits in govt. jobs since 2015,"Home Ministry tells parliamentary panel that relief, rehabilitation provided to registered migrants

As many as 254 Kashmiri Pandits have joined government service in Jammu and Kashmir since a special package was announced for the displaced community by the Centre in 2015.

Under the Prime Minister’s Development Package (PMDP) announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 7, 2015, the government approved creation of 3,000 additional State government jobs for Pandits at a cost of ₹1,080 crore.

Also read | Thirty years on, still no spring for the Pandits

A similar employment package was announced by the Manmohan Singh government in 2008 under which 1,474 State government jobs were provided to the migrant youth.

The Union Home Ministry, in reply to a parliamentary standing committee on relief and rehabilitation provided to Kashmiri Pandits, said that “till date, appointment orders to 528 candidates have been issued and 254 have joined duties.”

The special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was revoked and the State was bifurcated and downgraded into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh by Parliament on August 6, 2019.

The Ministry told the panel that as per the inputs provided by the government of Jammu and Kashmir, there are 64,827 registered migrant families comprising 60,489 Hindu families, 2,609 Muslim families and 1,729 Sikh families.

“Of the 64,827 families, 43,494 families are registered in Jammu, 19,338 in Delhi and 1,995 families are settled in other States and Union Territories. Of the 43,494 migrant families, 5,248 families are living in migrant camps,” the report tabled in Parliament last week said.

The Ministry said the government had been providing relief and rehabilitation packages to all registered migrants “irrespective of their religion”.

“Cash relief to the eligible Jammu and Kashmiri migrants is given at the rate of ₹3,250 per person with a ceiling of ₹13,000 per family a month. The last enhancement was sanctioned in June 2018. In addition, dry ration is also provided,” the Ministry told the panel.

Hike in cash relief

The monthly cash relief to the Kashmiri migrants was increased from ₹6,600 per family as sanctioned in 2004 to ₹13,000 per family per month in 2018. The cash allowance provided by the State governments is reimbursed by the MHA.

“Regarding the transit accommodation, 849 flats are available, and 560 flats are under construction,” the report said.

The panel led by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma observed that “the living conditions in the 849 transit accommodations are not good” and recommended that the Ministry should send a team to visit the transit accommodation and take necessary steps to provide adequate living conditions including floor space, hygienic food, water supply, sanitation and other basic amenities.

The committee also recommended that the Ministry should fast-track the construction of new transit accommodations so that the burden on the existing accommodation might be eased, the report said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ax8sl8/article31033913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TH-KASHMIRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/254-kashmiri-pandits-in-govt-jobs-since-2015/article31033914.ece

A parliamentary committee has said only three States and five Union Territories have become kerosene-free, though the government in September last met the target of eight crore LPG connections under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana.

Also read: Data | How effective has the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana been

The report of the Parliamentary Committee on Petroleum, which was tabled last week, points to the gap between the continuing use of kerosene and the claim of 97% LPG coverage nationwide. The committee is headed by BJP member Ramesh Bidhuri.

The allocation for the scheme has been cut down by 58% from ₹2,724 crore during 2019-20 to ₹1,118 crore during 2020-21. The Petroleum Ministry informed the committee that the government had met the target on September 7, 2019, and 96.9% coverage had been achieved nationwide, except in Jammu and Kashmir. The Ministry said the scheme was no longer running, and the present allocation was meant to meet the arrears in the reimbursement of expenditure.

The 97% coverage has been calculated by dividing the number of households — it stand at 2850.5 lakh as on February 1 this year — and the domestic LPG consumers, at 2772.2 lakh.

The committee was upset at the closure of the scheme and said there was still a lot of ground to cover. “There are poor households in the general category in urban and semi-urban localities that also need to be covered. The committee, therefore, recommends that the scheme be extended to poor households in urban and semi-urban slum areas, and achieve a higher LPG coverage of the population by providing connections to households that do not have LPG,” the report said.

At the same time, the committee said, large segments of people in various States still depended on kerosene for cooking and household lighting.

He told The Hindu that he would file his nomination later this week. “Yes, I have been nominated as the joint candidate of the Left and the Congress. I will file it [the nomination] on March 12,” he said.

Mr. Bhattacharya, 68, is a prominent lawyer and had been the Mayor of Kolkata from 2005 to 2010. His name emerged as a consensus candidate after the CPI(M) Polit Bureau rejected the State unit’s request for the nomination of party general secretary Sitaram Yechury.

“Mr. Yechury was our first preference and when he is not contesting, our MLAs will support whomsoever the CPI(M) leadership nominates,” Congress general secretary Amitava Bhattacharya said.

Mr. Bikash Bhattacharya is acceptable to the Congress because he was instrumental in bringing the Saradha chit fund scam and the Naradha video tapes before the Calcutta High Court and had pressed for an investigation by Central agencies.

In 2017, the Left parties put him up for the Rajya Sabha, but he could not file the nomination before the deadline. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, he was the Left Front candidate in Jadavpur and was defeated by Mimi Chakraborty of the Trinamool Congress.

The Left parties and the Congress do not have enough strength in the Assembly to elect a nominee to the Rajya Sabha on their own.

The seat is held by Kshetrimayum Bhabananda of the BJP, whose term ends in April.

The Congress in Manipur has 28 MLAs, but eight of them switched over to the BJP to help Nongthombam Biren form a coalition government in 2017. The BJP had won 21 of the 60 seats.

Of the eight MLAs who switched allegiance, Thounaojam Shyamkumar became the Forest Minister in the BJP-led government and a case regarding his political status is pending in the Supreme Court. The other seven have claimed they are very much Congress MLAs.

“Our candidate has a chance if the rebel Congress MLAs do not side with BJP. We are also hopeful of getting the vote of a Muslim Independent MLA,” a senior Manipur Pradesh Congress Committee leader said.

The Congress is also banking on the BJP’s regional allies, specifically the Naga People’s Front (NPF), for its candidate to sail through. There has been some friction between the BJP and the NPF, which is a rival of the saffron party in adjoining Nagaland.

The State Congress extended the deadline for filing nomination for the RS seat from March 9 to March 12 after only one candidate, party spokesperson and academic Ningombam Bupenda Meitei, submitted his papers.

“I have met all our party MLAs at a personal level and have received positive vibes from them,” Mr. Meitei told The Hindu from Imphal on Tuesday.

59,2020/03/10,Akali Dal’s Cheema accuses Punjab CM of making ‘false claims’ on employment,"Why is Punjab lagging behind in providing jobs to youth, former education minister asks

While the verbal spat between the ruling Congress and the Opposition Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders in Punjab continued, former education minister and senior Akali leader Daljit Singh Cheema has hit out Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, asking him to explain why Punjab was lagging behind in providing jobs to youth.

“It seems that either the CM is not aware of the standard procedure adopted by the Economic Survey through out the country, or he is trying to mislead the people again. Will the Chief Minister deny the fact that 2.69 lakh applicants have registered themselves with the State’s unemployment bureau, out of which 91% are categorised as skilled and 85% are [Class] Xth pass or above?” Mr. Cheema alleged.

Mr. Cheema said that, in his recent statement, the Chief Minister had accepted that only 57,905 youth had been provided employment and that his [the Chief Minister’s] “claim made in Delhi” during the recent election campaign, on giving employment to 12 lakh youth, was totally “false and baseless”.

‘High-handed’

The SAD leader accused the State government of high-handed behaviour with unemployed teachers who protested in Patiala, demanding jobs. “The young protesters, who have completed Elementary Teacher Training (ETT) and cleared the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) were demanding jobs but instead of listening to them , the police used force against them,” said Mr. Cheema.

“The Chief Minister should accept that his performance over three years is a complete failure and that the government direly needs to work on providing jobs to the youth. The process for the same should be started at the earliest,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/nayvjr/article31032986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Daljit-Singh-Cheema,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/akali-dals-cheema-accuses-punjab-cm-of-making-false-claims-on-employment/article31033045.ece
60,2020/03/10,Tight fight for Gujarat Rajya Sabha seats,"The BJP appears determined to retain three seats despite being short on the numbers

With elections to four Rajya Sabha seats underway in Gujarat, political activity in the State is set to intensify as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) appears determined to retain the three seats despite being short of numbers on its side.

Also read: CPI(M) decides against fielding Yechury for Rajya Sabha

Out of the four seats, currently, the BJP holds three, while one is with the Opposition Congress. The arithmetic suggests both the BJP and the Congress can get two seats each in the absence of voting, based on the number of legislators on both sides.

Unlikely to concede

However, the ruling BJP is unlikely to concede a seat to the Opposition party and will instead field a third candidate and try to split the Opposition party’s numbers to ensure its victory.

“As of now, Congress, with 73 legislators, can barely manage to send two candidates to Rajya Sabha, but even a minor defection of a few legislators can change that scenario,” a party leader said, adding there are already talks of a few legislators in touch with the BJP to either cross vote during voting or abstain from voting.

Neither party has so far declared any candidates for the four seats. The last day for the filing of nominations is March 13, while voting will be held on March 26.

Members retiring

From the Congress, Madhusudan Mistry is retiring from the Rajya Sabha after a six year term, while from the ruling BJP, three members are retiring — Shambhuprasad Tundia, Lalsinh Vadodia and Chunibhai Gohel.

61,2020/03/10,Centre intends to hike allocations for madrasas more than 80% next year,"Drop in spending on modernisation scheme a disturbing trend, says parliamentary panel

The government spending on improving education at madrasas has dropped drastically after the States were asked to pitch in with funding, said a parliamentary panel, slamming the “disturbing trend” which hurts children from the most educationally backward communities.

Also read: Rise in boys dropping out of madrasas in Bengal

After the change in funding ratios, only 15% of allocated money was used last year. With just over a month left in this financial year, only about half the funds had been spent. The Centre intends to hike allocations more than 80% next year, despite the low utilisations in the last two years.

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development, which submitted its report on demand for grants in 2020-21 to the Rajya Sabha last week, expressed concern that the School Education department has not used the allocated funds for providing education to madrasas over the past three years. “This is a disturbing trend and needs to be rectified,” the panel said.

Madrasas are minority institutions, usually run by a local mosque using community donations. Traditionally, they have focussed on Islamic theology and teaching and “largely ignored the growth of scientific knowledge and technology in modern education”, according to a 2018 study by the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration (NIEPA). This is one of the reasons why the Muslim community has among the lowest levels of literacy and high rates of school drop-outs.

Over the last decade, the Centre has run the Scheme for Providing Quality Education in Madrasas (SPQEM) to encourage these religious schools to introduce modern academic subjects such as Science, Mathematics, Social Studies and Hindi and English languages, as well as vocational training for older students. It provides funds for hiring qualified teachers and building modern infrastructure. So far, over 21,000 madrasas have benefited from financial assistance to the tune of ₹1,138 crore, according to the NIEPA study.

Over the last three years, the Centre’s annual budget has allocated ₹120 crore for the scheme. In 2017-18, ₹108 crore was spent, with the remaining ₹12 crore allocated to the northeastern States where there was no demand for the scheme, according to the panel.

In 2018-19, funding for the larger component of the scheme was changed from a 100% Central grant into a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with a 60:40 split between Central and State funding. The change “led to procedural delays in the submission of proposals by State/UTs and subsequent shortfall in releases”, the Centre told the parliamentary panel. Only ₹18.25 crore was actually spent that year.

In 2019-20, the expenditure under the scheme was ₹63.57 crore as on February 10, 2019, just above half of the allocated amount. With over a month to go, the Centre hoped that the final expenditure would be higher, it told the panel.

The scheme’s funding will grow 83% in 2020-21, with the budgetary allocation being hiked to ₹220 crore. In fact, the projected financial outlays for the next two years are even higher, rising to ₹250 crore in 2021-22 and ₹280 crore in 2022-23.

By 2023, the scheme will be providing assistance to 9,000 madrasas, paying salaries to 27,000 teachers in modern subjects. About 250-300 institutions will get infrastructure funding, the Centre told the panel, adding that the School Education Department was setting up a Project Monitoring System to keep a tab on scheme projects.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3omxk3/article31032057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-intends-to-hike-allocations-for-madrasas-more-than-80-next-year/article31032058.ece

65,2020/03/10,Analysis | Jyotiraditya Scindia revolt a likely turning point in tussle within Congress,"The episode is also indicative of the drift within the party and the leadership’s inability to take quick decisions

The latest revolt and subsequent expulsion of Madhya Pradesh Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia can be a turning point in the tussle between the party’s younger lot of leaders and veterans.

The episode is also indicative of the drift within the Congress and the leadership’s inability to take quick decisions.

Apart from Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan is another State where the veterans managed to edge out Sachin Pilot despite him being the State Congress president who led the party to victory in December 2018.

On Monday, though Mr. Scindia remained incommunicado to Congress leaders, he is reported to have met Mr. Pilot — who is Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister — in Delhi.

Mr. Pilot was reportedly the Congress high command’s emissary but the move was aimed at placating Mr. Pilot as much as Mr. Scindia, as his differences with Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot are well known.

“I am hopeful that the current crisis in M.P. ends soon and that leaders are able to resolve differences. The state needs a stable government in order to fulfil the promises made to the electorate,” Mr. Pilot tweeted early on Tuesday.

Also Read BJP hand in glove with mafia to destabilise Madhya Pradesh government, says Kamal Nath

With the Congress’s clout being substantially reduced and young leaders not getting too many opportunities within the party, several of them, such as Milind Deora and Jitin Prasada, are restive about their political future.

Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor’s plea to hold internal elections in Congress has been largely ignored, as also Mr. Scindia’s plea to have a full-time State Congress chief.

For 15 months now in M.P., Chief Minister Kamal Nath has also been continuing as the chief of the State unit, as the party’s high command has been unable to find someone acceptable to all factions.

After losing out to Mr. Nath for the post of Chief Minister, Mr. Scindia was the strongest claimant to the post of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) chief but has been ignored because of reported opposition by former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh and his supporters.

Mr. Scindia and his supporters found an opportunity to hit back once the Congress performed disastrously at the 2019 Lok Sabha election, with only the Chief Minister’s son barely managing to win the family’s traditional seat of Chhindwara.

Non-fulfilment of promises such as waiving off farm loans and a lacklustre performance became a weapon in the hands of Mr. Scindia and his supporters to hold their own government to account.

In the run-up to the Assembly election in November-December 2018, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had repeatedly announced at public meetings that if loan waivers did not happen within 10 days, he would change the Chief Minister.

Six months later and post the Lok Sabha debacle, it was instead Mr. Gandhi who made way for his mother once again as the party chief.

This change of guard at the top also meant that the party’s backroom managers and veterans were once again calling the shots. Whether it was Mr. Nath in M.P. or Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan, all are close to strategist Ahmed Patel, who was the real power behind Ms. Gandhi’s earlier stint as Congress chief and 10 years of United Progressive Alliance (UPA).

While it is true that the party’s old guard is politically shrewder than those who are handpicked by Mr. Gandhi or those who are close to him, the divide between the old and the young is taking the party towards a fight to finish.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/lok-sabha-2019/336u7m/article27070364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-JYOTIRADITYASCINDIA-BL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-jyotiraditya-scindia-revolt-a-likely-turning-point-in-tussle-within-congress/article31030345.ece

67,2020/03/10,‘67% of donations to national parties by unknown sources’,"ADR analyses income tax returns and donation statements

As much as 67% of donations to national parties in 2018-19 came from “unknown sources,” an increase from 53% in the previous financial year, said a report released by the Association for Democratic Reforms on Monday.

The ADR analysed the income tax returns and donation statements submitted to the Election Commission by the BJP, the Congress, the Trinamool, the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Nationalist Congress Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party.

The BSP declared zero voluntary contributions, the report said.

Total income

The total income of the parties was ₹3,749.37 crore, of which ₹951.66 crore was from known donors.

Electoral bonds accounted for 78% of the ₹2,512.98 crore, or 67%, income from unknown sources.

While parties are required to give details of all donations above ₹20,000, donations under ₹20,000 and those via electoral bonds remain anonymous.

Out of the total income from unknown sources, 64% went to the BJP and 29% to the Congress.

“Since a very large percentage of the income of political parties cannot be traced to the original donor, full details of all donors should be made available for public scrutiny under the RTI [Right to Information Act],” the ADR said in a statement.

In its report on national parties’ funds in 2017-2018 released in 2019, the ADR had analysed six parties, except the CPI(M) as details were not available.

Amid political turmoil in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Monday accused the BJP of attempting to destabilise the government in connivance with mafia. He said it would not be allowed to succeed at any cost.

During the day, while 17 lawmakers supporting Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia landed in Bengaluru and went incommunicado, later 16 Ministers tendered their resignations to Mr. Nath, requesting him to dissolve the Cabinet, and reconstitute it.

Stating that politics of bargaining went against the State’s interests, Mr. Nath claimed in the past 15 years of the BJP regime, mafia in every sector had become a parallel government. “People were fed up with the mafia, and gave the Congress the mandate to get rid of it. I campaigned against the mafia responding to the expectations of the people,” he added.

He further said upon taking oath, his objective was to carve out a new identity for the State in the youth’s interest. “But BJP is just power-hungry and has nothing to do with the people of the State and its development,” he added.

Pointing out that the BJP’s electoral base had begun shrinking, Mr. Nath said, “It lost its government in seven States in the last few months. It is just frustrated and not allowing any other government to function from Day 1.”

Last week, Congress leaders claimed to have rescued six MLAs of the Congress-led government from a hotel in Manesar in Haryana, where they were reportedly held hostage by the BJP.

The sand mafia had cost the public exchequer Rs. 15,000 crore, he said, “After I took over, the sand mafia took a severe blow. And it was an affront to those with devious intentions. The BJP is nothing but a puppet in the hands of the mafia.”

Stating that he had devoted his entire life to public service, Mr. Nath said, “The BJP had used power not for serving the public but as a means of luxury. Now, it wants to destabilise the government through unfair means.”

70,2020/03/10,16 Ministers submit resignations in Madhya Pradesh,"Jolt to Kamal Nath govt. as pro-Scindia MLAs head to Bengaluru, Chief Minister accuses BJP of conniving with the mafia in trying to destabalise his government

Sixteen Cabinet Ministers of the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh resigned on Monday night and requested the Chief Minister to reconstitute the Cabinet. According to the Chief Minister's Office, the Ministers, including Home Minister Bala Bachchan, Finance Minister Tarun Bhanot and Law Minister P.C. Sharma, tendered their resignations to Kamal Nath at a late night Cabinet meeting.

The development capped a day of hectic political activity with Mr. Nath forced to rush back to Bhopal from Delhi after 17 Congress MLAs — supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia — went incommunicado. Several of them, including a Minister, reached the BJP-ruled Karnataka by a special flight later in the day.

Read: In midnight drama, Congress ‘rescues’ Madhya Pradesh MLAs

Speaking to reporters outside Mr. Nath's residence where the meeting was held, Sajjan Singh Verma, who resigned as the Public Works and Environment Minister, said, “Given the vicious atmosphere created by the BJP, we have requested Mr. Nath to reconstitute the Cabinet independently. We want to thwart the efforts of the BJP to topple the government.”

Stating that the Congress had called a meeting of party MLAs at 5 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Verma said the government was stable. ""We have been given the mandate for five years by people. We will complete our term.""

Umang Singhar, who resigned as Forest Minister said, “The government is safe. New Ministers will be appointed.”

Mr. Nath had reached Delhi on Sunday to brief Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the political turmoil in the State and discuss an imminent expansion of the Cabinet and the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections from the State. He is believed to have left it to Ms. Gandhi to decide the way forward and reach out to Mr. Scindia.

The younger Congress leader, after having lost out on the CM’s post, was also ignored for the post of the Madhya Pradesh Pradesh Congress Committee (MPPCC) chief.

Congress insiders indicated that Mr. Scindia could be offered a Rajya Sabha seat as well as the MPPCC chief’s post as part of a compromise.

Read: Kamal Nath dares Scindia to hold protest

Amid persistent rumours about Mr. Scindia being in touch with senior BJP leaders, the former Lok Sabha member from Guna remained unavailable for comment. Late in the evening, he is reported to have met party colleague and Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot.

The group of Congress MLAs, including at least one Cabinet Minister, arrived at Bengaluru by a special flight.

BJP leader Arvind Limbavali, who played a crucial role in wooing Karnataka Congress MLAs last year resulting in the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) coalition, is reported to be handling the logistics of the Madhya Pradesh lawmakers’ stay. Sources said these MLAs were shifted to a private resort in Whitefield.

Reacting the development, Rajasthan Congress president Sachin Pilot hoped for the crisis to end soon. ""I am hopeful that the current crisis in MP ends soon and that leaders are able to resolve differences. The state needs a stable government in order to fulfill the promises make to the electrolate"", Mr. Pilot tweeted.

When asked if the developments posed a threat to the government, Congress MP Digvijaya Singh said, “Whoever rejects the mandate of the State’s people, they’ll give them a reply”.

Earlier during the day, Surendra Singh Shera, independent MLA from Burhanpur, who was believed to be in Bengaluru along with three other legislators after he had gone missing last week, said, “Every MLA is happy, and the effort is to listen to everyone and resolve their issues. Ever since the government was formed, the BJP has been approaching us.""

Asked when he would be made a Minister, Mr. Shera said, “Very soon. I would like to be the Home Minister and develop a people’s-friendly police.”

Last week, Congress leaders claimed to have rescued six MLAs backing the government from a hotel in Manesar in Haryana, where they were reportedly held hostage by the BJP. Of another four MLAs, who were believed to be ferried to Bengaluru by the BJP, two, including Mr. Shera, have returned to Bhopal. Congress leaders have said this was the fourth attempt by the BJP at dislodging its government formed in December 2018.

Mr. Singh last Tuesday had accused BJP leaders, including former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, of ferrying MLAs backing the government to New Delhi, and luring them with bribes to cross over, a charge confirmed by Mr. Nath later, while Mr. Scindia said he wasn't aware of it.

While the Congress holds 114 seats, and enjoys the support of four independent, two BSP and an SP MLA, the BJP has 107 seats in the 230-member Assembly.

Moreover, elections to three Rajya Sabha seats from the State, one held by Mr. Singh and the other two by BJP’s Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatiya are due later this month. Given the numbers, both the parties will secure one seat each in the Rajya Sabha, while for the third, Congress will need the support of another two MLAs, while the BJP will need nine. A candidate needs 58 first-preference votes to win.

Both Mr. Scindia and Mr. Singh are eyeing the Rajya Sabha seats. Moreover, Mr. Scindia, a member of the royal Scindia family of Gwalior who lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from his stronghold Guna, is also seemingly keen to helm the State Congress unit, at present led by Mr. Nath.

In the 13-month-old Congress government that unseated BJP after 15 years, fissures within the State Congress, riven by factionalism, have emerged repeatedly. Last month, giving a cold shoulder to the Chief Minister, Mr. Scindia threatened to hit the streets if poll promises, especially the farm loan waiver, were not kept.

In the past, two MLAs of his faction had accused the Health Minister of corruption. Meanwhile, Umang Singhar, from his camp, had accused former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh of trying to destabilise the government.

Meanwhile, a source close to Mr. Scindia on Monday claimed the faction’s MLAs felt ignored by the State Congress Unit, which was in shambles due to mismanagement of three-four leaders from Indore. “While Kamal Nath, who presently heads the State Congress unit, is busy with the post of the Chief Minister; there is no mechanism to hear the grievances of our MLAs. It’s already been close to one and a half years,” he added.

'BJP hand in glove with mafia'

Amid political turmoil in the state, Mr. Nath accused the BJP of attempting to destabilise the government in connivance with mafia. He said it would not be allowed to succeed at any cost.

Stating that politics of bargaining went against the State’s interests, Mr. Nath claimed in the past 15 years of the BJP regime, mafia in every sector had become a parallel government. “People were fed up with the mafia, and gave the Congress the mandate to get rid of it. I campaigned against the mafia responding to the expectations of the people,” the Chief Minister said.

He further said upon taking oath, his objective was to carve out a new identity for the State in the youth’s interest. “But BJP is just power-hungry and has nothing to do with the people of the State and its development,” he added.

“It lost its government in seven States in the last few months. It is just frustrated and not allowing any other government to function from Day 1.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aieor1/article31027077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200310-WA0011,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/16-ministers-submit-resignations-in-mp/article31027078.ece
71,2020/03/10,AI-based signalling system to end traffic woes in Guntur,"City-based group inks MoU with GMC to complete project in 18 months

A city-based group is set to use artificial intelligence not just to improve the signalling system so as to streamline the city traffic that has gone haywire, but also to bring in the entire city under surveillance.

Chaitanya Media Soft Solutions and Guise AI, a US-based computer vision company, are partnering with the Guntur Municipal Corporation to provide real-time solutions for public safety, law enforcement, military use, government and intelligence.

To start with, high-resolution cameras would be installed at 35 traffic junctions and synced with artificial intelligence-based computer vision solutions offered by Guise AI to improve the security and transportation network of the city. All the cameras would be synced to a control centre to be set up at Guntur Urban Police District office.

“The solutions of Guise make cameras smarter by extracting valuable data from high-resolution video streams and delivering useful and easily digestible analytics,” says Nagasharath, CEO of Guise AI.

Detection of threats

Further, the security-enabled AI helps locate high-risk threats such as criminals, pick-pockets and violent offenders, and identify missing children. Besides, the AI-enabled transportation network helps detect and report wrong-side driving, parking violations, helmet-less driving, triple driving etc. The signalling system also helps in notification of emergency vehicles, extraction of number plates, violation of red signals and notify accidents.

The Chaitayna Media Soft Solutions has entered into an MoU with the GMC to execute the project within 18 months.

Bhoomi puja was conducted at Nagarampalem traffic junction. Each junction would be manned by a high-resolution AI-based camera that would be connected to the central control room which can track even the slightest of traffic violations and road rage.

“For many years, traffic in the city has become haywire due to lack of effective surveillance and signalling system. It is for the first time that such AI-based signalling system is being put in place by a firm,” said a senior municipal official.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/zgiofg/article31037296.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJPAGE3TRAFFIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ai-based-signalling-system-to-end-traffic-woes-in-guntur/article31034422.ece
72,2020/03/10,Move to enforce ‘No School Bag Day’ effectively,"Officials directed to inspect schools to ensure compliance

Officials of the Education Department are not happy with the lukewarm outcome of the ‘No School Bag Day’ (Srujana - Sanivaram Sandadi), introduced in primary classes of every school, both private and government, on the first and third Saturdays every month.

The new concept brought in by the government as part of ‘Happiness Curriculum’, aimed at helping children bust stress and engage in extra-curricular activities for their physical and mental happiness.

Close on the heels of the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development ordering a cap on the weight of school bags, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed the officials of the education wing to evolve a weight-loss formula for school bags. Expressing concern over young schoolchildren staggering under heavy, bulging bags in the morning and after-school hours, he asked the allied wings in the education sector to design a strategy that would not only reduce the size of the school bag but also incorporate a ‘no-school bag day’ at least twice a month.

Short-lived enthusiasm

But the programme did not take off in the manner in which it was meant to. In the initial months, school managements flashed colourful photographs of children engaging in a series of games, sports and other amusement activities. But gradually, the enthusiasm faded with some teachers saying that they ran out of ideas to engage the children, and some others citing complaints by a section of parents who were “worried that precious time was being wasted in extra-curricular activities.”

Taking a serious note of the programme being reduced to a lacklustre affair, the Commissioner of School Education V. Chinaveerabhadrudu said the very objective of the initiative was to create joyful and child-friendly atmosphere in schools. The purpose of it was defeated by some schools which did not implement the same in letter and spirit, he said.

Mr. Chinaveerabhadrudu asked the Regional Joint Directors, District Education Officers, Deputy Education Officers, Mandal Education Officers and headmasters of all schools to visit two private schools and one government school every first and third Saturday of the month.

The officials have also been asked to submit reports on their visit on the official website of the department.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ixtqh6/article31034321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJPAGE2BAGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/move-to-enforce-no-school-bag-day-effectively/article31034323.ece
73,2020/03/10,Remove party colourson govt. buildings: HC,"Chief Secretary asked to furnishcompliance report within 2 weeks

The High Court on Tuesday directed the government to restrain from painting government/panchayat buildings with colours similar to the ones of flags of political parties or party offices.

The HC directed the Principal Secretary, Panchayat Raj Department, to remove the colours painted on the buildings within 10 days and directed the Chief Secretary to furnish a compliance report within two weeks to the court Registrar .

Issuing the orders on writ petitions filed by Muppa Venkateswara Rao, a resident of Pallapadu village in Vatticherukuru mandal, and Angu Ramana, from Vizianagaram district, Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari and Justice Ninana Jayasurya directed the State Election Commission to hold free and fair elections to the local bodies and take appropriate steps without allowing the parties to take any form of evil practices which might influence the voters.

In a significant observation, the court held that it had become a common practice for any political party to paint the buildings of panchayat or others akin to the colours of the party flag, and directed that such practices should stop. It also held that the National Building Code applies to the buildings of Panchayat Raj also as they fall within the purview of local self-government and constructed with government funds.

The court directed that the use of impermissible signs cannot be permitted to be used in future and said such actions might affect the conduct of free and fair elections.

The Chief Justice mentioned that the court had given an interim order on December 13,2019, directing the government not to paint the government buildings with the colours of the flag of a particular political party.

Suitable combination

The court also quashed the Government Memo (No PRR01-PROPPAN (MISC) approving the proposal of the Commissioner of Panchayat Raj to paint gram panchayat buildings with the colours similar to that a party.

The HC also directed the CS to formulate guidelines to specify a suitable colour combination for painting the panchayat/government buildings which should not be similar to the colours of flags and offices of political parties. The TDP has been crying foul over the manner in which some government buildings have been painted in colours similar to that of the flag of the ruling party.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/j5y1oe/article31034312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJPAGE1COLOURS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/remove-party-colourson-govt-buildings-hc/article31034313.ece
74,2020/03/10,"Committed to bridging the gap between qualification, competence","Chief track engineer Sai Baba conducts technical lectures to make engineering students employable

The man behind the world’s tallest railway bridge between Jiribam and Imphal in the North-East has now embarked on a different task – bridging the gap between qualification and competence among engineering students.

Ankala Sai Baba, an alumnus of Sri Venkateswara University College of Engineering, Tirupati, hit the headlines when he headed the rail project measuring 141 metres, with a running distance of 111 km. Now, he is keen on making the new generation of engineers employable by regularly conducting technical lectures.

Built in an earthquake-prone region that is also known for highest rainfall and left wing extremism (LWE), the bridge was declared the world’s tallest after it surpassed the previous record held by a 139-metre-tall structure in Europe. The second tallest bridge in India by Konkan Railways is only 90m high. The successful completion of the ₹14,000 crore project will not only improve logistics and tourism potential by bringing the North-East closer to mainland India, but also catalyses the formation of trans-Asian rail network and improves security infrastructure in the strife-torn region. “At double the size of Qutub Minar, the bridge is a structural marvel,” remarks Mr. Sai Baba. In an informal chat with The Hindu, Mr. Sai Baba recalled how Remote Structural Health Monitoring system was introduced to check the health of this bridge on a real-time basis. Drone cameras were employed for the first time to hover around and check the embedded systems strategically placed across the bridge.

Working on bridges seems to be a strange coincidence for Mr. Sai Baba, as this structural engineer’s career started with India’s first cable-stayed bridge at Krishnarajapuram in Bengaluru. An expert in seismic analysis and design, he had earlier worked for Bengaluru and Hyderabad metro rail projects and is now the Chief Track Engineer of South East Central Railway zone headquartered at Bilaspur, covering operations in Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.

Reaching out

Intending to reach out to students, he has conducted a whopping 432 lectures to engineering students in 15 countries, including those in the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa, the latest being at his alma mater last week. At the rate of 43 talks a year, his passion is to drive home sustainability and environment-friendly engineering among students.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wjd337/article31034288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJPAGETALK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/committed-to-bridging-the-gap-between-qualification-competency/article31034289.ece

State Bank of India has been adopting new strategies to improve its business in all the 38 mandals in the district by giving wide publicity about the sanction of personal loans and top-up loans on existing home loans without submission of documents.

The sanction of loans are done on the same day as it has details such as track record of each and every customer, says SBI Regional Manager K. Tejomay Arvind while speaking to The Hindu.

Hassle-free manner

“The bank provides many new services in a hassle-free manner for the YONO app users. Just, they have to download the app in their smartphones to know about their pre-approved personal loans, home loans and top-up loans. They can get many other non-financial services such as updating of Aadhaar number, address, phone number and mail IDs. Otherwise, they have to submit document proofs if they approach their respective branches,” he added.

“Without ATM cards, the customers can withdraw amount with the support of the app. They have to enter the withdrawal amount in their App. They have to enter OTP in the ATM to withdraw money. We have already provided this facility in 54 out of 167 ATMs in the district. This facility prevents many frauds at the ATM centres,” said Mr. Aravind. According to him, SBI General Manager-Amaravati B.V.S.K.T. Bhaskar has held a series of meetings with branch heads for the promotion of digital banking in rural areas too as many customers are good in use of smartphones.

The bank has been sending special teams to all branches to make all 17.7 lakh customers to know the benefits of digital banking. The bank’s aggressive campaign has helped to sanction ₹125 crore home loans as against the target of ₹120 crore in the current financial year 2019-20.

It has also sanctioned ₹150 crore as personal loans with the improvement of digital applications received through Yono app. The bank sanctioned ₹375 crore as loans in the ongoing financial year. It is expected to cross ₹400 crore target by the end of March.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gia3zd/article31034195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJRJYPAGESBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sbi-provides-many-services-to-yono-app-users-rm/article31034196.ece

77,2020/03/10,"TDP, Jana Sena leaders join YSRCP","Satish Reddy, who had fought ruling party tooth and nail, among the new entrants

Ahead of local body polls, a few opposition leaders, including the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and the Jana Sena, joined the YSR Congress Party on Tuesday.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy welcomed former MLA Kadiri Babu Rao into party fold by presenting him party scarf. Former Tribal Welfare Minister P. Balaraju, his daughter Darshini, a doctor by profession, former MLAs Tynala Vijay Kumar and Ch. Venkataramaiah joined the YSRCP in the presence of Rajya Sabha member Vijaya Sai Reddy in Visakhapatnam.

Mr. Babu Rao alleged that TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu was adept in deceiving the leaders who reposed faith in him. Mr. Naidu forced him to contest from Darsi in the 2019 elections.

The former Chief Minister did not consider the advice from Hindupur MLA N. Balakrishna that the idea was not correct. In comparison, Mr. Jagan would not go back on his word, he said.

Mr. Balaraju said the decision to make Vizag the Executive Capital and welfare measures being implemented by Mr. Jagan were the reasons behind his decision to join the YSRCP.

‘Homecoming’

Mr. Vijay Kumar, who had a brief stint in the TDP after quitting the YSRCP, said it was ‘homecoming’ for him. He said YSRCP was always dear to him and he was very much impressed with the way Mr. Jagan was implementing his promises for the welfare of various sections of society.

While Mr. Balaraju had resigned from the Jana Sena some time ago after severing ties with the Congress, Mr. Vijay Kumar had defected to the TDP just before the general elections. Mr. Venkataramiah had contested on Jana Sena ticket from Pendurthy after winning from Gajuwaka on Praja Rajyam ticket, which later merged with the Congress.

Badminton player Ch. Ushasri, who participated in several national and international events, joined the YSRCP in Visakhapatanam.

Earlier, she forayed into politics by joining the Jana Sena Party, in which she worked as campaign and publicity committee chairperson.

After joining the party, she said she was very much impressed with the style of functioning of the Chief Minister .

Meanwhile, the TDP Pulivendula constituency in-charge Singareddy Venkata Satish Kumar Reddy, popularly known as SV Satish Reddy announced to desert the party.

Mr. Satish Reddy unsuccessfully contested against the YSR family every time and became the face of the TDP in this constituency.

He was compensated with some post or the other when the TDP came to power.

In 2014, he was rewarded with the post of Deputy Chairman of the Legislative Council.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3rhnym/article31034085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJPAGE4BALARAJU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-jana-sena-leaders-join-ysrcp/article31034086.ece

Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams funds were deposited in Yes Bank against the set norms and the Centre should order a thorough inquiry into the whole affair, he said.

Mr. Naidu had conducted a global summit in New Delhi in collaboration with Yes Bank and wasted lakhs of rupees to prepare a tourism mission document, the Minister alleged.

“We are requesting the Centre not just to stop the investigation with Rana Kapoor but also include all those who were involved in hawala transactions with Yes Bank,” Mr. Venkataramaiah said.

The Communist Party of India State unit is in talks with the Telugu Desam Party to fight the local body elections jointly, according to party national secretary K. Narayana.

At a press conference here on Monday, Mr. Narayana took exception to the government bringing in an ordinance to ‘blackmail and arm-twist’ the opposition parties.

The CPI is in talks with other Left parties, including the CPI(M). It also began talks with the TDP, Mr. Narayana said. A clear picture would emerge by Tuesday, he added.

“It is a myth that this ordinance will stop money and liquor influence, but it will give a handle to the ruling party to summarily dismiss any elected representative they desire to tilt the scales,” the CPI leader said giving an example of YSRCP leaders distributing sarees in Tadipatri mandal of Anantapur district.

“The YSRCP is afraid of holding the elections in 29 Amaravati villages as it will lose very badly,” he said and added that it was a psychological defeat for the ruling party. “Women from these villages will now campaign in all over the State to ensure defeat of the YSRCP,” he observed.

Telugu Desam leader Dokka Manikya Vara Prasada Rao, who quit the MLC post recently, met Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and joined the YSR Congress Party on Monday. Minister for Higher Education A. Suresh, MLAs Meruga Nagarjuna and Ambati Rambabu were present.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Vara Prasada Rao in an open letter addressed to the people explained the reasons for taking the decision.

“In my entire political career, I have a single minded intention of serving the people and the political party is just a platform for it. I have my own reasons to quit the TDP. Just days before election notification in 2019, I was asked to contest from Prathipadu when I sought to contest from Tadikonda. I lost by a narrow margin, but the TDP had never sought to address my concerns. Before the beginning of Council sessions, I tendered my resignation sensing that the sessions could become controversial. I believe that the Council has an advisory role and complements the Assembly,” he said.

A Minister in the Kiran Kumar Reddy government, Mr. Vara Prasada Rao won from Tadkikonda (SC) Assembly constituency for two successive terms in the elections held in 2004 and 2009. After bifurcation of the State, he chose not to contest the elections and a year later, joined the Telugu Desam Party and was given the MLC ticket in 2017. He was the Chief Whip in the Legislative Council and won laurels for airing his views on many issues relating to the weaker sections.

Mr. Rahman told media persons, that he had been supporting the CM ever since he has made the announcement on making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital. He vowed to work for the victory of the YSRCP in the GVMC polls.

Addressing the media at Jammalamadugu in Kadapa district, the TDP leader said that he was busy holding meetings with party (TDP) cadres regarding selection of suitable candidates for the local bodies elections.

He said in the case of leaving the TDP and joining another party, he would definitely consult with his followers and party cadres, before revealing it to the media.

Andhra Pradesh has 970-km long coastline, the second largest after Gujarat. Despite its huge potential, the facilities available for the tourists are woefully inadequate due to Coastal Regulation Zone and other restrictions.

“We want 125 acres for developing an 18-hole world-class golf course, the first of its kind in the country and eco-friendly cottages along with apartments for living of senior citizens with some infrastructure to play water sports,” Vincent Pinto, Director, Site Master Planning & Golf Course Design, Pacific Coast Design, has told The Hindu.

He said they would be needing 125 acres for the golf course and 50 acres for resorts and other facilities without tampering with the curbs imposed under the Coastal Regulation Zone. He said as per their preliminary assessment, Visakhapatnam had tremendous potential.

Mr. Pinto, whose firm had international experience in developing golf courses, said they were yet to work out the investment pattern as their proposal was at nascent stage. He said the project would also help in creation of oxygen and stopping soil erosion.

When contacted, Mr. Pravin Kumar, who is also CEO of AP Tourism Authority, said in the new tourism policy they had laid emphasis on developing waters sports, adventure tourism, temple tourism and ecotourism besides encouraging investments by private parties to attract tourists interested to see 40 famous Buddhist sites located across the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/f56m26/article31027535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-VJ-COASTLINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/world-class-18-hole-golf-course-resorts-on-beachfront-near-vizag-mooted/article31027482.ece

“A special helicopter is also being kept ready to conduct the elections in the LWE-affected areas. Conducting the two-phase election within a short span is a major challenge but the recent experience in conducting the general elections will stand in good stead,” the Collector said.

He said that 11 polling stations are completely inaccessible, 272 stations are hypersensitive and 282 are sensitive among the total 1,072 Gram Panchayats that go to the poll among the total 1,103 in the district.

88,2020/03/10,"Ensure welfare schemes reach all tribal people, officials told","Staff should not be under the impression that they are doing a favour to them: DIG

Tribal people are not availing of various government schemes, meant for their welfare, due to their lack of awareness, said the speakers at the inaugural of an orientation workshop on ‘Welfare schemes of the Government of India for tribal people,’ here on Monday.

The workshop was organised by the Bureau of Outreach and Communication – Regional Outreach Bureau, Visakhapatnam, of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I & B) to train the field-level staff on reaching out to the tribal people in the interior areas.

Deputy Inspector General (Visakhapatnam Range) L.K.V. Ranga Rao, who participated as the chief guest, said that several government departments were involved in the protection of the interests of tribal people. The officers and staff of these departments should not be under the impression they were doing a favour to the tribals. The culture of tribal people was developed and there was no need to change it. All that they need was educational advancement and bringing about a change in some of their habits.

The artiste teams (kala brundalu) should identify the target groups and tell what was needed to that particular group. Youth should be told about the career prospects available to them and women on various aspects of their own health as also that of children. Mr. Ranga Rao said that though the Maoists would make their own efforts to influence the tribals, unlike the government departments, the Maoists do not have social outreach groups.

Field Publicity Officer M. Srinivas Mahesh in his report said that the Government of India has allocated ₹53,700 crore to tribal areas to provide better connectivity, improvement of roads, provision of drinking water and health. The objective was to ensure that the schemes reach the last person.

Jeevan Rani, District Immunisation Officer, briefed about the various schemes being implemented for the welfare of tribal women with the objective of bringing them on par with their counterparts in the plain areas. Apart from providing free education and health care, the tribal students were being given interest-free loans ranging between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore. K.S.L.G. Sastry, Chief Medical Officer, GVMC, explained about the programmes being implemented by the governments to improve the health facilities in tribal areas and appealed to the beneficiaries to utilise them.

Subedar Major Ramakrishna of CRPF 198 Bn, Tribal Welfare Officer Seetharamulu and a professor from Andhra University Srimannarayana were among those who spoke.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nu2ir8/article31027433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-VJ-TRIBALWELFARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensure-welfare-schemes-reach-all-tribal-people-officials-told/article31027434.ece
89,2020/03/10,160-year-old Chittoor school finds an exceptional friend in a police officer,"Musical instruments are the latest in a series of donations by the alumnus

The PCR Government High School here, with its hoary past dating back to the British Raj, has found an exceptional friend in circle inspector S. Gurunath of the intelligence wing in Chittoor, who vowed to bring back the lost glory of the institution, at a time when government schools find it a herculean task to have a decent infrastructure to match the growing demands of teachers and students.

An alumnus of the school, Gurunath had passed 10th class in 1995, cherishing a strong feeling to contribute for the uplift of his school. After getting a job in the police department, the cop’s resolve for the school had only doubled. After several years, Mr. Gurunath found himself lucky to be working in Chittoor district working close to his school. Now, posted in district headquarters Chittoor itself, the police official has found himself at home.

During the last couple of years, Gurunath had come out with several donations to his school, worth around ₹4 lakh to fulfil the essential requirements, including an RO water plant, cycle stand, a stage, contribution to the sports fund, providing a water connection and motor pump to the school, and a public address system.

On Monday, a batch of students attached to the cultural wing was a happy lot with Mr. Gurunath getting them a brand new set of “brass band”. The school authorities said that though donations such as notebooks and stationery were common, the police officer’s gesture of providing musical instruments was quite unique.

Produced visionaries

Interacting with the students, Mr. Gurunath urged them to always keep in mind the historicity of the school, which saw some of the British academicians as headmasters, to start with James Neale in 1856. “The PCR School has always stood the test of time, imparting discipline and the best education to students for several generations. I am happy that my school has produced several visionaries in the past 160 years,” he said.

Mr. Gurunath said that the police department in Chittoor district always took the lead in extending friendly gestures to government schools and hostels, including their adoption.

He wants to involve as many alumni as possible in the direction of creating strong infrastructure in the school and discipline among the students.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vi10kv/article31027421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VJPAGESCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/160-year-old-chittoor-school-finds-an-exceptional-friend-in-a-police-officer/article31027422.ece

Thousands of devotees witnessed the annual Rathotsavam of Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple at Mangalagiri in Guntur district on Monday. The market road reverberated with the chants of Jai Narasimha as the huge chariot moved through the packed crowds. It is the most significant event of the Brahmotsavam celebrated in this temple which is known for the hill-top Panakala Narasimha Swamy and its towering Raja Gopuram.

Devotees poured in from all corners to watch the presiding deities taken out in the richly-decorated chariot, which started rolling around 4 p.m. Police had a tough time in controlling the crowd as the devotees tried to break the cordon to break coconuts on the wheels of the chariot and giving ritual offerings.

Folk artistes depicted scenes from the Hindu mythology, particularly the battle between Lord Narasimha and Hiranyakasipu. Devotional songs were played on loud speakers even as the massive crowd went up in raptures on seeing the Lord come out in a grand procession.

Volunteers distributed Panakam and butter milk.

Religious ecstasy marked the ‘Kumaradhara theertha’ mukkoti festival on Monday at the sacred town of Lord Venkateswara.

Thousands of devotees, particularly from various districts and the neighbouring State of Tamil Nadu, enthusiastically trekked the arduous hilly terrains and reached the theertham (water falls) situated amid thick Tirumala forest, about nine kilometres from the town.

Immense importance is attached to the annual fete which according to the Hindu almanac coincides with the ‘Maagha’ pournami the mentioning of which is also found in Vamana and Varaha puranas. Innumerable water bodies that exist along the Seshachalam ranges are broadly divided into four categories – Dharma, Gnana, Bhaktivairagya and Muktiprada theerthams.

98,2020/03/10,Appeal to shift elephant that killed mahout on AOL campus,"A mahout was killed allegedly by an elephant inside the Art of Living (AOL) ashram on Kanakapura Road here on Monday. Now there is an appeal to shift the elephant out of the campus in the interest of both the animal and people around.

An AOL spokesperson said it was a “freak accident”. “The jurisdictional RFO and the police know about it and the wildlife head and Aranya Bhavan have been kept in the loop,” said the spokesperson, without divulging any further details.

Jurisdictional Forest Department officials said the incident occurred when the mahout, Rajesh R., 34, approached the elephant to give it a wash. “The incident happened on Monday afternoon. As of now, the elephant is lodged in the ashram and another person has been asked to look after it. We have given instructions to people not to go near the elephant unless it has to be fed and for medical check-up,” an official said.

Joseph Hoover, convener, United Conservation Movement, and others, under the umbrella of Friends of Animals, have appealed to the Forest Department to take care of the tusker until its “aggressiveness ebbs”.

“If the tusker has been in a constant state of musth, it would be prudent to release it for rehabilitation, in the interest of both the animal and people who are in close proximity to the elephant. The captive elephant, which has been restrained to a small area, should be relocated to an elephant camp either at Bannerghatta or Nagarhole Tiger Reserve,” the appeal stated.

“It has been a practice among private elephant owners in Tamil Nadu to send their tuskers to Madumalai Tiger Reserve to cohabit and de-stress at Theppekadu,” it stated.

But jurisdictional Forest Department officials said the decision to shift the elephant out of the AOL campus needs to be taken by the “higher authorities”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/x16lrb/article31034433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/appeal-to-shift-elephant-that-killed-mahout-on-aol-campus/article31034434.ece

If everything falls into place, then Vijayapura will soon have its own tree park near the Bhutanal tank on the outskirts of the city.

100,2020/03/10,Vishwanath seeks action against former Speaker Ramesh Kumar,"He accuses Congress leader of ‘provoking’ Muslims against Narendra Modi

Former Minister A.H. Vishwanath on Tuesday lashed out at former Speaker Ramesh Kumar for ‘provoking’ Muslims against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked the BJP government in the State to book a case against Mr. Kumar.

“A former Speaker of the State Assembly, Mr. Ramesh Kumar, who holds forth on constitutional values, has himself spoken in an unconstitutional manner by pitting one community against a democratically elected Prime Minister”, Mr. Vishwanath said while addressing a press conference here.

He said the State government should put him behind bars for inciting disturbing peace in the society.

Referring to the context of Mr. Ramesh Kumar’s reported speech, Mr. Vishwanath wondered why Congress leaders including Mr. Kumar and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah speak against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) only in Muslim areas. “Why do you go and speak about CAA only in Muslims areas? Why not in Hindu areas? That is because nobody comes to listen to you”, he said.

He accused the Congress leaders of misguiding innocent Muslims and sought to caution the community against the designs of the Congress. Mr. Vishwanath, who was disqualified from the Assembly by Mr. Ramesh Kumar during the latter’s tenure as Speaker, later contested as a BJP candidate in the by-polls to Assembly from Hunsur, but lost to Congress candidate H.P. Manjunath. Mr .Vishwanath also targeted Mr. Siddaramaiah and questioned his criticism of the B.S. Yediyurappa government’s move to wind up the Shaadi Bhagya scheme.

“Why do you want only Shaadi Bhagya? Aren’t Muslims entitled to Akshara Bhagya (education), Arogya Bhagya (health), Udyoga Bhagya (employment) and Rajakiya Bhagya (political representation)?”, he asked.

If the Congress has concern for Muslims, why doesn’t Mr. Siddaramaiah propose the name of a member of the community to the post of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) chief or Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader, he said.

Similarly, he said even the JD(S) pays only lip service to the Muslim community. “Could they not have appointed a Muslim as the party’s state unit chief after I quit?”, he questioned.

Fielding queries, Mr. Vishwanath said he favoured the continuation of Shaadi Bhagya and Tipu Jayanti. In a democracy, once a scheme is announced, it should not be withdrawn, he reasoned.

Referring to former Union Minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal’s remarks against freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy, Mr. Vishwanath found fault with both. While Mr. Doreswamy, who is respected as a freedom fighter, should not have identified himself with the Congress, Mr. Yatnal too should have exercised restraint, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hrgxc0/article31034411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MYSVISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vishwanath-seeks-action-against-former-speaker-ramesh-kumar/article31034413.ece
101,2020/03/10,Poultry industry hit hard in Mysuru,"Retail, wholesale prices of egg, chicken fall steeply, farmers in distress

The scare over bird flu has added to the prevailing anxiety over COVID-19 and taking a heavy toll on the poultry industry in Mysuru.

When the demand for chicken and egg from not only Mysuru, but also parts of neighbouring Kerala, had ebbed in the wake of global spread of COVID-19, the outbreak of bird flu in Kozhikode and a scare in Mysuru recently had delivered a huge blow to the poultry industry.

Even though government authorities including the Department of Animal Husbandry officials had clarified that there was no involvement of poultry in the outbreak of COVID-19 and there is no confirmation of any bird flu case in Mysuru, fake messages spread on social media against consumption of poultry had forced a lot of people to avoid chicken and eggs, said Satish Babu, the Mysuru coordinator of National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC).

Not only have people taken chicken off their menu in households, they are keeping off the dish even in hotels.

Serving of chicken and egg dishes had also come down at weddings. “Some hosts do not prefer chicken and egg dishes at weddings now”, said Mukarram, proprietor of Alishan Caterers.

The wholesale price of eggs, which were sold at an average of ₹408 for 100 eggs during 2019, had fallen to ₹ 340 now.

Due to fall in demand, several retailers had begun selling eggs for less than their purchase price. The price of egg in the retail market, which used to be around ₹5 per piece, is now less than ₹4.

The poultry farmers in Mysuru, who send about 8 to 10 lakh eggs every day to Kerala, have also been severely affected.

There are about 30 lakh layers (egg-laying hens) in Mysuru. In view of the slump, several farmers have begun a distress sale of the layers. “Even though the cost of production of a layer is ₹80 per kg, it is being sold for ₹40 per kg”, said Mr. Babu.

The prices of chicken too have hit rock bottom. The farmgate price of broilers has come down to an abysmal ₹ 20-25 per kg when the cost of production itself is ₹70 to ₹75 per kg. Each broiler bird weighs roughly around 2.2 kg, which means the farmer is getting no more than ₹50 for every kg, incurring a loss of about ₹100 for every bird.

The retail price of a kg of skinless chicken was around ₹160 to ₹180 kg before outbreak of coronavirus, but now it was available for as less as ₹60 per kg.

The condition of the poultry industry at present is worse than the situation prevailing in 2006 following the outbreak of bird flu, Mr. Babu said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/u7see9/article31033938.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MYSPOULTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/poultry-industry-hit-hard-in-mysuru/article31033939.ece
102,2020/03/10,Bird flu scare: laboratory reports awaited,"Two rounds of analysis will decide status, say experts

Even as the migratory birds nesting on trees in lakes around Mysuru city are under close watch, the Department of Animal Husbandry here is awaiting the lab reports on the cause of deaths of migratory birds reported on February 15 and 22.

The deaths had been reported from Hebbal and Chamundipuram areas. Two cranes each had been found dead and the samples were sent to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals in Bengaluru for analysis.

“If the samples test positive for the bird flu (H5N8) at IAHVB, the samples could have also been sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, for the second round of analysis. We are awaiting the reports from Bhopal. Avian influenza can be confirmed only on the basis of the Bhopal report,” said Ajit Kumar, Deputy Director, Animal Husbandry, Mysuru.

While denying reports of fresh deaths of cranes at Hebbal lake, Dr. Kumar said he visited the lake on Tuesday morning following the reports but he found no carcasses of birds. The area where the bird deaths had been reported last month had been sanitised.

Similar deaths of cranes had also been reported in Bengaluru rural district, he said and added that the lab reports can throw light on the source of infection and cause.

Admitting that the bird flu scare has hit the poultry industry, he said the poultry birds are safe with a lot of precautions taken by the owners in the wake of reports of the outbreak in Kerala. Yet, the industry is itself on high alert as the birds are sensitive.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/p34yk6/article31033935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MYSBIRDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bird-flu-scare-laboratory-reports-awaited/article31033936.ece

105,2020/03/10,Karnataka government considering special court to try IMA cases,"The State government is considering setting up a special court to hear cases pertaining to the multi-crore I Monetary Advisory (IMA) scandal that has hit several thousand investors across the State, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy told the Legislative Council on Tuesday.

Stating that the government was empowered to set up special courts in such cases, he said, “Should we have a special court, and if so should we have two or three courts, are issues before the government. There is a huge amount of evidence available in the IMA scam,” he said.

So far, more than 50,000 complaints have been registered in the State against IMA, which folded up last year. The police estimate that investors may have lost over ₹1,000 crore.

Meanwhile, government sources said three legislators have approached the State government to set up a special court for speedy trial. “There are thousands of victims. Regular court may not be able to accommodate all the cases. A special court is needed. However, the Cabinet has to decide on it,” a source said.

Recently, the High Court of Karnataka chastised the State government for not providing the necessary infrastructure, staff and financial and administrative powers to the newly created post of Special Officer and Competent Authority for IMA. It also directed the government to take a decision within a month on the requests of the Central Bureau of Investigation for grant of sanction for prosecution of five police officers named in the CBI report and the then Assistant Commissioner of Bengaluru North taluk in the case.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-considering-special-court-for-ima-cases/article31032792.ece
106,2020/03/10,"Karnataka government wages war on drug menace, says Minister Basavaraj Bommai","The State’s Home Minister said the government has taken it as a challenge with zero tolerance against drugs and is committed to fighting it.

Karnataka government has declared a war on drugs, with rise in the number of related cases, State Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Tuesday.

The government has taken it as a challenge with zero tolerance against drugs and is committed to fighting it, he said.

“This is a social menace that is prevalent at the State and national-levels, especially concentrated around education institutions in metropolitan cities,” he said.

“I want to tell the people of the State that we have declared a war on drugs and it needs to be tackled using various means,” Mr. Bommai said.

Responding to a question from K.J. George [Congress] in the Assembly, he said drug menace needed to be tackled, we need to break its backbone, and it is a very hard approach we need to take.”

We have booked 1,652 cases in the State in 2019, this is a rise by 600 cases in two years, this shows the trend, Mr. Bommai said, adding that several educational and control measures are being put in place by the government.

Raising the issue of drug menace during the question hour, George, former Home Minister, stressed the need to strengthen intelligence to fight against it, as he pointed out that there are some black sheep in the Police Department supporting such drug-related activities.

He said other than action against users and peddlers, there was need to find out its source, as the drugs come from other States and countries.

Coronavirus may come and go, but this is a permanent virus,” he said.

Stating that these days drugs were sold and purchased at the international-level using the Internet, the Minister said the State police have been able to break the dark web used for such illegal activities, and CCB have made several arrests in this regard.

Also expressing concern over the increase in synthetic drugs, Mr. Bommai said they are available in different forms such as chocolates, biscuits at educational institutions, hostels and beeda shops, and efforts are on to crack down on them.

He said the government would organise in April a mega campaign war against drug and awareness would be created, and called on parents, teachers, educational institutions, and society at large to join hands in fighting the menace.

Another Congress legislator N.A. Harris stressed on an effective legislation or change in laws to fight the menace.

Agreeing to it, Mr. Bommai said, “According to Narcotic Drugsand Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 we have been taking action, but it needs to strengthened and new sections need to be added, and we will do it.”

He also said the government has opened Cyber Crime, Economic Offences & Narcotics (CEN) police stations for effective control, and this year the Chief Minister has opened eight CEN police stations in Bengaluru and at all district headquarters.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/lx6uvn/article30660865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MNBOMMAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-government-wages-war-on-drug-menace-says-minister-basavar-bommai/article31032697.ece
107,2020/03/10,Peaceful Holi celebrations in Dharwad,"Holi, the festival of colours, was celebrated amid the scare of COVID-19, examinations round the corner and the high mercury levels here on Tuesday.

The Holi revellers played with colours at various places of the city even though the turnout at the celebrations was less compared to the previous years. The celebrations went off peacefully amid strict police vigil.

The celebrations began early in the day with children dominating the scene, splashing colours on their friends and relatives. Cheers and the cries of the children celebrating dominated the scene with them appearing in different shades of colours giving a thrill to their parents too.

Irrespective of gender, both boys and girls, including youth, celebrated Holi to the hilt. Cheers, splashing and dousing of colours and dancing and playing traditional instruments marked the festival of colours celebrated with traditional fervour and gaiety.

But the absence of PU students was felt at several locations. As the police had banned playing DJ music to contain noise pollution, people had to resort to Halagi beating. Some Holi revellers forum had also hired folk artistes to beat the drums.

The celebrations started with Kamannas being burnt in every street-corner of the city. In all, these Kamannas were kept in as many as 118 places.

Groups of youth searching for snacks and food were common as food joints and hotels were closed. Some provision stores and bakeries that opened at noon made most of the business. Fruit vendors had a heyday as they could do their business without having to face bargaining tactics from revellers who had gone hungry after celebrating the festival for over five hours since morning.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/peaceful-holi-celebrations-in-dharwad/article31032618.ece
108,2020/03/10,Four critical as eight workers suffersevere burns after boiler bursts,"As many as eight workers suffered severe burns after a boiler burst in a scrap tyre burning unit at Kadechur-Badiyal Industrial Area at Kadechur in Yadgir district on Tuesday.

All the injured have been shifted to Raichur Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Raichur. The condition of four of them is stated to be critical as they have suffered more than 60 % burns.

Severn of the workers were identified as Hussainsab, Arif, Sufiyan, Sameer, Imran, Imran Shabbir and Ravi Kumar, all aged between 20 and 40 and from Kadechur village.

Sources said that the scrap tyre burning unit is yet to become operational. On Tuesday, the workers were conducting a test run. When it was under test, the cap of the boiler, in which scrap tyres were burning, could not be opened. Thus, the workers employed gas welding methods to open the cap of the boiler. But, after a few seconds it came under heat, the cap suddenly opened and oil splashed on the workers. As a result, they suffered severe burns all over their bodies.

“Immediately after the incident, the workers were all shifted to RIMS where preliminary treatment was given. But, doctors advised that they be shifted to Hyderabad for further treatment as the condition of four of the injured became critical,” Mohammad Pasha, a relative of an injured worker, told The Hindu over phone.

The unit was originally owned by Bharat of Yadgir district and it was leased to a Hyderabad-based industrialist who owns a similar unit there. It was meant to supply oil to cement factories by burning scrapped tyres.

“The incident happened due to negligence of the owner of the unit who has taken it on lease and planned to operationalise it. Therefore, action should be taken against him,” Siddanagowda, a local resident, has said.

“We have asked him to pay initially all hospital expenditure to be incurred and later, give suitable compensation for the injured workers,” he added.

The Karnataka government is mulling over providing additional health insurance coverage to doctors and paramedics treating the COVID-19 cases and working in the laboratories besides existing schemes, Medical Education Minister Dr. K. Sudhakar said on Tuesday.

Stressing that their safety was ‘paramount’, he also asked them to follow the guidelines laid down by the Health Department while treating COVID-19 cases, the number of which has risen to four in the State.

He was speaking after inaugurating a new laboratory which will have testing facilities for coronavirus and other pathogens, including H1N1, at the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) at the Victoria Hospital campus in Bengaluru.

Shop-keepers said that COVID-19 scare is likely to hit business. Compared to last year, sales are down but they are hoping that people may reverse the trend and join the celebrations on Tuesday morning.

Idols of Kamanna and Rati have already been installed in public places and children gathering in the front of small tents over the idols and beating the “Halagi” (a percussion instrument made of leather) and dancing was a common scene on Monday.

The idols of Kamanna and Rati have been installed in public places in almost all the localities of Dharwad and people of all age groups are thronging the venues to see the idols.

The “Holi Hunnime” fell on Monday and the effigies of Kamanna will be burnt in the early hours of Tuesday. Before setting the effigies on fire, people will offer puja and perform religious rituals and this will be followed by splashing of colours on Tuesday.

The pot-breaking competitions, singing of Holi songs and drum-beating competitions as part of the celebrations will go on as usual.

Meanwhile, the Dharwad Halagi Habba that was held as a prelude to the Holi festival here on Sunday elicited overwhelming response with hundreds of people and folk troupes from Dharwad and surrounding areas enthusiastically participating in the event.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-casts-a-shadow-on-holi-celebrations/article31029253.ece
118,2020/03/10,‘Understand the spirit behind Women’s Day and celebrate it at all times’,"We should all realise that we can change our life by changing our attitude: Bimba Nadakarni

“Womanhood should be respected at all times, not just on Women’s Day,” said educationist Bimba Nadakarni at KLS Raja Lakhamagouda Law College in Belagavi on Monday. She was responding to a felicitation at “Garime”, an event organised at the college as part of International Women’s Day.

“Days come and go. There are days for fathers, mothers, children and other sections of society. We celebrate them and forget about them. But we all need to understand the spirit behind Women’s Day and celebrate it at all times,” she said.

She advised young women not to condemn other women who may not have succeeded in other walks of life, as “they might have had to face several battles that we cannot imagine”. “We should all realise that we can change our life by changing our attitude,” she said.

Ms. Nadakarni and other women achievers, herpetologist Nirzara Chitti and lifestyle photographer Trupti Kamat, were felicitated on the occasion. They interacted with students at the M.K. Nambyar Moot Court Hall. Principal A.H. Hawaldar felicitated the guests.

Ms. Kamat, a young photographer, who has succeeded in a field dominated by men, felt that there was no need for describing successful women as women achievers. “We don’t need tags. We need objective appreciation,” she said. She advised girls to choose a field of their liking and succeed in it with hard work. “What you need is the mental strength to live up to the challenges and do what others say you can’t do,” she said.

Ms. Chitti, the first woman snake rescuer in the State and a woman who has rescued the highest number of snakes in the country, asked men to support women in taking up vocations of their choice. “My husband trained me in handling snakes for five years and I have been a professional snake rescuer for eight years now,” she said.

“The bravest of men are afraid of snakes. They are surprised when a village girl like me goes to catch snakes. It is another matter that it relieves them of their tension,” she said.

Dr. Hawaldar, who presided over the function, noted the academic and co-curricular achievements of girls in the college. The guests felicitated the women support staff of the college. D. Prasanna Kumar, NSS coordinator, and Pavan Naik, NSS volunteer, administered a tobacco prohibition oath to students.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/to7qe1/article31029235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGWOMENSDAY1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/understand-the-spirit-behind-womens-day-and-celebrate-it-at-all-times/article31029237.ece
119,2020/03/10,Steps to avoid drinking water crisis,"Deputy Commissioner K.B. Sivakumar was speaking at a meeting on Monday to discuss the measures to be taken to ensure proper supply of drinking water during summer.

Deputy Commissioner K.B. Sivakumar has stressed the need for planned utilisation of the water stored in major reservoirs in the district to avoid drinking water crisis during summer. He was speaking at a meeting here on Monday to discuss the measures to be taken to ensure proper supply of drinking water during summer.

He said that with the present storage in Bhadra, Tunga, Anjanapura and Ambligolla reservoirs, it is possible to supply drinking water to the human habitats dependent on them till the end of June. The release of water from the reservoirs for non-drinking purpose without seeking the permission of the district administration has been barred. He directed the engineers in charge of these reservoirs to submit a report for him once in 15 days on the water storage.

Mr. Sivakumar told the meeting that as many as 316 human habitats in rural areas have been identified as vulnerable for drinking water problem during summer. He said that approvals have been accorded for proposals related to the work of identification of drinking water sources in the vicinity of such villages and drawing water by laying pipelines.

Underscoring the need for speedy implementation of the works related to multi-village drinking water supply schemes to mitigate the drinking water problem, he directed the officials of Department of Rural Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation to take measures for commissioning two multi-village drinking water schemes that were successfully operated on trial basis recently.

On the supply of drinking water through tankers, he said all administrative work related to this should be executed through the official software. He directed the officials to clear the bills related to drinking water supply works executed last year.

Anuradha, Additional Deputy Commissioner; and Chidananda Vatare, Commissioner of Shivamogga City Corporation, attended the meeting.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i66krb/article31029231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09SHIMOGAWATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/steps-to-avoid-drinking-water-crisis/article31029232.ece
120,2020/03/10,Field trials of ‘pest-proof’ cotton variety soon: CSIR,"The variety has been developed by a Lucknow-based research laboratory

In continuation of CSIR’s ‘farmer-centric’ approaches, a new pest-resistant cotton variety developed by a Lucknow-based research laboratory is ready for field trials which are expected to be done soon at Nagpur in Maharashtra.

Speaking to reporters on Monday, CSIR Director-General Shekhar C. Mande, who was in Mysuru, said the cotton crop usually faces the problem of pest attacks and scientists carried out a research for developing the “pest-proof” cotton variety.

The same variety will undergo further tests and trials before it is certified for commercial cultivation. The research has been carried out in collaboration with the ICAR-Central Institute for Cotton Research.

Dr. Mande recalled the Samba rice variety (Samba Mashuri), which was developed jointly by the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, a CSIR lab, and the ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice Research. Today, this “pest-resistant” rice variety was grown in about 18 lakh hectares in many States, helping farmers fetch higher yields and higher returns.

Dr. Mande also spoke about the aroma and honey missions. The Khadi Village Industries Corporation (KVIC) has joined hands with CSIR for the “Honey Mission”. Honey is a good alternative to sugar since it contains medicinal properties. A MoU had been signed with KVIC, he said. The idea is to help farmers take up modern methods of beekeeping to improve honey yield and also get additional income.

He said a new programme would be launched by the DST from April 1 to promote basic sciences by setting aside a grant of ₹50 crore. It would help students come up with scientific ideas in an attempt to encourage them to pursue basic science.

On the Aroma Mission and the CSIR Floriculture programme, he said the Aroma and Phyto-Pharmaceutical Mission was intended to boost the cultivation of aromatic plants that have medicinal properties. This mission, taken by the Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants and medicinal plants such as lavender and others, will be promoted with the help of farmers in several States, including Karnataka.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/field-trials-of-pest-proof-cotton-variety-soon-csir/article31029187.ece
121,2020/03/10,"Budget has focused only on South Karnataka and neglected North Karnataka, says KPCC","‘Funds were allocated for the Upper Krishna Project only after pressure from MLAs from the region’

Accusing the BJP government led by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa of being anti-North Karnataka and anti-minority, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson S.M. Patil Ganihar has said that Mr. Yediyurappa had neglected North Karnataka region and minorities in the recent budget.

Addressing presspersons here on Monday, he said that Mr. Yediyurappa has focused only on South Karnataka and his native district, Shivamogga, and neglected North Karnataka.

“By stopping a scheme such as Bidayi that is meant to give financial aid to women from minority community for their wedding, the BJP has shown that it is anti-minority,” Mr. Ganihar said.

Stating that political leaders from Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts wanted adequate allocation for the Upper Krishna Project, he said that Mr. Yediyurappa first did not allocate any funds in the budget but later coming under pressure from the party’s own MLAs from North Karnataka region, he announced ₹ 10,000 crore. “But we think it is an eye-wash as he did not clarify the source of the fund when the State is facing financial crunch with the Union government not paying over ₹ 8,000 crore as the State’s share,” he said.

Demanding that the Chief Minister to declare the source of funds to be mobilised, he asked the Chief Minister not to hoodwink the people merely by announcing funds for the project.

Referring to the long-pending demand for an airport in Vijayapura, Mr. Ganihar said that the budget has dashed the hopes of people as it has not allocated any funds for the project.

He said that neither the Union nor the State governments are giving any importance to the airport project when the same party is ruling in both the places. “Similarly, no announcement has been made for developing the tourism sector in Vijayapura and Bagalkot districts that have several ancient monuments,” he said.

He said that not just the Opposition, even MLAs from the ruling party are upset with the budget as it has neglected North Karnataka.

He demanded that the Chief Minister announce the continuation of the Bidayi scheme and funds for North Karnataka region in the supplementary budget.

122,2020/03/10,Special grant for State: Sadananda Gowda to speak to Finance Minister,"₹5,495 crore sought by Karnataka under the 15th Finance Commission

Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers D.V. Sadananda Gowda on Monday said he would speak to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman regarding the special grant of ₹5,495 crore sought by the State under the 15th Finance Commission.

“I will speak to her and see what best I can do to get that money for the State,” he told presspersons. He said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had told him that papers regarding special grants were now with the Finance Department. “I will speak to the Finance Minister on Wednesday and see what best I can do to get that money for the State,” he said.

The 15th Finance Commission had recommended a special grant of ₹5,495 crore to Karnataka for 2020–21, so that the absolute Finance Commission-driven transfers (devolution and revenue deficit grants) in the year remain similar to 2019–20. However, the Centre had earlier rejected the proposal. Karnataka has seen a sharp reduction in its share of the Central taxes in the 2020-21 financial year. The 15th Finance Commission, in its interim report for 2020–21, reduced the State’s share of the divisible pool of the Central taxes by more than one percentage point.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/special-grant-for-state-sadananda-gowda-to-speak-to-finance-minister/article31027373.ece

Deputy Chief Minister and Social Welfare Minister Govind M. Karjol told the Legislative Assembly that a letter has been written to the Revenue Department to initiate action against tahsildars and other officials who have issued false caste certificates without proper verification.

Mr. Karjol said there had been 68 cases registered for obtaining false caste certificates in order to contest elections. Some of them had gone to court contesting them, he added. He assured the members that action would be taken against all officials, including tahsildars.

At this point, members cutting across party lines demanded that the government bring out a law for punishing officials who issue false caste certificates. They pointed out that now the Social Welfare Department had ended up being the only recommending authority to the Revenue Department. Moreover, the Revenue Department would not take action against officials belonging to their department, pointed out Congress member Priyank Kharge.

124,2020/03/10,73-year-old injured in wild elephant attack in Tumakuru,"A 73-year-old man sustained serious injuries after a tusker trampled him in Kolihalli of Tumakuru taluk on Monday.

Venkatachala Murthy was going to the construction site of his house near his field around 7.30 a.m. when the tusker attacked him. He has been shifted to a private hospital in Tumakuru.

Raju, his son, told The Hindu that some villagers had seen the tusker earlier and had alerted Murthy, but he failed to register the matter as he had hearing troubles.

Deputy Conservator of Forests Girish said the tusker had come from Adarangi forest in Nelamangala taluk of Bengaluru Rural district. It entered Tumakuru district on Sunday night and was going back to Adarangi forest at the time of the incident.

Forest personnel are tracking the tusker and making announcements on loudspeakers for people to move away from its path.

126,2020/03/10,Marine protected area off the coast of Karwar,"The wildlife board has given concurrence for notifying a marine protected area, which will be the first of its kind in Karnataka.

The Mugali Marine Protected Area will come up off the coast of Karwar and is 6 km from the beach in the Indian waters. It harbours spinner dolphins, bottled-nose dolphins, Bryde’s whales, spot-tail sharks, whitetip sharks and whitecheek sharks. It has 34 of the marine wildlife species categorised under the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Sanjay Gubbi, a member of the board, suggested the protected tag given the range of marine life found in the area, and it was accepted by the board. However, there will be no restrictions on fishing.

In another significant decision, the wildlife board agreed to rationalise and redefine the boundary of Shettihalli Wildlife Sanctuary in Shivamogga. It was officially notified on November 23, 1974, but parts of the town which existed then, including the bus stand, some residential areas and the office of the Superintendent of Police, fall within the sanctuary’s boundary.

127,2020/03/10,PIL on Bidar school incident filed to demoralise police: Advocate-General,"The Advocate-General on Monday told the High Court of Karnataka that the PIL petition raising questions about police action at Shaheen School in Bidar in connection with a sedition case appears to have been filed to fight the case on behalf the accused and to demoralise the police.

A submission in this regard was made during a hearing before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi. The petition was filed by city-based advocate Nayana Jyothi Jhawar and the NGO South India Cell for Human Rights Education and Monitoring.

Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi also contended that the letters, written by the parents of some of the children studying at the school, to the Chief Justice contained fluent English and their contents are identical in nature. However, the parents have disowned the letters, Mr. Navadgi claimed, pointing out that petitions are filed on similar grounds before the High Court as well as the apex court.

When the Bench sought a reply on the photo of policemen in uniform interacting with the schoolchildren produced by the petitioner’s counsel, the A-G said he would verify the photograph with the investigating officer. He also pointed out that the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules state that the police officer interacting with children shall be, as far as possible, in plain clothes and not in uniform.

In its earlier response to the court’s query on the allegation made in the petition that policemen in uniform had questioning the children, the government had said that the investigating officer was in plain clothes, but a police videographer, who was initially in uniform on a particular day, was told to change the uniform.

The Bench adjourned further hearing on the case till March 26 while directing the investigating officer to submit a response to the photograph in the form of an affidavit.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pil-on-bidar-school-incident-filed-to-demoralise-police-advocate-general/article31026837.ece
128,2020/03/10,Karnataka wildlife board opposes proposed Hubballi-Ankola rail line,"The controversial Hubballi-Ankola railway line project, which came up for discussion at the State Board for Wildlife meeting held on Monday, saw stiff opposition from a majority of the board members.

The proposed rail project entails large-scale destruction of forests, including the felling of nearly 2.2 lakh fully grown trees in a biodiversity hotspot, but a section of officials argued in favour of the project. Sources said that there was political pressure from elected representatives of the region to get environmental clearance and permission from the wildlife board on the grounds that the project was a demand of the people of north Karnataka. The board met in Bengaluru and the meeting was chaired by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. Forest Minister Anand Singh and senior Forest Department officials, members of the wildlife board, and Chief Secretary Vijay Bhaskar were among those who attended the meeting.

A senior official supportive of the project argued that the railway line did not cut through a protected area and was outside it, and hence the permission of the board was not required. But those opposed to the project argued that any forest between two protected areas acts as a corridor, and so a discussion on the project was well within the purview of the board.

Some of the members pointed out that the project, which was announced in 1997, has met with stiff opposition at all levels. It was rejected by the Central Empowered Committee of the Supreme Court, the Ministry of Environment and Forests had opposed it, and even the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had rejected it twice on the grounds that the damage rendered by such a linear project through pristine forests could not be mitigated and the adverse affect on flora and fauna would be irreversible.

Kept in abeyance?

However, there was no response from the Chief Minister, who suggested that they move on to the next subject. This is interpreted to mean that the project may be in abeyance, but not rejected. A senior forest official who attended the meeting said there was opposition to the project from the members, but there was no confirmation on whether it was “officially off”.

The 164.44-km railway line passes through pristine forests between two major protected areas — Kali Tiger Reserve and Bedthi Conservation Reserve. A 75-km stretch between Hubballi and Yellapur comprises plain land, while a 56-km stretch between Yellapur and Sunksal is a ghat section where the track alignment cuts through the Western Ghats. More than 80% the line has to pass through the dense forest lands of the Western Ghats, and this entails the diversion of 727 hectares of prime forests. According to a railway document, the total land required is 995.64 hectares, including 595.64 hectares of forest land, 184.6 hectares of wetland, and 190 hectares of dryland.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2mugvy/article31026796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BgHubballiAnkola-Mapcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-wildlife-board-opposes-proposed-hubballi-ankola-rail-line/article31026797.ece
129,2020/03/10,New plant species spotted,"Sonerila sulpheyi is a small herb found near streams

A new species of plant belonging to the Sonerila genus of Melastomataceae family, Sonerila sulpheyi, has been discovered from the Thollayiram forest area under the Meppadi forest range of the Western Ghats in Wayanad.

The small herbaceous plant has been discovered by a team of researchers led by Salim Pitchen, conservationist, M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). T.K. Hrideek, scientist, Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), and Jose Mathew, Assistant Professor, Department of Botany of Sanatana Dharma College, Alappuzha, are the other members of the team.

This genus, known as the ‘golden leaf’, is believed to be a native to the Western Ghats, Mr. Pichen said. There are more than 183 species of this plant worldwide, he said.

Inflorescence

“The inflorescence of Sonerila sulpheyi is different from other plants of this genus, as it is branched,” Dr. Hrideek said. “The plant which grows on rocks adjacent to streams during the rainy season has fleshy tubers and lovely leaves and flowers. The life cycle of the plant is four months,” he said.

The plant has been named Sonerila sulpheyi in honour of M.M. Sulphey, Professor, College of Business Administration, Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia, for his contributions to environment in general, Dr. Jose Mathew said.

130,2020/03/10,iExams glitch disrupts HSE procedures,"But SSLC and HSE examinations go off well with no complaints forthcoming from students

The Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) and higher secondary eduction (HSE) examinations got under way in the State on Tuesday. With no complaints forthcoming from students, both the examinations seem to have gone off without a hitch.

The first paper for SSLC was first language. The Plus One papers included Biology, Sanskrit Sasthra, Communicative English, and Geology, while the Plus Two subjects include Part 2 languages and Computer Science and Information Technology.

However, glitches with the iExams software in the higher secondary section led to a delay in completing examination procedures and sending the answer papers to valuation centres. Though iExams is used for both SSLC and higher secondary sections, no hurdles were reported in the case of SSLC-related exam procedures. However, in the higher secondary section, the iExams software which replaced the Exam Manager last year developed problems for the second year running.

The higher secondary examination on Tuesday concluded at 12.30 p.m., but more than four hours later the answer scripts were not packed and ready for despatch by post to the valuation centres.

Uploading

After the exams, 13 answer scripts each are put into a packet along with the score sheet used by examiners to record the marks and the packet sealed.

A packing slip that is generated after the list of absent students is uploaded into iExams is stuck on the packets. While receipt of the address to which the answer papers are to be sent was delayed quite a bit, the packing slips started arriving only late in the evening. By this time, the answer scripts had been stored in the presence of exam deputy superintendents inside lockers where the question papers had been kept.

School authorities said much was made by the Education Department of the need for time-bound completion of exam procedures and despatch of answer scripts. Steps taken to maintain security such as CCTV cameras and lockers would have no meaning if the papers could not be sent on time.

A school Principal said iExams had been introduced only last year and changes had been made to the software this time. Glitches on the first day were not be made a big deal of and would be addressed within no time.

The Aided Higher Secondary Teachers Association alleged that keeping papers in the open without sealing them was a security risk and provided an opportunity for irregularities to occur. It also alleged that conducting the SSLC and higher secondary examinations together would destroy the higher secondary sector.

Joint exams fail

The Kerala Higher Secondary Teachers Union, in a statement, said the bid to hold examinations together in the name of merger of directorates had failed. With nearly 10 lakh students appearing for the HSE examinations, appeals by the union to remove any problems with exam procedures had gone unheeded by the department.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2f8ppd/article31034454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvtrexamKKN6,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iexams-glitch-disrupts-hse-procedures/article31034455.ece
131,2020/03/10,One more KFD case confirmed in Wayanad,"Vaccination awareness drive begins in Thirunelly grama panchayat

One more case of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever, was confirmed in Wayanad on Tuesday.

Of the 14 KFD cases reported in the district this year, three were undergoing treatment at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, and the District Hospital at Mananthavady.

As many as five KFD cases were reported in the district in a week and a woman succumbed to the disease on Sunday.

Vaccination only option

Meanwhile, the Health Department, in association with the Forest Department and the local body, launched a door-to-door visit at Thirunelly grama panchayat on Tuesday to sensitise the public to the significance of vaccination against KFD, Noona Marja, district surveillance officer, told The Hindu. They would also collect details of fever patients and adopt steps to shift them to the District Hospital, Dr. Marja said.

As many as 147 people, including health and forest officials and ward members of the grama panchayat, participated in the drive, G.Mayadevi, president, Thirunelly grama panchayat, said.

They visited 400 houses in Ward 17 and distributed notices and body lotion (to deter ticks) to villagers, Ms. Mayadevi, said. The drive would continue in the coming days, she said.

The Health Department would vaccinate 3,868 people in habitations on the forest fringes under the Appapara family health centre against KFD.

“Vaccination is the only possible remedy to keep the disease at bay. However, only 646 people have been vaccinated so far,” Dr. Marja said.

The reluctance of the villagers to take vaccination was a challenge and the awareness drive was expected to overcome their apprehension, Dr. Marja said.

Since KFD is a tick-borne viral infection that spreads from monkeys to humans, the movement of stray monkeys in human habitats is also a matter of concern.

Forest Department sources said though 18 carcasses of monkeys were collected from the Tholpetty forest range under the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary since January 1 this year, autopsy could not be conducted in any cases as they were in a decomposed state.

“Though we collected ticks specimens from the carcasses and sent it to the Health Department for analysis, we were yet to get results,” they said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/m53iak/article31034407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvwyhealthdrive1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/one-more-kfd-case-confirmed-in-wayanad/article31034397.ece
132,2020/03/10,Visually impaired student creates history,"Haroon Kareem writes SSLC exam on computer at Mankada centre

Visually impaired Haroon Kareem created history of sorts on Tuesday when he wrote the SSLC Malayalam examination on computer without a scribe’s support. He became the first student in Kerala to write the SSLC examination on computer.

When the invigilator C. Manoj read out the questions, Haroon typed the answers on the laptop at a special cabin arranged at the Government Higher Secondary School, Mankada.

On cloud nine

Haroon, his friends, family and teachers were on cloud nine as he surmounted many technical hurdles to write the examination on the computer in spite of his total blindness.

“This is a small beginning of a massive change. Our community (the visually impaired) should be brought to the mainstream, rather than being given a special status,” said Haroon.

Haroon had studied at a blind school at Mankada until Class 7. From Class 8, he said goodbye to Braille and strived to take notes and write exams on laptop. He said the entire school had supported him. He was excited to speak about his friends and teachers. His close friend Athira used to help him by drawing diagrams and pictures on his hand whenever the teacher drew one on the blackboard.

“There should be nothing special. The visually impaired should not be confined in special schools. They should be brought to the mainstream,” he said.

His father Abdul Kareem, who is a farmer, and mother Sabeera, who is a teacher, said they were proud of Haroon.

Role model

“He should be an inspiration for hundreds of others who are being sidelined because of their visual impairment. Their parents should take initiative to bring them to the mainstream,” said Mr. Kareem. Mr. Kareem had taught Haroon computer keyboard from his primary school. Haroon took a special liking for the computer, and developed software of his own to write the examinations on computer.

133,2020/03/10,Gulf travel plans of NRIs go awry,"GCC countries impose stringent restrictions on air passengers

Travel plans of hundreds of non-resident Indians (NRIs) have gone awry with several Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries imposing stringent restrictions on air passengers in the wake of the raging COVID-19 threat worldwide.

Those who have booked tickets for the summer vacation have postponed their travel plans even as many airline companies are facilitating rebooking for new dates even up to May 31.

So far the UAE, Bahrain and Oman have not imposed travel ban on Indians or foreign nationals who have visited India. But the restrictions have been put in place for entry ban for nationals of China, Iran and Italy and those who have visited these countries in the 14 days prior to travel to Oman.

“The ban on other GCC countries has forced many to take an exit route through the UAE or Bahrain for renewal of visas in April,” a software engineer P. Ashraf said.

There are others such as Rekha, an India-born U.K. citizen, who reached Kerala via Abu Dhabi last week for offering Pongala at the Attukal temple in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday despite the COVID-19 fears. She will be returning on Friday.

Entry to Qatar has been temporarily suspended for all those travelling from many countries including India.

Only passengers with onward connections through Hamad International Airport will be allowed for travel.

Preventive measure

This decision, authorities said, comes as a preventive measure due to the spread of the disease globally. It affects all individuals intending to enter from these countries, including visas upon arrival, those with a residence or work permit, and temporary visitors, the Qatar Airways said.

Similarly, Saudi Arabia has suspended the tourism visa from India and also entry to the country for the purpose of Umrah and visiting the Prophet’s mosque temporarily. Thus, travel agencies are either deferring or cancelling the travel to the cities of Mecca and Medina.

Likewise, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Kuwait, has issued a circular following the decision issued by the health authorities in that country that all incoming flights to and from Kuwait International Airport have been temporarily suspended for many countries including India for a week.

At the same time, India has issued a circular that all foreign and Indian nationals entering the country from any port are required to furnish a self-declaration form including personal particulars and travel history to health officials and immigration officials at all ports.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gulf-travel-plans-of-nris-go-awry/article31034299.ece
134,2020/03/10,Eight more test positive for COVID-19 in Kerala,"As many as 14 cases in the second wave of infection with Pathanamthitta cluster alone accounting for 11

Eight more people tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) in Kerala on Tuesday, taking the total number of positive cases reported in the State in the second wave of the disease to 14.

Of the eight positive cases, six belong to the COVID-19 cluster that originated in Pathanamthitta district, all of which are linked to the family that arrived from Italy on February 29.

The other two cases are that of the parents of the three-year-old boy who tested positive earlier and is already in isolation at the Government Medical College Hospital, Ernakulam. This family too came from Italy but they landed at Kochi only on March 8.

The COVID-19 cluster at Pathanamthitta initially included the three-member family from Italy and two of their immediate relatives staying next door. All are already isolated at General Hospital, Pathanamthitta.

On Tuesday, the cluster further expanded as the daughter of the family and her husband (both who received the family at the airport), the two grandparents and two friends of the family also turned out to be COVID-19 positive.

These persons are now isolated at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kottayam, and District Hospital, Kozhencherry.

Condition stable

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja told mediapersons that while the health status of all patients is stable and satisfactory, the condition of the two elderly patients is indeed a cause for concern as they suffer from other geriatric morbidities.

The Health Department currently has 1,495 persons under surveillance in various districts, of whom 259 persons are in isolation in various hospitals with mild or moderate symptoms of respiratory illness. The rest (1,236 persons) are on monitored self- quarantine in their own homes.

Contact-tracing on

Ms. Shylaja said the contact tracing exercise linked to the family at Pathanamthitta is progressing meticulously and that in the past two days various teams deployed by the department have managed to trace a majority of persons with whom the family members might have come into contact.

The attempt is to limit the community spread by finding the maximum number of contacts and putting them under quarantine. Details of the flight co-passengers of the family at Kochi are being collected.

In an attempt to expedite testing of samples, the government has now sought permission for the SARS CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) PCR tests to be done at Government Medical College, Thrissur, State Public Health laboratory and at Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology also. This is apart from the testing facilities currently made available at the National Institute of Virology unit at Alappuzha and the medical colleges in Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram.

Support services

Ms. Shylaja said the mental health teams of the Health Department are already in touch with the patients in isolation and the families on home quarantine and are giving the necessary support services. The local self-governments have been asked to seek the service of volunteers to lend assistance to the families who are home-bound because of the 28-day quarantine norm imposed by the State.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zgwnvc/article31034277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tv-Covidcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/eight-more-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-kerala/article31034269.ece

136,2020/03/10,Vaikom to welcome second solar-powered vessel,"2 emission-free vessels in the pipeline

Three-and-a-half years after Aditya, the country’s first solar passenger boat, was inducted into service, Vaikom in Kottayam is now set to welcome its second solar-powered passenger vessel in June this year. Works on the IRS (Indian Registrar of Shipping ) — class vessel — with a capacity to carry 75 passengers, is progressing fast at a private yard in Aroor in Kochi.

Confirming the move, Shaji V. Nair, State Water Transport Department (SWTD) said plans were afoot to launch two emission-free vessels between May and June this year. “One of them will be operating between Vaikom-Thavanakkadavu route — one of the busiest water routes in the State, while a survey is on to identify the route of operation for the second boat,” he said.

Official sources said the second vessel was most likely to hit the Perumbalam-Panavally route around the same time. The cost of construction per vessel, which will work on 80 Kilo Watts propulsive power engine, is estimated to be around ₹2.5 crore.

“The design and specifications were finalised after analysing the operation of the pilot project Adithya for two years. Accordingly, some changes were made in the overall design while the capacity of battery has been doubled to ensure more running time,” the official said.

Solar cruise boat

Meanwhile, a ₹3.5 crore double-hull solar cruise boat is expected to join the SWTD fleet later this year. The AC double-decker boat, which will have 100 push-back seats on the lower deck and a party area on the upper deck, is for operating package trips connecting the various backwater destinations across Alappuzha and Kottayam. Inspired by the success of Aditya, Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran recently announced that the SWTD planned to induct five more solar boats into its fleet. The announcement was made while inaugurating the third anniversary celebrations of Adithya in Vaikom last week. On the occasion, the Minister also announced plans to allocate a hovercraft service to the town.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vaikom-to-welcome-second-solar-powered-vessel/article31034172.ece
137,2020/03/10,Plan to make a mini-forest in Mavelikara block soon,"Local body joins hands with Folkland international centre

The Mavelikara block panchayat is set to become the proud owner of a mini-forest in the near future.

The local body has joined hands with the Folkland International Centre for Folklore and Culture, a Kasaragod-based non-profit organisation, to create a dense forest on two cents of its land using the Miyawaki method.

More than 350 saplings of fruit-bearing/medicinal trees and plants of various native species will be planted as part of raising the forest on the premises of the block panchayat office.

“One of the best ways to fight climate change is planting and growing trees. The local body has decided to take the initiative and lead from the front. We have already identified a small area and started work for creating the forest. The initial cost of planting will be borne by Folkland. Saplings will be sourced from the Forest Department, individuals and non-government organisations. It will act as a carbon sink and encourage others to follow suit,” says, K. Reghu Prasad, president, Mavelikara block panchayat.

Japanese technique

Miyawaki is a technique introduced by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki that revolutionised urban afforestation by creating dense and native forests. It involves planting several native species in a small area and making it a self-sustaining green space in three to four years.

Ahead of the planting, the earth was dug up to three feet. Further, 1,500 kg of cow dung and other organic fertilisers were added to the soil to make it more fertile. According to V. Jayarajan, chairman, Folkland, trees in four different categories — canopy, large, medium and small — will be planted.

“The forest will host a large number of trees and plants of different native species. These include jackfruit, mango, black plum among others. Between three and four years, it will take the shape of a dense forest where birds and other organisms thrive,” Mr. Jayarajan says.

The local body will provide seating facilities in the forest. The future maintenance of the forest will also be done by it.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/plan-to-make-a-mini-forest-in-mavelikara-block-soon/article31034170.ece
138,2020/03/10,Assembly pays homage to Vijayan Pillai,"Chavara MLA passed away recently

The Legislative Assembly on Tuesday paid rich tributes to Chavara MLA N. Vijayan Pillai who passed away recently.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reminisced about Pillai’s selfless efforts that gained wide acceptance in his constituency and beyond. Recollecting his last conversations with the late CPI(M) legislator, Mr. Vijayan said he had deferred seeking medical attention for his ailment out of fear that his absence from public life could affect many of those who depended on him in Chavara.

Quality

Such was his quality that endeared him to all sections. He has never tasted defeat in his political career since becoming a member of the Chavara grama panchayat.

He added that his victory from the Chavara constituency during the last Assembly polls was no mean feat, considering the area used to be considered a bastion of the Revolutionary Socialist Party for decades.

Industrialist

Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said Mr. Pillai stood firmly by underprivileged sections all throughout his political career even as his business grew.

He excelled both as an elected representative as well as an industrialist.

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan, Ministers E. Chandrasekharan, Ramachandran Kadannappally and representatives of various parties including M.K. Muneer, Mathew T. Thomas, Mons Joseph, Mani C.

149,2020/03/10,Iron Age sickle discovered from Malampuzha reservoir area,"Discovery may throw light on agrarian life in Iron Age

An iron sickle presumed to be from the Iron Age was discovered from the Malampuzha reservoir near here recently.

The broken sickle was found on top of a destroyed urn in the valleys that had long been converted into the reservoir of the Malampuzha Dam. The discovery made by a team of researchers led by K. Rajan, associate professor of history at Government Victoria College here, has the potential to throw light on the agrarian nature of life led by the people in the locality during the Iron Age.

Mr. Rajan and team have been exploring the reservoir and the catchment areas of Malampuzha for the last two years. Several iron tools were recovered during the explorations in recent months from the catchment areas.

Iron implements such as a nail, a chisel, a wedge, a knife and a dagger had been recovered during explorations in July last year. They were found from a cist burial site.

Burial units

Malampuzha region has many varieties of Iron Age burials, including cairn circles, stone circles, cist burials, dolmens, urn burials, and menhirs.

Mr. Rajan resumed the exploration a few weeks ago when the waters in the Malampuzha reservoir receded. The broken urn and the iron sickle were found during an intensive search for the Iron Age traces.

“The sickle can be considered as a piece of solid evidence to prove that the Iron Age people who lived in Malampuzha and neighbouring locality had led an agrarian life,” said Mr. Rajan.

Historians and archaeologists across the world have associated sickle as a symbol of agriculture. “It’s mainly used for agricultural purpose. Interestingly, iron technology, pot making, agriculture and a developed burial culture were the most important characteristics of the Iron Age in Kerala,” said Mr. Rajan.

Archaeological explorations have thrown up pieces of evidence to prove that that the low-lying areas around mountains and hills in Kerala had been widely cultivated by the people of Iron Age. But historians are yet to come up with any evidence to throw light on the irrigation system that existed during the Iron Age.

“We do not have any idea about the irrigation system that the people Iron Age had used. It is certain that people might have begun cultivating the naturally irrigated fertile lands in the fringes of the hills and mountains,” said Mr. Rajan.

Iron Age in Kerala is said to have started in the pre-Christian era and ended by the first third centuries after Christ. An exploration conducted by M.G. Sasibhooshan in 1980s had found burial sites within the catchment areas of Malampuzha.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has asked the Victoria College researchers to survey the region thoroughly and to document it in detail.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7xw7dt/article31034118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvmpm-IronAgeSickle,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iron-age-sickle-discovered-from-malampuzha-reservoir-area/article31034119.ece
150,2020/03/10,Kasaragod records increase in tourist arrivals,"Efforts of Bekal Resort Development Corporation and DTPC play major role

Kasaragod district has become the favoured destination for foreign tourists visiting Kerala for the second consecutive year.

According to reports published in March by the Department of Tourism, Kerala, the district has seen a huge increase in the arrival of foreign tourists in 2019, compared with the previous years.

The remarkable growth in foreign tourist arrivals was achieved despite issues like the Nipah virus outbreak and floods that severely affected the State. This was made possible with the establishment and efforts of the Bekal Resort Development Corporation (BRDC) and the promotional activities carried out by the District Tourist Promotion Council.

The district was visited by 7,269 foreign tourists in 2019, up from 4,122 in 2018. The district had seen a sudden increase in foreign tourist arrivals since 2011. However, their number dropped from 2,040 in 2011 to just 1,115 in 2017. But, with initiatives such as SMILE (Small and Medium Industries Leveraging Experiential Tourism), homestays, the introduction of houseboats and other activities captained by former BRDC managing director T.K. Manzoor, tourism in the district flourished and it was able to attract a large number of foreigners to the district. The boost in tourism also provided more job opportunities to the local population.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kasaragod-records-increase-in-tourist-arrivals/article31034019.ece
151,2020/03/10,Panchayat to restore Anjarakandy river,"Removal of obstructions, construction of barriers mooted

The District Panchayat has decided on the restoration of the Anjarakandy river as part of the From Grime to Radiance (Azhukkil Ninu Azhagilaekh) to protect the water resources of the district.

District Panchayat President K.V. Sumesh announced this during the Anjarakandy River Study Summary Seminar attended by members of Sastra Sahitya Parishad and 12 representatives of local bodies, at the Science Park here on Tuesday.

He said that a detailed project report would be prepared to restore the river which passes through the 12 local bodies and the process would begin within a month.

During the meeting, recommendations were mooted, based on the primary studies conducted at the local level.

It was suggested that any activity that would hinder the smooth flow of the river should be removed. Plants and trees such as bamboo should be planted to strengthen the river banks and prevent landslips. It was also suggested that barriers be constructed along the stretch of the river.

The study found that trees, sand dunes, and piers interfere with river flow. There are 38 bridges, six hanging bridges and five dams across the river.

Solid and liquid waste accumulates in many areas.

The study also found that the silt had accumulated in the river owing to the construction of the bridges and that this had led to flooding.

A total of 442 students and members of the Sastra Sahitya Parishad participated in the study under the leadership of local bodies. The study report was prepared based on a survey and mobile app Kobotool, developed by the Sastra Sahitya Parishad.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/panchayat-to-restore-anjarakandy-river/article31034009.ece

“We have learnt that a government-level review of the general situation will be held on March 16. A decision on whether to extend the period of the closure of theatres will be taken on the basis of the feedback given by the government and after making an overall assessment,” said M. Renjith, president of the Kerala Film Producers’ Association.

A joint meeting of trade bodies representing exhibitors, producers, technicians and distributors was held after the government imposed major restrictions on public gatherings across the State following the spike in COVID-19 cases.

Mr. Renjith said that shooting of nearly 20 Malayalam films was progressing at various locations in the State and outside. “We have asked the producers of the movies to take a call on whether to suspend the work based on the health scenario prevailing at locations,” he said.

The meeting decided that movies that had good run at the box-office till Tuesday would be screened again once the cinemas opened following the temporary shutdown.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cinemas-in-kerala-to-remain-shut-till-march-16/article31033726.ece
153,2020/03/10,Drastic fall in flyers at Kerala airports,"Export of perishables too drops

The four international airports in the State are witnessing a drastic fall in international flyers in the wake of COVID-19 scare.

The volume of daily export of fruits and vegetables to West Asia through the Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode airports had dropped from 140 tonnes to 70 tonnes, causing a dent in foreign exchange earnings.

The Cochin international airport, which handles the highest number of international flights in the State, is the worst-hit as the drop in flyers is in the range of 30-35%.

As many as 21 flights operate weekly in the Kochi-Kuwait sector.

The load in domestic flights operated from Kochi is above 90% and it remained intact even on Tuesday, an airport official said.

At the Thiruvananthapuram international airport, the dip in international flyers is 17%, while it is 15% in the Calicut international airport.

The Kannur international airport, which does not have international flights of any foreign carrier, has a drop of 20% in international flyers.

Due to the drop in flyers, some of the airlines have switched from wide-bodied to narrow-bodied aircraft. Malindo Air, which operates from Malaysia, and Scoot, which operates from Singapore, have reduced the frequency to make the flight operations feasible, Director of the Thiruvananthapuram airport C.V. Ravindran said.

No curbs on cargo

“There is a drop in volume of the export of perishables from the State. We have been taking care to maintain quality and hygiene at all levels. So far, there is no restriction on the export cargo due to the outbreak of COVID-19. As the flights have been restricted to Kuwait, we are resorting to transshipment cargo to send perishables from other ports in West Asia,” secretary, Agricultural Products and Processed Food Exporters Association (APPEXA), Dil Koshy said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/arzgwu/article31034302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tv-flightscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/drastic-fall-in-flyers-in-state-airports/article31032715.ece
154,2020/03/10,Coronavirus: Kerala in partial shutdown mode,"All educational institutions closed, but no change in SSLC, Plus Two exams

With eight more cases of COVID-19 being confirmed in Kerala on Tuesday, the State has gone into a partial shutdown mode by imposing limits on public gatherings and ordering closure of schools and colleges till March 31 to prevent further spread of the disease.

At a press conference here on Tuesday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who chaired a special Cabinet meeting here, urged temples, churches, mosques and ashrams to suspend crowded festivals and events till the threat eased. He advised madrasas and other places of religious learning to temporarily suspend classes.

Programmes cancelled

All public programmes, including those involving Ministers, stand cancelled. Government offices will observe a strict protocol to prevent the spread of the virus. The public have been advised to avoid overcrowded weddings and social activities for now. There will be no cinema shows, staging of dramas and other cultural events till March 31.

Mr. Vijayan sought to marshal public support for the government’s decision to shut down educational institutions and halt academic activities, including summer holiday camps and private tuitions, till the threat of the outbreak receded. He said SSLC (Class 10) and Plus Two examinations would be held as per schedule. Students under observation for COVID-19 could appear for the tests in special rooms.

Anganwadis shut down

The government also shut down anganwadis and ordered District Collectors to supply meals to the children at their homes.

155,2020/03/10,A study centre to hone language skills,"Kollam district panchayat’s regional language initiative

If it is her sheer interest in learning a new language that brought Rajani to the classroom, Taha, a retired teacher and an avid traveller, wants to improve his vocabulary in Tamil. And they both attend Kollam district panchayat’s regional language study centre with its motley crowd of students who include pensioners, young professionals, college-goers and homemakers.

The centre offering free language lessons, perhaps the first of its kind initiative started by a local body in the State, currently conducts Tamil and Hindi classes. “I have worked in different parts of India and I know a handful of regional languages though I am not proficient in any of them. I find it an opportunity to hone my language skills,” says Raju, retired from the Civil Supplies Department.

Culture

The students are taught not just alphabets as their teachers also introduce them to the regional culture through custom, proverbs and folk tales. Sivaprakasam, a teacher originally from Salem and settled in Kollam, handles Tamil classes while Haseena, a guest instructor at a nearby school, teaches Hindi.

“All the students are very diligent and they really want to get some command over the language. In Kerala there is a strong Tamil population and there are many traders who keep commuting between the States. Tamil influence is seen in many parts and even Chinnakkada, name of the city centre of Kollam, is actually derived from Tamil,” says Mr. Sivaprakasam.

Ms. Haseena says many of her students attend the classes for the right choice of words and fluency, skills they lack despite learning the language for several years it at school. “Some students attend the classes to communicate with the migrant labourers they have employed without the help of an interpreter.”

The students who skip a class come a little early for the next session so that they can catch up with others and they are also encouraged to get in touch with the teachers if they have any doubts.

Good response

“The idea is to make the students capable of reading, writing and communicating. Hindi was selected as our national language and Tamil is one of the oldest languages in the world. We have fixed the maximum strength as 30 so that all of them get individual attention. The feedback so far has been good and we are planning to start a Sanskrit batch this year,” says K. Prasad, district panchayat secretary and the implementing officer for the project.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-study-centre-to-hone-language-skills/article31032388.ece
156,2020/03/10,Pilgrims told to avoid Sabarimala darshan,"TDB will not block pilgrims reaching the temple

Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president N. Vasu has urged the public not to attend the monthly pujas scheduled to be held at Sabarimala Ayyappa temple from March 13 to 18.

Mr. Vasu told reporters here on Tuesday that the request to pilgrims to abstain themselves from the monthly pujas was made in view of the precautionary measures initiated by the government following the spread of COVID-19 cases. Pilgrims from all over the country reach the temple for the monthly pujas. The State Cabinet too had called upon the public to suspend festivals, marriages and other functions that would have mass gatherings.

The board would not physically block pilgrims reaching the temple for the monthly pujas, but Mr. Vasu exuded the confidence that Ayyappa devotees from different States who frequented the temple would cooperate with the board and the government to contain the spread of the virus. The pujas and other rituals will be held by the Melsanthi and other board staff residing at Sabarimala. No additional staff will be deputed to the temple.

The board urged the advisory committees of other temples under its ambit to cancel cultural programmes planned in connection with annual festivals and restrict it traditional rituals alone to avoid mass gathering.

The precautionary measures have been initiated in the current month and would be reviewed as per the changing circumstances. The temple would again be opened for festival on March 28 and would be closed on April 7, Mr. Vasu said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pilgrims-told-to-avoid-sabarimala-darshan/article31032336.ece
157,2020/03/10,Minorities’ education panel finds lapses on MCC Principal’s part,"It calls for probe into Jaspreet Singh’s death

The National Monitoring Committee for Minorities’ Education on Tuesday collected details about the circumstances that led to the suicide of Jaspreet Singh, third-year student of BA Economics at Malabar Christian College (MCC), Kozhikode.

The main function of the committee is to monitor minority education as well as the schemes of the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development for minorities.

Committee member A. Vinod spoke to the family members of Jaspreet and interacted with Godwin Samraj, college Principal, and teachers of the economics department. Jaspreet took the extreme step on March 1 after he was reportedly denied a chance to write the final semester examinations following attendance shortage. He did not have the 75% attendance to appear for the examination.

Though Jaspreet had cited domestic problems for his absence from college and sought a relaxation in the norms, the college authorities were reportedly not willing to budge.

Mr. Vinod told the media later that the ongoing inquiry by the college staff council as well as the police had not considered the sentiments of Jaspreet’s parents, who had sought action against the Principal and others for turning down his repeated request for relaxation in the attendance norms.

There had been lapses on the part of the Principal. Though Calicut University had sought a report from the college after Jaspreet approached it with a request to allow him to write the examination, the student was not informed about it. The committee would look into the family’s allegation that racial remarks were made against Jaspreet and his family, Mr. Vinod said.

“The Principal, however, claims he was not aware of any such remarks. The apathy on the part of the teachers is evident from the fact that none of them had bothered to visit Jaspreet’s house even 10 days after the incident,” he said. Mr. Vinod said that Calicut University should conduct a probe after suspending the Principal and other teachers from their posts.

A report would be submitted to the committee chairman, University Grants Commission, Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, State Higher Education Department, and Calicut University, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2ptved/article31037109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10KIJASPREET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/panel-finds-lapses-on-principals-part/article31032238.ece

159,2020/03/10,Kerala clamps down on public gatherings as COVID-19 resurfaces,"Government constrained to impose limits till March 31, says CM

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday said the government was constrained to impose limits on public gatherings till March 31 to prevent further spread of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).

He said 12 persons in Kerala have tested positive for the infection (COVID-19) after the virus resurfaced in Pathanamthitta district last week. Four of a family had arrived there from Italy, a coronavirus hotspot, and inadvertently infected eight others.

They appeared to have concealed their travel history from authorities. Mr. Vijayan said the State could ill afford to brook such negligence given the risk of contagion.

As many as 1216 persons are under surveillance across the State, of which 967 are confined to their houses. The government had sent samples drawn from 807 patients to check for coronavirus. He said 714 of the specimens had tested negative. The remaining results were awaited.

Sabarimala

Importantly, Mr. Vijayan appealed to the public to forego darshan at Sabarimala temple till March 31. He said the rituals at the Ayyappa temple would go on as per the religious calendar and without any disruption.

He appealed to madrasas and other places of religious learning to temporarily suspend classes. Mr. Vijayan also urged managements of temples, churches, mosques and ashrams to abandon crowded festivals and events. He also requested the public to avoid overcrowded weddings and social activities until the threat passed.

160,2020/03/10,Join hands to tackle viral diseases: expert,"‘Compartmentalisation will harm disease control programmes’

Medical practitioners and researchers should function hand-in-hand to tackle emerging viral infections, Shyam Kottilil, Chief, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland, Baltimore, has said.

Speaking to the The Hindu, Dr. Kottilil said the compartmentalisation of various sections will hit the effectiveness of disease control programmes.

“There is a real shortage of virologists in the medical field. We need research in emerging diseases and their mode of transmission. There should be studies about vector biology and vector control measures. We need epidemiological data to improve surveillance,” Dr. Kottilil, who is the Director of the Division of the Clinical Care and Research at the Institute of Human Virology, USA, said.

State’s health network

Early diagnosis and breaking the chain of transmission are the most effective ways to contain viral infections. Kerala could control Nipah effectively since the State had the advantage of a well-developed healthcare network, he said.

Dr. Kottilil, who is a member of the American Society of Clinical Investigation, said people panicked over viral infections as they can affect anybody and transmit rapidly. They can become pandemic and lead of massive fatalities.

Higher risk

“Pandemics are complex whether in developed or developing countries. In the case of COVID-19, it was imported. Containing people coming from outside is one thing. But if it starts transmitting within the local community, things will go out of hand. The increasing lifestyle diseases put more people at higher risk in the case of viral outbreaks.”

In Kerala, the Health Minister herself was leading the medical team. But in case of bigger outbreaks, one person or a small group may not be able to handle the situation.

In developed countries like the U.S., a government agency is leading and co-ordinating the research, preventive and medical programmes, he said.

Generic medicines

Dr. Kottilil, one of the founding members of the US National Hepatitis C treatment Guidance Panel, said India producing many generic medicines for Hepatitis C at reasonable rates was good news.

“But in the absence of a national programme, a systematic follow-up has not been taken out in the case of Hepatitis C, like in the case of HIV/AIDS. So many people drop off and stop medication. We do not have sufficient data either. Dialysis patients and drug abusers are two known risk groups of the disease. The challenge is to make sure that they continue to take medicine. The national programme on HIV/AIDS was a role model.”

Vaccination

The focus of research is on ways to prevent these diseases with vaccination and how they can be completely cured. However, researches on effective vaccination for HIV/AIDS has yet not made much progress, especially in persons who have had repeated exposure to HIV/AIDS virus, said Dr. Kottilil, recipient of Hinda and Richard Rosenthal award from the American College of Physicians.

A graduate from Thrissur Government Medical College, Dr. Kottilil has authored over 300 peer-reviewed publications.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5b9bg0/article31029100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvtrdrshyamKKN4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/join-hands-to-tackle-viral-diseases-expert/article31029101.ece
161,2020/03/10,Steps to minimise spread in community,"Contact-tracing of COVID-19 positive Pathanamthitta family on: Shylaja

The Health Department has launched an all-out effort to backtrack and trace all persons who might have come into contact with a family based in Pathanamthitta that had returned from Italy and found to be COVID-19 positive on Saturday.

Addressing mediapersons here on Monday, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said meticulous contact-tracing and isolation were perhaps the only way one could attempt to limit or minimise the spread of the infection in the community.

On Monday, the Pathanamthitta district health administration managed to add another 120 people to the primary contacts list of the family, taking the total number of primary contacts to 270. As on Monday, apart from the five persons who tested COVID-19 positive at Pathanamthitta, a child too tested positive for the disease at Ernakulam. The condition of all six were stable and satisfactory, she said.

The State on Monday put 1,116 persons under surveillance, of whom 149 were in isolation wards in hospitals.

In anticipation of more people going under isolation, additional facilities were being readied at hospitals.

The department was also strengthening community surveillance, by roping in local bodies and ward-level health and sanitation committees, to ensure heightened vigil whenever people from abroad take up residence in a locality. In the urban areas, corporation councillors have been tasked to talk to representatives of residents’ associations and initiate similar monitoring.

More testing facilities

The State had sought and obtained permission from the National Institute of Virology to open SARS- CoV-2 testing facilities at the government medical colleges in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode.

At a meeting called by the Prime Minister’s Cabinet Secretary, the State had appealed that local airport authorities be delegated discretionary powers to accommodate requests from the District Collector or the State health authorities, rather than wait for the consent of the airports authority, Ms. Shylaja said.

Against the backdrop of COVID-19, the Health Department decided to take action under the Travancore Cochin Public Health Act against any person, who by their non-disclosure of travel details and non-adherence to health advisories, might endanger the health of public.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/steps-to-minimise-spread-in-community/article31027295.ece
162,2020/03/10,Pongala offered amid COVID-19 fears,"Thousands brave scorching summer heat for ritual in ten-kilometre radius

Tens of thousands of women offered Pongala at Attukal Bhagavathy Temple here on Monday under the grim shadow of COVID-19 and amid heightened disease surveillance by the government apparatus.

News of the sixth COVID-19 case in Kerala in two days broke from Kochi on Monday morning even as devotees were engaged in last-minute preparations for the annual ritual, described as ‘Women’s Sabarimala’ and the largest assemblage of women.

Braving the scorching summer heat, devotees jammed the premises of the Attukal temple, the epicentre of the festivities, and lined city streets with makeshift brick hearths in a ten-kilometre radius.

Women had arrived from all over the State to make the offering - a sweet pudding of rice, jaggery, grated coconut, ghee and banana prepared in earthen pots - to the presiding deity.

Many devotees were seen sporting masks, ominous reminders of the outbreak which has assumed global proportions.

At airports

The State government had stepped up COVID-19 surveillance at airports and issued detailed advisories to the public after five people in Pathanamthitta district tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday.

The number rose to six on Monday after a three-year-old in Ernakulam was added to the list.

As the ritual progressed on Monday, the police turned back several foreigners from the festival zone. In view of Sunday’s development, the Health Department had directed people with travel history to COVID-19-affected countries to stay away from the festivities. Hotels were asked to dissuade foreign tourists from visiting crowded areas.

Shortly after the ritual concluded, firefighters rushed to douse a fire which broke out at the Manacaud market.

The fire is believed to have spread to a trash dump from one of the Pongala hearths.

Devotees had been streaming into the State capital over the weekend to partake in the ritual which falls on the ninth day of the Attukal temple festival. Street-side cooking spots were booked days in advance using bricks, ropes and chalk markings.

Chief priest P. Easwaran Namboothiri lit the Pandara Aduppu, the main hearth, at 10.20 a.m. In a short while, the festival zone was engulfed in smoke rising from thousands of hearths across the city.

As part of the COVID-19 precautions and the general arrangements, the Health Department had made elaborate arrangements to tackle emergencies. Healthcare teams and ambulances were deployed across the festival zone.

The Police Department had assigned 3,000 personnel to handle security.

The Pongala ritual concluded with the sanctification of the Pandara Aduppu at 2.15 p.m. The ‘Chooralkuthu’ ritual was held later. It was followed by the ‘Purathezhunellippu’ of the deity. This year’s festivities will conclude in the small hours of Tuesday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iitpjd/article31027275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TVATTUKALPONGALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pongala-offered-amid-covid-19-fears/article31027269.ece

Elaborate arrangements have been made for SSLC examinations beginning across the State on Tuesday.

As many as 78,094 will appear for the examination from Malappuram, the largest number in a district in the State. It will include 376 private students in the old scheme of examination.

When Malappuram educational district alone will have 26,916 students taking the SSLC exam, Tirurangadi educational district will have 19,839 students.

Tirur and Wandoor educational districts will have 15,836 and 15,503 students respectively appearing for the exams.

Irrespective of being private or government or aided, all schools were giving extra classes for weak students. When some schools arranged special night camps with the support of the parent-teacher associations, others conducted holiday classes.

Teachers, particularly of some aided and private schools, were entrusted by the managements with the responsibility of getting the weakest students to clear the examinations.

164,2020/03/10,Green protocol helps bring down waste,"Within hours of pongala, sanitation workers of the city Corporation clean up roads

The considerable reduction in the amount of waste produced after the Attukal Pongala in the past three years has come as a relief for the city Corporation. From the 80 tonnes of waste produced in 2018, it had come down to 67 tonnes last year. This year, it has further come down to 54 tonnes. According to officials of the city Corporation, the fall could be attributed to the increased awareness due to the constant campaigns on the green protocol.

“The amount of waste produced this year would have stayed below 50. But, in some wards around the temple, it has been noticed since last year that several people dump other waste materials stored inside their houses using this cleaning as an opportunity. We have got old broken beds, chairs and other materials, which they could have given at the material recovery centres,” said a health official.

This was the 5th year of the green protocol being implemented at the Attukal Pongala. The amount of plastic waste is negligent. Health officials say that plastic carry bags are almost absent, while much of the plastic is from the plastic covers used for branded items, including rice and other materials. Reports have come from 10 places regarding violation of green protocol, especially drinking water distributed in plastic or paper cups. Notices will be served on the voluntary organisations responsible for this.

“The people have taken up our campaign against use of plastic materials for Pongala. It is evident in the less amount of plastic waste this year,” said Corporation Mayor K. Sreekumar.

Within hours of the pongala getting over, the Corporation’s sanitation workers cleaned up most of the main roads.

3,387 workers

As many as 3,387 sanitation workers were involved in the work, with 2,200 of them being appointed temporarily for pongala cleaning.

Their work was overseen by a team of health supervisors, health inspectors and junior health inspectors.

The health inspectors also video graphed the pongala proceedings in each circle, in view of the COVID-19 scare. These videos will be stored for a period of one month and will be handed over to the Health Department, if need be.

Bricks for houses

In addition, 300 volunteers from the Kerala State Youth Welfare Board and 250 green army volunteers of the city Corporation were involved in the collection of pongala bricks.

These bricks, now stored at the Jagathy ground, would be used for the construction of houses as part of the government’s housing schemes for the poor.

The cleaning activity concluded at night when the main stretch from Palayam to East Fort was washed down with ‘artificial rain’ from 20 tankers.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/m994xz/article31027124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TVATTUKALPONGALA4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/green-protocol-helps-bring-down-waste/article31027125.ece
165,2020/03/10,"White topping to be adopted for road construction, says Sudhakaran","Minister inaugurates renovation of three roads in Thalassery constituency

Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran on Monday said that the new technology of white topping would be adopted in road construction.

He was speaking after inaugurating the renovation of three roads in Thalassery constituency.

The Minister said the speciality of the new technology was that roads would last 30 years. Though this had been implemented in many places, including Bengaluru, this was the first time that Kerala was going to use the new technology.

Mr. Sudhakaran said that the government had rebuilt more than 3,000 roads, making more than 98% of PWD roads motorable.

The Pookkom Chokli road, Pookkom Madapedika road and Oriental School-Vailipedika road had been renovated, he said.

Giving details, he said that renovation of the Pookkom Chokkli road, which was 2.74-km-long and 5.5-metre-wide, had been granted administrative sanction of ₹3.5 crore.

The Pookkom Madapedika road, which was 3.675-km -long and 5.5-metre-wide, had been approved by the government for ₹4 crore, he said.

As part of the road renovation work, the construction of concrete bridges and concrete marking boards had been done.

All these roads passed through Panniyannur Chokli panchayats, the Minister said.

The road facilitated easy accessibility to the Kannur airport, to the hilly region of Thripankkot panchayat, to tourist destinations such as Vazhamala, Pallur, Mahe, Thalassery, Kottiyoor, Wayanad and Malabar Cancer Centre, and Kozhikode, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hu30zo/article31026832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-KI-SUDHAKARAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/white-topping-to-be-adopted-for-road-construction-says-sudhakaran/article31026833.ece
166,2020/03/10,The dying lake of Wayanad,"Construction and farming activities posing grave threats to Pookode Lake

Debates on conserving biodiversity-rich areas often fall on deaf ears. The Pookode Lake in Wayanad, an ecologically fragile district, is a glaring example. The second largest freshwater lake in the State is dying.

A large part of the 5.172 hectares of the lake has turned into green grassland because of soil erosion brought about by uncontrolled construction and farming activities taking place in areas around the lake. The lake is dying mainly due to anthropogenic activities, eutrophication (a process by which waterbodies receive excess nutrients that stimulate excessive plant growth), and accumulation of sediments owing to soil erosion.

According to a study, the maximum depth of the lake has declined to 6.5 metres from 12 metres nearly four decades ago. Construction activities by the Tribal Development Department atop the hill, hardly 500 metres away from the lake to provide houses to landless tribals, pose threat to the waterbody.

Four streams originating from the surrounding hills provide the lifeline of the waterbody. Any construction activity on the nearby hills will sound the death knell for the streams and finally, the lake.

Pookode Lake is an important eco-tourism destination in the district. According to a recent study by the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM), Kozhikode, every year the number of tourists visiting the lake is on the rise. The study also found that the environmental quality of the lake was deteriorating owing to various human activities.

The lake environment is extremely sensitive to environmental changes in its watershed. Worse, when phenomena like eutrophication and pollution occur, even though they may proceed slowly, the damage caused is correspondingly difficult, if not impossible, to reverse.

Though the lake is in the possession of the Fisheries Department, it has been developed as an eco-tourism centre on the direction of the district administration in the 1990s. It is the habitat of several endemic and critically endangered fish species, including Puntius pookodensis (Pookode Barb). The lake shore is also a major habitat of nearly 70 species of birds and nearly 60 species of Odonate.

Today, more than half the portion of the lake is covered with three species of water weeds. The long-term damage to aquatic native biodiversity they can cause is still unknown.

It is high time an urgent intervention was made to preserve the lake. Unfortunately, the district administration is yet to adopt measures to save the dying lake. Though a main stream of the Thalipuzha River, a tributary of the Kabani, originates from the lake, the natural flow of water has been closed by the Tourism authorities for boating purposes.

We should pay heed to experts on freshwater resources who warn that while what happens in the air, on land, and in the sea, affects lakes and rivers, we are all affected by what happens in lakes and rivers.

167,2020/03/10,Flying squad to locate and neutralize snares laid by poachers,"In almost all of the reported instances where carnivores have died or got trapped in snares, the incidents occurred in agricultural areas, forest official

Following a spurt in the number of poaching cases in the Nilgiris, the Forest department plans to set up a “flying squad” to locate snares and traps laid by poachers to hunt wildlife.

According to forest department officials, there had been three “notable” instances over the last two years in the Nilgiris forest division that had led to large carnivores getting ensnared in traps laid to capture small game such as black-naped hare and wild boar.

In 2019, two leopards were killed after getting ensnared in traps, while in 2020, a tiger was trapped for an entire day in a snare before it finally managed to break free. Till date, the forest staff have not been able to track down the animal to find out if it had suffered any injuries.

D. Guruswamy, District Forest Officer, Nilgiris division, concedes that there has been a noticeable increase in the number of poaching cases. “Last week, we imposed heavy fines on four people who were caught hunting a Sambar deer with dogs,” said Mr. Guruswamy, adding that it was difficult to find snares laid to trap wild animals as they are usually kept in agricultural areas or tea estates.

“In almost all of the reported instances where carnivores have died or got trapped in snares, the incidents occurred in agricultural areas where the owners of the land or workers laid the traps, and are outside forest limits,” said Mr. Guruswamy, adding that another difficulty the forest department was facing was the inability of forest staff to identify the snares.

“In order to bridge this gap, we plan to set up a flying squad which will begin random checks in areas where we receive information about poachers being active,” said Mr. Guruswamy, who added that the team will be given training on how to identify particular kind of snares and traps in any location.

“We also appeal to the public to share information with the Forest department about instances of poaching, and to NGOs to also hold sensitiaation programmes in villages discouraging the use of snares and traps, as large carnivores, such as leopards and tigers, as well as ungulates like Indian gaur get trapped and injured,” said Mr. Guruswamy.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ok3ed3/article31031242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SNARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/flying-squad-to-locate-and-neutralize-snares-laid-by-poachers/article31031243.ece
168,2020/03/10,MoEF to decide on action against TN officials for concealing information,"The expert appraisal committee of the MoEF has found fault with Tangedco and TNPCB officials

The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has asked the Ministry to take a call on taking action against officials for concealing information while uploading the draft Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the 1x660 MW Ennore Supercritical Thermal Power Project on the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board’s (TNPCB) website.

In a stinging rebuke to the project proponent, Tangedco, the State’s power utility, and the TNPCB, the EAC said the Environmental Clearance for the expansion project was granted on the assumption that the EIA report was uploaded on theTNPCB website for a period of one month and had received no comments from the public.

The EAC’s observations came on an application filed by the Tangedco seeking certain amendments to the EC granted for the project on December 11, 2019. One of the amendments sought was to change a paragaraph (6) where it was written that “draft EIA has been uploaded on Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) website for seeking comments / concerns from the public.”

The Tangedco sought an amendment seeking to change this to “draft EIA has been uploaded on MoEF&CC website which is accessible by public to view and offer their comments/concerns.”

The Tangedco had argued that there was no scope to upload the EIA report on the TNPCB website since public hearing for the project was exempted by the MoEF through a letter dated July 10, 2019.

Noting the sequence of events when the project proponent made its presentations to the Committee before the grant of the EC, it said that the TNPCB had informed the committee, based on Tangedco’s request, in a letter dated September 18, 2019, that it had not received any comments from the public after uploading the EIA report on its website.

However, when the Tangedco approached the EAC for amendments, the EAC found, on close scrutiny of the letter given by the TNPCB, the Tangedco had approached the pollution control board only one day before, on September 17, 2019 and “and the TNPCB provided a reply on September 18, 2019. Hence, the comments from the public cannot be obtained in two days,” the EAC noted.

It further found that Tangedco had not produced any letter that they had approached the TNPCB after obtaining ToR (Terms of Reference) or PH (public hearing) exemption letter. “But, Committee can make out that M/s Tangedco has concealed the information,” it said.

The EAC said only after obtaining the EC, the Tangedco said there was no scope to upload the draft EIA on the TNPCB website. While it has considered the amendment sought by the Tangedco, it has not been approved, the committee said. It also said the MoEF can take a call with regard to taking action against the officers responsible for concealing information.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ui9tou/article31030513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ENNORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/moef-to-decide-on-action-against-tn-officials-for-concealing-information/article31030514.ece
169,2020/03/10,"AIADMK nominates Vasan for RS seat, ignores DMDK","Thambi Durai, Munusamy in the fray

The ruling AIADMK on Monday named Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) leader G.K. Vasan as one of its three nominees for the March 26 Rajya Sabha biennial elections and ignored the demand for a berth by another ally, the DMDK. The other two seats were allotted to former Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker M. Thambi Durai and former Minister K.P. Munusamy. Unlike in July, when the party chose two lesser-known personalities for the Upper House, this time around it picked veterans. But its choice of Mr. Vasan generated ripples.

Sources in the AIADMK emphasised that the BJP “played an important role” in getting a seat for Mr. Vasan, a former Congressman and Union Minister [Mr. Vasan denied this. See interview]. While joining the AIADMK-BJP alliance last year, he had declared that the TMC (M) had come “far away” from the Congress. Unlike the PMK, which was allotted one Rajya Sabha seat last year by the ruling party as part of the Lok Sabha electoral pact, there was no formal agreement between the AIADMK and the TMC (M) for an Upper House berth.

Sources said that even though there were many “qualified candidates” within the AIADMK for the third seat, the party leadership “came under pressure from New Delhi”. This explains the selection of Mr. Vasan, whose party, like the PMK, does not have a single legislator in the Assembly. Two other allies of the ruling party — the DMDK and the New Justice Party — too made attempts to get the third seat.

On record, the AIADMK and the BJP disputed that the latter had anything to do with Mr. Vasan’s nomination.

A perusal of electoral performance of the PMK, the DMDK and the TMC (M) since 2016 reveals that the TMC (M) comes third. In the 2016 Assembly elections, the PMK, which fielded nominees all over the State, secured 5.41% of the votes polled while the DMDK and the TMC (M), which put up nominees in 104 and 26 constituencies, as part of a six-party-combine, got 2.39% and 0.53% of the votes, respectively.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and rural local bodies’ polls, all three parties were part of a front headed by the AIADMK. The PMK, which was given seven Lok Sabha seats, polled 5.49% votes; DMDK 2.22% in four seats and the TMC (M) 0.53% in 1 seat. In the rural local bodies’ elections held in December, the three parties remained in the AIADMK-led alliance. The PMK bagged 16 district panchayat (DP) wards and 220 panchayat union (PU) wards; DMDK 3 DP wards and 97 PU wards and the TMC (M) 2 and 13 wards, respectively.

Yet, justiyfing Mr. Vasan’s selection, the AIADMK’s organising secretary and Mettur legislator, S. Semmalai, said that the move has to be seen against the backdrop that he was an “experienced person and a former Union Minister.” Besides, he added, “we have given the seat only to one of our allies, following the formula adopted last time. This does not mean that we are neglecting others, whose case will be considered by the party leadership when an occasion arises.”

To a question on the reported pressure from the BJP, Mr. Semmalai, who represented the party in the Lok Sabha during 2009-2014, said, “Why should they (BJP) seek the ticket for Mr. Vasan, when they have many leaders in their party? And, there is no necessity for them to apply pressure on us on behalf of the TMC (M) or Mr. Vasan.” P. Muralidhar Rao, BJP general secretary looking after Tamil Nadu affairs, who met Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami last week, said he did not discuss the issue of allotting a seat to Mr. Vasan.

As for the party’s choice of veterans, both of whom hail from Krishnagiri district, instead of younger persons, the AIADMK’s organising secretary said that in July, the party had given opportunities to relatively less-known members of the party. “This time, we have allotted the seats to two very senior and competent leaders of our party. We believe they are the most suitable candidates,” Mr. Semmalai added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-nominates-vasan-for-rs-seat-ignores-dmdk/article31027242.ece
170,2020/03/10,"Defying of whip: Deputy CM, 10 MLAs told to reply by March 16","Faction led by OPS voted against CM in Feb. 2017

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and 10 other AIADMK MLAs have been asked to reply by March 16 to notices issued by Speaker P. Dhanapal on why action should not be initiated against them for defying the whip and voting against the Edappadi K. Palaniswami government during a motion of confidence in February 2017.

At that time, Mr. Panneerselvam and the 10 legislators had rebelled against the AIADMK faction headed by V.K. Sasikala. Subsequently, Ms. Sasikala was sidelined, paving the way for a merger of the factions led by Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami.

Sources said that after the Supreme Court disposed of a plea by the DMK, seeking action against the rebel MLAs under the anti-defection law , the Speaker granted time till March 16 for their replies.

The Speaker’s office has been following up on the notices issued to the legislators. The State’s Advocate General had informed the apex court last month that the Speaker had issued notices to the MLAs concerned.

Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde had declined to impose a deadline on the Speaker, observing: “Needless to mention, the Speaker had to take a decision in accordance with the law.”

DMK whip R. Sakkarapani had, in his plea, stated that the 11 AIADMK MLAs from the then Panneerselvam faction voted against the trust vote on February 18, 2017. The plea for their disqualification was made before the Speaker under Paragraph 2(1)(b) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8dv9fz/article27024305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dhanapaljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/defying-of-whip-deputy-cm-10-mlas-told-to-reply-by-march-16/article31027141.ece
171,2020/03/10,"Panel finds violations galore in AUT appointments, yet no action taken","‘Government wants faculty members to go, Syndicate says they must be allowed to continue’

In 2009, the Anna University of Technology (AUT) in Tiruchi called for applications for the post of Assistant Professor in Physics and Civil Engineering among other departments. Applicants were required to have qualification in Civil Engineering or in Physics and should have worked as lecturer for at least three years.

One of the applications it received was from a candidate who possessed a B.Sc second class degree in Geology, an M.Sc in Applied Geology and PhD in Environmental Science. His application was rejected. But strangely, he was called for an interview for the post of Assistant Professor in Physics Department, though he had not applied for it. He was eventually appointed as Assistant Professor in Geology, though there was no such post.

Going a step further, the Selection Committee recommended that he work in the Department of Civil Engineering, University of College of Engineering in Pattukottai. Such violations abound if one goes by the findings of a 2017 committee, headed by IAS officer R Anandakumar, which examined the appointments of 158 teaching and non-teaching staff in the erstwhile AUTs in Coimbatore, Tiruchi, Madurai, Tirunelveli and Chennai and their constituent colleges.

The panel found that not only were many of the appointments in gross violation of All India Council for Technical Education and university norms but were also an “unjustifiable Constitutional violation” of the communal roster system.

The committee examined each of these appointments on the basis of the prescribed AICTE guidelines, university norms and the actual qualification of candidates. After thorough scrutiny, it classified that the appointments of 54 faculty members was “irregular”; 21 teaching staff were appointed “in violation of the roster system”; 23 teachers were appointed “in excess of sanctioned strength”; and the appointment of 37 non-teaching staff were either “irregular” or “in excess.”

It upheld the appointment of only 23 teaching staff in the five AUTs, which were established during the erstwhile DMK regime and merged with the Anna University by the AIADMK government.

The committee “unanimously” recommended that “the government may initiate appropriate action to remove 135 invalid appointment candidates... Further, appropriate disciplinary action may be initiated against the selectors based on the University Disciplinary norms…”

It came to the conclusion based on 10 principles and well-settled legal standards including natural justice and equality of opportunity. Mismatch in advertisement and possessed qualification will be a valid reason for rejection and not following roster system “is a grievous liability, ab-initio void” nature of improper appointment, it said. Citing multiple relevant court judgments, it said, “Those who come by the back door should go through that door.”

Former Anna University Vice-Chancellor E. Balagurusamy said the government must dismiss the 135 persons and act against those who recruited them.

However, Anna University Vice-Chancellor M.K. Surappa said, “The Syndicate had twice said that the 135 employees must be allowed to continue. The government wants them to go. But courts have backed the Syndicate decision. What do I do? I don’t know.”

He added that if these staff are sacked, he would find it difficult to run the show. Arguing that core competency was not required in some appointments, Prof. Surappa said, “The administrators do not often understand the requirements of academics. In higher education, appointments are made not merely based on academic qualification. The candidates’ capability and administrative ability and other factors come into play.”

Higher Education Secretary Apoorva said she would be able to comment only after studying the committee’s recommendation.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/utzxsj/article31027118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUTMADURAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/panel-finds-violations-galore-in-aut-appointments-yet-no-action-taken/article31027120.ece

173,2020/03/10,‘BJP had no role in my Rajya Sabha nomination’,"It was AIADMK’s call, insists Tamil Maanila Congress leader

The AIADMK on Monday ignored the DMDK’s demand for a Rajya Sabha berth and, in a surprise move, nominated TMC president G.K. Vasan to the Upper House. In an interview, the TMC leader has denied that he had requested the BJP to ask the AIADMK to accommodate him. Excerpts:

The AIADMK’s decision to nominate you to the Rajya Sabha has come as a surprise. How did it come about?

In 2019, I was actually the last (referring to the TMC) to join the [AIADMK-BJP] alliance. I was offered only one seat in the Lok Sabha...Back then, I said it was the intention and not the number that was important.

So, I campaigned for the alliance the way the other leaders did. Time and again, whenever there was an opportunity, we approached the AIADMK and reiterated our request for a Rajya Sabha berth. We have been working well with the government and the alliance on various issues. I am happy that they have chosen us for the seat.

Since when had you been approaching the AIADMK for an RS berth?

We only requested…we did not demand it. We began requesting [an RS seat] around October-November 2019. We reminded them [about it] whenever we met them to discuss issues concerning farmers, fishermen, etc. It was our duty to do it in the interest of our party.

Some AIADMK leaders have privately said the BJP had pressured them to give you a seat…

All the numbers (MLAs, whose support is needed for the Rajya Sabha election) are from the AIADMK. None of the alliance partners, including the national party (the BJP), has even a single MLA for us to approach them. All three candidates are their (the AIADMK’s) choice, their wish.

So there was no pressure from the BJP?

I can only ask the AIADMK...how can I jump the gun (and ask the BJP)?

There is talk in political circles that you might join the BJP and be named its State unit president…

We (the TMC) are growing very well. It is in our interest to get our members elected to the Assembly. Then, there are various posts in the local bodies. We want to have a separate identity and grow as a party.

These claims about my joining the BJP are all the daydreams of people who do not want the TMC to grow.

What is your position on the CAA-NPR-NRC issue?

We are very clear that Indian Muslims will not face any issues or setbacks [as a result of their implementation]. If there are any concerns in this regard, we will be the first party to meet them (the Muslim community) and be their voice.

The DMDK is disappointed over not getting an RS berth. Will this affect the alliance?

I really don’t know about the other parties or their agreements with the AIADMK. As the leader of the TMC, I don’t have any understanding with the other parties.

What are your plans upon becoming an RS member?

I have served in the House and in government before. I know the procedures of the House.

I am interested in ensuring the State’s growth because I am in the ruling party’s alliance. I will do whatever I can to safeguard the interests of the State.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wosmaq/article31027089.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10GKVASAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bjp-had-no-role-in-my-rajya-sabha-nomination/article31027090.ece

The festival will be held from May 12 to 23 and the L’Atelier programme runs from May 14-21. Mr. Mukherji heads to the French Riviera with his upcoming project Marichjhapi.

Now in its 16th year, the programme brings together filmmakers with promising projects, along with their producers, and industry professionals, producers, distributors and potential partners, in Cannes. The idea is to provide access to the international co-productions circuit, and opportunities for international financing and investment for the speedy completion of films.

Mr. Mukherji is an advertisement and feature film director based in Mumbai. His filmography includes Bengali film Teenkahon (‘Three obsessions’) and the Hindi film The Violin Player. Both these films were self-produced under Little Lamb Films, a boutique production house he runs with poet and filmmaker Monalisa, who also happens to be his wife.

‘A new feeling’

Marichjhapi, written by Mr. Mukherji and Abhinandan Banerjee, is the first film that they found too big and ambitious to self-finance and have gone out and sought co-producers for. “It’s a new feeling. Till now, we haven’t been answerable to anyone,” said Mr. Mukherji. The Atlanta-based American production house, Splendid Films, is already on board and Mr. Mukherji hopes that L’Atelier will help start “European conversations” and for the project go a “little more international”.

Marichjhapi was one of the new projects introduced at the Busan International Film Festival’s Asian Project Market in October 2019. It was then that actor Adil Hussain also came on board. Set in the Marichjhapi in the Sunderbans in January 1979, it is based on real incidents of atrocities and violence heaped on refugees to the island. If all falls into place, Mr. Mukherji intends shooting in January-February 2021. According to him, the film can’t be shot any time before that. “Sunderbans in winters is very different from how it is in summers,” he explained.

Next generation

Cinefondation was created under the aegis of the Cannes Film Festival to inspire and support the next generation of international filmmakers. Its L’Atelier programme started in 2005 to stimulate creative filmmaking and to encourage the emergence of a new generation of filmmakers. So far, out of 233 projects, 171 have been released in theatres and 14 are currently in pre-production. This year, including Marichjhapi from India, there will be 15 projects representing 15 countries — China, Columbia, Egypt, Greece, India, North Macedonia, Malaysia, Netherlands, Philippines, Romania, United Kingdom, Serbia, Sweden, Turkey and Yemen.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/703lx3/article31032125.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BAUDDHAYANMUKHERJI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/indian-filmmaker-bauddhayan-mukherji-chosen-for-latelier-programme/article31032126.ece
175,2020/03/10,Watch | ‘Vaathi Coming’: Second single from Vijay’s ‘Master’ released ahead of audio launch,"The rest of the songs from Anirudh Ravichander’s album will be released during the event later this week on March 15

Vaathi Coming, the second single from Vijay’s Master has been released.

The song, which is a kuthu number, has been composed by Anirudh Ravichander and sung by the composer along with Gana Balachander, who has also written the lyrics. The duo also feature in the video of the song that has been released.

It was also announced recently that a grand audio launch for Master would take place on March 15.

However, unlike Vijay’s earlier films when huge stadiums were booked to house all his fans for the occasions, due to the coronavirus scare, the event has been organised at a hotel with limited seating for guests to avoid congregation of large crowds. The audio launch will have a live telecast on Sun Television channel from 6:30 pm onwards.

There is talk that a surprise performance will happen on stage to make up for fans missing the event.

Meanwhile, the first single from the album, Kutti Story has racked up 30 million views since the time of its release. The rest of the album will be released at the audio launch event.

Besides Vijay, Master also stars Vijay Sethupathi as the antagonist and others like Malavika Mohanan, Andrea Jeremiah, Shanthanu Bhagyaraj, Arjun Das, Gouri Kishan and Ramya Subramanian.

Produced by Xavier Britto and Lalit Kumar, Master is directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. The film is slated to release on April 9.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8fe5fg/article31031573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vaathi,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/watch-vaathi-coming-second-single-from-vijays-master-released-ahead-of-audio-launch/article31031574.ece
176,2020/03/10,Kamal Haasan is too busy to give me a call: Gnanavel Raja,"The Studio Green producer discusses Suriya-Hari film 'Aruvaa', his spat with Kamal Haasan over unsettled dues, and why the film distribution business is a betting game

Gnanavel Raja is a man who bets on his instincts. The 50:50 success-failure ratio attached to such a business model is something he is aware of. It is this strategy that brought him the highs of a Singam (2010) or Madras (2014) but also took him to the lows of a NOTA (2018) or Mr Local (2019).

“It is all part of the trade,” says Gnanavel Raja, adding, “We enjoy the good things, don’t we? So we have to be prepared to face the bad as well.”

Things may be starting to turn a corner as the man behind the Studio Green production firm now has his feet wet with two big projects: Suriya’s next film with Hari titled Aruvaa, and the Shakti Soundar Rajan fantasy-revenge-action film, Teddy, starring Arya, whose teaser releases today. There is also Vaibhav’s Katteri, which he is pushing for a March 27 release, and another project with Suriya to be helmed by Siva that is expected to begin production in September 2020, after Siva completes Rajinikanth’s Annaatthe.

Excerpts from a conversation:

Why reunite with Hari?

It is a very interesting project. This is Suriya and Hari’s sixth film together and my fourth film with Hari.

Director Hari | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

When the Singam series started, their combination went on a different trip. But along the way, the family, emotions and relationship elements went missing from it. With Aruvaa, Hari is back into that mould. From whatever I have heard (script), I can say that the film is a mix of Vel (2007) and Kadaikutty Singam (2018).

Is this the ‘Viswasam’ effect that has now got to Suriya as well?

Viswasam worked big because of the emotions in the subject. We believe the audience is open to films that portray relationship issues within a family, their camaraderie etc. In Aruvaa, the focus will be between brothers.

The ‘trend’ that everyone says Viswasam started... it is actually Hari’s format. When you see a Thaamirabharani (2007), Vel or Venghai (2011), these films had more drama, the focus was on relationships with family members like an aunt or a sister. Hari stepped out of that once Singam started... his films came to be all about ‘mass’. He is back on track with Aruvaa. It also won’t have the touch of earlier Hari-Suriya films.

You mean to say we can expect a Hari film that is not ‘loud’?

(smiles) Aruvaa won’t be loud. It will be more settled than his other films. Vel was not too ‘loud’ either.

Why choose the title Aruvaa?

It gives a rural feel, and an aruvaa (sickle) is used in all of Hari’s films (laughs). It may be the reason but the option was given by the director. Knowing the story, I think it is an apt title.

You speak of trade being a roller coaster ride. Hasn’t Suriya been on one too?

Suriya | Photo Credit: L Srinivasan

Every star goes through their good and bad patches. Suriya went through a bad patch but with Soorarai Pottru, which looks promising, he will come back 100 per cent.

As an established distributor, why do you think issues like the one that happened with Darbar crop up?

All technicians and artistes demand a price they feel they are qualified for and producers also pay that money because they think they stand to gain business out of their stardom. When a film fails... for example, think of it as buying a footwear for ₹20 and ₹5,000, and what happens when it is damaged in a day. If it is a cheap slipper, you will throw it away and buy a better one. What if it is an expensive shoe? Wouldn’t you go and demand compensation? That’s what happened with Darbar.

How does that make it okay to ask actors for compensation?

Legally speaking, it is not fair to ask the artistes or technicians for compensation when a big film fails. But if you look at it case-by-case, here the film’s producer had also incurred losses. So, for the actor and director to pay heed to [compensation] calls is purely a moral decision they need to make.

A workaround would be for the distributor to watch a film before choosing to invest in it so as to avoid losses, right?

A distributor has no option of seeing the film and buying. It is not given, especially for big films.

Why so?

It is not needed also. How qualified is the person watching it to decide the film’s worth and understand its potential? He can watch after he puts up the money (smiles). As a producer, say I have invested ₹40 crore in something, how can I open and show it to someone who has not even put a penny into it? I can’t do that.

Gnanavel Raja | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

So the film distribution business is essentially a ‘betting game’?

Yes. But it depends what or on who you are betting on. Are you betting on the director or the actor? No one bets on the producer. If tomorrow, Lyca funds a smaller film, would distributors line up to buy it off them? Even if they come, will they buy it for the price of Darbar? So, the point of distributors buying a film for the banner’s name is moot.

Darbar issue boils down to the pricing, then?

The history of a star’s previous films and the business it has done is what sets the demand. The demand from theatres matter. In the case of Darbar, it was the wrong equation. Had they sold the film based on Petta’s business, the losses would not have been this huge and distributors would not have come asking for a refund. The mistake is on both parties.

Could stars reducing salaries or taking back-end payments help minimise the disastrous effects of a failure?

Reduction of salaries won’t happen. There is always some producer who is willing to front the fee a star demands. Back-end payments... it has started in Mumbai. I’m sure in another five or six years, it will become commonplace in South. It is a profitable system because as producers, we are saving on the interest component, which, otherwise, a third person called the financier keeps taking away. Removing that alone will add to the profits of a film.

That’s what every producer says...

Finance rates is the problem with cinema. It has got nothing to do with any individual lender. If the industry starts operating on bank interest rates, almost all films will become profitable.

But banks don’t lend often to film producers... not often, at least.

Look, this is the best business to fund. What other options do they have? Real estate? That guy is at the mercy of market fluctuations. There is no time limit on those investments.

Gnanavel Raja | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

But cinema is not like that. The product has to be released in an eight month to one year period. The borrower will come forward to settle dues because a film is not like land, where the value keeps rising as the borrower and lender battle it out in courts. Only upon settlement can a film be released.

Banks can draw up mandatory conditions, seek collateral property and put teams on this to monitor loans. Banks should recognise our business as an industry.

You were on the TFPC board for a while. Why didn’t you take the issue up with banks?

My team didn’t let me do it. We had lots of nonsense in the team. That is why I quit. I promised I would leave if I couldn’t get things done and I did as promised. I am happy that the bad name is not on me.

Finally, you never did respond to Kamal Haasan’s denial of your accusation that his firm RKFI took ₹10 crore from you for Uttama Villain...

I have yet to respond. I didn’t want to respond then because I felt my time was not good. But I will take this up legally.

Look, the issue is simple. We invested ₹10 crore on the guarantee of the late Chandrahasan. We have the guarantee statement on his letterhead with us, and he has given us certain commitments.

Kamal Haasan | Photo Credit: PTI

Wasn’t Thirrupati Brothers and N Lingusamy the ones who purchased the film on first copy basis from Kamal Haasan?

Yes, and then Lingusamy entered into a continuation agreement with me. Chandrahasan sir knows this. He was there in the TFPC meeting and knows the investment came from my end and which is why he gave me the letter. Maybe, somebody is misguiding Kamal sir.

If Chandrahasan sir was alive, I’d have met him and clarified the situation.

Hasn’t Kamal spoken to you?

Oh, he is busy with politics, and you know how my number is very difficult to get through...

177,2020/03/10,"‘Game of Thrones’ star Jack Gleeson back to acting, after a six year break","The actor is best known for the role of King Joffrey in the globally popular fantasy series

Actor Jack Gleeson, best known for the role of the despicable King Joffrey in the globally popular fantasy series Game of Thrones, is all set to make his return to television after a six-year break.

Gleeson has been announced among the cast members for Out of Her Mind, a BBC comedy from comedian Sara Pascoe which has Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on board as executive producers, reports variety.com.

The news of Gleeson’s casting comes after he had previously hinted that he might give up acting as a career.

The series explores heartbreak, family issues and how to survive them both. The show will look to subvert the traditional sitcom format by combining eccentric characters, animation, and scientific explanation.

“Out Of Her Mind is a direct expression of my mind. We’ve turned my brain into a theme park, and everyone’s invited,” said Pascoe, adding: “The cast are incredible and I can’t wait for people to see what we’ve made.”

Gleeson’s screen credits include a cameo in Batman Begins. On TV front, his four-season run as Joffrey, which ended in spectacularly poisonous fashion, is his only credit.

Out of Her Mind also stars Juliet Stevenson, Fiona Button, Cariad Lloyd, Adrian Edmondson, Navin Chowdhry, Sean Gilder, Tom Stuart, Scroobius Pip, Jumayn Hunter, Sheila Reid, Cash Holland, Lorraine Ashbourne, and Cian Barry.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/arqvem/article31031210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/150727-hines-joffrey-teaseghqm1o,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/game-of-thrones-star-jack-gleeson-back-to-acting-after-a-six-year-break/article31031211.ece
178,2020/03/10,"Coronavirus: Theatres in Kerala to be shut down until March 16, film releases postponed","The release of Mohanlal’s ‘Marakkar Lion of the Arabian Sea’ has been postponed, and the fate of April releases ‘Master’ and ‘Soorarai Pottru’ hangs in the balance

After Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan requested earlier today that all movie theaters be shut down in the state till March 31, keeping in mind the larger public good, the producers and distributors in the industry have decided to honour his request by shutting down cinemas till March 16.

Due to the coronavirus scare and the latest development of six new cases of COVID-19 being reported in Kerala, the decision has been welcomed. The state has reported 12 positive cases now totally.

""Cinema halls will remain closed till March 16. We have learnt that a government-level review of the general situation will be held on March 16. A decision on whether to extend the period of the closure of theatres will be taken on the basis of the feedback given by the government,"" said M. Renjith, president of the Kerala Film Producers' Association.

Also Read Kerala clamps down on public gatherings as COVID-19 resurfaces

A joint meeting of the the trade bodies representing the exhibitors, producers, technicians and distributors was held after the government imposed major restrictions on public gatherings across the State following the spike in COVID-19 cases. Mr. Renjith said that the shooting of nearly 20 Malayalam films was progressing at various locations in the State.

""We have asked the producers of these movies to take a call on whether to suspend the work based on the health scenario prevailing at the various shooting locations,"" he said. The meeting decided that the movies that were enjoying a good run at the box-office till Tuesday will get a chance to continue screening once the cinemas open following the temporary shut down.

The big-budget release in Kerala this March was to be director Priyadarshan and Mohanlal’s Marakkar Lion of the Arabian Sea, which also stars a huge ensemble cast.

The film traces the life of the naval chief captain of the Zamorin of Calicut (present name Kozhikode) Kunjali Marakkar IV, who is essayed by Mohanlal, and is based on the 16th century warrior who mobilized the country’s first naval force to battle the Portuguese invasion.

Another film to have a delayed release will be Tovino Thomas-starrer Kilometers and Kilometers, a comedy movie, which is written and directed by Jeo Baby.

However, now the release of the historical epic will be postponed. Further, if the situation escalates, April releases like the Tamil films — Vijay’s Master and Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru — will also not release in Kerala.

Distributors also said that there has been a major dip in collections in the past two days, especially in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam, where COVID-19 cases were reported. They added that the respective directors of Malayalam films can take a call on whether shooting of ongoing films have to continue.

After reopening the theatres, the release priority will be for the March releases as per the initial discussion with producers, say the distributors in the industry.

179,2020/03/10,All about the action: Teasers of Arya’s ‘Teddy’ and Jayam Ravi’s ‘Bhoomi’ out,"A CGI bear accompanies the hero in a revenge action-drama, while the other social drama that takes up the plight of farmers and farmlands

Both Jayam Ravi and Arya are set to bring the action genre alive to theatres this summer judging by the teasers of their respective films that was uploaded to YouTube.

Directed by Lakshman, Bhoomi, which is Ravi’s 25th film, looks to be a film that takes up the plight of farmers and farmlands. The teaser begins with Ravi at a conference taking place in an international location where he says, “We have created a new home... Mars.” This scene followed by shots of farmlands going dry due to water scarcity seems to suggest that Ravi plays the role of a scientist who helps bring water back to aid farming. With Vande Maataram echoing in the background, we see Ravi with a spade in his hand, driving the tractor and ploughing the field and standing shoulder-to-shoulder alongside farmers as they express their gratitude to him for helping them out of a situation. We also get to see action sequences where the angry hero pummels the anti-socials. Bhoomi is set for a May release.

Meanwhile, Teddy has a dark undertone as it begins with a voice over by Magizh Thirumeni, who plays the antagonist, before we see a bearded Arya in a montage shot fighting a handful of people ranging from a hospital attendant to a security guard. The teaser then reveals the fantasy element of this film directed by Shakti Soundar Rajan of Tik Tik Tik fame, when a CGI teddy bear shows up on screen. Arya thinks he is hallucinating but very soon realises that the teddy bear is for real. Says Gnanavel Raja, the film’s producer, “Teddy is actually a revenge action-drama film.”

Malayalam actor Jayasurya’s magnum opus big-budget 3-D film Kathanar The Wild Sorcerer has now been taken over by Gokulam Films as producers.

The project was earlier attached to Friday Film House.

Kathanar is expected to be one of the most lavish Malayalam films ever made, on a budget of over Rs 75 crores, and will be shot in two parts, using the technique of virtual production.

The film is being directed by Rojin Thomas (The Monkey Pen and Jo and the Boy), and the team includes composer Rahul Subrahmaniam, cinematographer Neil D’Cunha, and writer R Ramanand.

Thanking Gokulam Gopalan of Gokulam Films for taking over the film, actor Jayasurya posted on social media, “Kathanar, I believe, will be a stunning 3D experience and the biggest movie of my career. Having one of the biggest production houses in our industry bankrolling it is truly exciting and humbling. Thank you, Gokulam Gopalan, for believing in us and taking up this project.”

An animated teaser of Kathanar was released earlier last month, which indicated the scale of the project. A fantasy thriller, the movie is based on the life of legendary Kerala priest who lived in Kadamottom in the eighth century, and possessed supernatural powers.

Jayasurya is also currently shooting for romantic drama Sufiyum Sujathayum, which has Aditi Rao Hydari playing the female lead.

The 24-year-old index (first) COVID-19 case from Telangana would be discharged in four days if he tests negative in the second consecutive test. The youngster who was admitted to Gandhi Hospital with viral pneumonia on March 1, tested negative for coronavirus infection for the first time on Sunday.

As per guidelines, a patient who tested positive can be discharged only if s/he tests negative twice consecutively. Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the samples collected from him were put to second test on Tuesday. “The results would be known on Wednesday,” Mr Rajender said. If all goes well, he would be discharged next Sunday. It was learnt that the patient is recovering from viral pneumonia.

However, officials said that they are on alert as cases are being reported in neighbouring States. Screening of patients, isolating suspects and collecting samples for tests will continue. On Tuesday, 26 people were admitted in isolation wards and samples were collected for tests. Five of them tested negative. Till date, a total of 264 samples tested negative.

184,2020/03/10,Funds crunch hits implementation of micro-irrigation,"Less than 2% of targeted extent covered till February-end in 2019-20

The State government claims to give continuous thrust on micro-irrigation to make the optimum utilisation of available water and increase crop productivity aside, the prevailing economic slowdown appears to have affected the implementation of the project to provide drip and sprinkler implements to farmers a huge subsidy ranging from 75% to 100%.

Against the action plan of the Horticulture Department that implements the micro-irrigation project to cover at least 2,71,562 acres (1,08,625 hectares) under drip and sprinkler systems during 2019-20, the achievement till February-end is hardly 1.78% or 4,833 acres. With only a fortnight’s time left for the completion of the financial year, reaching even a quarter of the target appears difficult.

“Achieving the target or even going near it even in terms of administrative sanction is difficult now given the impact of economic slowdown on the State and Central governments’ revenues and the release of funds for the purpose,” a senior official of the department said unwilling to be quoted. For providing the drip and sprinkler implements to the targeted extent of land, an amount of ₹669 crore is required, including ₹270 crore contribution of the Centre and about ₹400 crore share of the State.

Under the ambitious project initiated by the State government with the support from the Centre, drip and sprinkler implements are provided at 100% subsidy to SC and ST farmers, at 90% subsidy to BC and other small and marginal farmers and at 80% subsidy to farmers of other communities. For portable sprinklers, the subsidy given is 75% for 2.5 acres per farmer.

Sources said that the micro-irrigation project has failed to make headway this year (2019-20) only due to paucity of funds. The amount spent on the project till February-end was only ₹16 crore covering 1,745 farmers. The extent of land covered under micro-irrigation so far this year is only 0.73% of the land covered till formation of Telangana or only 4,833 acres out of 6,60,243 acres covered so far.

Officials further stated that 11,97,500 acres of land was covered under micro-irrigation project by supplying drip and sprinkler implements with varying year-wise subsidy before formation of Telangana — from 2003-04 to 2013-14 benefiting 5.02 lakh farmers.

185,2020/03/10,"Government hoodwinking people over budget, charges Laxman","Major component of receipts is debt, says BJP State president

Telangana budget for the forthcoming financial year of 2020-21 has no connection with either the proclamations made by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao or the Telangana Rastra Samithi’s manifesto as it is full of false narratives and only meant to hoodwink different sections of society like farmers, unemployed, government staff, workers, BCs, SC/STs and others, charged BJP president K. Laxman.

He told a press conference that the budget presented by Finance Minister T. Harish Rao was nothing but a jugglery of figures without indicating how the gap in proposed expenditure plans of up to ₹33,191 crore will actually be carried out. When the government claims income to be ₹2,28,216 crore, why does it shy away from stating that ₹91,000 crore is debt, he questioned.

Mr. Laxman pointed out that the debt had reached ₹2.39 lakh crore from ₹70,000 crore in 2014 and this showcased the TRS rule in the last five years. He demanded that the Chief Minister explain about the free reimbursement scheme glitches, delays in two-bedroom housing, no headway in free education from KG to PG, no word on employees pay revision commission or their retirement age enhancement, about reduced allocation to health, education as well as for BCs and SC/STs.

Allocation of little over ₹10,000 for Education Department only covers expenditure on salaries and the government is yet to notify teachers recruitment, he said and sought details on how many households — rural or urban — have been getting potable water after Mission Bhagiratha was taken up.

The BJP leader sought clarity on whether the government thinks there is a recession and if so, why has it projected high growth rates and more income next year. “Six months ago the government cut the budget by ₹40,000 crore due to economic recession and it is now showing high figures claiming to have overcome it after making a big fuss over the Centre not allocating ₹3,000 crore,” he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tza73t/article31033471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10Laxman,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/government-hoodwinking-people-over-budget-charges-laxman/article31033472.ece
186,2020/03/10,HC to hear PIL plea on Inter exams ‘one minute late rule’,"Petitioner demands action against officials who stop students

The ‘one minute late rule’ (not allowing intermediate students into examination hall during the ongoing annual exams if they are late by even a minute) of Intermediate Board reached Telangana High Court on Tuesday, with an advocate challenging it by filing a PIL petition.

The Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy will hear on Wednesday the petition seeking a direction to government to permit students turning up late at exam hall. Lawyer Rapolu Bhaskar, who filed the plea, requested that students entering exam hall late should be given three hours time to write the exam.

He contended that government should take steps to spread awareness among students’ and parents’ community about punctuality in reaching examination hall along with analysing as to how the issue of ‘coming late to the hall’ can be controlled. The petitioner requested the HC to instruct the government to initiate action against officials not permitting late-comers to the examination hall.

He sought a report from the government on the students who were not allowed to appear for exam due to delay in reaching the hall on time and the action taken against officers responsible for such instances. When the Bench assembled in the morning, Mr. Bhaskar made a mention of the PIL petition stating that students, who get delayed to exam hall because of traffic and other factors, were being put to great difficulty because of ‘one minute late rule’.

The Bench led by the CJ agreed to hear the matter and posted it to Wednesday. Several factors like family issues, traffic, unfamiliarity with location of the exam centres, mistakes in hall-ticket numbers, longer distances between students’ homes and exam centres were contributing to the delay of students to exam hall, the lawyer said in his plea. In some cases, ill-health could also be an issue impacting the student’s journey from home to the exam hall, he stated.

The circular issued by Board of Intermediate Education that students reaching exam hall by a minute should not be allowed inside was illegal and arbitrary, he contended. Turning away students from exam hall for the delay of one minute would drastically affect their future. The physical and mental stress might even drive them to end their lives, the petitioner said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/p344cy/article31033386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11ONEMINUTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-to-hear-pil-plea-on-inter-exams-one-minute-late-rule/article31033244.ece
187,2020/03/10,TS-Genco gears up to shut down old units of KTPS,"Starts exercise to redeploy workforce of these units in other stations in State

With the stipulated date for permanent shutdown of the eight old units of the Palvancha-based Kothagudem Thermal Power Station (KTPS) (O&M) complex with a total capacity of 720 MW fast approaching, the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation Ltd (TS-Genco) has embarked on an exercise to redeploy the workforce of these units to other thermal and hydel power stations in the State.

The major redeployment exercise was necessitated following the decision of the TS-Genco to permanently phase out all the eight units of the KTPS (O&M) complex by March 31 this year.

The units that outlived their utility and lined up for permanent closure include four units of 60 MW capacity each and four units of 120 MW capacity each of the KTPS (O&M).

All of them are more than four-decades-old and had outlived their shelf life several months ago. Three of these eight units have already stopped power generation, sources said.

The phasing out of these old units with high emission levels has become imperative to comply with the norms of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) and fulfill a condition reportedly stipulated by the Central government agency to phase out these old units while giving clearance to the KTPS’s 800 MW super critical unit in 2015.

The KTPS’s 800 MW super critical unit-12 of stage VII was declared commercially operational in December 2018.

However, power generation in the unit came to a halt at the fag end of last year due to some technical glitches in its turbine. Efforts are on to carry out repairs on a war footing and resume power generation in the unit well ahead of the phasing out of the eight old units, sources added.

Around 547 engineers of various cadres of the KTPS (O&M) have been redeployed to various power stations including the KTPS’s Stage VII, Kakatiya Thermal Power Station at Bhupalapalli, Jurala hydel power station and the Bhadradri thermal power station, which is under construction at Manuguru, sources said.

The process of redeployment of the remaining workforce including foremen and plant attendants of the KTPS (O&M) complex has been hastened up to complete the whole exercise in the next fortnight.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/j0p6tf/article31033202.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11KTPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-genco-gears-up-to-shut-down-old-units-of-ktps/article31033203.ece

189,2020/03/10,Panel formed to work out modalities for sale of Rajiv Swagruha properties,"Government proposes to dispose off the non-performing assets in an open auction

The Telangana government has decided to dispose off all the assets of Telangana Rajiv Swagruha Corporation and constituted a High Power Committee of Secretaries to work out the modalities for disposal.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao during the presentation of the Budget for 2020-21 announced that the government has decided to sell the non-performing assets held by institutions like Housing Board and Rajiv Swagruha.

In line with the announcement made in the Assembly, the government issued a GO here on Tuesday setting in motion the process for selling the non-performing assets held by these institutions in an open, transparent way to raise revenues.

The High Power Committee will be headed by Special Chief Secretary, Housing Department, Chitra Ramachandran and will have Principal Secretary, Finance, K. Ramakrishna Rao and Principal Secretary, Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department, Arvind Kumar as members.

The government in its order said it has decided to dispose off all the assets of Telangana Rajiv Swagruha Corporation, including the properties at Bandlaguda and Pocharam, by conducting an open auction in a fair and transparent manner. The auction should be conducted in an ‘as is where is’ basis, duly fixing the upset price by taking the recommendations of a reputed consulting firm well acquainted with the real estate market.

The government also directed the Managing Director, Telangana Rajiv Swagruha Corporation Ltd., Hyderabad to take necessary further action.

It may be recalled that the new Housing Programme Rajiv Swagruha was launched in 2007 in the combined State in all municipalities and Municipal Corporations. The Corporation had ambitiously planned for 32 projects, consisting of about 46,565 units to construct about 4 crore sft at an estimated cost of about ₹ 8,504 crore.

As many as 20 housing projects with a project cost of ₹ 6,301 crore were grounded in between 2008 and 2011 by mobilising bank loans. In the year 2011, Rajiv Swagruha faced severe financial crisis and all operations came to a stand-still. A bail-out package was recommended by Group of Ministers and a High Power Committee headed by the then Chief Secretary. A decision was taken to stop the works in ‘as is where is condition’ and agreements with the contractors were foreclosed. By that time an amount of ₹1,621.26 crore had been spent on projects which were all shut down. All projects are hence incomplete and unfit for occupation in its current stage.

After formation of Telangana, the Rajiv Swagruha Corporation cleared bank loans along with interest by paying ₹1,071.39 crore with the support of State government and released all projects from mortgage. In 2016, it had decided to allot the finished and semi-finished flats at Bandlaguda and Pocharam projects to government employees with certain guidelines and even issued a GO. But the latest GO issued on Tuesday superseded the GO issued in 2016 and paved the way for disposing off all the assets of Rajv Swagruha Corporation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/s6wsre/article31032775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11RAJIVSWAGRUHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/panel-formed-to-work-out-modalities-for-sale-of-rajiv-swagruha-properties/article31032776.ece

191,2020/03/10,Transcending faith and religion to feed the hungry,"A casual gesture of giving food to an old woman got him a blessing; touched, the local realtor decided to feed patients and their attendants at the local cancer hospital, which has now become an organisation

Hunger knows no religion, gender, or colour. It is neutral. In these times of polarisation along communal lines, some people have gone beyond and have united for the cause of humanity. One such is a man who is serving people - especially cancer patients and their attendants - by feeding them every Sunday in Karimnagar town.

It all started a year-and-a-half ago when S.G.M. Hussain, alias Haqani, a realtor, was going past a cancer hospital on the Housing Board Colony Road on the outskirts of Karimnagar town when an old woman stopped him and asked where she could find some food. Hussain replied that there was no hotel nearby, and offered to get food for her.

Turning point touch

At the hotel, the owner - knowing Haqani - asked why he was taking a parcel. When the latter told the hotel owner about an old woman waiting for food at the hospital, the owner refused to take money. When Haqani returned and handed over the food packet to the old woman, she offered money, which, Haqani says, he declined. “Then the old woman blessed me by putting her hand on my head, which had really touched my heart and soul,” he recalls.

That set about Haqani thinking about the old woman and the people starving at the hospital. “Later, I decided to serve food to the patients and their attendants at the hospital at least once a week. It was on January 5, 2019, that I first began serving food to 25 people at the cancer hospital by starting a voluntary organisation called Humanity, Insaniyat and Manavatvam (HIM). Now, with the support of friends and others, we are feeding 80 persons every Sunday without any interruption,” says Haqani.

Helping hands all

After seeing his service, his friends and well-wishers, including Hindus and Muslims too joined HIM, and are contributing in feeding the hungry at the cancer hospital. Some pitch in bags of rice, while some others give vegetables, pulses, oil, water packets, plates, etc. What stands out is that not all HIM’s donors are rich, but many are middle-class people.

Vanaja, a widow, who runs a flour mill in the town is one such. She contributes to the ambitious feed the hungry programme by donating one rice bag per month, and also other essentials whenever required. Taking time off, she also participates in food distribution to the patients on all Sundays. Inspired, her friends and others are also donating to feed the hungry programme.

“With the blessings of almighty, I have plans to serve food every day to the patients at the hospital. There is no religion for our charity service. We all want to feed the hungry, and that is our sole motto,” says the altruist proudly.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/td7zr3/article31032643.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11FEEDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/transcending-religion-to-feed-the-hungry/article31031613.ece
192,2020/03/10,Emotions run high at Maruthi Rao’s funeral,"T. Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the ‘honour killing’ of Dalit youth P. Pranay Kumar in September 2018, was found dead at Arya Vysya Bhavan in Hyderabad.

Emotions ran high at the funeral of Maruthi Rao when the police escorted his estranged daughter Amrutha Varshini to the pyre for a final glimpse on Monday.

The situation was peaceful till the procession reached Shabunagar Hindu cemetery from Reddy Colony. However, it soon became tense as the police cordoned off the north entry and got its “rope party” ready. Ms. Amrutha was driven in the police department’s SUV till the cremation platform, where the pyre was ready, and just distance away were slogan-shouting people with clenched fists.

“Amrutha go back” slogans rent the air for all of the 30 seconds she was out of the vehicle, and her final glimpse of Maruthi Rao was denied amid the tension. Police soon whisked her away as the situation appeared to go out of hand, and only later, johar Maruthi Rao, Maruthi Rao amar rahe, slogans calmed the tempers.

The final journey of the town’s business icon started at Reddy Colony on a flower-bedecked tractor-trolley, with his wife Girija and sisters seated by his side. Most shops remained closed for Holi festival, and the two-kilometre final procession, led by Maruthi Rao’s brother Shravan Kumar, who carried the cremation urn passed smoothly through Rajiv Chowk, the bylanes, and reached Shabunagar.

Miryalaguda MLA N. Bhaskar Rao consoled the Tirunagaru family and was also helpful to Amrutha on her visit to the crematorium.

T. Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the ‘honour killing’ of Dalit youth P. Pranay Kumar in September 2018, whom his only daughter Amrutha Varshini married, was found dead at Arya Vysya Bhavan in Hyderabad on Sunday.

Amrutha Varshini described the sudden death of her father as sad, and said she wasn’t against her family, but for the murder of her husband Perumalla Pranay Kumar.

“I was demanding justice for Pranay. I would have been happy if Maruthi Rao was awarded death penalty, life or any punishment, whichever as proved and awarded by the court. But suicide is sad,” she said, responding to reporter’s questions.

Speaking outside her in-laws’ house at Muthireddykunta, hours after her father was cremated, she stressed that she would reunite with her mother as per her father’s last wish, but would not break off ties with the in-laws..",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ngjmsd/article31029371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10AMRUTHA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/emotions-run-high-at-maruthi-raos-funeral/article31029372.ece
193,2020/03/10,Drenching less fortunate children in hues of happiness,"NGO organises special celebrations at orphanage for 10th year

A festive atmosphere pervaded Oasis Orphanage in Hanamkonda here as children drenched themselves in a myriad colours during a herbal Holi celebration on Monday.

Organised by local NGO Sulakshya Seva Samithi as part of their objective of ‘spreading love and affection’, the party saw children letting down their hair and dancing to peppy songs. They particularly seemed to enjoy smearing each other with the smoke colour.

“We usually celebrate the festival with family members, colleagues and colony residents, but we thoroughly enjoy playing colours with the kids. We have been celebrating Holi with them for the past decade and it gives us immense satisfaction spending the day here. The kids have their breakfast a little earlier than usual and wait for us by the gate. The smile they flash on seeing our bagfuls of colours is priceless,” said Santhosh Manduva, founder president of Sulakshya Seva Samithi.

“I have celebrated Holi with hundreds of my friends in college, but being in the midst of children on the occasion gives me true happiness. Distributing colours to the kids is a tought but fun task as they corner us,” said Shashank Bharadwaj, an engineering student and a volunteer of the NGO.

Vishnu, an inmate of the orphanage, said, “Every year, we eagerly wait for the brothers, who we know will definitely come and celebrate Holi with us. We all have a great time together.”

Volunteers Kodam Vinay and Waseem Ryan and orphanage in-charge Oddiraj Chandraprakash took part in the celebrations.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/82w5l0/article31027043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09-HOLI-WARAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/drenching-less-fortunate-children-in-hues-of-happiness/article31027032.ece
194,2020/03/10,COVID-19 scare puts a damper on Holi festivities in State,"Most people stay indoors; others play colours within the family or in very small, intimate groups

Joy permeated the streets in many parts of the district on Monday as people celebrated Holi with great zeal.

Many villages, including several tribal hamlets, witnessed a flurry of activity as revellers had a gala time sprinkling water mixed with gulal on each other. A host of traditional cultural programmes including Kolatam marked the celebration of Holi at Pedda Thanda in Khammam rural mandal, Lokya Thanda in Kusumanchi mandal and elsewhere in the district.

However, Holi celebrations turned out to be rather low-key affair in some business localities in Khammam and various other towns in the old undivided Khammam district as a sizeable number of people preferred to remain indoors as a safety precaution due to “caronavirus scare”. This despite the fact that no case of COVID-19 has been reported from anywhere in the erstwhile composite Khammam district so far.

In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, Vasantotsavam was held in the historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam on the occasion of Holi. The preparation of Mutyala Talambralu for the ensuing Sri Sitarama Tirukalyana Mahotsavam traditionally began too, coinciding with the festival of colours.

Low-key celebrations

In most other places in the State, the fear of COVID-19 robbed Holi of its colour. In Siddipet, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao participated in the celebrations and Municipal Chairperson B. Vijaya Lakshmi in Sangareddy.

In integrated Karimnagar district too, Holi was a low-key affair. There were no street shows or people coming on to the roads to play with colours. The handful of revellers, who did celebrate the festival, used only natural colours or by hurling eggs at each other.

There was no celebrations at the police headquarters either. Local politicians also restricted the festivities in their respective municipal divisions over COVID-19 fears.

Revenue authorities, however, enjoyed the festival at the Collector camp office wherein Collector K. Shashanka, his wife and Jagtial SP Sindhu Sharma participated in the celebrations along with district officials. Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy and Mayor Y. Sunil Rao joined the revelry.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tlarig/article31026893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09-KHM-HOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-scare-puts-a-damper-on-holi-festivities-in-state/article31026859.ece
195,2020/03/10,How does an organisation build a culture of trust?,"Here are examples of what a culture of trust can do for employee morale and organisational development

“How does an organisation build a culture of trust?”

The answer has two strands to it.

Firstly, structurally the organisation should have the capacity to accommodate a culture of trust. And then, in the dynamic environment of everyday interactions, it should promote small but significant efforts that add to this culture.

Simple gestures

In human interactions, we notice trust is built by solicitous acts carried out on a sustained basis. It doesn’t have to be any different in the organisational context. Trust can get rock-solid during a crisis, if a sense of caring shines through the dark hour.

It takes just simple, meaningful and timely gestures to achieve this.

“In our intranet system, we have a small box that asks every employee — ‘How are you feeling today?’ There are three faces, green with the regular smiley; red with an inverted mouth-line, signifying a frown; and yellow with a mouth set in a flat line. When someone presses the red one, there is a trigger in my mailbox. It will also go to the people practice team. One of us will respond immediately to this person who doesn’t seem to be having a good day at work. If I don’t see any response going out from the people practice team, I will respond myself. It sends out a message to employees that as an organisation we are responding to any need they may have,” Sharon S. Rajkumar, general manager and happiness evangelist, Happiest Minds Technologies.

Timely help

Now, with COVID-19 raising concerns, there are some organisations that are proactive in ensuring their employees’ safety. These companies have already started encouraging their employees to work from home as a precautionary measure.

Cactus is now planning a drill to see if its workforce across the country can work from home. As a big scientific communication company, this may cause certain impediments to its regular course of functioning, but it seems prepared to make the effort necessary to ford any challenges that may arise.

“In marketing, for instance, 20% of our employees already work from home. In certain other functions, remote-working can affect operational efficiency and so our HR teams have asked all teams to gear up for a test run to see if all employees can shift to a remote-working arrangement if the situation warrants it. The idea is to check how ready each team is for such a working arrangement, and understand the pain points that may arise as a result of this change so that they can be addressed,” says Dina Mukherjee, director marketing, Cactus.

When it is pointed out to her that this measure may essentially be about maintaining operations even in the event of a huge outbreak, Dina says that Cactus’ remote-working systems have already been fine-tuned through an approach that embraces transparency and trust.

“I had worked with co-located teams before joining this organisation, where I now have 16 people reporting to me and this includes colleagues from global teams where the contact is over mail or Skype. It was a challenge. I speak once a week with each team member; and once a month, we meet as a team. I set out my expectations and then I had to trust them to meet those expectations. My team built that trust for me.”

A point of vulnerability

Building a culture of trust through caring may mean that organisations are willing to start from a point of vulnerability.

“In our organisation, we have something called the happiness framework, which consists of 7 Cs, and credibility is one of them. When there is no conflict between the ‘say’ and the ‘do’, there is credibility. Organisations have to constantly check if their ‘say-do’ ratio is right,” says Sharon.

Make it natural

Organisations have to build trust in a manner that does not make the exercise obvious. It should be as natural as breathing, and can’t be obtrusive.

“We have many informal ways to build trust, which is important; otherwise it will look like an organisational agenda,” says Ritu Agast, head of HR, Pearson.

According to Ritu, weaving trust into the fabric of an organisation would mean looking at mundane aspects that constitute its regular day.

“In our organisation, there is a conscious effort to encourage discussions in the open, so that all members of a team feel included and valued. The meeting rooms are mainly used only when a conversation has to be kept private; or when a team needs the quiet space to brainstorm for ideas,” says Ritu.

She adds that announcements involving larger organisational policy matters, should be delivered to small groups by vertical heads so that there is scope for answering the many questions they may have.

Document wisely

“Documenting a discussion can create distrust. Unless there are action points to be derived from a conversation, do not document it,” says Ritu.

An organisation is well on the way to building trust when it has a robust and dynamic feedback mechanism for its employees to suggest improvements to existing systems. Such features signify an openness on the part of the management.

Smita Saha, vice president – HR & Regional HR Lead, AstraZeneca says that ‘Pulse’, a bi-annual feedback process followed by the pharmaceutical company has given all employees a sense of participation in the development of the organisation.

“The feedback is followed by a focus-group discussion that seeks to identify and understand the issues and then take action to resolve them,” says Smita.

Sharon says there is a Trust Triad that builds trust among the various stakeholders within an organisation. She explains:

“It involves taking care of three Es — Experience: the employer being focussed on ensuring positive employee experience, and the employee doing the same for the employer; Empathy, on the part of both employer and employee; and Empowerment of the employee.”",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/ir2u4w/article31033841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11OPTrustjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/how-does-an-organisation-build-a-culture-of-trust/article31033842.ece

198,2020/03/10,24 arrested for Meghalaya lynching,"The incident, triggered by rumours about childlifters spread through social media,

The police in East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya on Tuesday arrested 24 persons in connection with the lynching of a man on Sunday night.

The incident, triggered by rumours about childlifters spread through social media, was similar to the killing of Goa-based sound engineer Nilotpal Das and his friend Abhijeet Nath in Assam’s Karbi Anglong district in May 2018.

Read: Lynch mobs across India spurred by rumours

Witchcraft was initially believed to have made the villagers of Syntung attack a group of nine men from Shillong, who had gone there for a picnic.

One of the picnickers, identified as Macmillan Kharshandy, died and two others sustained serious head injuries.

“We picked up these people around 4 a.m. They said they presumed the nine men to be kidnappers as they were moving back and forth from one village to another at night. They had apparently been forewarned about the movement of suspicious people via social media,” District Superintendent of Police Claudia A. Lyngwa told The Hindu from Shillong.

The victims said they got late at the picnic spot and lost their way back at night, driving without a clue. Some villagers stopped and surrounded their vehicle and assaulted them.

“A majority of those who participated in the lynching have been sent to judicial custody, while six were sent to police custody,” Ms. Lyngwa said.

R. Pale, headman of Syntung village, said the elders had tried to control the mob in vain. “Some of the village elders went to the house of the victim in Shillong to pay their respects and apologise for the attack,” he said.

The Drug Controller General of India has approved “restricted use” of the combination of medications lopinavir and ritonavir which are second-line HIV drugs, for treatment after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) sought an emergency approval.

SMS Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr. D.S. Meena said the Italian couple had developed severe respiratory problems following which a decision was taken to put them on the drugs.

According to officials, the consent of the patients was taken before the drugs were administered.

“The Italian man, who himself is a doctor, is on oxygen support. Even before he acquired the infection, he had some respiratory issues. His condition had deteriorated and he developed severe respiratory problems after getting the infection and thus was given these drugs. His condition is stable now. His wife is also doing better and she is taking care of her husband,” Dr. Meena said.

The drug combination along with other drugs has been used in clinical trials in China, where the virus had first emerged, and Thailand.

The couple were among the 16 Italian tourists who along with their Indian guide had tested positive for COVID-19. Except the couple, the other tourists are admitted at the Medanta hospital while the Indian guide is being treated at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi.

According to Health Ministry officials, the number of confirmed cases in the country stood at 44. However, the ICMR has also counted three persons from Karnataka and two from Pune as positive, which once taken into account takes the total to 49.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/anti-hiv-drugs-given-to-covid-19-affected-italian-couple-in-jaipur/article31033762.ece

Hitting out at Mr. Scindia after he sent in his resignation letter to party president Sonia Gandhi, Mr. Gehlot said joining hands with the BJP at the time of national crisis spoke volumes of his “self-indulgent political ambitions”.

Making his remarks on Twitter, Mr. Gehlot said Mr. Scindia had opted to go with the BJP when the ruling party at the Centre was ruining the economy, democratic institutions, social fabric and judiciary. The Chief Minister had left for Delhi on Monday night to join the efforts of the party to save its government in Madhya Pradesh.

Earlier, Deputy CM Sachin Pilot had expressed hope that the crisis would end soon and the leaders would resolve their differences. Mr. Pilot, also the PCC president, said the State needed a stable government for fulfilling the promises made to the electorate.

The Jharkhand police is probing a video doing the rounds on social media where the editor of a Hindi news channel is seen exhorting people to “economically boycott rioters”, official sources said on Tuesday.

Taking to Twitter, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said the government has taken cognisance of the event, and asserted that any attempt to disrupt communal harmony will not be tolerated.

A CMO official said Mr. Soren asked police to initiate a probe after the video went viral on Twitter.

Suresh Chavhanke, the editor of Sudarshan News, had shared the video of an event on the microblogging site where he is heard asking the saffron-clad attendees to take an oath to boycott “rioters” by refusing them jobs and not buying things from them.

Suresh Chavhanke, in his tweet, also said that the mayor, former Ministers, businessmen and industrialists undertook the pledge at a city hotel. He requested netizens to take a similar oath and share the video.

Several Congress leaders slammed Jyotiraditya Scindia on Tuesday for quitting the party, accusing him of betraying the trust of the people and placing “personal ambition” over ideology.

Hitting out at Mr. Scindia, many Congress leaders referred to the 1857 revolt against the East India Company and the role of the Scindia royals back then as well as Vijaya Raje Scindia’s switch from the Congress in 1967.

Congress’ prominent youth leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party on Tuesday and appeared set to join the BJP amid a rebellion in Madhya Pradesh by his supporters, pushing the 15-month-old Kamal Nath government to the brink of collapse.

A shell-shocked Congress, in a largely symbolic move of no consequence, expelled Mr. Scindia, the party general secretary and scion of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family, on charges of anti-party activities.

Reacting to the development, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot accused Mr. Scindia of betraying the trust of people and ideology, saying people like him cannot thrive without power and the sooner they leave, the better it is.

“Joining hands with the BJP in a time of national crisis speaks volumes about a leader’s self-indulgent political ambitions, especially when the BJP is ruining the economy, democratic institutions, social fabric and as well the judiciary,” he said on Twitter.

Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said ideology did not matter to Scindia, and claimed that “political convenience” and “personal ambition” played a major part in his decision to quit the party.

Mr. Chowdhury alleged that some sort of “allurement and enticement” offered by the Bharatiya Janata Party had convinced Mr. Scindia to switch over from the Congress.

“It is sad news for the Congress party because Jyotiraditya Scindia had been nurtured by the party over the years,” Mr. Chowdhury said.

“He had been entrusted with important jobs by the party. But now the situation had come to such a pass that he found it more convenient to switch over to the other party,” he said.

Some leaders also voiced concerns over the state of the party.

Haryana Congress leader and MLA Kuldeep Bishnoi said Mr. Scindia’s “departure is a big blow” to the Congress.

“He was a central pillar in the party and the leadership should have done more to convince him to stay. Like him, there are many other devoted INC leaders across the country who feel alienated, wasted and discontented,” he said.

“India’s oldest party needs to empower young leaders who have the capacity to work hard and resonate with the masses,” said Mr. Bishnoi, the son of former Haryana chief minister Bhajanlal.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh state minister Jitu Patwari made a reference to the 1857 Revolt against the East India Company as well as Mr. Scindia’s grandmother, Vijaya Raje Scindia, quitting the Congress in 1967 to state that something similar was happening.

“No person is, nor will be greater than the party,” he added.

Gaurav Pandhi, national coordinator for social media in the Congress, said, “A traitor is a traitor and no amount of arguments and reasoning can justify treachery. Period!”

Referring to the rebellion in Madhya Pradesh Congress, the party’s Karnataka unit chief, Dinesh Gundu Rao, said it was time for Rahul Gandhi to lead the party from the front and make drastic changes at the top.

The daughter of the Pune couple, who tested positive on Monday, a co-passenger and the cab driver who ferried the couple from the Mumbai airport to Pune on their return from Dubai on March 1, were the latest to test ‘positive’, said Dr. Pradip Awate, State epidemiologist.

As of now, all five positive cases in the State are from Pune.

“All five persons including the couple, their daughter, a co-passenger who hailed from Yavatmal district and the cab driver who ferried the couple, have been placed in isolation in Pune’s Naidu Hospital after their samples that were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) tested positive,” Pune district Collector Naval Kishore Ram said, adding that all five individuals were stable and there was no cause for concern.

In addition, the samples of two other family members had also been sent to the NIV for tests, said Pune Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar.

Saying the couple who tested positive were stable, he said the district administration was tracking the tour group of 40 persons who were with the couple on their trip to Dubai.

At present, six persons including the couple, three of their kin and the driver are in isolation at the Naidu Hospital.

“The Pune couple had travelled to Dubai in the last week of February and were part of a 40-member tour group. They returned to India on March 1. One of the two started showing symptoms of infection and were referred to Naidu hospital for a check-up on March 8. Their samples were sent to the NIV and both tested positive. As Dubai was not in the list of the affected places given out by the Centre, the passengers could not be checked and separated at the airport itself,” Dr. Mhaisekar said.

To track down the persons with whom the couple had travelled to Dubai and with those who came in contact with them in the past week, five teams comprising officials from the police, health and revenue departments, as well as authorities from both the Pune and the Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies had been formed, he said.

“The administration is also listing down people who came in contact with the couple at their workplace or the areas where they visited following their return to Pune to keep a check on them too. The immediate family of the couple, their relatives and co-workers at their office would also be checked for any signs of infection in the coming days,” he said, while appealing to people to keep calm and not panic.

208,2020/03/10,Rajya Sabha seat: Competing sections make selection tough for BJP,"Some groups want CM Biren be sent away from State politics as MP.

The selection of the ruling BJP candidate for the lone Rajya Sabha seat in Manipur could not be finalised on Monday during the visit of Ram Madhav, national organising secretary, and Ajay Chambal, national secretary in charge of northeast. With competing sections demanding selection of their candidates, indications are that an announcement might be made soon after the two secretaries submit their reports. The election, if necessary, will be held on March 26.

The claims have not caused surprise to anyone as the State BJP has been riven with factionalism for a long time.

After the core committee meeting attended by Chief Minister N. Biren, some ministers and senior party leaders, the two BJP secretaries had a closed door meeting with Mr. Biren. It is not known what transpired in the meeting. Later the national secretaries had left Imphal.

Reports say some Ministers and party leaders want re-nomination of State BJP president K. Bhabananda. Another section wants nomination of one of the former presidents — Meinam Bhorot, Haobam Borobabu and T.Chaoba.

The issue was further complicated as the Kuki tribals under the banner Kuki Impi Manipur say one of them should be nominated. The long-standing demand of the people of the seven Assembly segments in Thoubal district is that one person from these segments should be selected as compensation for being denied the right to contest the MP seat. As these segments had been included in the reserved seat, these non-tribal voters can elect the MP but they themselves cannot contest the same. It is also reported that some groups wanted Mr. Biren to be sent away from State politics as MP.

An order issued by H. Gyan Prakash, the special secretary (Home), Manipur, says that the preventive measure was taken to check possible outbreak and transmission of Coronavirus in Manipur. Crossing the international gates by all sections of people through these gates is prohibited. The order says that all district authorities and security forces have been instructed to close down all entry points.

On Monday, the troops of 43 Assam Rifles deployed along the border had banned crossing of the border. Only a few people are going to Myanmar and entering Manipur through these gates manned by officials of Manipur and Myanmar. Majority of the traders bring their goods to Manipur through other parts of the border. An official source says that the sealing of the international border will be extended to Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh which have a common border with Myanmar.

There have been local media reports saying that just one or two officials check the people coming from Myanmar. As there is no crowd control system near the international gates, the possibility of contracting the disease is high. Besides, reports say that those wanting to enter Manipur are stranded for hours as the doctors are yet to arrive from Imphal.

Health officials said that the tests conducted on 12 suspect persons were found to be negative. One Indian coming to Imphal was lodged in the isolation ward of the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, Imphal. Medical Superintendent C. Arunkumar said the patient was improving and said that he may be discharged soon.

There are two isolation wards in the two medical colleges, RIMS and JNIMS, in Imphal.

211,2020/03/10,"Accompanied by Shah, Jyotiraditya Scindia meets Modi; quits Congress","He will be joining BJP, according to a source

The political crisis in Madhya Pradesh came to a head on Tuesday morning with former Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia quitting the Congress and all set to join the BJP.

Setting off a chain of events, the former MP from Guna drove to Gujarat Bhawan in the morning to meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The two later left for the Prime Minister’s official residence, 7 Lok Kalyan Marg, in Mr. Shah’s vehicle. Mr. Scindia, 49, announced his decision to quit the Congress party right after his meeting with Mr. Modi.

Stifled in party

While Mr. Scindia’s resignation letter was dated March 9, he made it public only after he met Mr. Modi. In his letter addressed to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Mr. Scindia said he was unable to serve the people within the party and was hence taking this step.

The Congress later said it had sacked Mr. Scindia.

Mr. Scindia’s loyalists in the Madhya Pradesh Congress (around 19 MLAs, including a Minister) had landed in Bengaluru on Monday, prompting an emergency meeting of the State Cabinet. Sixteen Ministers had submitted their resignation to Chief Minister Kamal Nath allowing a Cabinet revamp.

In talks for months

This, however, was not enough to pacify Mr. Scindia who has been having growing differences in the Congress over what is his due after the party gained power in the State.

Sources in the BJP said Mr. Shah and Mr. Scindia as well as a BJP spokesperson, who is a personal friend of the latter from his banking days, had been in talks for months. Later State-level leader Narendra Tomar had been roped in along with Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan.

Around the last week of February, Mr. Scindia handed over a list of 24 MLAs who were with him. After this State BJP leader Narottam Mishra got in touch with the dissenters, while Mr. Scindia met with senior BJP leaders in Delhi. An abortive attempt on March 5 to spirit away MLAs was made, but on March 8, after finalising the offer of a Rajya Sabha seat for Mr. Scindia, 19 MLAs loyal to him were moved to the BJP-ruled Karnataka.

While Mr. Scindia did not join the BJP on Tuesday, sources say he is likely to do so on Wednesday in Bhopal and file nominations for the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

Mr. Scindia’s aunt and BJP leader Yashodhara Raje said on record that he would join the party soon.

The BJP held a meeting of its Central Election Committee (CEC) on Tuesday evening but a member told The Hindu that the list of its candidates for next month’s Rajya Sabha polls will only be out on Wednesday.

Speculation is rife over the future course of the Madhya Pradesh government and Mr. Scindia.

“The BJP is keen that Mr Scindia join [the party] in the presence of former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. And there are two views over the road ahead — one is to emulate what happened in Karnataka, that is, go for a floor test in an Assembly with reduced numbers and wait for bypolls to complete the circle; the other is to ask for snap polls,” said a source.

For the BJP, the defection of Mr Scindia and his supporters is a major shot in the arm in a State they lost after 15 years, which was considered one of the birth places of the Jan Sangh, the earlier avatar of the BJP. Mr Scindia’s grandmother, the late Vijayaraje Scindia was one of the stalwarts of the Jan Sangh and a founder member of the BJP, a point continually emphasised by BJP leaders through the day.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s3xyg9/article27819939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TH-JYO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/accompanied-by-shah-scindia-meets-modi-quits-congress/article31030163.ece

Chief Minister for 15 years before Congress stormed to power in December 2018, Mr. Singh has drawn accusations from Congress leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Digivijaya Singh who hinted at his role in purportedly buying over lawmakers backing the government in a bid to subvert it last week.

Accompanying him, Narottam Mishra, a former BJP Minister, described the resignations by the 16 Cabinet Ministers as diversionary tactics of the Congress. “I don’t think they can save themselves now. As per my political acumen, the government is gone,” he said.

On being asked if the BJP would welcome estranged Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia within the party fold if he turned towards it, Mr. Mishra said, “I don’t have any information about his joining. Still, this is the BJP, and we welcome with an open heart anyone who wants to join.”

Last evening, 11 MLAs and six Ministers from the Gwalior-Chambal belt, a stronghold of Mr. Scindia, who had lost the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Guna, snapped contact with the State Congress leadership. Coming days after the Congress leaders claimed to have rescued six MLAs from the “BJP’s clutches” at a hotel in Haryana, the development sent jitters across the Congress, with Chief Minister Kamal Nath cutting short his New Delhi visit to return here.

Taking to verse while referring to the incommunicado lawmakers, Mr. Mishra said: “Kuch to majbooriya rahi hongi, yuh hi koi bewafa nahi hota” (There must be some compulsion, just like that no one becomes disloyal)

As reported earlier by The Hindu, a whistleblower last week released a string of videos purportedly showing Mr. Mishra striking a deal with a Congress MLA and explaining to him how the government would be subverted. Mr. Mishra had questioned the veracity of the videos.

Meanwhile, the Congress legislature party will also meet here on Tuesday, to dwell on the embattled government, and plan reconstitution of the Cabinet, requested for by the Ministers who had resigned.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/x4ssdd/article30801250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIEFMINISTERSHIVRAJSINGHCHOUHANBHOPALMADHYAPRADESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/upheaval-in-madhya-pradesh-congress-govt-an-internal-matter-bjp-vice-president-shivraj-singh-chouhan/article31029854.ece

The Gujarat Congress on Monday said it had postponed the 386-kilometre ‘Gandhi Sandesh Yatra’ aimed at highlighting the current situation of the country through a symbolic Dandi March.

Starting from Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, the yatra was supposed to trace the route of Gandhiji’s historic Salt March and cover a distance of 386 kilometres in 26 days between March 12 and April 6.

214,2020/03/10,NSUI sweeps Gujarat University senate polls,"Elections in State’s largest varsity were held on Sunday after a gap of four years

The National Students’ Union of India, the students’ wing of the Congress, has swept the Gujarat University senate elections, winning 6 seats out of 8 seats in the prestigious polls held after four years in the State’s largest varsity.

The Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the students’ wing of the BJP, won the remaining two seats in the senate and five seats in the welfare board. The Congress students’ wing won nine out of 14 seats in the university welfare board.

Reacting to its victory, the NSUI tweeted, “Students of PM Modi's hometown rejected BJP's dividing policies & chosen the ideology of united India. NSUI won 6 out of 8 seats in Gujarat University Senate Elections.”

The Gujarat University senate and welfare elections were held on Sunday. Gujarat College, RH Patel, RJ Tibrewal, HK Arts and Rashtrabhasha College had participated in the polls. Total 2,218 students cast their votes out of the total 3,279 registered in all faculties in under-graduate and post-graduate courses.

“Students of Gujarat have rejected the BJP in the State because of unemployment and politics of hatred. It’s a victory for NSUI and its politics of inclusiveness,” said Congress in-charge in Gujarat Rajeev Satav.

‘Fight for youths’ rights’

He added that the Congress and its organisations have been fighting for the rights of the youths in the State and students of the State’s largest university have reposed their faith in NSUI.

The Gujarat NSUI in a statement said, “Youth of Gujarat has outrightly rejected the hatred spread by BJP, and by choosing the NSUI, they have clearly shown that they prefer a more liberal and issue-oriented student body.”

The Opposition party’s students’ wing is likely to launch a Statewide agitation on the issue of unemployment in Gujarat.

“In the last several years, there have been massive irregularities in recruitments in the State government. We have been fighting for transparency in the recruitment for various categories of jobs in the State administration,” said Gujarat Congress leader and former NSUI and Youth Congress chief Indravijaysinh Gohil.

216,2020/03/10,Ranji Trophy final | Vasavada wanted to bat like Pujara and he did,"Both Vasavada (106 off 287) and Pujara (66 off 237) batted for five hours on day two.

Arpit Vasavada, who struck a crucial hundred in the Ranji Trophy final in company of childhood friend Cheteshwar Pujara on Tuesday, says he was determined to bat time with the Indian batting mainstay, a plan that worked out very well for Saurashtra.

Both Vasavada (106 off 287) and Pujara (66 off 237) batted for five hours on day two for their 142-run stand off 380 balls, succeeding in their plan to wear down the Bengal attack.

Pujara overcame illness to make a valuable contribution while Vasavada, who is coached by the former’s father Arvind, could not have asked for a bigger stage to score a back-to-back hundred.

“We have been playing together since long. It was in my mind that because of Pujara’s health, he will bat after me and I knew he would be there (in the middle). So, for me it was about not getting tired and keep playing with him,” said Vasavada.

Pujara and Vasavada put Saurashtra in a strong position, taking their side to 384 for eight at close of play on a deteriorating surface.

Pujara has mastered the art of batting long and Vasavada said batting alongside him helped him immensely. The focus was on defending in their marathon stand.

“We batted well. It is not an easy wicket. We have got runs on the board so we have an upper hand.”

Asked if there was a specific plan to tire out Bengal’s pace attack, the left-handed Vasavada said: “We just wanted to bat as long as possible to tire them out.”

The 31-year-old is having his best first-class season with four hundreds.

“It was about staying on the wicket. I have learnt from Pujara’s father. Even Cheteshwar was telling me in the middle, what to do, what not to do. I get a lot confidence when he is at the other end.”

Bengal coach Arun Lal, who rated the pitch as “very poor” on day one, maintained his stance despite Saurashtra putting up a strong first innings total.

Asked if he spoke too early about the surface, Lal said: “No. it is a poor wicket, it’s not a cricketing wicket. It is slow and low. They batted off course but in cricket there is bowling, fielding, spin and pace. It’s not only batting.

“And batting 170 runs (178 actually) in the whole day. They also could not score with the ball keeping so low.”

He said he was proud of his bowlers as they stuck to their task.

“We are not out of the game yet. The match is open. The only thing is, they have runs on the board and we have not. If we have a good start, we can get these runs,” Lal said.

“I would have been happier if we restricted them to 300-325 but they played well. In morning session, they (Pujara and Vasavada) did not take any chances. They taught us how to play on this wicket. To bowl on a dead pitch requires a lot of effort. We were able to contain them. I am reasonably happy.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sm6fou/article31033930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VASAVADA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-2019-20-final-saurashtra-vs-bengal-day-2-arpit-vasavada-comments/article31033931.ece

Arpit Vasavada, Saurashtra’s rescuer in the semifinal against Gujarat, played the role of a consolidator against Bengal to strengthen the host’s position in the Ranji Trophy final at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium here on Tuesday.

Vasavada’s second consecutive century (106, 287b, 11x4) within a week and his 142-run chanceless stand with childhood friend Cheteshwar Pujara (66, 237b, 5x4) on the second day enabled Saurashtra, resuming on 206 for five, to gather 178 runs in 79.1 overs and aggregate 384 for eight in its first innings at stumps.

Two wickets by Mukesh Kumar and one by Shahbaz Ahmed helped Bengal gain some control in the final session.

Tremendous application

The two — looking to wear out the opposition — showed tremendous application on a slow surface even as Bengal pacers bowled tight lines to do the containing job. The spinners posed threat by capitalising on the natural wear and tear and unpredictable bounce.

In the opening session, Vasavada bravely faced Akash Deep, whose hostile spell was peppered with bouncers on the left-hander’s leg-stump, while Pujara had a fascinating duel with left-arm spinner Shahbaz.

Pujara, troubled by the odd ball that jumped suddenly, stepped out on numerous occasions and survived a few lbw appeals. Bengal once referred the DRS in vain.

Vasavada, 29 overnight, played every ball on merit. He cut and drove confidently on the off-side.

Fourth hundred

Vasavada and Pujara defended solidly after lunch. The left-hander, who got to his half-century with a four, sent part-timer Anustup Majumdar to the point fence to notch up his fourth hundred of the season, including three on the same ground.

“We wanted to bat as long as possible and tire them out,” said Vasavada.

Pujara, who narrowly escaped getting run out at the non-striker’s end, scored his fifty by cutting Arnab Nandi to the boundary.

Bengal tasted success after about 63 overs when Shahbaz had Vasavada stumped to end a five-hour long stand since morning.

With a hint of reverse swing, Mukesh removed Prerak Mankad in his next over.

220,2020/03/10,"Bring back de Villiers in SA squad for T20 World Cup, suggests Jonty Rhodes","The 36-year-old de Villiers hasn’t played international cricket for nearly two years, having announced his retirement in May 2018.

South Africa must do anything to win the T20 World Cup, including exploring the option of bringing back the great AB de Villiers from retirement, former player Jonty Rhodes has suggested.

The 36-year-old de Villiers hasn’t played international cricket for nearly two years, having announced his retirement in May 2018. It was later revealed that he made an offer to play the 50-over World Cup last year, but was turned down by the national selectors.

“I’m a big fan of AB de Villiers. I’m just not sure of the precedent. If you want to win a T20 World Cup, you should do anything to win it,” Rhodes was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

“I suppose a lot of people watch how he performed at the IPL but just watching him in the Big Bash, he’s such a class player.”

The ICC T20 World Cup 2020 will commence from October 18 and conclude on November 15 in Australia.

“I think it’s interesting because it’s a tough call. You want your best team to play, it’s also tough on the guys who then miss out. You know AB is a very special player so then do you set a precedent for a guy like AB de Villiers if he is not playing for South Africa, I mean why are you selecting him.”

One of the game’s best fielders, Rhodes, however, also felt a move like calling de Villiers back may mean leaving out a player who would be in contention in the lead-up to the tournament.

“You are not breaking any rules, you are setting a slight precedent and you are going to be upsetting a few players who are going to miss out. But a team without AB de Villiers or a team with AB de Villiers... I’d love to see that guy play,” Rhodes said.

He added, “Although difficult to answer that because I’m not somebody who is missing out, I’m also not from the administration about setting this kind of precedent, so I don’t have to make that call.

“It’ll just be great to see AB de Villiers play at a World Cup again for us,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wv4oii/article31031602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABDEVILLIERS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bring-back-de-villiers-in-sa-squad-for-t20-world-cup-suggests-jonty-rhodes/article31031603.ece
221,2020/03/10,Justin Langer in search of ‘white-ball finisher’ like M.S. Dhoni,"Dhoni has won innumerable matches from seemingly hopeless positions, and so did the likes of Bevan and Hussey.

Australia head coach Justin Langer says his team is desperately looking for a finisher in the mould of Mahendra Singh Dhoni or Michael Bevan in limited overs cricket.

Also read: 15 Years of MS Dhoni: From a forgettable ODI debut to World Champion

Their three-match ODI series against New Zealand, beginning on March 13, provides Australia an opportunity to test the depth in their middle order, and potentially hone in on batsmen who could fill the ‘finisher’ role.

“We’ve been fortunate in the past with a Mike Hussey or a Michael Bevan who are masters at it. MS Dhoni is a master of it, Jos Buttler has been brilliant at it for England,” Langer was quoted as saying by ICC.

“What I’ve learned is everyone in the world is looking for it,” he added.

Dhoni has won India innumerable matches from seemingly hopeless positions, and so did the likes of Bevan and Hussey.

South Africa crushed Australia 3-0 in the recently-concluded ODI series where Mitchell Marsh played at number 6 in the second and third games and scored 32 and 36 runs respectively.

Langer feels it is the right time for the potential candidates to seal the spot. The challenge starts with the upcoming ODIs against New Zealand.

“So it’s a role that’s there for someone to grab hold of,” said Langer.

“No one at this stage has absolutely secured it, have they? But there are good opportunities there for someone to do that,” he added.

Over the last year, as many as 13 batsmen have occupied positions 4-7 for Australia in ODIs, with nine different batsmen tried out at No.6.

Glenn Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis occupied the spot in five matches each, but Stoinis, particularly, misfired in the role, scoring just 27 runs in four innings.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cpjoj3/article31031114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JUSTINLANGER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/justin-langer-in-search-of-white-ball-finisher-like-ms-dhoni/article31031115.ece
222,2020/03/10,"Love KL Rahul’s style, says Brian Lara","‘He's got the skills to play all forms and secure his place’

It’s been 13 years since Brian Lara quit the international scene, but the West Indies icon still keeps a tab on world cricket and considers K.L. Rahul his favourite batsman.

“Rahul is just class… he is my favourite. He is a great entertainer and a great person to watch bat,” Lara said here on Monday.

Skillful

The former West Indies captain, however, clarified that even though India captain Virat Kohli is the best batsman in the world at the moment, he personally enjoys Rahul’s style of play.

Despite enjoying success in the limited-overs series, Rahul was left out of India’s Test squad against New Zealand last month, raising a few eyebrows. But, Lara — here for the UnAcademy Road Safety World Series, where he is captaining West Indies Legends — said Rahul has the skills to make it to any team, irrespective of the format.

“I don’t know (why he was not included). I just know that with his technique and the way I see him bat, he should not have a problem being in any team,” the 50-year-old said.

“He's got the skills to play all forms of the game and to secure his place. He should be one of the first names after Virat Kohli in any Indian team,” Lara stated.

The West Indies legend — not a big fan of day-night Tests — also believes it is time the longer format of the game is revived.

“When I was a kid, Test was the form of the game everybody wanted to watch. We had thousands of people outside Queen’s Park Oval in Trinidad. We would wait to get inside to watch a Test at six o'clock in the morning. That's not the case today.

“ Obviously, the game has evolved and it's a lot more attractive — the shorter versions of the game. But my only concern really would be to see if we can get Test cricket to shine again.”

But what should be done?

“I think they have created that love and respect for the game in England and also in Australia in terms of a Boxing Day Test, or even any Ashes series, that’s played there. That has to come back,” Lara said.

Proper marketing

“A couple of Test matches isn't going to increase the love for the game.

“Growing up, we wanted to be Test cricketers, while a kid now wants to be a T20 cricketer. Why? Because T20 is marketed in that way for kids.

“So, the marketing of the sport is important. And if we are not doing that, it doesn't matter how many Test series you have,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/n3fvk5/article31025931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10LARA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/love-kl-rahuls-style-says-brian-lara/article31025932.ece

Romesh Kaluwitharana, a cheeky batsman able to startle fast bowlers with his power-hitting in the 50-overs format, is part of the Sri Lanka Legends squad in the Unacademy Road Safety World Series.

The Lankan opener and member of the 2006 World Cup-winning team, admires Mahela Jayawardene’s batting, rates Virat Kohli as favourite batsman among the current lot and advises youngsters below 19 to keep away from the Twenty20 format.

Excerpts:

On playing for Sri Lanka Legends

We had a good start, happy to have beaten the mighty Australia Legends. They played good cricket, we sneaked through.

It feels great to be back in Mumbai and play cricket for a cause.

Present player across formats he will pay to watch

There are many players I like. I would like to watch most the India captain.

Virat Kohli gets runs all the time, consistency and hard work pay off. I like to see him bat because in any format, under any conditions, he is successful.

On Jayawardene’s success in T20s

Mahela has been a great ambassador for Sri Lankan cricket. He was an intelligent player, maximised his ability. He put a lot of thought into his batting.

Never a power-hitter, he got big scores in T20 because of his ability to find the gaps.

Value of skills to be effective across formats

Any batsman with skills can do well. Even in T20 you don’t need to be a power-hitter, because what is necessary is to get more than run-a-ball when you are batting. Placing the ball into gaps and playing intelligent cricket is effective.

Advice to young cricketers hooked on T20s

At 19, I don’t think you should look at T20 cricket too much. Because at that age you are developing and learning how to build innings, build your career.

There is always a risk factor if the focus is on T20 alone. It will not give you the necessary edge to become a tactically and technically sound cricketer. I would not advise any player to start off with T20.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/1r925x/article31025436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KALU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/road-safety-world-series-kohlis-success-because-of-hard-work-says-kaluwitharana/article31025437.ece

The loss may have been crushing and devastating for fans who were convinced the Cup was India’s but the lessons have been huge too. For former India captain Shubhangi Kulkarni, the journey at the ICC T20 women’s World Cup was nothing short of “glory on the best stage.”

Speaking to The Hindu from California, she insisted there was no reason to feel “gloomy” at the 85-run defeat against Australia on Sunday. “The gap between the teams looks big when you see the end result but the same girls beat Australia in the opening match. It only confirms the spectacular progress India has made in the last one year.”

Shubhangi pointed out the lack of support from players like Harmanpreet Kaur (30 in five innings) and Smriti Mandhana (49 in four).

Good fielding

“The star players did not perform. It hurt the team. Imagine what would have happened had they scored? I must say the Indian fielding was far better than most other teams. Earlier, fitness and fielding were issues. Not this time.”

Also read: ICC Women’s T20 World Cup XI | Poonam Yadav lone Indian in squad

“Shafali (Verma) gave us great starts but most batters missed out on taking ones and twos. They kept getting out to shots in the air. Maybe, Smriti could have been cautious. Don’t forget Alyssa Healy got an early reprieve. All this in hindsight, though.”

Shubhangi, who played 19 Tests and 27 ODIs in a 15-year career starting 1976, wanted the team to have a good mental trainer. “This is one field I thought they need to concentrate on. Playing on a big stage like MCG, in front of such a big crowd, the girls could have gained from some guidance to manage their nerves. These things count.”

To capitalise on the good work by the team, Shubhangi backed the idea of an IPL for women. “Australians learnt to play in front of huge crowds because of the Big Bash. We can have a women’s IPL to encourage the girls as not many comfortable to the thought of playing in front of huge audience. An IPL would give financial security and attract more youngsters to look at a career in cricket.”

225,2020/03/10,"Bomb found at Hindu Munnani office, police on alert in Coimbatore","The vigil was mounted after the Hindu Munnani said in the morning that it suspected that a failed attempt was made to hurl a ‘petrol bomb’ at its head office in Kattoor in the city.

Following fresh communal tension in Coimbatore on Tuesday, security has been stepped up with 1,000 police personnel along with Rapid Action Force (RAF) personnel maintaining vigil in the textile city.

The vigil was mounted after the Hindu Munnani said in the morning that it suspected that a failed attempt was made to hurl a ‘petrol bomb’ at its head office in Kattoor in the city. Close on its heels, a functionary of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), an Islamic outfit, was beaten up in the area by unidentified persons.

Coimbatore Commissioner of Police Sumit Sharan told The Hindu that 1,000 policemen and RAF personnel were deployed to monitor the situation in the city. A separate Deputy Commissioner of Police will be in charge of the Kattoor area following the two incidents, he said.

T. Guna, State executive committee member of Hindu Munnani, alleged that when the outfit’s functionaries opened the office on Ranga Konar Street around 10.45 a.m they found a broken bottle with a white cloth and wick tied to it. He claimed that the ‘petrol bomb’ could have been hurled in the early hours of the day.

Acting on a complaint, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) L. Balaji Saravanan along with other police officers inspected the premises around noon.

Speaking to mediapersons following the inspection, Mr. Guna alleged that the Hindu Munnani was “repeatedly targeted for the past 10 days.” Its district secretary Madukkarai Anand was attacked by miscreants on the night of March 4. Mr. Guna condemned the police for not arresting the accused involved in the assault and for not providing police security to the Hindu Munnani office.

Functionary attacked

Hours after the incident was reported, a group attacked SDPI district secretary Mohammad Iqbal (52) after barging into his shop at Ram Nagar on Tuesday afternoon. An SDPI spokesperson said Mr. Iqbal suffered injuries at the back of his head and his right eye. He was admitted at Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH). He claimed Mr. Iqbal was attacked by seven men. The Hindu Munnani and the SDPI announced that protests would be held in parts of the city on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Manithaneya Makkal Katchi president M.H. Jawahirullah raised suspicion over the Hindu Munnani’s claim that there was a bid to attack its office. Pointing out that multiple CCTV cameras were installed in the area, he urged the police to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the accused.

In a separate case, the Saravanampatti police on Tuesday arrested BJP member K. Pandi (41) and VHP member V. Akil (23) on charges of hurling a petrol bomb at a mosque in Vedambal Nagar on March 5. The accused were nabbed at Chinnavedampatti after they attempted to speed away on a two-wheeler from a police team engaged in a vehicle check.

During interrogation, they allegedly confessed to having hurled the petrol bomb at the mosque in response to the attack on Hindu Munnani leader Madukkarai Anand the previous day. The police claimed that the accused were planning further attacks. The Saravanampatti police remanded the accused in judicial custody.

Meanwhile, the District Administration and Coimbatore City Police will conduct communal harmony meetings between Hindus and Muslims to deescalate tensions in the city, Mr. Sharan said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/vrdmpt/article31031324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hindu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/petrol-bomb-hurled-at-hindu-munnani-office-in-coimbatore/article31031325.ece
226,2020/03/10,Central textile institute students stage protest,"More than 250 students of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International School of Textiles and Management started a sit-in protest on the campus on Avinashi Road, Coimbatore, on Monday.

A student, who spoke on behalf of the protesting students on condition of anonymity, said the Ministry of Textiles’ decision to close the institute had made their future uncertain. If the students were to pursue higher education or apply for jobs, the closure would put a question mark over the credibility of their education qualification.

The Ministry should, therefore, give up its decision to close the institute or convert it into a textile research centre, the student said.

The students’ protest on Monday night was only an extension of the protest they had been holding since February this year.

The student said after they had protested for 25 days in February, the institute’s additional director promised to take up the issue with the officials in the Ministry.

As part of his promise, the additional director also promised to take one or two of their representatives. Trusting his words, the students had given up the protest.

After he returned, he had told them that the Ministry would run the institute. He had also told them that the Ministry had also given up its earlier move to merge it with the Central University of Tamil Nadu, Tiruvarur.

But, within a few of his return from New Delhi, the Ministry had announced its decision to close the institute and not take fresh admissions starting 2020-21 academic year.

This showed that the additional director had not represented their grievance to the Ministry officials, the student said and reiterated the demand for the continuance of the institute.

He added that the students would continue boycotting classes till the Ministry announced a favourable decision that protected their future.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/central-textile-institute-students-stage-protest/article31029432.ece

Sources said that the Corporation, by cleaning, had asked the management to disinfect the common area such as reception and the room.

The civic body had also asked all hotels and lodges in the city to alert it on any visitor from abroad, particularly from countries with COVID-19 outbreak. The hotel management should not consider alerting the civic body as an avoidable act but should cooperate. While many hotels cooperated, a few showed reluctance.

229,2020/03/10,COVID-19 threat: flower growers demand moratorium on plastic flowers from China,"There are no real time updates on consignments coming in from China, the farmers say

Flower growers here have renewed their demand for a moratorium on plastic flowers from China, in the wake of COVID-19 threat.

For long, plastic flowers from China have been cited as the single largest cause for the slump in demand for fresh flowers. Piggybacking their long-stated demand for curbs on plastic flowers on the COVID-19 safeguards, flower growers have flagged it again, demanding a ban on plastic flowers for weddings and other events.

Claiming that there were no real time updates on consignments that were coming in from China, the flower growers here want the government to pass a moratorium, citing public health, on the use of plastic flowers for events.

Bala Siva Prasad, president, Hosur Small Farmers Association told The Hindu he was certain that the consignments were coming in as late as January, and that “there is no organised data on consignments since a shipment of this month will be uploaded after three months.”

Plastic flowers from China are imported as consignments of synthetic, fibre and plastic toys.

Citing a report from The Journal of Hospital Infection, published February 6, that states that the virus can stay on surfaces such as metal, glass or plastic for as long as nine days, the small farmers association in tandem with the flower growers across the country have amplified their demand on social media platforms.

“Flower growers of Pune, Delhi, Himachal, Hyderabad have all made the demand jointly with the growers of Hosur and Bengaluru. Use of plastic flowers from China in events and marriages with large gatherings poses a potential health hazard and their use should be temporarily banned,” says Mr.Prasad.

However, the fears of virus contamination in consignments has also been discounted by certain quarters on the grounds that the environment conditions such as temperature, humidity in shipping packages may not be conducive for the survival of the virus.

The floriculturists have also cited an order of the Ministry of Environment and Forests issued on September 6, 2019, in the wake of the Prime Minister’s Independence Day address calling for curbs on single-use plastics, in their demand for moratorium on plastic flowers, before taking a policy decision.

The MOEF-issued GO among other things called upon all State governments and UTs to stop using artificial flowers in their offices, among other single-use plastics listed out.

Apart from the loss to floriculture, with plastic flowers taking the centre stage replacing natural, fresh flowers to cut-costs in event managements, the sector has underlined losses by revenue to the government. “We have calculated ₹25,000 crore loss directly and indirectly through tax evasions and also through loss of labour in floriculture farms. The imported plastic flowers are undervalued to evade tax and are reused multiple times for events. Besides, the public health hazard posed by the rich, synthetic colours should also be accounted for,” says Mr.Prasad.

The farmers of Bengaluru and Hosur had lobbied recently to the National Flora Expo in Hyderabad from using synthetic plastic flowers and had succeeded, he says.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/uml33j/article31027014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KA10PLASTICFLOWERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-threat-flower-growers-demand-moratorium-on-plastic-flowers-from-china/article31027015.ece

The police said that nearly 100 police personnel were deployed in two shifts at the Four Road Junction area in Mangalam.

Rajamani on Monday demanding action against the headmistress of a panchayat union primary school near Periyanaickenpalayam under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Led by district secretary N.V. Nirmal Kumar, the members alleged in the petition at the grievances redress meeting that the district administration was “refusing” to take action under the SC/ST Act and termed the alleged lack of action as “unconstitutional.”

The Department of School Education suspended the headmistress on February 18 over allegations of forcing a 10-year-old Dalit girl to clean the school toilet.

‘Remove encroachments’

Residents from R.S. Puram petitioned Mr. Rajamani to remove encroachments on Shastri Ground used for playing various sports. Members of R.S. Puram Shastri Ground Sports Association alleged that 36 huts had been occupying a part of the ground, which could lead to children living in those huts getting injured during the sports.

232,2020/03/10,Conservancy workers on contract allege irregularities in recent recruitment,"The Corporation had recruited 321 persons on March 6

Conservancy workers working on contract for the Coimbatore Corporation protested in front of the Coimbatore Collectorate and the Corporation head office in Town Hall on Monday alleging that they had been discriminated against in appointment of conservancy workers.

The Corporation had on March 6 recruited 321 persons for conservancy worker posts.

The workers on contract, who came under the Coimbatore Labour Union (AITUC), Tamilnadu Annal Ambedkar Sugadhara Thupuravu Matrum Podhupaniyalar Sangam, Janasakthi Mazdoor Sabha and a few other organisations, alleged that the Corporation had appointed people close to the ruling party, living in Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani’s constituency and people working for those close to them by overlooking their seniority and experience.

Many of the contract workers were working for the Corporation for around 10 years. They had been demanding that they be regularised and given government salary on a time scale basis.

Many such contract conservancy workers had also applied for permanent posts when the Corporation called for advertisements to fill 543 posts. But in giving appointment orders, they had been overlooked, the workers reiterated.

They also alleged that the Corporation had given appointment for three of a family, appointed a person who was less than 18 years of age, 15 persons from a street, had not followed seniority in appointment and preferred people in South Zone (Mr. Velumani’s constituency) to people in other four zones.

They demanded that the Corporation annul the appointments, the government constitute a committee to look into the alleged irregularities in appointment and regularise the services of those who had been working for over four years.

The Corporation sources said that the civic body had followed the roster system (caste-based reservation system) and denied any wrong doing.

Transwoman among protesters

G. Gayathri, a transwoman who is employed as a conservancy worker at Ward No. 16 in Vadavalli, was among the protesters outside the District Collectorate on Monday. She told The Hindu that she enrolled as a temporary conservancy worker with the Coimbatore Corporation five years ago to “change the perceptions of the society” about transgenders. Ms. Gayathri alleged that while there was already an inadequate representation of transgenders in the Corporation, this recent direct recruitment would further affect transgenders who were willing to work as conservancy workers.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/5b9cqw/article31026848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB10CONSERVANCY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/conservancy-workers-on-contract-allege-irregularities-in-recent-recruitment/article31026849.ece

Workforce demand

Though India was the largest country with a productive youth population of under 25 years at nearly 70 crore, what the population lacked was skill. If only the youth were educated and skilled to meet the needs of 21st Century India, they would contribute immensely to the country's development and meet the workforce demand for the next three to four decades.

And, this would be at a time when most countries would be having an ageing population.

Innovative ideas

A device to screen newborn for hearing defects was installed at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) here on Friday.

Dean B. Asokan inaugurated the device in the presence of Medical Superintendent T. Sadagopan and Head of the Department of Paediatrics V. Booma at the hospital’s District Early Intervention Centre.

Tamil Nadu Government along with Central government’s National Health Mission installed the device at a cost of ₹ 2.78 lakh at CMCH, Dr. Booma said.

The technique, called otoacoustic emissions (OAE) screening test, will detect vibrations in the inner ear of newborn.

“The device will analyse these vibrations and produce a printout,” Dr. Booma said.

The printout will say ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ upon analysis and in case of the OAE test results showing ‘fail’ twice, the doctors will proceed with Brainstem Evoked Response Audiometry (BERA) test to confirm hearing loss in newborn, she said. While OAE screening test takes only about two minutes, BERA test will take more than one hour.

The Tea Board has served show cause notices on 16 biofertilizer units and eight instant tea units that were issued licence for purchase of tea waste.

According to officials, members of the public had raised complaints that the units were purchasing tea waste on the pretext of using them for producing biofertilizers and were instead supplying them to tea factories to be used as an adulterant. In order to check the veracity of the complaints, the Tea Board launched inspections at the biofertilizer and instant tea manufacturing companies recently.

According to the Government of India, tea waste is described as “tea sweepings, tea fluff, tea fibre or tea stalks or any article purporting to be tea which does not confirm to the specification for tea laid down under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act,1954 (37 of 1954), but does not include green tea or green tea stalks.”

Based on the information shared with the Tea Board, 16 biofertilizer units and eight instant tea units situated in South India were inspected by four teams comprising Tea Board officials. Officials said that licences had been issued to 24 companies to purchase tea waste to produce biofertilizers or for manufacturing tea bags.

In a statement, M. Balaji, Executive Director of Tea Board, Coonoor, said that it was observed that the “units have not maintained the statutory records properly and failed to produce relevant details on sale of the end products. Further, the manufacturing activities at the said units are not carried out in accordance with the licensed conditions. Also, the biofertilizer units and some of the instant tea units have not filed returns properly as per the terms and conditions of the licence,” said Mr. Balaji.

The Tea Board stated that the violations contravened rules of the Tea Marketing Control Order, 2003 and also the Tea Waste Control Order 1959. “Therefore, show cause notices were served on the 24 units calling for an explanation. Appropriate action will be taken immediately on receipt of their reply under the aforesaid provisions of the control orders of Tea Board,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tea-board-serves-show-cause-notices-on-biofertilizer-units-purchasing-tea-waste/article31026638.ece
239,2020/03/10,"Three men picked up by police in midnight swoop, families clueless","Kin claim they were guarding temple as part of post-riots vigil

Around 1 p.m. on Monday, families and relatives of three residents of Nehru Vihar were waiting outside the Dayalpur police station to meet them and know why they had been held. “Ye to goonda raj hai (This is rule of lawlessness),” said a relative, exasperated after an over 12-hour ordeal.

Around 12.30 a.m., Habib, Usman and Mohammed Yameen, all in their late thirties and early forties, were picked up by Delhi Police from Nehru Vihar’s E2 Block. Their relatives claim they were guarding the area, especially a temple in the vicinity. In almost every locality since riots broke out in the city, locals guard the area themselves to ensure no untoward incident takes place.

“Like every other night, they were guarding the area. There are only five Hindu families in our block. We don’t want any outsider to come and target the temple and blame our community for it, so a few of us keep vigil,” said Alanoor, Usman’s brother, who also lives in the area.

Recounting Sunday night’s events, Habib’s nephew Azeem said that while they (Habib and others) were sitting, a police van came and suddenly picked him up. “Habib called Usman for help and when the latter intervened, they picked him up as well. Locals gathered and tried to argue but a policeman pulled out a pistol. They all then fled,” said Azeem.

‘No information’

Families of the three then reached the police station but were asked to come at 8 a.m. on Monday, they said. “We reached here at 6 a.m. but the police didn’t let us speak to them. We aren’t even being told why they have been held,” said Shoaib, Usman’s nephew.

Another person identified as Nafees, a resident of Sanjay Chowk, was also held by police on Saturday evening. His family claims the police are actually looking for Nafees’s brother Gulfam. “Police came around 5.15 p.m. on Saturday and took Nafees. They asked us to hand over Gulfam... only then would they release Nafees. We are looking for Gulfam but what’s Nafees’s fault?” said Shakeel, another brother.

Noor Mohammed (86), another relative of Habib, said what the police are doing is one-sided and it’s wrong. “It’s never one-sided in a riot,” he said.

Shoaib said that the three held by police have families and kids to take care of. While Usman runs a clothing business, Habib is a tailor and Yameen runs a retail clothing outlet. “They have nothing to do with these riots. Our area was not even affected by violence.

240,2020/03/10,Yes Bank crisis: AAP leader attacks Centre,"It terms BJP ‘Bharatiya Jeb Katra Party’

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) senior leader and MP Sanjay Singh on Monday attacked the BJP over the Yes Bank controversy and alleged that people who do not pay back huge loans donate money to the BJP and termed the BJP as “Bharatiya Jeb Katra Party”.

“This is ‘Hindu-Muslim’ virus being spread and propagated by the BJP is much more dangerous than the coronavirus [COVID-19]. They have engulfed the entire country in this Hindu-Muslim virus and keep the common man distracted and steal their hard-earned money on the other side,” he said.

Hits out at ED

“Five lakh crore rupees have been lost in the share market is in the news today. Is the money of Hindus or Muslims? 21 lakh account holders’ money lost their money. Were they Muslims, Hindus or Sikhs? You are looting the money of lakhs of Hindus, ₹590 crore belonging to Jagannath Mandir has been looted during this scam of Yes Bank. And who looted? These friends of the BJP,” he added.

He also slammed the Enforcement Directorate for not acting upon defaulters such as Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, who have also been accused of committing fraud and money laundering.

“Anil Ambani group took a loan of ₹13,000 crore from Yes bank and gave ₹20 crore to BJP. Second, Essel Group took ₹3,300 loan from Yes Bank and gave BJP a sum of₹40 crore in the years 2017-2019. Radius Developers, third big defaulter, took ₹1,200 crore as loan from Yes Bank and gave [in the year 2014-2015] ₹50 lakh as donation to the BJP... These are all Yes bank defaulters who gave huge donations to the BJP and are friends to the party, and through them, the BJP has carried dacoity and loot of the money of a common man,” he said.

Mr. Singh said that the new formula of the BJP is neither sparing Hindu nor Muslim and not even sparing the money. “Every person will be duped. On one hand, they gave fuel to the riots in Delhi, and on the other, looted money,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yes-bank-crisis-aap-leader-attacks-centre/article31027504.ece
241,2020/03/10,Delhi Metro’s 15-year-old coaches to get a facelift,"The entire process of midlife refurbishment will take 20-24 months: official

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is in the process of mid-life refurbishment of coaches which were inducted in 2002 and have completed over 15 years, said a DMRC official.

The entire process of mid-life refurbishment will take approximately 20-24 months, the DMRC official said. “However, much will depend upon train requirement for meeting ridership,” a senior official added.

The first set of coaches, comprising 70 trains of four coach formations are mostly deployed on the Red and Blue Lines currently.

“As part of mid-life refurbishment of these trains or coaches, the DMRC is now preparing to undertake major overhaul activities, including internal painting, floor repair or replacement, gangway overhauling and secondary suspension replacement,” the DMRC official told The Hindu.

Around 280 coaches are in line to be provided with a “fresh layer of special water base point,” according to the DMRC.

Additionally, officials added, “Forty of the coaches need major attention to their floor. Same is being planned with the help of the original car builder.”

For overhaul of the gangways (partition area between two coaches), around 70 trains are in line.

“There are a total of 420 number of gangways in 70 trains. All of these will go for overhauling which includes 100% fabric or bellow replacement, cleaning and corrosion to provide smooth riding to passengers,” the official said.

Secondary suspension

A total of 1,130 secondary suspension in 70 trains are also expected to be done. “All of these suspensions have been planned for replacement, which are also being replaced,” the official added.

Last week, in response to a question asked in Parliament pertaining to whether the government was planning to modernise old metro trains operating on the Red and Blue Lines, the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs had said that according to the DMRC the coaches had a design life of 30 years.

“Any major technological upgradation or modernisation during the life cycle of coaches was neither technically feasible nor desirable from the financial point of view. The first set of coaches that were introduced on Red and Blue Lines are more than 15 years old, now need major repairs to components like flooring, panelling, etc,” the reply read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/n9n15r/article31027490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09DELPRIYADELHIMETROCOACH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-metros-15-year-old-coaches-to-get-a-facelift/article31027491.ece
242,2020/03/10,Tribunal seeks Centre’s reply over AIIMS nursing staff selection,"Action of govt. was arbitrary and anti-merit, says plea

The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) has issued notice to the Centre on a petition by a bunch of reserved category applicants for the post of nursing officer at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) - Bhopal, Jodhpur, Patna and Raipur.

The tribunal has asked the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to respond to the petition before March 30, the next date of hearing. It also clarified that the “joining of the applicants at the places allotted to them, shall be subject to further orders”.

Merit list

The applicants, who belong to OBC, SC and ST categories, in their collective petition have claimed that they were not allotted their first preference of institutes, even after scoring higher marks than other reserved category candidates.

The petition filed through advocate Gyanant Kumar Singh claimed that after the result of the exam was declared on February 20, 2020, the petitioners were placed in the unreserved/general category merit list having scored more marks than their counterparts who made it to the reserved category lists.

“The applicants being put in the General Merit List were not allotted their first preference while many of their counterparts in the reserved quota lists who had scored less marks were allotted institutes listed as their first preference,” Mr. Singh said.

The applicants had submitted representations before AIIMS after the declaration of results. But were constrained to approach the tribunal as the selected candidates have been asked to report to the institutes allotted to them for verification of documents.

Mr. Singh argued that the action of the government “causes irreparable injury to the rights of the applicants, particularly in view of the fact that the posting is non-transferable”.

He contended that this action of the government was “arbitrary, anti-merit and in violation of binding judgments by courts” as the less meritorious candidates belonging to the reserved category have been allotted preferred choice of posting, while those who scored higher have been denied their choice of institutes.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tribunal-seeks-centres-reply-over-aiims-nursing-staff-selection/article31027489.ece

246,2020/03/10,"Police kiosk at Idgah camp is of little help to us, say victims","Officers taking complaints of only those who didn’t call police

At a relief camp in Mustafabad’s Idgah ground, Delhi Police has set up a kiosk for victims to submit their complaints that comes under the jurisdiction of three police stations. However, the victims said that it was not helpful for all.

Mohammed Irshad (30), came to the kiosk to submit his complaint. His salon in Dayalpur’s Nehru Vihar was looted on February 25 during the violence, he stated in his complaint. He had dialled ‘100’ at the time of incident and received a reference number, but didn’t get any help thereafter.

“No police official contacted me after that. I came to this kiosk with my written complaint but they are saying that I should visit the police station,” he said.

Police officials at the kiosk said that they are receiving complaints of only those who did not call the police or submitted their complaints at the time of violence. “Complaints of those who had called to ‘100’ are not being received because action has either been taken on them or will be taken,” said an official.

Lack of coordination

“There should have been coordination between the officials sitting here and those in the police stations to keep track of our calls and complaints. The kiosk is of little use to us because many of us had called the police on the day of violence,” said Irshad.

The official at the kiosk said that the facility was set up on Saturday and they are receiving complaints on incidents pertaining to Dayalpur, Gokulpuri and Karawal Nagar Police Stations. “On an average, we receive about 25-30 complaints which are then taken to the respective police stations for further investigation,” he said.

The reason behind setting up of the kiosk was that “people are scared or hesitant to go to the police stations”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jgtlex/article31027424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-POLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/police-kiosk-at-idgah-camp-is-of-little-help-to-us-say-victims/article31027425.ece
247,2020/03/10,We are probing Tahir’s phone records: police,"NDTV report claims suspended AAP councillor made 5 distress calls to police

The Delhi police on Monday said they are going through the details of the phone records of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain to ascertain his claim of making several distress calls to the police on the days of violence in the Chand Bagh area in north-east Delhi.

“The case will be investigated thoroughly. Tahir had made several distress calls to the police and to some of his friends. All facts in the case will be considered during the investigation,” said Delhi Police public relations officer M.S. Randhawa.

The police response came after an NDTV report claimed that Mr. Hussain had made at least three distress calls to the police on February 24 before he was “rescued” by them and two calls on February 25, informing the police about stone pelting near his house in Chand Bagh.

He made the first call on February 24 at 3.11 p.m. to the police control room. During the call, he claimed that rioters had taken over his house and were pelting stones from his terrace. The second call he made was at 3.54 p.m. informing about the violence. The PCR operator disconnected the call promising to send a police team to his house.

NDTV reported that Mr. Hussain made the third call at 5.10 p.m. to PCR saying he had called several times but no police team had reached to rescue him. He again informed that a mob had entered his house and was pelting stones from his terrace. He was “rescued” by the police later that evening.

On February 25 at 4 p.m., he made a call to Joint CP (Eastern Range) Alok Kumar informing him that stone pelting had again started in Chand Bagh near his house. Mr. Kumar assured him of prompt action. He again called Dayalpur police station at 4.11 p.m. informing about stone pelting in the area. He claimed that he was not in the area but getting reports of violence. The policeman on the line assured him of action, but said that they are finding it difficult to reach the location.

The details of call recording that Mr. Hussain made to the PCR were accessed by NDTV.

Police did a U-turn

During a press conference, Additional Commissioner of Police Ajit Kumar Singla claimed that after getting a distress call from Mr. Hussain on February 24, a police team went to his building in Chand Bagh. He refused to come out of the building without a police escort after which he was taken out by the police team. However, within a few minutes, the Delhi police refuted the claim of Mr. Singla and said that Mr. Hussain was in his house.

Mr. Hussain was arrested for allegedly murdering IB staffer Ankit Sharma and for his alleged involvement in the violence in Chand Bagh.

At the time of his arrest, his two mobile phones were found “missing”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/we-are-probing-tahirs-phone-records-police/article31027412.ece

249,2020/03/10,‘Police picking up boys after asking their name’,"Mustafabad residents claim that they haven’t seen such an atmosphere prior to festival

An eerie calm pervaded the narrow bylanes of Mustafabad on the eve of Holi as those affected by the riots ambled down their paths to rehabilitation with gloom in their eyes and files containing details of their dead, missing or detained kin tucked beneath their arms.

Mirza Muzaffar Ali, who owns and operates locally popular Baba Juice Corner in the area, claimed he hadn’t seen such an atmosphere, laden with apprehensions about “what it could bring” prior to the festival, in six decades.

Whisked boys

“In my 66 years, I have never seen an atmosphere like this. There is a lot of police deployment in the area, generally because of what happened and also because of Holi...People, especially young boys, are being picked up... residents like us are used to things like that around festivals but now it is happening on a much larger scale...in all my life I haven’t seen or felt such fear and apprehension prior to Holi – not even when, and after, the Babri Masjid was demolished in 1992,” Ali said.

Meanwhile, women, children and senior citizens queued up on the main Mustafabad Road leading towards Karawal Nagar for hours to get their hands on relief material ranging from rations and clothes to stationery and footwear.

As small pyres for traditional Holika Dahan materialised at Bhagirathi Vihar across the road, residents alleged that four to five boys from each bylane on both sides of the street – but “mostly from just one community” – had been picked up by the police for their alleged involvement in the riots which claimed 53 lives across communities.

“Bas naam poochte hain aur utha lete hain...Har gali se 4 se 5 ladke utha rakhe hain [They just ask your name and pick you up. Four to five boys have been picked up from each bylane],” alleged Sultan Mirza, a resident of Mustafabad.

“The time of day doesn’t matter; the police just come and whisk the boys away whenever they want. A significant number of those detained for the riots are from here,” claimed Ali Mehdi, another resident.

Families clueless

While the families of those placed under detention since February 24, according to residents, made rounds of police stations and the Karkardooma Courts complex here on Monday, some of them, such as Shahdab Alam’s father Dilshad Ali, are waiting for the next court hearing to catch a glimpse of their kin.

The 27-year-old was detained from the Samrat Medical Store, the biggest and most popular among around two dozen such establishments in the area where he has been employed for eight years, on February 24 and is now under arrest after a fortnight in detention “despite proof of non-involvement provided by his Hindu employer,” Ali alleged.

“He and his colleague, Arshad, had gone to take part in a religious congregation near Karol Bagh on Monday morning and returned in the afternoon. When the violence was unfolding, my son and Arshad were in the shop. Their employer even showed the police CCTV footage to establish their innocence – but both of them were picked up,” Ali claimed, adding that the police had “shown his arrest” from a different location.

“His phone got switched off and we were left fearing for his safety at home. The police didn’t allow us to step out of our homes because of the situation till 11 p.m. We were finally able to track him to Dayalpur police station...we went there to meet him and were told that he would be let off after routine questioning. I could hear his cries as they beat him and Arshad up inside the lock up but didn’t let us meet him. It has been 14 days since they got him and have now put him in jail...I can only see him on the March 13,” Ali lamented.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4rdmjx/article31027396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL10-MUSTAFABAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/police-picking-up-boys-after-asking-their-name/article31027398.ece

252,2020/03/10,Dismissal of ex-Army man will discipline others: HC,"He was held guilty of wife’s dowry death

The Delhi High Court has dismissed the plea of a man who was thrown out of the Army after he was held guilty of dowry death of his wife by repeatedly demanding a scooter from his in-laws.

A Bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Sanjeev Narula noted that, “the object of punishing delinquent employee is not merely to inflict the punishment on the employee, but also to discipline others in the organisation”.

Challenge decision

Former Nb Risaldar Dilbag Singh had moved the High Court challenging a decision passed by the Armed Forces Tribunal, Principal Bench in Delhi, which rejected his plea against his dismissal from service.

Singh enrolled in the Army in April 1994. His wife expired on March 20, 1998, due to consumption of a poisonous substance. A case of dowry death was registered against him while he was serving as a Sepoy.

7 years’ prison

In 2001, he was convicted by a court and sentenced to undergo seven years of rigorous imprisonment. He appealed against his conviction and sentence before the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

Later, he was released on bail following which he rejoined his duties and continued to serve with the Army for the next 14 years.

In 2013, the High Court dismissed his appeal and affirmed the sentence awarded to him. His appeal was dismissed by the Supreme Court as well. After completion of his sentence, he was released from jail in August 2015. In the meantime, he was dismissed from service in December 2014.

The Bench noted that Singh has been convicted of a very serious and heinous offence of causing dowry death of his wife within seven years of marriage.

“The sum and substance of evidence against the petitioner [Singh] was that he forced his wife to consume a poisonous substance in the presence of other witnesses,” the Bench noted.

“The factual background — duly established, was that the petitioner repeatedly demanded dowry in the form of a scooter from his wife and in-laws. The trial court also found that the petitioner was cruel towards his wife, since he did not take her with him to his place of posting,” the Bench said.

If in a case like the present also, this court were to interfere and convert the dismissal into discharge, there would hardly be any other case which would justify the punishment of dismissal from service,” the High Court remarked while rejecting any relief to Singh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dismissal-of-ex-army-man-will-discipline-others-hc/article31027317.ece
253,2020/03/10,Shops selling Holi gears wear deserted look,"Businesses in Kotla, Khanna Market and Ansal Plaza affected by COVID-19 scare

A day before Holi, on Monday afternoon, shops had different colours and pichkaris on the display but one could hardly spot a customer. The COVID-19 scare has driven many to ditch celebrations and stay away from colours and gatherings.

Yogesh Kumar, who owns a makeshift shop in Kotla, said: “This has so far been the worst Holi, in terms of business, in the past 20 years. No one wants to play Holi following the outbreak of COVID-19,” Mr. Kumar said. Traders from Kotla to Khanna Market in Jor Bagh and Ansal Plaza, a mall in south Delhi, were of the same view when asked about the sales this season.

While the shops selling colours, pichkaris and other Holi paraphernalia wore a deserted look, owners of many other businesses, including restaurants and garment shops, said the sales have been affected partially due to COVID-19 scare.

Mr. Yadav, who lives in Kotla, pointed at other traders who sell colours and said that there were hardly any customer at their shops as well. “Expecting that the sales will go down this Holi, I had bought a stock of only ₹20,000 this time, which is half of what I had last year. By this time last year, we had sold half of our stock. I have hardly sold 10-15% of my stock this time,” he said.

“People come and ask ‘Have these products come from China?’. Look at the street. Do you feel like it’s Holi? Hope things will improve by the evening,” 50-year-old Kawaljeet Singh, who has been selling colours among other things for the past five years in Khanna Market, said.

“I had got the stock about 25 days ago and at that time, the fear of COVID-19 had not gripped people like it has now. Only one or two customers are showing up in an hour and now I will have to pack a lot of the products and store for next year. My money will be stuck,” Mr. Singh said.

Amar Sharma (36), who runs three cloth stores in Khanna Market, pointed towards his empty shop and said: “Last year, a day before the Holi, there were so many customers that we did not have a minute to spare and we would eat lunch around 5-6 p.m. Today, no one wants to come to the market,” he said.

At Ansal Plaza, Perwej Ahmad (38), who has been working at the underground parking at gate number 3 for since a year, said that their business has been also affected. “Earlier, 125-150 cars entered through the gate every day, but now it has gone down to merely 50-80. Our business has also been affected after the outbreak [of COVID-19],” he said.

Sudhan Shankar (34), assistant manager of Kofuku, a Japanese-theme restaurant said their sales have gone down by 20-30%. “Most of our customers are from Japan or Korea and many of them are not turning up.”

Manoj Kumar, 47, owner of Harryz white shirts, said that he gets his stock from China and that the sales had gone down. “A major chunk of our customers are advocates. We had exhibitions in Saket and Dwarka courts last Holi and we sell goods worth ₹5-6 lakh such exhibitions. We did not hold any exhibition this year after the outbreak of COVID-19.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8wdm30/article31027315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10CORONA3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shops-selling-holi-gears-wear-deserted-look/article31027316.ece
254,2020/03/10,HC: avoid unnecessary overcrowding on court premises,"Bar Association asked to display advisory issued by court on notice board and circulate it

The Delhi High Court has issued an advisory asking lawyers and litigants to avoid “unnecessary overcrowding” of the court premises to prevent spread of COVID-19.

The circular issued by High Court Registrar (General Administration) Ramesh Chand noted that the Delhi government had recently issued advisory on COVID-19.

It said that COVID-19 is caused by a contagious virus, which causes respiratory infection and can be transferred from human to human through air by coughing, sneezing, personal contact such as touching or shaking hands, touching an object or surface with the virus on it and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes with unwashed hands.

“As per the said advisory, one should avoid going to crowded places. Therefore, advocates, general public and litigants are requested to adhere to the guidelines/advisory issued by the government of the NCT of Delhi and avoid unnecessary overcrowding on the court premises,” the High Court circular stated.

The High Court Registrar also asked the Delhi High Court Bar Association to display the circular on its notice board as well as bring its contents to the knowledge of the members for necessary action.

Passengers and airport staff at the Indira Gandhi International Airport here have been taking precautionary measures of wearing masks to protect themselves from COVID-19. Many people travelling to foreign countries said they feel safer in abroad than in India.

While most of the people said that “precautions are necessary”, Suniksha Deb, who was travelling with her four-year-old son, termed her destination, London, a “safer location”, adding that she did not hesitate to travel without mask.

However, 69-years old Raghvir Singh Virk, who was returning to Canada along with his wife after having cut short his three-month stay here, said he could be at risk given his age. With nose and mouth covered with an N-95 mask, he said that his children asked them to return immediately after number of COVID-19 cases in India saw a rise.

At the ‘Arrivals’, Anuvinda Sharma, pre-occupied with rubbing sanitiser on her palms, shared that she had come to India to attend her best friend’s wedding. “It is going to be a huge gathering and I am scared now. I asked her if she could postpone the wedding,” she said, adding that she might pair up a mask with her attire she chose to wear at the wedding.

Most of the security staff, taxi counter operators and janitors were seen wearing masks, adhering to the suggested guidelines by the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “We cannot stop working due to the COVID-19 scare,” they explained.

A flight attendant working with the Indigo airline said that she prefered wearing masks in the flights these days to be safe. She said passengers washed hands more frequently these days and added that the fear among the fliers at times had been leading to a ruckus if one of the passengers was sick. They question the airline staff as to why a person with cold and cough had been allowed in the flight.

A family of four with masks were, meanwhile, spotted stepping back and avoiding conversations with non-masked people maintaining the “required distance”.

Employed in Estonia, Ankit Tripathi, had returned to enjoy Holi at home this year. “This is one time of the year that I meet my friends and family. The celebrations are going to be restricted though,” Mr. Tripathi who had “bought a portable sanitizer two years back” said. He had started using it only after a 12-hour-long flight takes off and showed that the bottle was empty.

An Australia-based technician, Herman, explained the importance to report back to work as his sanctioned leaves were lapsing. “It [COVID-19] was not this widespread when I had come here. I don’t have a choice. I believe prevention is actually better than cure and have been using masks and sanitisers.”

256,2020/03/10,COVID-19: pharmacists say fear among people has reduced,"Availability of masks has increased and prices have also been reduced

Talking about COVID-19, several pharmacists across the city said that the fear among people seemed to have reduced compared to last week. Awareness campaigns by the government helped reduce the panic they said, while adding that masks and sanitisers were back in the market once again.

Vipin Sharma of Star Medicos, located opposite to G.B. Pant Hospital, said, “The availability of mask has now increased and the prices have also been reduced. It is no longer as high as it was when the disease started spreading in the city. Several guidelines announced by the government and awareness campaigns on social media have helped curb the fear among people. They have begun to understand the issue.”

Echoing similar views about COVID-19 scare, Rajesh Kumar of Vinayak Medicos said that in some places were still seeing shortage of masks and sanitisers.

“The availability of N-95 masks and sanitisers are less in some areas. However, the panic that had initially gripped people have now reduced,” Mr. Kumar said.

Hotels across the city were also taking precautionary measures, the managements said.

Juliyan Ayers, General Manager of Hyatt Regency Delhi, where one person was detected positive, said that protocols and guidelines from various health organisations, including the World Health Organization, were being adhered to.

“Specific measures are in place at Hyatt Regency, Delhi, that include screening of all employees upon arrival and departure, deep cleaning of restaurants and additional cleaning of public areas, restaurants, meeting spaces, guest rooms, spa, and fitness centres. Sanitizers and wet vibes are placed at all public areas and also in all guest rooms for usage,” Mr. Ayers said.

Students living in hostels and paying guest (PG) accommodations also said that precautionary measures are being taken to monitor the spread of the virus.

“All students living in PGs have been asked to immediately report to authorities in case of any uneasiness or symptoms of COVID-19. The owners are also ensuring that the rooms are cleaned and disinfected regularly and the staff have been ordered accordingly,” said Anisha, a postgraduate student of Delhi University.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ykinps/article31027291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10CORONA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-pharmacists-say-fear-among-people-has-reduced/article31027292.ece
257,2020/03/10,Srirangam’s significance,"Mantras have the power to protect us and the power to confer good on us, said Velukkudi Krishnan, in a discourse. There are many mantras, which we can learn from an Acharya and recite every day. But what of those who do not? They too benefit when they visit temples. Temples are designed to give us the good we derive from the recitation of mantras. Take the Srirangam temple, for instance. In Srirangam, just before the sanctum is a mandapa, which is called the Gayatri mandapa. There is a reason for the name. This mandapa has twenty-four pillars, and the Gayatri mantra has twenty-four aksharas (syllables). The vimana above the Gayatri mandapa in Srirangam, is called Pranavakara vimana. So, the significance of this mandapa can be seen easily- with the Gayatri mandapa and the pranava on top of the mandapa. The kalasas on the pranavakara vimana represent the vyaahrtis. Why should a mandapa be so designed? It is for the benefit of those who do not recite the Gayatri mantra. They can still get some good when they stand in the Gayatri mandapa, to have darshan of Lord Ranganatha.

Ramanujacharya ensured that many people had a permanent association with the Srirangam temple. He appointed many people to carry out the various tasks in the temple. Thus, there was a person to wash the deity’s garments. There was a person who stitched the curtains in the chariot. There were boatmen attached to the temple, to row across the Cauvery, when required. Thus, Ramanuja ensured a temple connection to many people. Bathing in sacred rivers is also one way to get rid of sins. Thus, for each person there is some way to acquire merits in life. If for some it is mantras, for others it is service in a temple, or a visit to a temple, or a bath in a river. None needs to feel left out.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/srirangams-significance/article31033636.ece

Days after content claiming that ‘outsiders’ who had settled in Hyderabad could trigger a Delhi-like communal riot in the city was shared widely on social media, the city police swung into action, traced the origin of the message and apprehended a school bus driver.

According to the police, the accused Rahmat Shareef, who allegedly recorded the voice message and shared it on WhatsApp, is a resident of Ahmed Nagar which comes under Banjara Hills Police Station Limits. In the voice message, the accused describes himself as a ‘school van driver’ who also drives an autorickshaw.

It was on Monday that Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar, on Twitter, discouraged the public from sharing inflammatory content created by those seeking to spread rumours. He urged the public to cooperate with the police to nab such individuals.

Later, on Tuesday, Mr Kumar tweeted, “Hyd police have traced the origin of the fake news which was circulated on WhatsApp to create communal issue. The suspect will be arrested in few hrs.

260,2020/03/10,Transcending faith and religion to feed the hungry,"A casual gesture of giving food to an old woman got him a blessing; touched, the local realtor decided to feed patients and their attendants at the local cancer hospital, which has now become an organisation

Hunger knows no religion, gender, or colour. It is neutral. In these times of polarisation along communal lines, some people have gone beyond and have united for the cause of humanity. One such is a man who is serving people - especially cancer patients and their attendants - by feeding them every Sunday in Karimnagar town.

It all started a year-and-a-half ago when S.G.M. Hussain, alias Haqani, a realtor, was going past a cancer hospital on the Housing Board Colony Road on the outskirts of Karimnagar town when an old woman stopped him and asked where she could find some food. Hussain replied that there was no hotel nearby, and offered to get food for her.

Turning point touch

At the hotel, the owner - knowing Haqani - asked why he was taking a parcel. When the latter told the hotel owner about an old woman waiting for food at the hospital, the owner refused to take money. When Haqani returned and handed over the food packet to the old woman, she offered money, which, Haqani says, he declined. “Then the old woman blessed me by putting her hand on my head, which had really touched my heart and soul,” he recalls.

That set about Haqani thinking about the old woman and the people starving at the hospital. “Later, I decided to serve food to the patients and their attendants at the hospital at least once a week. It was on January 5, 2019, that I first began serving food to 25 people at the cancer hospital by starting a voluntary organisation called Humanity, Insaniyat and Manavatvam (HIM). Now, with the support of friends and others, we are feeding 80 persons every Sunday without any interruption,” says Haqani.

Helping hands all

After seeing his service, his friends and well-wishers, including Hindus and Muslims too joined HIM, and are contributing in feeding the hungry at the cancer hospital. Some pitch in bags of rice, while some others give vegetables, pulses, oil, water packets, plates, etc. What stands out is that not all HIM’s donors are rich, but many are middle-class people.

Vanaja, a widow, who runs a flour mill in the town is one such. She contributes to the ambitious feed the hungry programme by donating one rice bag per month, and also other essentials whenever required. Taking time off, she also participates in food distribution to the patients on all Sundays. Inspired, her friends and others are also donating to feed the hungry programme.

“With the blessings of almighty, I have plans to serve food every day to the patients at the hospital. There is no religion for our charity service. We all want to feed the hungry, and that is our sole motto,” says the altruist proudly.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/h68ot/article31032644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11FEEDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/transcending-faith-and-religion-to-feed-the-hungry/article31031680.ece
261,2020/03/10,One lakh 2BHK houses set to be completed this year,"GHMC elections are less than a year away

The one lakh double bedroom housing units under various stages of construction across the city may finally reach completion as the government has loosened its purse strings, and given a bounty to the Housing department by way of budget allocations.

With total allocation of ₹11,917 crore, Housing has been given prominent place in the budget, giving hope for the stranded 2.72 lakh 2BHK homes across the State.

With GHMC elections less than a year away, it is nobody’s guess where maximum allocations would go.

Within GHMC, a lakh homes have been proposed at 117 locations, of which close to 10,000 units are being constructed in-situ in slums.

Construction of majority of these housing complexes has come to a virtual standstill, owing to lack of fund flow from the government.

Officials shared that close to ₹1,000 crore bills are pending, due to which the contractors have slowed down the works almost to a halt.

So far, ₹4,500 crore worth bills have been cleared for the project in the city. “We can give 50,000 units within four to five months, with a grant of ₹1000 crore funds, after clearance of pending bills,” an official shared.

On the whole, the one lakh units would cost ₹10,000 crore, including the cost of infrastructure such as roads, street lighting, power, drinking water supply and other such expenditure.

Besides less than 300 units handed over to the beneficiaries so far, close to 9,000 more are ready for distribution, pending the works related to power and drinking water supply which would cost mere ₹10 crore, officials say.

Water and power lines alone would cost over ₹600 crore for all the one lakh units put together.

Though the Central government is to bear ₹1,500 crore from the project cost, so far, only about ₹600 crore has been released, officials say. For the remaining, the Centre is asking for beneficiary list, which the State is unable to provide, as they have not been identified so far.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ju2ag6/article31029327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY102BHK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/one-lakh-2bhk-houses-set-to-be-completed-this-year/article31029328.ece

ASPIRE-BioNEST of University of Hyderabad (UoH) was placed in sixth position among life sciences incubators in the country in a survey conducted by BioSpectrum India, a leading B2B media platform in life sciences. The survey focused on BioIncubators, both private and public, based on their achievements in the past financial year.

Four parameters — number of incubatees, funds raised, space available and pacts signed by BioIncubator with other agencies to attract enterprises/ entrepreneurs — were considered for the rankings. ASPIRE-BioNEST located in the School of Life Sciences of UoH is a 20,000-sq.ft. facility dedicated deep science incubation space.

The facility was inaugurated on February 28, 2018, and presently has 21 incubatees in diverse areas of life sciences such as agri-biotech, biologics, healthcare, pharmaceuticals and IT for life sciences.

“It is a matter of pride to figure in the top 10 of the Life Sciences incubators in the country, but we should not rest on these laurels and strive for higher goals,” said UoH Vice-Chancellor Appa Rao Podile.

263,2020/03/10,Coronavirus outbreak likely to hit airports in Asia Pacific region,"Sharp decline in traffic causing major dip in revenues with projected revenue loss of $3 billion, says ACI

The Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific has warned that prolonged duration of COVID-19 outbreak will significantly set back the region’s airports as passenger traffic volumes are down -24% for the first quarter of 2020. China, Hong Kong and South Korea have suffered sizeable losses in traffic volumes and sharp spike in COVID-19 cases in West Asia is also expected to significantly impact traffic downwards by -4.2%.

The sharp decline in traffic and passengers is causing a major dip in airports’ aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenues with projected revenue loss of $3 billion, it said in a report released on Monday. Shortfall in air traffic leads to reduced revenues from airport charges such as landing and parking charges paid by airlines, passenger service and security charges paid by passengers.

Also read: Coronavirus | How is India containing COVID-19?

“Unlike airlines, which can choose to cancel flights or relocate their aircraft to other markets to reduce operating costs, airport operators have immovable assets that cannot be closed down. They are faced with immediate cash flow pressures with limited ability to reduce fixed costs and few resources to fund capacity expansion efforts for longer-term future growth,” said Stefano Baronci, Director General of ACI Asia-Pacific.

“Situation is worse for privately-held airports as they do not benefit from the relief measures but are obliged to continue paying concession fee to governments. Therefore, severity of the current situation requires a close cooperation between airport operators and policy stakeholders to identify options to tackle the crisis,” he said.

Asia manages more than 50% of super-congested airports in the world and will require to build the large majority of greenfield airports globally. Hence, proposals to reduce airport charges or to freeze the application of 80/20 rule on airport slots globally should not be supported without passing an economic feasibility test, observed the DG.

Mr. Baronci said the proposal for a global suspension of 80/20 usage recently made by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) would give airlines the freedom to cancel flights to/from congested airports -- not necessarily linked to COVID-19 outbreak.

“While we are sympathetic with the airlines’ needs to avoid flying empty airplanes simply to retain airport slots, it should not jeopardise connectivity of passengers and distort the competitive field. We favour an evidence-based market-by-market review evaluating rates of infection, load and scheduled bookings,” he said.

The feasibility of relaxation of the 80/20 rule to a lower threshold or a calculation of the historic rights for airlines based on a shorter period through their respective associations should be explored, concluded the Director General .",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lw7joa/article31029173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09-AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/outbreak-likely-to-hit-airports-in-asia-pacific-region/article31026981.ece
264,2020/03/10,Rapid traffic growth jams the brakes on flyover flow in Hyderabad,"The volume of traffic is now huge, and we should have gone for 4-lane or 6-lane flyovers, says transportation engineer

A higher than predicted growth of traffic has led to a slowdown of vehicular flow on many flyovers of the city. “Traffic growth was factored in at 7.5%, but the growth has been much higher. Every day, between 50 and 100 vehicles are being added. Two-wheeler owners are upgrading to cars and luxury vehicles. That has changed the traffic dynamic,” says P. Sravana, a transportation engineer at the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad.

To put things in perspective, vehicular growth in Hyderabad was calculated at 16% between 2001 and 2011.

Among the first flyovers to be built in Hyderabad was the one at Begumpet whose foundation stone was laid by Chief Minister T. Anjaiah in November 1980. It was commissioned within three years, during the time of Queen Elizabeth’s visit to Hyderabad in November 1983. The big push for flyovers began in 1998-99 when a series of flyovers were constructed between Ameerpet Jn and Secunderabad. The CTO Junction flyover was inaugurated by the then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in May 1999.

The Begumpet flyover is a test case of how rising population and vehicular growth has impacted the city.

Planning failure

The flyover has been extended, widened; and a footpath and a staircase have been added to take care of the traffic load. An extension of the footpath takes commuters to the Metro station.

“For big infrastructure projects like flyovers or bridges, planning is done for 30 or 40 years. We have clearly failed in that. It is like building a 2BHK house and adding balconies and toilets later,” says Anant Maringanti of Hyderabad Urban Labs.

“Flyovers are temporary solutions. It is like the doctor telling an obese patient to loosen his belt. It doesn’t solve the problem. We need to explore other mobility solutions instead of adding to the carriageway,” says Mr. Maringanti. The addition of Metro linking some of the business and office areas of the city has added to the choice of commuters but the impact on traffic is hardly visible.

“The purpose of flyovers is to speed up traffic flow by creating difference in space. Well designed flyovers can reduce the number of accidents and the cost of vehicle ownership by speeding up traffic flow. The volume of traffic is now huge, and we should have gone for 4-lane or 6-lane flyovers,” says Ms. Sravana.

One of the longest flyovers in the city is the 11.6-km P.V. Narasimha Rao Expressway built in 2009 at a cost of ₹500 crore. The access-controlled expressway with entry and exit points at S.D. Eye Hospital Mehdipatnam and Aramghar has been tweaked over the past 10 years with the addition of four ramps to ease the flow of traffic under it. Clearly, it has not worked and two more ramps are now under construction near Pillar nos. 156 and 166 to improve access to people in the surrounding areas. To compound the problem, buses and large vehicles are no longer allowed to ply on the flyover. The result: buses to and from Bengaluru use the main road adding to the traffic pressure.

One of the longer flyovers is being built to link Shaikpet area with Raidurgam to bypass the crowded Dargah Junction. The key bottleneck near the Rainbow Apartments has already been solved with land acquisition. “This will considerably ease the flow of traffic. We get vehicular movement from six directions. Once it becomes functional, traffic will be manageable,” says a constable managing traffic near Dargah.

Nowhere is the knee-jerk reaction of city planners more evident than on the Biodiversity Flyover which witnessed a horrific accident that killed a woman. With 108 rumble strips of various heights and different sequences, the flyover is like a bronc-rider track that sends ripples up the spine of two-wheeler riders. Even passengers inside cars are not spared from feeling the modified design. The tightly-packed rumble strips and speed breakers make all commuters touch their spine and feel its shape.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mz4c4u/article31026950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10Toli-Chowki-Flyover1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rapid-traffic-growth-jams-the-brakes-on-flyover-flow/article31026923.ece
265,2020/03/10,Space underneath Tolichowki flyover turns a choke point,"Under the two spanking wide flyovers in Tolichowki area, a pulsating neighbourhood has transformed a part of the city. The place, which had two small religious structures, is now a teeming mass of humanity. There are coconut vendors, ice sellers, a pushcart that sells snacks, a paan leaf seller and a birdseed seller; and there is no end to supply of tea from the nearby hotel.

“When a flyover is built, the older neighbourhood under it gets affected. Shopkeepers report lower sales. But the loss gets evened out over a period of time,” says P. Sravana, a transportation engineer at the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University-Hyderabad. But in the case of Tolichowki flyover, it has transformed the neighbourhood. On its part, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is carrying out an extensive urban renewal project by adding footpaths, parking bays and resting spaces.

“We used to have five vehicles here. Now there are 55 vehicles for hire. There are workers, raging from skilled plumbers and painters to stone masons and daily-wage labourers,” says Khaza Pasha, who has seen the area change from 1974. GHMC’s ₹5-a-meal kiosk attracts scores of people from the surrounding areas.

“It began in the ’90s when people returning from Kuwait began building houses in the area. Once HiTec City and Cyber City developed, the area became a choke point. After the flyover was built, the people of the older neighbourhood are reclaiming the space. There is an assortment of people who mark out their own turfs and begin using the area,” says Anant Maringanti explaining the changing dynamics of the area.

Reclaiming spaces

It is this reclaiming of spaces that has reduced the utility of many flyovers. Langar Houz Flyover, PVNR Expressway, Alwal Flyover, Narayanguda Flyover, Chandrayangutta Flyover and most other flyovers have bottlenecks under them.

A 3.5-km distance under the PVNR Expressway takes 13 minutes on a non-working day. It is the same scene at the Bharatnagar Flyover (10 minutes for a 2-km car ride) as hawkers choke the entrance point by spilling all over the road near Erragadda. It is like a solution has been readied but the problem has mutated into something else.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hiuwfy/article31026912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10Toli-Chowki-Flyover,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/space-underneath-tolichowki-flyover-turns-a-choke-point/article31026913.ece
266,2020/03/10,COVID-19 suspicion keeps people away from loved ones,"14-day home isolation must for those who have come in contact with a patient, tested negative or have travel history to an affected country

Fear of contracting COVID-19 has created a wall of sorts between suspected patients and their loved ones. Even the most doting parents are forced to keep away from their children, and spouses are isolated from one another.

Exercising caution

Health department officials have advised home isolation for a period of 14 days for people who have come in contact with a COVID-19-positive patient, tested negative for the virus, have travel history to a virus-affected country or suspect they might have contracted the infection.

Besides, people admitted to isolation wards in government hospitals also have to be under home isolation after they test negative and are discharged.

“One among them is a person who returned from Italy but tested negative for the virus. The suspect has to be under home isolation and stay away from his young daughter and others in the family. This precaution has to be taken for the safety of others,” said an official.

According to the World Health Organisation, the estimated incubation period for COVID-19 symptoms to show usually ranges from one to 14 days, most commonly five days.

During the isolation period, one has to stay put in a room, use separate plates and have clothes washed in hot water. If anyone were to enter the room, a distance of one metre has to be maintained, said officials. However, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention states that the virus is thought to spread from person to person who are in close contact with one another (within 6 feet).

All this makes it clear that people have to maintain a safe distance from suspected patients. Family members of the index (first) case from Telangana — a 24-year-old techie who tested negative — have also been advised home isolation.

Apart from this, a few people who have returned from coronavirus-affected countries but do not have any symptoms yet, have been advised to exercise caution.

“My friend who recently returned from the US has a newborn daughter. But he has to stay away from her and his wife for 14 days to avoid any risk to them. It will be tough on him, but it’s better to be safe than sorry,” said a city resident on the condition of anonymity.

Psychological support

Sources said that since those kept under home isolation may battle anxiety and need emotional support, it would be of help if the State government provides psychological support.

When they are under isolation, their health condition is monitored daily by Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme staff and officials. If they develop any symptoms, they are admitted to the isolation wards in government hospitals and their samples taken for tests.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/74bbre/article31026816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09-COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-suspicion-keeps-people-away-from-loved-ones/article31026754.ece
267,2020/03/10,Coronavirus: Minister inspects thermal screening at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport,"Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Monday inspected universal screening facilities at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport to detect COVID-19 in passengers. He said arrangements would be made for round-the-clock thermal screening.

If any person returning from abroad is detected with high body temperature, one of the symptoms of COVID-19, they are given Personal Protection Equipment, their body temperature is checked again and they are asked about their travel history, if they have other symptoms. Later, they are taken to an isolation wards of a government hospital in ambulance.

When the screening was initiated in third week of January, only those who travelled by flights originating from China were screened. Now, people arriving from any foreign country are being screened.

Mr Rajender said doctors and nurses are stationed at four main ways in the airport. In a day, 4,000-5,000 passengers arriving from foreign countries land at the Shamshabad airport.

Senior Regional Director for Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Anuradha Medoju, Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy and Director of Public Health G. Srinivas Rao accompanied the Minister.

Two more labs sought

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar on Monday sought two more laboratories in the State to test samples of coronavirus (COVID-19).

During a video conference with Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba with the Chief Secretaries of all States, Mr Kumar further requested for additional thermo N95 masks and two more thermal scanners at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad.

268,2020/03/10,CSIR-IICT unveils safe process of making APIs,"It will help in checking industrial explosions

Explosions in chemical units and boiler plants have been regular occurrences in the suburbs of the capital city due to accidents or mishandling of the materials causing serious injuries or even deaths in many a case over the years.

Scientists at the Council of Industrial & Scientific Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) have announced that it is now possible to synthesise complex chemical processes towards manufacture of drugs, pesticides and the likes in a much safer yet more productive manner.

Generally, most chemical processes for making of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) take days and require copious amounts of raw material which are then mixed in huge containers manually to get the end product. The process has to be repeated if the requirement is more and mishaps usually happen during the mixing of chemicals.

“We have been working on making APIs simple, safer and eco-friendly. We have succeeded in drastically reducing time in making six chemical compounds in our modern lab. It removes chance of any adverse reactions like explosions because there is no manual process involved and portions are smaller. This would be a boon to the industrial units as there is zero waste and costs are reduced,” avers IICT director S. Chandrasekhar.

Products of such ‘Integrated Continuous Flow Chemistry’ are: Alpha Lipoic Acid, an antioxidant taking just 15 minutes for synthesis; Daclatasvir, used for treating Hepatitis C virus takes about 41 minutes; Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction taking 13.5 minutes; same goes for Homosildenafil, another phosphodiesterase and Lodenafil, also a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used for erectile dysfunction.

Celecoxib is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug and the API takes about 14.2 minutes for synthesis. “All these compounds take anywhere from three to 10 days for the synthesis to happen in the normal course of traditional methods and to get one kilo of product, you have to use 10 kilos of solvents. Here there is no waste at all,” say scientists - P. Srihari and Ajay Singh.

Scientists explain that ‘miniaturising’ of the syntheses helps in getting the required final product minus spillage and impurities as the entire integrated flow is automated or can be controlled via remote through a mobile. “We have developed a few indigenous devices to fine tune. Any amount of end product can be obtained in a short time,” they explain. IICT is ready to help units to develop their compounds in its lab and pass on the knowledge too, affirms Dr. Chandrasekhar.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9qejak/article31026703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10IICT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/csir-iict-unveils-safe-process-of-making-apis/article31026704.ece

270,2020/03/10,AIC-CCMB backing to digital healthcare innovators,"Entrepreneurs-in-residence and start-ups to be given financial support under TIDE 2.0

Atal Incubation Centre-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (AIC-CCMB) will provide Entrepreneurs-in-residence and Start-ups financial support under the Technology Incubation and Development of Entrepreneurs Scheme (TIDE 2.0).

A part of MeitY Startup Hub, an initiative of the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the programme seeks to support innovations in digital healthcare, especially in bioinformatics and genomics. Innovators with medical, engineering, business and design backgrounds and passionate about developing solutions for actionable outcomes for clinicians will get a chance for incubation as well as funding under the programme, according to AIC-CCMB. Telangana IT and Industries Secretary Jayesh Ranjan on Monday launched the ‘AIC-CCMB IDEATHON 2020 – Bring your own idea’ through which the beneficiaries are to be selected.

The programme, conducted at CIE -IIIT Hyderabad, was addressed by CSIR- CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra, IIIT-H Director P J Narayanan and IIT Hyderabad Director B.S. Murty. TIDE 2.0 will be a part of Year of AI that Telangana has declared 2020 as.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Ranjan said it is an odd coincidence that the launch of application process comes at a time when the world is in middle of turbulent times because of COVID-19 (coronavirus). Advancements of technology will help understand the disease, provide cure or prevent besides helping manage it better, he said, highlighting the significance of innovation in healthcare.

Listing out various initiatives of the State government, he said a demonstration, as part of the Medicines from The Sky project involving Telangana and World Economic Forum, of blood supply using drones would be made at the upcoming Wings India 2020 aviation show. Dr. Mishra said the call for application is aimed at building models for precision medicine, strategies and products for better clinical outcomes for the Indian population and in general, improve wellness – using genomic data, AI and bioinformatics tools. This is also in line with the large scale Indian genomic studies CSIR has undertaken.

CEO of AIC-CCMB Madhusudhana Rao said a special feature of the programme is that it also allowed individual innovators to apply in addition to start-ups. These individuals undergo an immersion programme focusing on various aspects of business as well as mentored by experts from CCMB and industry. Both individuals as well as start-ups will have an opportunity to attract investments up to ₹ 40 lakh for product development and market outreach, a release from CCMB said. The last date of application for the program is March 31.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/aic-ccmb-backing-to-digital-healthcare-innovators/article31026628.ece

272,2020/03/10,Govt. asked to take overRAY project from Corpn.,"SHRC orders construction of apartments for 398 landless families

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has asked the government to undertake the construction of apartments for 398 landless families under the Rajiv Awaz Yojana (RAY) as the Kochi Corporation was not able to complete the work after launching the scheme in 2014.

SHRC Chairman Antony Dominic in an order asked the Principal Secretary of Local Self-Government Department to intervene in the issue without delay.

The plan was to construct two towers for the 398 families. Each tower was allocated ₹17.25 crore. The construction work reached a halt after completing the first floor when the project cost exceeded the initial estimate. A report submitted by the Corporation Secretary before the commission stated that the proposal for meeting the additional expenditure was pending before the city council.

Jaifin Karim, a resident of Fort Kochi and the petitioner, had blamed the Corporation for the delay in completing the project. An official release issued by the commission quoting its chief said that the views expressed by the petitioner that the delay on the part of the officials in ensuring the timely completion of the project cannot be ignored.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/govt-asked-to-take-overray-project-from-corpn/article31033497.ece
273,2020/03/10,Need to impose environmentcompensation stressed,"Local bodies asked to comply with Solid Waste Management Rules

The need to impose environment compensation on local bodies found violating the norms under the Environment Act and Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 was stressed at a meeting convened by the State Pollution Control Board here on Tuesday.

Justice K. Ramakrishnan of the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT), and A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, chairman of the State Level Monitoring Committee appointed by the tribunal, spoke at the meeting, which was held to create awareness on the plan schemes initiated by the board and to ensure implementation of various legal and administrative rules to check pollution.

According to officials who attended the meeting, both Mr. Ramakrishnan and Mr. Ramakrishna Pillai reminded the need to comply with the provisions under the National Green Tribunal Act.

As per the Section 26 of the NGT Act, persons who fail to comply with any order or award or decision of the tribunal shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine which may extend to ₹10 crore, or with both and in case the failure or contravention continues, with additional fine which may extend to ₹25,000 for every day during which such failure or contravention continues after conviction for the first such failure or contravention.

The provision also stated that a company that fails to comply with any order or award or a decision of the tribunal under this Act shall be punishable with fine which may extend to ₹25 crore, and in case the failure or contravention continues, with additional fine which may extend to ₹1 lakh for every day during which such failure or contravention continues after conviction for the first such failure or contravention.

The experts also asked the local bodies to comply with the various provisions under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

275,2020/03/10,Kundannoor flyover may be ready by April-end,"Work on Vyttila flyover may be completed only by June; T.K. Jose urges officials, contractors to be vigilant

The six-lane Kundannoor flyover would most likely be ready for commissioning by April 30, while its sister flyover at Vyttila might be ready only by June, Public Works Department (NH wing) officials apprised T.K. Jose, Additional Chief Secretary (PWD), who inspected the two work sites on Monday.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Jose held meetings with PWD officials and assured all help to complete the two projects in a time-bound manner.

He exhorted officials and contractors of the projects to be vigilant so that there is no further delay, especially in completing the Vyttila flyover, which was slated for completion in May 2019.

Mr. Jose was in the city to familiarise with the progress of work on the two flyovers. The Kundannoor flyover, work on which began in March 2018, could have been completed earlier but for a change of design of the approach portion on the Aroor side, it is learnt.

The PWD (NH wing) changed the design on the Aroor side to save space and to ensure a wide-enough service road.

Similarly, the central span’s height was increased in order to facilitate movement of container and other lorries, especially to the BPCL. Drains and signal posts at the junction had to be readied, apart from completing work on the approach spans on either side, said sources.

Slow pace

At Vyttila, a few more girders have to be launched, while work on the approach portion on the Palarivattom side is progressing at a slow pace. Slip roads on either side too are incomplete, even though PWD officials had assured that they would be readied by April 2019. Sample painting has begun on the Aroor side of the structure.

Meanwhile, a decision has been taken to adopt higher grade tarring over the flyovers to ensure their durability. The specific grade of bitumen will be brought here from Baroda.

Decongesting junction

On the second phase works to decongest Vyttila junction, sources said it could be looked into at a later stage. Metroman E. Sreedharan and a host of others had cited the need to build an underpass linking S.A. Road and Vyttila-Pettah Road to lessen congestion at the junction.

It would entail acquisition of around 10 metres on SA Road and at least 20 metres on the road towards Pettah, they added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/53h5mx/article31027180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09KIFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kundannoor-flyover-may-be-ready-by-april-end/article31027181.ece
276,2020/03/10,Chullikkal to switch to solar energy,"Energy survey report of ward prepared by C-HED released

Chullickal could be the first ward within Kochi Corporation limits to turn to solar power to meet its energy requirements. An energy survey report of the ward prepared by the Corporation’s Centre for Heritage, Environment and Development (C-HED) was released on Monday.

The door-to-door sample survey was conducted in the two sq.km area of the ward comprising around 2,000 houses to determine the inclination of residents towards renewable energy sources and deduce the potential of the ward to utilise solar power.

Antony Francis, councillor representing Chullickal, pointed out that implementing the report would require the Corporation’s support since a majority of the area’s residents would not be able to bear the initial installation expenses. Johnson Master, chairman, Tax Appeal Standing Committee, said as a pilot project, funds would be set aside from the coming financial year’s plan fund to set up solar panels in around 300 houses in the ward.

The survey found that nearly 50% of residents were not in favour of shifting to solar power and were apprehensive of the initial monetary investment involved. Around 41% of residents were unaware of the government subsidy of up to 30% to set up panels.

This was the first such ward-level energy survey by a local body in the country, according to Rajan Chedambath, director, C-HED. The survey was likely to be extended to other wards of the Corporation soon, he said.

If solar panels are set up in the ward, around 34 gigawatt hours of electricity could be generated annually, preventing the production of over 1 crore kg of carbon dioxide.

The survey was conducted by students from Cochin College and compiled with assistance from the World Resources Institute (WRI).",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/chullikkal-to-switch-to-solar-energy/article31027160.ece

As part of proactive measures against the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, all station house officers in the Kochi city police have been asked to take action against those found spitting or blowing nose in public under Section 120(E) of the Kerala Police Act, said a press release.

The Kerala police have made it clear that the failure to inform the Health Department by those who had travelled to coronavirus-affected countries will be treated as an offence.

278,2020/03/10,"No need for panic, says expert","There was no need for panic over COVID-19 as practising respiratory and hand hygiene would help keep people away from the infectious disease, said Dr. P.K. Sasidharan, former professor and Dean of Medicine, Kozhikode Medical College, in a talk organised here by the Social Health One Health (SHOH) Movement in association with Chavara Cultural Centre.

“Soap, water and common sense will prevent the spread of coronavirus. Washing hands frequently, especially before touching nose, mouth or eyes, should be a habit,” he said. Even when such simple methods were available, there was mass hysteria over the issue, he added.

Vaccine-making became a priority now, he said. However, it was not practical to create a vaccine for all influenza viruses because by the time the vaccine gets ready, there would be a new strain. A new vaccine would work against only those viruses having common antigens, he added. “It is a fact that we live among several microbes around us and we have to learn to live, despite their presence, by maintaining environmental and personal hygiene.”

It was important that people work on preventive methods like building immunity by having a balanced diet and following a healthy lifestyle, he said. Poor intake of balanced diet was the main reason for low immunity, he added.

Quoting the New England Journal of Medicine, which had published a series of articles since COVID-19 became a pandemic, he stated that the virus affected more people with co-morbid conditions.

279,2020/03/10,COVID-19: Kochi schools mull early holidays,"A few declare vacation for primary school students

In view of more COVID-19 cases getting reported in the State, some of the educational institutions in the city have advanced their summer holidays, especially for lower primary classes, as a precautionary measure.

At least three CBSE schools in the city have declared summer holidays with Monday turning out to be the last working day of the ongoing academic year for primary class students. While Choice School advanced summer holidays for classes from kindergarten to Grade 3, Rajagiri Christu Jayanthi Public School declared summer holidays for students from Classes one to four while cancelling exams and open house as well.

Global Public School closed all units of Stepping Stones and Grades one to five besides cancelling all scheduled programmes. More schools are mulling over following suit, it is learnt.

Caution in the air

When contacted, a school official said that with the school unable to track the travel history of parents, it was better to err on the side of caution.

Indira Rajan, secretary general of the National Council of CBSE Schools, said that the decision to advance summer holidays was the discretion of individual schools. She said that with both the district administration and the State government keeping a close tab on the situation, it was up to them whether to declare holidays or not.

“We have distributed among schools a circular issued at the national level by CBSE on the dos and dont’s with regard to COVID-19. Schools in turn distributed its copies to students to alert their parents,” Ms. Rajan said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/covid-19-kochi-schools-mull-early-holidays/article31026941.ece
280,2020/03/10,Action against fake social media posts on disease,"Police keeping tabs on messages

The city police continue to keep tabs on misleading and fake social media posts on COVID-19 with the Central police having registered two cases so far in this regard.

Cases have been registered against naturopath Jacob Vadakkancherry and an unidentified person under Sections 118 (b) (knowingly spreads rumours or gives false alarm to mislead the police, fire brigade or any other essential service) and 118 (e) (knowingly does any act which causes danger to public or failure in public safety).

“Mr. Vadakkancherry was found to have made a misleading Facebook post on COVID-19 while in the latter case an audio clip on the disease claiming to be by the Ernakulam Assistant Commissioner of Police K. Laljy was found circulating in WhatsApp. We are yet to identify the person behind the voice,” said S. Vijayasankar, Inspector.

He said the police were keeping track of similar misleading social media posts with the help of the cyber police.

A similar audio clip alerting that three patients at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS) have been tested positive for COVID-19 was also found widely circulating over WhatsApp. The voice, belonging to a lady, could be heard warning people in and around Ponekkara adjacent to AIMS stating that doctors and staff from AIMS moved along in the area freely. However, AIMS shortly came up with a clarification saying it was a fake news alert and warned of strong action, including petitioning the police cyber cell.

In another WhatsApp audio message, another lady could be heard claiming that COVID-19 had reached Angamaly since a case had been confirmed in Little Flower Hospital. This was found to be another instance of fake message and the hospital authorities lodged a petition with the Angamaly police.

“It was a message posted by the lady concerned in her family group last month. After it started circulating in the social media, we tracked down and arrested her. A case was charged under various Sections of the Kerala Police Act before releasing her on station bail,” said G. Arun, Sub Inspector, Angamaly.

282,2020/03/10,Mobile towers to connect Odisha villages,"Administration to instal them in BSF camps in Swabhiman Anchal

The Odisha government has planned to connect inaccessible villages in Odisha’s Swabhiman Anchal, a stronghold of CPI(Maoist), in Malkangiri district by setting up mobile towers for the first time.

After hard-fought area domination in Swabhiman Anchal, formerly known as the cut-off area, the administration with the help of paramilitary forces has started gaining access with road networks to the region once considered by the Left Wing Extremists (LWEs) as their liberated zone.

Plans are also afoot to set up mobile towers at strategic places for the first time.

At a recently held high-level meeting, the State government requested telecom companies to expand their mobile connectivity in the district, especially in Swabhiman Anchal. Besides, Bonda Hill Area in Chitrokonda and Khairput block will also be connected with mobile technology.

“After inauguration of Gurupriya Bridge, the area has now been connected with the mainland. The people of 151 villages intend to interact with mainland and are keen to use mobile phones,” said Suresh Mohapatra, Development Commissioner and Additional Chief Secretary, while chairing the meeting.

The State government has zeroed in on two villages – Badapada and Hantalaguda — where BSF camps have been operating, for erection of mobile towers. At Badapada, a 33/11 kV electricity sub-station is being set up with the help of paramilitary forces.

Police escorts will be provided to telecom companies for transporting equipment to the Maoist-affected areas.

283,2020/03/10,Naga organisations seek early political solution,"‘Trust there will be no new subjects, reversals on any matter’

Two influential tribal organisations in Nagaland have linked the settlement of the ‘Naga political issue’, dragging for more than 20 years now, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reputation.

The organisations – Dimapur Gaon Burah Federation and Naga Council Dimapur – reminded Mr. Modi that settling the issue at the earliest would reflect on his leadership qualities.

“We trust that there will be no new subjects or reversals on any matter already negotiated and agreed upon. We urge your office that whatever is on records as on October 31, 2019, be announced to the Naga people…,” the organisations said in a joint memorandum to Mr. Modi.

The memorandum was submitted after a rally on Monday called by the Nagaland Gaon Burah Federation across the State to reiterate the demand for an early solution to the problem.

“An early signing of the agreement will most certainly enhance your reputation as the undisputed leader of the world’s largest democracy,” the organisations wrote.

A solution to the vexed issue has been elusive despite the Centre and Naga extremist groups concluding a “successful” round of talks in October 2019. The National Socialist Council of Nagalim or the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) is the main group while seven more clubbed as Naga National Political Groups joined the peace process later.

In an interview a few days ago, the Centre’s interlocutor in Naga peace talks and Nagaland Governor R.N. Ravi accused the NSCN(I-M) of delaying the solution as it was not prepared for a settlement. He said the outfit was doing so by misinterpreting the August 2015 Framework Agreement with “new and mischievous interpretations”.

The NSCN(I-M) termed the statement “immature and malicious”.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/1svw31/article31027287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE10SOLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/naga-organisations-seek-early-political-solution/article31027288.ece

285,2020/03/10,Public urged to cooperate with culling in flu-hit areas,"Some people found hiding birds or smuggling them out

The Kozhikode district administration has urged the people and poultry farmers to cooperate with the culling of fowls as a precautionary measure against the spreading of bird flu that has been reported in Vengeri and Kodiyathur.

In a release on Tuesday, the authorities said that the culling was being done within 1-km radius of the infected areas. However, some people were found to be hiding their birds or smuggling them out. It had been pointed out that humans too stood a chance of getting infected on rare occasions. Thus, culling was necessary to destroy the virus in its primary source and prevent it from spreading to other areas and among humans.

District Collector S. Sambasiva Rao said that some local residents were found obstructing the work of the rapid response team at Vengeri, claiming that the birds had no health issues. Mr. Rao held a meeting at the collectorate in the evening to take stock of the situation. It was decided that ward councillors, health inspectors and a police official would accompany each team from March 11. The birds smuggled out from Vengeri would be tracked with the help of the police and culled. As many as 1,266 birds were destroyed on Tuesday, taking the total number of those destroyed to over 4,000. Eggs and fodder too were destroyed.

Meanwhile, there was some concern when bats were found dead in Karassery. Sources in the Animal Husbandry Department said though bats were unlikely to get infected, samples would be sent to the lab. The Health Department has cautioned against killing bats, pointing out that it would lead to the birds releasing their secretions through which there was a chance of the Nipah virus spreading.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/public-urged-to-cooperate-with-culling-in-flu-hit-areas/article31034006.ece
286,2020/03/10,VACB raids newspaper office in flyover case,"Ebrahim Kunju accused of diverting money to the daily

Sleuths of the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Tuesday carried out raids at the headquarters of a newspapers in connection with the case registered against former Public Works Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju for alleged corruption in the construction of the flyover at Palarivattom in Kochi.

It was alleged that a portion of the kickbacks to the tune of ₹10 crore was transferred to the account of the daily during the demonetisation period.

The VACB team verified the accounts, records and documents at the office on YMCA Road from 9 a.m. Previously, the VACB team had secured information about the transfer of the money to the establishment. It wanted to ascertain the source of funds that had been deposited into the account of the newspaper. Mr. Kunju, who is a member of board of directors of the newspaper, however, termed as “politically motivated” the raids on the daily and the case registered against him.

Earlier, the VACB had submitted a report in a Vigilance court in Muvattupuzha.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/vacb-raids-newspaper-office-in-flyover-case/article31033998.ece

The police on Monday arrested one more accused in a car theft case involving a former terror case convict and seized one of the cars stolen from Kottayam.

The arrested is Riyasuddin, 31, son of key accused Muhammad Rafiq. He landed in police custody while attempting to meet his father, currently lodged in the Kottayam district jail. During interrogation, Riyasuddin confessed to selling cars stolen from Kerala and based on his statement, the police recovered a luxury car stolen from Kottayam.

The car, originally owned by a retired police officer in Kottayam, had been sold to one Balu in Tirunelveli for ₹2 lakh.

290,2020/03/10,City police to book those spitting on the road,"Those who deliberately make streets dirty will be penalised

Spitting is an involuntary action for a lot of people in Kozhikode. While spitting out the mucus or unwanted substances is necessary for a patient, most people in these parts spit on the road or wherever they walk, for no reason apparently.

This habit of a section of the public has come under the scanner in the backdrop of COVID-19 infection. Droplets of mucus and saliva are often carriers of not just the coronavirus, but many others too and hence the police department has come up with restrictions on spitting on the road.

District Police Chief (Kozhikode City) A.V. George has issued a directive to police personnel to book those who deliberately make the city dirty in any manner, especially by spitting on the road. Violators will be booked under Section 120(e) of the Kerala Police Act. They will be liable to imprisonment up to a year or a fine up to ₹5,000. The directive came into effect on Monday.

Incidentally, the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation too has a similar law in place, though it is on spitting chewed pan in public. The law came into effect at least half a decade ago, but is largely defunct. The current officials in the corporation’s health wing have not paid much attention to the law, mostly because chewing pan is not so common in the city these days.

If not strictly implemented, the police department’s directive may not serve its purpose. On the other hand, it sends a strong message on personal hygiene.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/city-police-to-book-those-spitting-on-the-road/article31026937.ece

295,2020/03/10,‘Principal could have been lenient towards student’,"Death of undergraduate student of Malabar Christian College

The students’ grievance redress cell of Calicut University is learnt to have held that the principal and teachers of Malabar Christian College, Kozhikode, could have been a little more lenient towards Jaspreet Singh, the third year student of B.A. Economics who allegedly took his life after he was denied the chance to appear for the final semester exam.

Members of the cell on Monday held a hearing on the campus and spoke to Godwin Samraj, the principal, and other teachers in the department of Economics. The cell members were of the view that the principal should have used his discretion to allow Jaspreet to write the exam as he had over 65% of attendance.

According to university regulations, students should have at least 75% attendance to be eligible to write the exam. The cell members pointed out that if the students had valid reasons for absence from class, they should be given a chance. The cell also sought a report from the college authorities on why as many as 10 students were left out of their semester exams from the Economics department alone.

Meanwhile, Calicut University Registrar C.L.

296,2020/03/10,Better facilities sought at Beypore Port,"Cargo vessels ignoring port due to authorities’ indifference, says panel

Alleging apathy on the part of the Ports Department in completing pending dredging work at the Beypore Port, members of the Beypore Port Development Committee took out a protest march to the Kozhikode Collectorate on Monday.

The protesters, comprising members of various trade unions, complained that cargo vessels had been ignoring the port thanks to “indifference” of the authorities.

Inaugurating the march, U. Pocker, chairman, Beypore Port Development Committee, alleged that the State government did not have even a dredger to carry out emergency work at ports. “Several decades ago, there was a cutter suction dredger named Meena Kerala to carry out emergency work. After it broke down, the government has been heavily dependant on private operators,” he claimed.

Mr. Pocker said the delay in dredging was one of the reasons for cargo vessels suffering frequent damage. “The existing wharf at the port is not even sufficient to accommodate two cargo ships. For any further development, its length will have to be increased from the present 200 metres to 400 metres,” he added.

Trade union leaders said the Beypore Port was yet to benefit from the Centre’s Sagarmala project, which was aimed to promote cargo movement through minor ports. They also claimed that the construction of a dedicated wharf for Lakshadweep Islands at the port had failed to take off owing to poor follow-up measures by the port authorities.

Committee convener N. Anilkumar and Indian National Trade Union’s port unit president A.E. Mathew were among those who spoke. They said local-level protests would be organised again to draw the attention of the authorities to the development needs of the port.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/5vcgnu/article31026773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-KI-PORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/better-facilities-sought-at-beypore-port/article31026774.ece

As many as 86 persons are under observation in Kozhikode district for suspected novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) as on Monday.

Surveillance has been strengthened in the wake of fresh cases being reported in Ernakulam and Pathanamthitta districts, District Medical Officer V. Jayasree told the media.

Those who have returned from infected countries are under observation. Even if they do not have any symptoms, they should voluntarily inform the Health Department. A designated mechanism has been put in place to take them to hospitals, Dr. Jayasree said.

Of the 86 persons under observation, six are at the isolation wards set up at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) and the Government General Hospital, Kozhikode. The rest have been home-quarantined.

One person who was under observation at MCH was discharged on Monday, while two others were admitted to the General Hospital. Body fluid samples of three new suspected patients have been sent for lab tests. The results of 41 body fluid samples tested so far have been negative, and those of another five are awaited.

298,2020/03/10,Tamiflu supplied to residents of bird flu infected regions,"Over 3,000 birds culled in Vengeri and Kodiyathur in Kozhikode

Tamiflu tablets are being distributed among residents of Vengeri in the Kozhikode Corporation and Kodiyathur grama panchayat where bird flu was reported recently.

District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao told the media here on Monday that over 3,000 domesticated birds in the two places had been culled since Sunday as a precautionary measure. The process is expected to continue for a few more days as around 7,000 such birds are present there.

As many as 25 rapid response teams are part of the operation, and there are separate teams for culling birds, transportation of carcasses and their eventual disposal. Entry of poultry vehicles has been banned within one-km radius of the infected areas and poultry shops had been closed within a 10-km radius, Mr. Rao said.

Meanwhile, it is learnt that some owners of pet birds in the infected areas are illegally selling them off to avoid culling. A few others are letting birds go out of cages ahead of visits by rapid response teams.

K. Nina Kumar, District Chief Veterinary Officer, said a few cases of bird deaths had been reported from Mavoor, and that samples had been sent for lab tests. Chickens were found dying due to summer stress or Marek’s disease. However, there are no fresh cases. On the source of infection at Vengeri and Kodiyathur, Mr. Kumar said migratory birds were suspected to be the cause.

“The State Chief Disease Investigation Officer is camping in the district. A team from the Avian Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Thiruvalla, is expected to visit the infected areas soon,” he added.

299,2020/03/10,Women’s Cell to probe 10 sexual assault cases,"Role of women police officers in independent investigations to be enhanced

On the latest directive from the State Police Chief (SPC), the Women’s Cell of the Kozhikode City Police has taken up investigation into 10 major criminal cases, including four rape charges and four sexual assault of children, registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

The cases were handed over to the Women’s Cell recently as part of efforts to enhance women officers’ participation in independent investigations into crimes against women. Earlier, the Supreme Court had issued a verdict directing SPCs to facilitate it.

Additional women police personnel from various stations too have been asked to join the cell to support investigations following a directive from District Police Chief (Kozhikode City) A.V. George. If required, statements of sexual assault victims will be recorded again by the cell.

“Within a few weeks, we will be able to submit charge-sheets in all the four POCSO cases handed over to us. There are a lot of procedural requirements to be completed in sexual assault cases, which usually affect quick submission of charge-sheets. Here, we will try to meet such requirements fast to ensure speedy trial,” said K.M. Leela, Circle Inspector, Kozhikode Women’s Cell. She also said that the charge-sheets in all the other six cases would be submitted at the earliest.

Of the 10 cases, two were registered under Section 498 (Punishment for enticing or taking away or detaining a married woman with criminal intent) of the Indian Penal Code. Though several such cases had already been reported within the limits of various city and rural police stations, two serious cases chosen by the District Police Chief were handed over to the Women’s Cell.

Ms. Leela said the cell was not actively involved in independent investigations into sexual assault cases as it mostly focused on welfare, counselling and rehabilitation activities for needy women under various government schemes. “We hope that the direct involvement of women officers in probing such serious cases, apart from field-level intervention programmes, will help many hapless women victims,” she added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/womens-cell-to-probe-10-sexual-assault-cases/article31026681.ece

Citing an example of women empowerment, Mr. Prakash pointed out to the role played by Liberian women in bringing peace to the then conflict stricken nation. He said that the women of Liberia launched the ‘Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace campaign’ in 2003.

They urged the government to hold peace talks with the rebels. The women were able to bring peace to their nation and this resulted in Ellen Johnson Sirleaf becoming Liberia’s first female President and Africa’s first democratically elected female head of State in 2006, he said.

301,2020/03/10,Drop in maize price,"Maize farmers are upset as traders have drastically reduced the price of maize from ₹2050 to ₹1,400 a quintal.

A. Moorthy, a farmer from Srivilliputtur Taluk, said he has got some 100 quintals of maize stuck with him at his home.

“We were selling the produce for ₹2050 a quintal which was fetching profitable but now traders have reduced the procurement price citing corona virus outbreak,” he said.

Traders claim that maize that was used as a poultry feed has not seen demand after the corona outbreak so that the price has come down.

“After the increase in price of fertilizers and other inputs and wages for manpower, we will end up in loss if we have to sell it for ₹1,400. The price drop has been reported in the last 15 days,” Mr. Moorthy said. Attempt to pledge the produce to get 70% of the price through Cooperative societies failed as they have got huge stock of paddy, he added.

District secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam V. Murugan said maize farmers incurred huge loss last year due to infection of fall armyworm.

While farmers demanded ₹25,000 compensation for every acre of crop loss, the government gave only ₹3000 an acre for rain-fed region and ₹5,400 an acre for those who had lift irrigation facility.

“If farmers faced loss due to fall armyworm last year, this year they are on the verge of another loss due to cut in price,” he said.

The State government should intervene and procure maize directly from farmers and ensure a minimum price of ₹2050 a quintal so that they do not face yet another loss, he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/drop-in-maize-price/article31033808.ece
302,2020/03/10,Remove garbage bins placed in front of schools: HC,"Court deprecates Rajapalayam Municipality’s decision

MADURAI

Deprecating the decision of Rajapalayam Municipality to place garbage bins in front of schools for non-payment of solid waste management user charges, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the civic body to remove them.

Hearing the petition filed by N.S. Ramaraj of Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district, a Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi observed that such practices should not be followed by civic bodies.

The petitioner sought a direction to forbear the municipality from placing garbage bins in front of schools in order to collect pending charges. Such steps had been initiated when there was a demand to maintain sanitation following the spread of COVID-19, he said.

The petitioner pointed out that some of the areas under the municipality lacked proper drainage facility, street lights and drinking water connections. Under such circumstances, levying of such charges was planned without application of mind.

He said that the decision of the municipality to place the garbage bins in front of schools came as a shock to the residents of Rajapalayam. The school students were affected by this move and the municipality was duty-bound to maintain sanitation, he said.

During the course of the hearing in the forenoon session, the court directed the authorities concerned to take immediate steps to remove the garbage bins placed near the school entrances. When the case was taken up for hearing again in the afternoon, the court was informed that the garbage bins were removed. Subsequently, the petition was closed.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/remove-garbage-bins-placed-in-front-of-schools-hc-madurai-rajapalayam/article31033791.ece

305,2020/03/10,Delimitation of wards criticised,"Objections pertaining to bifurcation of wards in the corporation came to fore when State Election Commissioner Palanisamy chaired a meeting here on Tuesday.

As political parties objected to bifurcation of all 55 wards in Tirunelveli Corporation, especially reduction of wards in Muslim-dominant Melapalayam from 10 to 8 even though population has increased substantially, those who participated in the review meeting held at the Collectorate resisted the move to enforce the officials’ decision.

The participants also criticised trifurcation of a ward in Kulavanigarpuram and annexing two portions with the far off Thatchanallur Zone. The annexure of Thimmarajapuram, which was under Palayamkottai Zone, with Thatchanallur zone was objected as residents of this area will have to travel for about 10 km to reach the zonal office.

Mr. Palanisamy, while addressing the meeting, said delimitation of wards was being done with the objective of simplifying the functioning of urban local body and taking development works to the public in seamless manner.

“Representations made in this meeting will be discussed with Collector and other officials concerned within two days following field visits. Moreover, petitioners will be invited for the discussion before taking the final decision,” he said.

He informed that rural local body elections in the 9 districts, where the delimitation work was yet to completed, would be conducted once the exercise was over.

307,2020/03/10,Stop power project work: fishermen,"They want to see environment clearance certificate issued by the authorities concerned

Fishermen from as many as 22 villages along the coast laid a siege at Morepannai, a fisher hamlet, here on Tuesday, demanding and end to all construction work on Uppur power project.

They expressed their displeasure over the attitude of officials after submitting a memorandum signed by fishermen and women to Collector on Monday.

They told reporters that they have assembled here to tell the government that it cannot harm natural resources under the guise of development projects. The power project is sure to harm marine life and there is enough threat to the environment.

The L&T has been carrying out construction work by laying a bridge along the sea for about 8 km. Fishermen and associations object to the work since the announcement came a few years ago.

While the government has been maintaining that there is no harm to the ecology due to the project being carried out at a cost of ₹ 12,655 crore, as apprehended by fishermen, villagers urged officials to show environment clearance certificates issued by the authorities concerned including Forest and Fisheries departments.

When the district administration tried to hold a conciliatory talk last year, it remained inconclusive as there was no consensus or promise to stall the work. Officials refused to divulge the documents.

In the event of non-disclosure of certificates, we will approach the court and seek justice, said V Kalidas, a villager, who was part of the agitation. “In a bid to silence us, the police are indulging in filing false cases against us. We are only asking for information. Non-cooperation of officials and stoic silence maintained by the district administration has only confirmed our suspicion and the local people are keen to intensify the stir,” they said

The stir was withdrawn after the police and revenue officials assured to give details in about 10 days, Mr. Kalidas said and added that when there was a court order banning sand mining in 13 districts, tonnes of sand (alluvial soil) was being dumped into the sea. Debris from old buildings too were brought here round the clock in lorries to lay the bridge work.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/stop-power-project-work-fishermen/article31033170.ece
308,2020/03/10,TNSTC workers begin protest,"TNSTC employees, affiliated to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) - State Transport, on Tuesday began a “waiting” protest outside the TNSTC office here on Madurai Road.

The protest was led by president of regional transport A. Sundararajan.

State president M. Vellaidurai said the State government had agreed to make budgetary allocation for the State Transport Corporations to meet the difference between the corporations’s income and expenditure in 2017. However, the government has not kept its promise in the last three years. Corporations have not paid various dues to employees’ account towards provident fund, gratuity and insurance. Besides, those how have retired between April 2019 and till date have not been given any of their retirement benefits like PF, gratuity, commutation and leave salary.

Services of reserve workers, who are paid daily wages and who have been working for the last four years, have not been regularised. “While their services should be confirmed if they work for a minimum of 240 days, services of these around 3000 workers have not been regularised even after they had worked for 1,200 days,” he said.

Bus operations in Virudhunagar district was partially hit as around 500 employees did not turn up for duty. “We are going to continue the protest till the government invited us for talks,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tnstc-workers-begin-protest/article31032999.ece

Collector T. G. Vinay said that a special camp for differently abled persons to receive aids under the Assistance to Disabled Persons for Purchase/Fitting of Aids and Appliances (ADIP) scheme will be held from March 15 to March 25 in different parts of the district.

The Collector said that members from Artificial Limbs Manufacturing Corporation of India's (ALIMCO) southern division will be taking note of various aids, including walking sticks, wheelchairs, spectacles and hearing aids and then have them manufactured to the recipients. Although the event was to be held on February 18 and then on March 12, the district administration said that the differently abled will be free to make their way and seek help starting March 15.

“We have also made it an integrated camp. Older people with disabilities can apply for pension, those looking to start businesses can look for loans. They can also get their overall health check up done here,” he said.

Member of Parliament from Madurai Su. Venkatesan who petitioned the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment regarding the conduct of the event, said that the event will be held in 11 places. The ‘mela’ for assistive instruments will largely benefit those from low-socio economic backgrounds who have not had the ability to purchase new instruments with better technology.

The mela will be held at Thiagarajar College, Teppakulam, on March 15; Corporation Marriage hall, Pamban road on March 16; Fatima College on March 17; Loyola Technical Institute on March 18; M. S. S.

310,2020/03/10,Vaigai North Bank Road at Sellur to become safer,"‘The wait is only for the curing time required for concrete structure’

Madurai

Vaigai North Bank Road near Sellur road overbridge (ROB) will become safer soon. For the extension of the North Bank Road along the ROB on the riverbed to provide direct link between Sellur and Kulamangalam Road, under construction by State Highways Department, will soon be thrown open for public usage.

A highway official said that the concrete layer for the road on the riverbed has been laid and the wait is only for the curing time required for concrete structure. “Once curing is over, we will lay the blacktop and the road would be thrown open for traffic, most probably by a month’s time,” he said.

The North Bank Road that was laid years back to prevent encroachment of the river served as a major arterial road to avoid the Goripalayam junction. However, when the ROB was subsequently constructed, the officials failed to provide service road on both sides as a result vehicles going to Kulamangalam Road had to cut across the road at the landing of the ROB on the Palam Station Road.

Besides causing congestion at the junction, it often led to accidents with vehicles making wrong crossing.

In 2018, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami laid the foundation stone for the extension of the Vaigai North Bank Road for some 400 metres so that vehicles could go directly to Kulamangalam Road from North Bank Road under the ROB.

The project at a cost of ₹3 crore involved construction of retaining wall inside the riverbed to provide a wider road for two-way traffic.

This road is expected to bring a big relief to the road users.

However, another road facility in the same area has remained under-utilised for nearly three years. Purtachi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Bridge across Vaigai river connecting Sellur with Thaikkal has remained a show-piece ever since it was opened in 2017 what with just very few vehicles, using it.

“Only autorickshaws and two-wheelers are using this bridge to commute between Thaikkal and Sellur. The traffic has always been very thin even during the peak hours,” said an autodriver, M. Gurunathan (45).

However, hardly 250 metres away from MGR Bridge, the Kalpalam connecting Palam Station Road with Yanaikkal has been facing severe congestion. This is because it has been the main thoroughfare connecting the northern and southern parts of the city.

“Vehicles from Periyar bus stand have to invariably take this bridge to go to (MGR Integrated Bus stand in) Mattuthavani and Anna Bus stand,” he added.

The city police have been planning to divert buses from Simmakkal through Thaikkal Road and MGR Bridge to reach Sellur.

“The plan has been there for nearly two years. However, a public toilet on the entrance of the road at Simmakkal poses hindrance, especially for the buses. Since, it is very close to the entrance, the buses would find it difficult to take a sharp turn,” a police officer said.

The city traffic police has sought the help of Madurai Corporation to demolish the toilet so that it could ease the traffic, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic), Sugumaran. At least 30% of the traffic on Kalpalam could be diverted through this road.

“Vehicles from Simmakkal can go to Goripalayam junction with ease as well as can take the Dindigul Road,” he added.

The Thaikkal Road, which is otherwise wide enough for a two-way traffic, has been plagued with haphazard parking of vehicles for some 300 metres. “This is because not much vehicular traffic is there. Once the road is opened for traffic, parking could be regulated,” the officer said.

If buses are diverted, it would ease the stress on Yanaikkal. The TNSTC would have no objection as there is no bus stop between Simmakkal and Goripalayam. “Hence, TNSTC would not face an revenue loss. Besides, it is also not very circuitous considering the existing traffic congestion on Kalpalam,” the officer said.

Madurai Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan, has promised to remove the hurdles for providing an easy passage for city vehicular traffic to put the road and the bridge to optimum usage, Mr. Sugumaran said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/v5pi2f/article31032553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA11CITY-VAIGAINORTHBANKROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/vaigai-north-bank-road-at-sellur-to-become-safer/article31032554.ece
311,2020/03/10,"Inspector, Head Constable booked","For criminal conspiracy and impersonation

The Sattur Town Police have booked three persons, including an Inspector Venkatachalapathy and woman head constable Ganapathy, for attempting to produce a man to impersonate his cousin, who was accused of drunken driving before a Judicial Magistrate Court here on Monday.

They said that the police booked Marisamy on the charge of riding a motorbike under the influence of alcohol during a vehicle check on Saturday night. Marisamy, who was employed with the Indian Army and came on vacation, was on his way to Sattur railway station for returning to duty when he was caught. Subsequently, he boarded the train and left Sattur.

When the drunken driving case was taken up by the Judicial Magistrate Court I on Monday, the Inspector and Head Constable produced Saravanan, Marisamy’s cousin, in his absence, before the court. When he signed the documents, the Magistrate noticed striking differences between signatures of Marisamy and Saravanan in the case documents.

After it was found that Saravanan was impersonating Marisamy, the Magistrate M. Shunmugavel Raja ordered booking of cases against all the three for criminal conspiracy and impersonation.

The police arrested Saravanan and produced him before the court on Tuesday. The Magistrate released him on personal bail.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/inspector-head-constable-booked/article31032509.ece
312,2020/03/10,‘Parents must remember they are examples to their children’,"MADURAI

“It is essential for parents to remember that they will remain examples to their young children for generations. We must teach, monitor and listen to them,” said Secretary, Indian Association of Lawyers, K. Samidurai.

He was speaking on the importance of parents spending quality time with children at an inter-school meeting organised by M. S. Chellamuthu Trust and Corporation as part of their Happy Schooling programme here on Tuesday.

The initiative aims to ensure better emotional well-being among students of Corporation schools. Parents from different schools gathered to become stakeholders in the process of better mental health for students.

Mr. Samidurai told parents that it is both essential to educate students about assault and ensure that they are empowered enough to use the justice system.

The lawyer also highlighted different acts applicable for young children including the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

Executive Director of M. S. Chellamuthu Trust R. Rajkumari said that aim of the meeting was to induct parents into the process of bettering the mental health of students.

“Do not reject the ideas that children bring to you. Try to constructively take part and teach them the pathway to success. It is also essential to make sure that bravery and ability to express themselves is instilled in them,” she said.

Founder, M. S. Chellamuthu Trust, C. Ramasubramanian, said that there is a change in perception of students studying in Corporation schools due to illustrious alumni and support from multinational companies for implementing innovative programmes. With teachers and parents helping students through agony and mental trauma, it is possible to ensure that students too can be successful and happy, he said.

Corporation’s Education Officer P. Vijaya said that in a world where there is little time to interact with families, parents must try to arm themselves with kindness and help their children share. This is the only way towards growth, she said.

Project Head, ‘Happy Schooling’, S. Selvamani, said that parents will be invited for more such events to get a glimpse into the lives of their children.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tkhgdf/article31032503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA11CITY-HAPPY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/parents-must-remember-they-are-examples-to-their-children/article31032504.ece

314,2020/03/10,Meet reviews steps taken to check COVID–19,"Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, who chaired a meeting here on Tuesday to review precautionary measures taken so far in the wake of COVID–19 cases reported in a few parts of the country, has urged officials and the public to ensure personal hygiene.

Addressing a meeting of representatives from various fields who are constantly in touch with the public everyday, she said everyone should wash their hands with soaps at regular intervals in their workplace and on returning home as it would effectively kill the infection, if any. Those who have to travel in buses or trains to reach their workplaces or returning home should be doubly cautious by wearing masks and cleaning hands on reaching their destinations.

Bus operators should clean their buses properly, especially seats, handrails and other places with disinfectants to check infection, if any, in vehicles. Autorickshaw drivers should follow similar procedure to keep their vehicles virus-free. If a commuter is found to be suffering from cough and cold, the procedure should be followed by the driver without fail so that the possible infection to other passengers through the vehicle could be avoided.

Theatre owners should ensure cleaning of every seat with disinfectant after end of every show. Private hospitals, while handling patients suffering from cold, cough, fever and consequent breathing troubles should be doubly cautious and samples collected from them for analysis should be destroyed as per the procedure.

While asking the public to go to government hospitals in case of any symptom, warned owners of pharmacies not to give drugs to buyers without proper prescription given by qualified physician. “If you do so, it will lead to cancellation of licence and registration of cases under appropriate Sections,” she said.

She appealed to the public not to go to places where the people would gather in large number until normalcy returns everywhere and urged them to voluntarily remain in isolation in their home itself if they were suffering from cough, cold, fever and breathing problems until they get cured completely by getting proper medical advice.

Ms. Shilpa asked the heads of educational institutions to identify students suffering from any of these symptoms and guide them to get proper assistance and appropriate line of treatment from doctors of government hospitals, where isolation wards have been created.

She said there was no need for panic as no case has been reported in the district so far and personal hygiene and precautionary measures taken by every individual would effectively play a role in checking the infection.

Dean, Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital Ravichandran, Deputy Director of Public Health Varadharajan, City Health Officer Sathish Kumar, hoteliers, representatives from educational institutions, private bus owners’ association, private hospitals, traders’ associations and cinema halls, office-bearers of taxi and autorickshaw drivers’ associations, senior officials from the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation and State Express Transport Corporation and senior officials from various government departments participated.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/meet-reviews-steps-taken-to-check-covid19/article31032360.ece

Representatives from the All India Agricultural Workers Union (AIAWU) and farmers petitioned District Collector T. G. Vinay, seeking the increase in the total number of days under the scheme from 100 to 200.

Association district president V. Uma Maheshwaran said that the district administration was not fulfilling its basic duty of providing employment for those who possessed job identity cards.

“The aim of the project is to ensure that people who cannot eat a single meal get the opportunity to earn a day’s wage. Despite several people having job cards, they are not being called for work. Old people are struggling for their basic survival. This needs to change,” he said.

Association State secretary Vasantha Mani said the public must be hired to desilt tanks again as it would increase the number of jobs available under the scheme. “Why make the Public Works Department (PWD) contract other labourers?” she asked.

One of the roads that has been in most urgent need of repairs is Ettines Road. A quarter mile stretch of the road is being re-laid.

“Apart from the road being re-laid, interlock bricks have also been laid at the ATC Junction to ensure that water does not stagnate along the stretch during the monsoon,” said an official from the Udhagamandalam Municipality.

Local residents called on the municipality to ensure that the work is completed quickly as traffic along the road is coming to a grinding halt during peak traffic hours. R. Ramani, a resident of Elk Hill, said the municipality should also ensure that repair works were conducted along the rest of the stretch of road, as manhole covers along the road had sunken into the road.

“As they have sunken into the road, they have become very dangerous potholes, posing risk for two-wheeler riders in particular,” he said.

The residents have also called for road repairs to be done along the road leading from Elk Hill to the Government Rose Garden before the summer festival season begins in May.

Davidson Devasirvatham.

Inaugurating a canteen, a shelter for visitors and another for police personnel on the City Police Office premises here on Monday, he said the facilities were part of a series of police welfare activities. These facilities had come up in a better way thanks to generous sponsorship from traders.

The vacant space on the CPO premises that was in a shabby condition had been put to good use with the construction of the new facilities which would benefit people coming to give complaints.

Police officials would visit the members of the public at the shelter instead of making them wait for hours together outside their chambers. “As the officials arrive at the CPO, they can meet the people with grievances on the ground floor and dispose of their petitions in the morning itself. This will spare the people of an endless wait at the CPO,” he said.

The canteen would sell beverages, snacks and food at a nominal price. With lot of devotees coming to the Mariamman Temple at Armed Reserve Ground, the city police with the help of sponsors was constructing toilets for men and women, he said.

319,2020/03/10,High Court quashes proceedings initiated after 36 years,"Deploring the fact that proceedings under Revenue Recovery Act was initiated against a widow for a ‘notional loss’ suffered by the State way back in 1982, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court quashed the proceedings.

The court was hearing the petition filed in 2018 by M. Rajathi of Madurai who challenged the order of the Divisional Excise Officer, Tirumangalam, Madurai district, to initiate proceedings under the Revenue Recovery Act against her.

In 1982, an impersonator in the name of her husband, S.A. Maharajan, had participated in an auction conducted for an arrack shop in Tirumangalam. The impersonator offered the highest bid of ₹45,180 and as a pre-condition had to remit 15 days kist.

The impersonator failed to pay the amount and a re-auction was conducted. The shop fetched ₹30,105. Now, the department is demanding the petitioner to pay ₹ 1,80,900 - 12 times the difference in the auction price of ₹ 15,075. The recovery was initiated after 36 years.

Taking into account the submission that the authorities were also aware of the fact that an impersonator in the name of the petitioner’s husband had participated in the auction, Justice C.V. Karthikeyan observed that the case reflected the retrograde bureaucratic approach of the government officials.

“The court can only express its dismay at the strange ways in which the wheels of government departments, particularly the Revenue Department, works,” the judge said and added that he failed to comprehend whether there was any application of mind before the proceedings were initiated.

The court was dismayed over the fact that the proceedings were initiated not for the actual loss, but the notional loss, said to have been suffered by the government. Also, there was no explanation as to why no steps were taken in this regard for 36 years.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cd875y/article31029391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MACITY-BENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-quashes-proceedings-initiated-after-36-years/article31029392.ece

321,2020/03/10,Train cancellation violated Railway Board’s policy: Activists,"They say Railways cannot cancel existing train without following due process

Cancellation of the existing Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru Express by the Railway Board, at the instance of Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (KRCL), is a gross violation of the Board’s own policy, argue rail activists.

The Board, while announcing a new overnight, dedicated express between Bengaluru (Yeshwantpur) and Karwar, ordered the cancellation of Trains 16513/14 (via Kunigal) and 16523/24 (via Mysuru) that were operated combined with the Bengaluru-Kannur-Bengaluru Express with effect from March 8.

West Coast Rail Yatri Abhivriddhi Samiti adviser Anil Hegde said as per the May 26, 2005 policy brought out by the Railway Board, several steps have to be taken before cancelling an existing train and an abrupt cancellation is not possible.

“Railways cannot assume that the existing trains will lose patronage upon the introduction of the new, dedicated train,” he said, adding that Railways should have operated the existing services at least for six months before cancelling either of the two trains on the basis of poor patronage.

As per the policy, a train may be cancelled for two reasons — if the patronage was less than 30% for a year or that an alternative service was available.

An elaborate procedure too has to be followed before cancellation. A committee of senior officers in a railway zone may shortlist trains to be cancelled primarily maintained in that zone and refer the same to the opinion of Divisional Railway Users’ Consultative Committees and Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative Committees for their views.

A final report has to be submitted to the General Manager of the zone, who then would recommend the cancellation to the Board, Mr. Hegde said.

In cancelling Bengaluru-Karwar-Bengaluru trains, the Railways did not follow any of these procedure. KRCL was not the primary zone where the trains were operated, but it was South Western Railway (SWR). Neither KRCL nor SWR held meetings with users’ committees. SWR did not recommend cancellation of the trains, he pointed out.

SWR General Manager A.K. Singh told The Hindu the zone had not recommended cancellation of the train. He said during the recent Inter Railway Timetable Committee meeting at Bengaluru, KRCL had expressed constraints, which the board might have considered.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/eycic7/article31034390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGBENGALURU-KARWARTRAIN16513EXPRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/train-cancellation-violated-railway-boards-policy-activists/article31034392.ece
322,2020/03/10,Give jobs for persons with disabilities: DC,"‘It will help them have independent life’

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said on Tuesday that people should provide job opportunities for persons with disabilities instead of showing sympathy.

He was speaking at a workshop organised by the district administration, the District Small Industries’ Association, the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities, and other organisations at the DSIA auditorium, here.

Mr. Jagadeesha said people with disabilities had confidence and performed their duty with devotion.

“It is essential that they be given jobs so that they can lead their lives independently and with self respect. The district administration would provide all help and cooperation in this regard. Society too should support the persons with disabilities,” he said.

Already camps had been in held in all seven taluks in the district and over 100 persons with disabilities had been registered so that they could be provided employment. The industrialists and businessmen should employ persons with disabilities in their firms, he said.

If the person with disability required any skill-based training to get jobs in the firms, the district administration will provide them such training through the District Skill Development Training Centre, he said.

The administration was planning to hold separate Udyog melas people with disabilities in the coming days, Mr. Jagadeesha said.

I.R. Fernandes, president of District Small Industries’ Association, presided over the function.

324,2020/03/10,Udupi farmers take the initiativeto produce and market neera,"They have formed the Udupi Kalprasa Coconut and All Spices Producer Company

Farmers in Udupi district have formed the Udupi Kalprasa Coconut and All Spices Producer Company and plan to start production of neera in a couple of months to add to their income.

Neera is a sweet sap extracted from the inflorescence of coconut palms. It is a non-alcoholic thirst quencher, high in nutritional value.

As a precursor to the company, the farmers had formed 54 coconuts societies under three coconut federations in Kundapur, Karkala and Udupi taluks in the district. As many as 4,820 farmers are members of the three federations and have 3.88 lakh healthy coconut trees with them.

“Of the 3.88 lakh coconut trees, our company plans to tap 38,560 coconut trees (of the 4,820 farmers) to extract nectar approximately at the rate of eight coconut trees per farmer in the next five years,” said Satyanarayana Udupa, farmer and chairman of the company.

The tapping of neera can be done by either the farmers or by tappers appointed by the company. If farmers take up tapping, they have to spend two-and-half-hours in the morning and two hours in the evening.

“If the tappers do it, then they will get ₹ 30 per litre of neera extracted. The ₹ 30 will include their insurance charges, while the farmers will get ₹ 20 per litre. A coconut tree is expected to give approximately two litres of neera daily,” he said.

The coconut tree could be tapped for about 350 days. The company has taken technical help from the CPCRI, Kasaragod, Kerala, for the icebox to collect the neera. The company will construct a small building within a couple of months for collecting, storing and marketing neera.

Guruprasad, Assistant Director of Horticulture, said that the department had already given its consent letter to the company which had been forwarded to the Excise Department for giving in-principle licence.

“After the nod from the Excise Department, the company will have to work as per the guidelines of the District Neera Committee. Since it is a non-alcoholic beverage, a cold-storage chain will have to be maintained from its collection to its sale,” he said.

In the second phase, the company will expand and a bigger building will be constructed by November, and then produce items such as neera sugar, neera honey, neera chocolate and neera vinegar. “Our total project is estimated at about ₹ 4.5 crore,” Mr. Udupa said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ppjhy8/article31027101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10MNUDUPINEERA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/udupi-farmers-take-the-initiativeto-produce-and-market-neera/article31027102.ece

State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) have reduced the prices of sensitive petroleum products such as petrol and diesel by 30 paise and 25 paise a litre respectively across major cities as the price of international crude oil fell.

The sixth consecutive cut in petrol and diesel prices comes after the OMCs reduced the price of petrol and diesel prices by quarter of a rupee on Monday and are likely to maintain the declining trend this week.

327,2020/03/10,"Yes Bank customers can pay credit bill, loan repayments through other bank accounts","The bank has now said that its ATMs are fully up now and customers can withdraw the stipulated amount from other banks’ ATMs as well

Crisis-hit Yes Bank said on Tuesday that customers could now make payments towards their credit card and loans through other bank accounts, days after prominent banking services were curtailed after the RBI imposed moratorium on the lender.

The announcement comes as panic gripped the bank’s customers, who queued before ATMs and bank branches to withdraw money. They were also not even able to access Internet banking and other services like digital payments through another party’s platform. Forex services and credit card purchases, among others, were also impacted.

“Inward IMPS/NEFT services have now been enabled,” Yes Bank tweeted. “You can make payments towards YES Bank credit card dues and loan obligations from other bank accounts. Thank you for your co-operation.”

The Reserve Bank of India had put a moratorium last Thursday on the cash-strapped Yes Bank, imposed withdrawal restriction of ₹50,000 only till April 3 and superseded its board through appointment of an administrator.

328,2020/03/10,AGR dues: full evaluation to take 6 months,"The government, last week, had asked Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies to pay remaining AGR dues as per the SC order

A full evaluation of the self-assessment done by telcos’ for AGR dues could take at least six months, given the multiple years and numerous documents that have to be checked, according to a telecom department source.

The government, last week, had asked Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies to pay remaining AGR dues as per the SC order.

A senior telecom department official said that a complete evaluation of the self-assessment done by telecom companies for their AGR dues could take six months as it will require checking scores of documents spread over multiple years.

“Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has done a detailed audit for the years 2006-07 to 2014-15...Overall, DoT’s complete evaluation of the self assessment by telecom companies will take six months,” the official said.

In all, 16 entities had owed the government Rs 1.47 lakh crore in AGR liabilities — Rs 92,642 crore in licence fee and another Rs 55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges. Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and Vodafone Idea accounted for about 60 per cent.

These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The Supreme Court last month rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for extension in the payment schedule and asked companies to deposit their past dues for spectrum and licences.

Since the February 14 tongue lashing that the Supreme Court gave telecom companies for missing its previous deadline of January 23 to pay past dues as well as the DoT for failing to enforce it, firms and the telecom ministry had been doing separate maths on the actual dues.

Beleaguered Vodafone Idea Ltd, on March 6, pegged its total dues to the government at Rs 21,533 crore — less than half of what the telecom department has estimated, even as the Vodafone CEO indicated keenness to make a “new, good beginning” in India. The company has so far paid Rs 3,500 crore out of the “self-assessed” liability of Rs 21,533 crore, while the Department of Telecommunications estimated its dues to be over Rs 53,000 crore.

On a similar self-assessment pattern, Bharti Airtel paid Rs 13,004 crore to the government in two installments. It had also deposited an additional Rs 5,000 crore as an ad-hoc payment to cover any reconciliation differences. Still, its payment is far less than over Rs 35,000 crore that the government estimates the company owes it.

Similarly, Tata Teleservices has paid Rs 2,197 crore in AGR dues, and more recently additional Rs 2,000 crore to cover reconciliation differences, while the DoT estimates the liabilities to be about Rs 14,000 crore.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/agr-dues-full-evaluation-to-take-6-months/article31026583.ece

330,2020/03/10,"Haiti, a land crippled by chaos","While the long-suffering nation needs a democratic renewal, others must respect its sovereignty

Last week, Haiti’s embattled President Jovenel Moise appointed Joseph Jouthe as Prime Minister, the third in less than a year, disregarding opposition calls and popular protests demanding his own resignation. A former agricultural entrepreneur, the President has refused to hold legislative elections, due last October. This sparked a violent unrest which has resulted in the deaths of at least 40 people. Mr. Moise is trying to alter the Constitution to enable any piece of legislation to become law if parliament does not approve or reject it within a stipulated time frame. This proposal has raised many eyebrows. His predecessor had delayed the 2015 parliamentary elections for some months. When the polls were finally conducted, they were riddled with serious irregularities.

A history of tragedies

The current political paralysis in Port-au-Prince predates the devastating 2010 earthquake that left about 2,00,000 people dead and displaced millions. The period after the three-decade-long dictatorship of François Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude Duvalier, which ended in 1986, was marked by military coups and short-lived democratic rule. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest with left-wing leanings, was deposed first in 1991 and then in 2004.

The role of the UN Stabilisation Mission deployed in the following months, with heavy U.S. influence, has been derided by critics as championing “investor rights, not human rights.” A survey in a 2006 edition of The Lancet found that 8,000 people were murdered and 35,000 women victimised in the greater Port-au-Prince area after the exit of Mr. Aristide. Crucially, the perpetrators were political actors and UN soldiers.

The UN Mission, which was scaled down in 2017, continues to attract controversy. Another study in December 2019, by a website called ‘Conversation’, disclosed further evidence of several peacekeepers sexually assaulting minor girls, leaving them destitute and with children. In the wake of the 2010 earthquake, many UN bases were accused of discharging sewage into the tributary of Haiti’s main river, triggering the outbreak of a cholera epidemic, which killed over 10,000 people.

The Mission was also criticised for standing by when a former president in 2011, Rene Preval, sought to impose a U.S.-backed successor. Mr. Moise’s own election in 2016 was mired in controversy, when the turnout was only 18%. Within months of taking office, Mr. Moise fired the head of the Central Financial Intelligence Unit. That decision is said to have influenced the move to clear his own name in a money laundering case.

Outrage and betrayal

In October 2017, Haiti’s Senate report found that billions of dollars were misappropriated from the Petrocaribe oil programme, intended for education and infrastructure development. This was corroborated last year by the country’s court of auditors, which also implicated a firm managed by Mr. Moise. Part of a regional initiative by then Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, Petrocaribe allowed Haiti to buy oil at 60% of the price and the remainder to be settled in deferred payments over 25 years. The slump in global oil prices brought to an end the Petrocaribe programme, as also the government’s fuel subsidies. The decision was eventually reversed, but only after the resignation of then Prime Minister Jean-Henry Ceant and violent protests across Haiti. The embezzlement of large sums has deepened the sense of outrage and betrayal among ordinary Haitians and loss of credibility among international aid agencies.

Haiti is Latin America’s first country that won independence in 1804. But millions of dollars paid in French reparations over the next 100 years, U.S. occupation early last century, the Duvalier dictatorship, and continuing misrule have crippled the economy. More than half the population lives below the poverty line. One of the world’s poorest nations, Haiti’s people have borne the brunt of some of the worst natural disasters in recent times. While the country needs a democratic renewal, others must respect Haiti’s sovereignty.

331,2020/03/10,A health scheme sans clout,"The PMJAY remains restricted in budget, capability and scope

Mainstreaming transformative technologies in the healthcare ecosystem and boosting innovation in delivery are a major focus under the Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB-PMJAY) — with the three intentions of containing costs, improving care quality, and bridging existing gaps in service provision. A 15th Finance Commission report estimated that total costs for AB-PMJAY in 2019, taking then levels of hospitalisation rates and expenditure and assuming full coverage, would range between ₹28,000 crore and ₹74,000 crore, with projections for 2023 being more than double this range. Certainly, the unremitting sluggishness of India’s public health spending and the massive funding requirements of AB-PMJAY warrant innovative solutions so that the lofty commitments can be met.

With this in view, the National Health Authority, the implementing body of AB-PMJAY, set up an “innovation unit” last year to promote indigenous cost-effective technologies. However, the current discourse on innovation in healthcare seems to be missing out on two fronts: first, the very nature of the proposed innovations; and, second, the piecemeal adoption being envisaged.

Range of solutions

While healthcare technology start-ups showcase an impressive range of solutions, not all of them can promise substantial system-level impact in terms of aspects like cost control. Second, a discourse on innovation revolving around items like telemedicine and drone technology disregards other simpler, fundamental, but highly impactful items, like operational processes and business models.

Multiple sporadic but successful precedents of such healthcare innovations already exist in India. These include, for example, thorough standardisation of hospital procedures. These are founded on evidence-based protocols that also permit other cost-saving innovations such as task-shifting, high-volume procedures, and reduction in complications. Standardisation of cataract surgeries in Aravind Eye Hospital is an example.

Reducing costs through robust procurement systems for supplies; cost minimising-substitutions like using generic medicines; and work-profile alteration of existing human resources are other possible avenues of bringing innovation without adversely affecting quality. For example, in the case of certain services, quality of care can be maintained by using physician assistants rather than doctors. These are not only pertinent to AB-PMJAY but would also be instrumental in achieving cost control. Further, the reimbursement mode (package rates) for healthcare providers under AB-PMJAY can allow for pushing such innovations through strategic design of payment components and the accompanying incentive-disincentive structures. The question arising then is: what stands in the way of mainstreaming such basic yet impactful innovations?

Large-scale adoption of innovations

While creating a smooth interface between healthcare technology start-ups and hospitals can aid in easy diffusion of solutions, it won’t guarantee a widespread uptake. In the absence of substantial and streamlined incentives for providers, adoption of innovations would largely be erratic, piecemeal, and incomplete. Large-scale adoption will thus require sufficient demand generation. AB-PMJAY, however, remains restricted in this capability, especially with regard to such things as business-model innovations.

A foremost reason for this is that AB-PMJAY, despite having an apparently formidable beneficiary base, still has a small share in the overall scenario of inpatient care provision. This is due to low empanelment of hospitals; a general reluctance of private providers towards dispensing AB-PMJAY benefits; and limited contribution of AB-PMJAY to the overall business of hospitals.

Not being a major payer of private inpatient care reduces its leverage with the hospital system. While talks of expanding the beneficiary base under AB-PMJAY to approach universalisation have been afloat, budgetary allocation trends render it a pious hope. Government health insurance schemes have traditionally been characterised by limited coverage of targeted population and low utilisation rates and claims ratios, owing to such factors as low awareness and bureaucratic barriers. Further, the perennially sluggish and ineffectual healthcare regulatory framework in India is likely to pose another impediment.

This doesn’t mean that cost-effective healthcare innovations cannot be pushed via AB-PMJAY. However, the kind of innovations and their consequence, and the extent and depth of their incorporation, will largely depend on the clout of AB-PMJAY in healthcare provision. This highlights how AB-PMJAY still has a long way to go in terms of becoming the central player in Indian healthcare.

332,2020/03/10,"Beneath the ‘Yes mess’, some stark truths","There is a pattern in the failure of promoter-driven entities that needs to be halted by regulators

The collapse of Yes Bank is the tale of a promoter who ran amok, treating a publicly listed bank as his private company. The sordid saga of the bank, launched in 2004, and its meteoric rise and fall, can be attributed to its founder and former Managing Director Rana Kapoor. The bank’s story is similar to many recent stories of large listed companies that went bust, companies that were treated like family firms by their promoters, companies that were household names. But what is astonishing in the case of Yes Bank is that though there were laws and regulations to abide by, like the Companies Act and those stipulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the bank had another layer of compliance requirements under the oversight of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which has its own set of strict guidelines. It failed in spite of all these.

‘Independent director’ fallacy

There is a pattern in the failure of such promoter-run firms. Yes Bank is no exception. Listed companies are run by Boards. There is a CEO and Managing Director who runs the company but is answerable to the Board. But the Board of Directors is perfunctory. Therein lies the rub. The Board has ‘independent directors’ not just because it is a statutory requirement, but also because this adds prestige to the company and the promoter. Usually, retired top-level bureaucrats, former public sector heads, former diplomats and former Generals are given such positions, adding heft. This also opens, for the company and the promoter, doors to the government, where most licences and files are still cleared depending on who you know in the corridors of power. These independent directors rarely perform their function of questioning the decisions of the CEO, upholding probity, and protecting the minority shareholders’ rights. Nor are they expected to do so by the promoter or the controlling shareholders who appoint them. However, the moment these ‘independent directors’ raise concerns on any seeming impropriety, they are shown the door.

Data | The Yes Bank crisis explained in six charts

When instances emerge of family-controlled or promoter-run businesses dipping into the company coffers at will, to transfer funds to other companies where the promoters have stakes, even the minority institutional shareholders and the public who hold stock often do not complain — as long as they get attractive returns on their stock. On the contrary, the common shareholders treat such transgressions by the promoters approvingly — they consider the promoters ‘smart’ enough to have used some of these proceeds to have bottlenecks removed. All this is tacit understanding.

The public and institutions — be it private hedge funds and mutual funds, pension funds or government insurance companies who invest in stocks — instinctively identify the promoters who have these attributes and excel in bending the rules to their advantage. Such promoters are, in fact, looked up to as ‘dashing entrepreneurs’. They are lionised by media houses and bestowed awards and honours in annual jamborees by Ministers from parties in power. Some of those diverted funds can also end up in the private pockets of promoters. All impropriety on the parts of these buccaneering promoters and CEOs is forgiven by the public, the banks and authorities most of the times.

This is as long as the loans are ostensibly paid, serviced or evergreened, statutory dues are cleared, the company prospers and share prices zoom. It is all hunky-dory and everyone is happy till the cookies crumble. And they often do. And then all hell breaks loose. People lose jobs, customers lose their deposits, vendors don’t pay in turn, ancillary businesses downstream collapse or turn sick, livelihoods are destroyed, assets and machinery lay waste and the ripple effect also grinds other concomitant good businesses to a halt as the cycle of debtors and creditors freeze. The promoter is arrested, the Opposition trains its guns on the ruling party, and the ruling party counter attacks and says it inherited the problems from the Opposition which gave the licence or sanctioned the loans in the first place during its reign. And the media screams its head off.

Amidst all this din, the real malaise in the system that is causing these repetitive disasters, which will in all likelihood repeat itself, is overlooked. There’s always a tendency and temptation to treat the symptoms instead of the disease.

The market regulators, the RBI and other statutory authorities must now introspect and ask themselves some hard questions. One, should promoters, many of whom have been in the past found responsible for misdemeanours and have compromised the interests of minority shareholders, continue to appoint independent directors? Here, it needs to be pointed out that it is the boards that are responsible to the shareholders and also ultimately accountable to the statutory authorities. Can the directors be expected to remain truly ‘independent’ while serving at the discretion and pleasure of the promoter-CEO? Two, should the authorities overlook violations by promoters when they are successful and deified in the media because of their wealth and power? You cannot have one set of rules when companies have a bull run and another set when they are floundering.

Improving regulatory checks

Corporate transgressions happen in the West too but the regulators do not spare the promoter, howsoever iconic they may be. Elon Musk was recently punished and asked to step down as Tesla Chairman by the U.S.’s Securities and Exchange Commission and penalised for issues related to insider trading. And many others, whether Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, have often been reined in, investigated and heavily fined. Can India learn from these and improve regulatory checks and balances without snuffing out the ‘animal spirits’ of entrepreneurs?

And, finally, how do we get politicians and bureaucrats to stop influencing and interfering with lenders and banks? There has existed, for decades, a cozy nexus between such officials and big family-promoted businesses.

There are probably one or two more lessons to be learnt from this episode. One, regulators should not punish the company for the sins of its promoters. All efforts must be made to save companies and jobs, as is being attempted with Yes Bank. Two, similar rescue plans must be put in place with other companies, not just banks, because they are politically sensitive. The devastation to the economy and impact on individual lives and collateral damage is as severe when large companies like Kingfisher Airlines, Jet Airways, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, or Reliance Communications fold up.

The failure of Yes Bank also has lessons for those at the helm of affairs. It is never late to bring about the needed reforms to strengthen the autonomy of various regulatory institutions. This needs to be carried out now.

333,2020/03/10,A new voice in a crowded space,"Instead of chasing electoral glory, the Bhim Army would do well to bring about social change and Dalit empowerment

Having sprung into the limelight with its confrontational ways of activism, the Bhim Army, a Dalit outfit based in western Uttar Pradesh, has decided to plunge into formal politics. The contours of its plan are not yet clear, but the outfit is expected to make an official announcement at a rally on March 15. Some leaders who were formerly with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are also billed to join the Bhim Army’s political formation.

Read: Comment | Mayawati’s blurred political vision

An alternative voice

With an already packed Opposition field in U.P., and with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dominating the political landscape, the Bhim Army would serve itself well to not harbour unrealistic ambitions. However, what’s undeniable is that its activism coincides with the failure of the mainstream parties — in particular, the BSP — in espousing the Dalit cause in the last few years.

BSP chief Mayawati’s appeasement of upper castes, reluctance to take up cases of Dalit atrocities, and alleged dilution of the reservation policy have all left the educated Dalit youth frustrated. In recent times, the biggest shortcomings of the BSP have been Ms. Mayawati’s obsolete communication methods and reluctance in re-organising her party in sync with the changing aspirations of the youth. Unlike other parties, the BSP does not have a student or youth wing and its over-reliance on the personality and caste credentials of its leader has led to a stagnation of the larger Bahujan movement (of Other Backward Classes and Dalits) started by her mentor, Kanshi Ram.

Following the 2014 general election, in which the BSP won no seats and the BJP emerged with a brute majority, it was natural that Dalit politics would see a churn. In 2017, Bhim Army leader Chandrashekhar Azad, a lawyer by education, was propelled into the spotlight as a local Dalit hero during the Dalit-Thakur clashes in Saharanpur. With the Bhim Army not shying away from taking on the dominant castes, a new voice claiming to fight for the dignity and security of Dalits emerged.

With its limited means, the outfit has no doubt caught the imagination of the Dalit youth. It has provided them with an alternative voice and mobilised them to fight for their constitutional rights on the streets. Mr. Azad’s confrontational approach and masculine flamboyance stand in contrast to the calculated and now restrained approach of Ms. Mayawati. Her decreasing public appearances and disconnect from ground conditions are stark today in the face of a sustained outreach by the RSS-BJP among Dalits, as well as the unrelenting phenomenon of caste-based violence, exploitation and subjugation. With the BSP’s electoral fortunes steadily declining since 2012 and Ms. Mayawati promoting her dynasty as the second line of leadership, a voice for an alternative was bound to emerge sooner or later.

Not a direct contender

But beyond the romanticism associated with Mr. Azad, does the Bhim Army have enough substance and depth to grow as a mainstream political voice, let alone transform itself into a political party to be taken seriously?

Time and again, Ms. Mayawati has revealed her insecurity about the Bhim Army by labelling it as a BJP proxy that is out to mislead Dalits and cut into her vote base to help her opponents. This insecurity is rooted in the fact that the Bhim Army’s support base and the BSP’s support base overlap. In real terms, this means that the Bhim Army would rely heavily on the support of the Jatavs, who are also the BSP’s core, to grow.

Beyond this similarity, however, it would be over-ambitious to pitch Mr. Azad as a direct political alternative to Ms. Mayawati, at least at this stage. Despite the BSP’s downslide and limitations, Ms. Mayawati still commands relevance in U.P. politics, more so among members of her community. The 2022 Assembly election offers her a chance to redeem her performance. Besides, with many Dalit leaders from the BSP already shifting to the Samajwadi Party, SP president Akhilesh Yadav would also likely project himself as the best bet for their interests in 2022.

Dalit thinkers in U.P. are divided over the Bhim Army’s growth. While some welcome it as a parallel socio-politico force that could work for the political empowerment of Dalits, others are more critical of the outfit’s aggressive approach and believe that competing with Ms. Mayawati would lead to further fragmentation of the Dalit voice, and possibly vote. But what’s common between these two groups is that they don’t pitch Mr. Azad as a serious electoral entity at this stage, his appeal notwithstanding. Therefore, a realistic goal for the Bhim Army would be to fill in the social vacuum left by the BSP without a hasty entry into the electoral game.

Challenges and constraints

The Bhim Army has many challenges and constraints. First, it does not have enough muscle to weather likely administrative action from the Yogi Adityanath government (Mr. Azad was jailed for a year under the National Security Act by the U.P. government for allegedly inciting violence). Second, it lacks a proper structure, resources, a pan-U.P. presence, and a solid network. This is its third challenge. The Bhim Army started out flaunting its caste identity through ‘The Great Chamar’ signboards. However, in the long run, this confrontational style maybe unsustainable or even counter-productive. Fourth, in the last few years, Ms. Mayawati has struggled to fill the gap between the Jatavs and the non-Jatav Dalits, deepened and exploited by the BJP through its clever caste engineering, promotion of caste icons, distribution of positions, and the appeal of Hindutva nationalism. The same burden would have to be borne by Mr. Azad.

So far, the Bhim Army has raised its voice over stray incidents of atrocities and organised some dharnas. It lacks a clear ideological plank and the intellectual guidance that the BSP enjoys. Rather than chasing short-term electoral glory in 2022 and running the risk of being consumed by mainstream parties, it would do well to set itself long-term goals of social change and empowerment of the Dalits, and draw linkages between the OBC and the SC communities. Its presence on the ground could play a small role in acting as a counterforce to the steady saffronisation of Dalit communities, especially in western U.P., a communally sensitive area.

334,2020/03/10,Oil’s rout: on fall in prices,"The fall in prices may bring cheer, but India will have to deal with a global slowdown

Global markets, already teetering from the impact of the coronavirus, received a jolt over the weekend as Saudi Arabia cut oil prices and declared its intention to increase output well beyond what the oil market can absorb currently. The Saudi reaction followed the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel and Russia, the largest non-OPEC producer, failing to reach an agreement to deepen existing production cuts to cope with the falling demand. Oil prices crashed overnight by almost a third to $31 a barrel consequent to the kingdom slashing prices and announcing its intent to increase output. The oil market is now set to witness the rare conjunction of a demand and a supply shock which is bad news for prices. Fears of a fall in demand following the outbreak of COVID-19 had already depressed oil prices in the last couple of weeks. China, a major importer, has cut its imports by a third from Saudi Arabia, its biggest supplier. The possibility of the market being flooded with excess production from Saudi Arabia and Russia leading to a supply shock, therefore, comes at a most inopportune time. There is still a large downside to prices from current levels especially if Russia joins the battle with Saudi Arabia and decides to hike its own output. Analysts are already talking of a floor of $20 a barrel.

While a fall in prices is good news for major consumers such as India and China which depend on imports for a major part of their oil needs, it may be bad news for the big oil companies and the smaller shale oil players who are highly leveraged. A collapse of these shale oil producers may set off defaults in the bond markets, setting off its own non-virtuous spiral starting with the U.S. markets. With stock and bond markets already in turmoil, the price war now set off in oil is only going to make the markets more volatile and murkier. For India though, the sharp dip in oil prices is good news, for now. This will reduce the oil import bill at a time when merchandise exports are likely to suffer due to the freeze in the developed economies. This will keep the current account deficit balanced. The fall in fuel prices will also drag down headline inflation giving the Reserve Bank of India elbow room to cut rates. But the oil price fall may be bad news for the Centre’s disinvestment programme as the sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) could run into headwinds. Big oil companies, which are widely expected to bid for BPCL, may either shy away from it or their bids may be much lower than expected as the company’s valuation may drop. In such an eventuality, it is quite possible that the government may step in to grab a slice of the windfall from falling prices, through higher excise duties to compensate for the loss from disinvestment proceeds. Any such decision is unlikely to go down well with India’s consumer middle class.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/oils-rout/article31025950.ece
335,2020/03/10,Women power: on ICC Women’s T20 World Cup,"India must broaden its base in women’s cricket to challenge the likes of Australia

India’s campaign in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup may have ended on a disappointing note but it was not without positives. The crushing 85-run loss to Australia in Sunday’s final did highlight a few weaknesses: the batting came undone in a high-pressure chase, while the fielding and the running between wickets were mostly pedestrian. But Harmanpreet Kaur’s unit became the first Indian women’s team to make it to the T20 World Cup final, a fine achievement in itself. That it secured a place in the title decider following a rained-out semifinal against England should not be held against it. India was undefeated in the group phase, something England did not manage and ultimately paid the price for. The emergence of the cherubic 16-year-old batter Shafali Verma was the biggest plus. Barely six months into her international career, Verma carried India’s batting almost single-handedly and thrilled one and all with her expansive stroke play. It was a pity that the form did not rub off on her team mates. But to lose to this Australian team is no shame. The nation’s status as a cricketing powerhouse, especially in the shortest format of the game, needed no fresh proof. But the fact that Australia has captured all but one of the last six T20 World Cups should settle that debate.

The symbolism of Sunday’s spectacle, though, went way beyond the result. Everything about the setting at the Melbourne Cricket Ground seemed just about right. Played on International Women’s Day, it saw Australia, a pioneering country in women’s sport, meet India, a driving force of world cricket. The legendary tennis player and women’s equality crusader Billie Jean King was in the stands, as a near-capacity crowd — 86,174 to be precise — cheered the players on while a country of more than a billion were glued to their television sets. The attendance was the highest for any women’s sporting event in Australia and it proved that a standalone women’s competition can be a resounding success if marketed and executed well. It was best captured in the words of Alyssa Healy, the player of the final, who said: “You couldn’t have wiped the smile off my face, even if we had lost this game.” It is this energy that India needs to harness. India’s run to the 2017 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup final had generated significant interest leading to a number of girls taking up the sport. Now, with the buzz at an accentuated state, it is imperative for the BCCI to carry out structural reforms at the lower levels to broaden the base. The Women’s T20 Challenge, first held in 2018 as a one-off match, has now grown into a small tournament. But a bottom-up approach is a must to ensure a firmer footing for the women’s game.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/women-power/article31025951.ece

337,2020/03/10,"Now, KSRTC decides to cancel electric bus tenders","This follows a similar move by BMTC; fresh tenders will be floated in a few days

The wait for eco-friendly friendly buses to operate in Bengaluru and other parts of the State has become longer.

Following in the footsteps of the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has decided to cancel the tender it had floated to lease and operate e-buses. The Board took this decision after a bidder quoted exorbitant operational costs.

KSRTC Managing Director Shivayogi C. Kalasad told The Hindu that fresh tenders will be floated in a few days. “The operational cost quoted by the single bidder was not sustainable for the corporation. Despite negotiations, the bidder failed to lower the price. It was decided to float fresh tenders to get competitive pricing,” he said.

KSRTC plans to operate e-buses on inter-city routes such as Bengaluru to Mysuru, Bengaluru to Tumakuru, and Bengaluru to Shivamogga, among others.

“There were various parameters to fix an operational cost. Every day, one bus has to be operated for a distance of minimum 400 km. A single charging bus has to cover a distance of 250 km. In addition to this, other factors such as electricity and infrastructure provided to operate the buses will be considered. The previous bidder quoted over ₹65 per kilometre and we felt it is at the higher end. In other States, prices quoted were lesser than this. We are hoping that in the fresh tenders, there will be more bidders,” said Mr. Kalasad.

According to a senior KSRTC official, who did not want to be named, road transport corporations in the State are in financial distress owing to growing operational costs. “Electric buses are still new to our country and the cost involved in procurement and maintenance is huge,” he said.

The Board of North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC), too, will take a final call on whether to continue with the existing bidding or go for a new one.

Under the Centre’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME India II scheme), the BMTC had planned to lease 300 e-buses from private operators. KSRTC and NWKRTC were to lease 50 e-buses each.

The Union government will provide a subsidy of ₹55 lakh for each of the 12-m buses that will be leased by BMTC and KSRTC, while the NWKRTC is likely to operate 9-m buses and will get ₹45 lakh subsidy. The BMTC and KSRTC have already written to the Centre to extend the dates to avail the subsidy.

As per the Centre’s scheme, subsidy will be transferred to the private operator. “The operator has to quote the operational price that the corporations will bear. The corporation has to look into financial viability before agreeing to the operational expenditure,” the senior KSRTC official said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/now-ksrtc-decides-to-cancel-electric-bus-tenders/article31032668.ece
338,2020/03/10,Vegetable prices fall by around 25% in Bengaluru,"Experts say this is because of a huge supply in the market, which is more than the demand

Consumers battling inflation and rising cost of goods and services have reason to cheer. The price of vegetables and kitchen staples like tomatoes and onions has fallen by an average of around 25% in March when compared to February. Horticulture experts say that this is because there is a huge supply of vegetables in the market, which is more than the demand.

Both wholesale as well as retail rates have seen a steep decline. Onions, which had crossed ₹100/kg a few months ago, are now retailing at ₹34 at HOPCOMs. A kg of tomatoes is going for ₹15.

G.R. Srinivasan, Director, HOPCOMS, said, “The prices have come down because farmers have got a good yield. By the end of November, all the water sources were full due to rains. Farmers would have sown their crops, which are now being harvested,” he said. He added that while prices normally increase in March, a relatively good monsoon has helped keep the cost of vegetables down.

For now, consumers are elated over the dip in vegetable prices. “For just ₹500, I can buy enough vegetables for an entire week for my family as retail prices have come down,” said Suresh S., a resident of Malleswaram.

However, Mr. Srinivasan warned that this is just a temporary relief and that prices will soar in a month or two as water bodies will dry up in summer.

Farmers getting low rate

Farmers, who are getting a low price for their produce, are unhappy. Wholesale dealer B. Ravishankar said that people like him are waiting for the ban on the export of onions to be lifted. “Once that happens, farmers will get a better rate for onions,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/8v7apd/article31029196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGVEGPRICESH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vegetable-prices-fall-by-around-25-in-bengaluru/article31029197.ece

340,2020/03/10,BBMP bans open food stalls over cholera fears,"Of 17 suspected cases, 2 confirmed as cholera

The civic body, which has started tackling the threat of COVID-19 on a war footing, has another problem on its hands. There were 17 suspected cases of cholera in the city. According to health officials, seven were detected in South zone, eight in the East zone and two in the West zone. Of the 17, two cases were later confirmed.

As a preventive measure, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar has directed officials to clear food stalls that operate by the side of roads and on footpaths. He has also spoken with Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) Chairman Tushar Girinath about the situation as cholera is a water-borne disease.

“I have urged Mr. Girinath to get the water supplied through BWSSB pipelines tested, and supply water to areas that were yet to be serviced by the board through tankers,” said Mr. Anil Kumar.

He added that medical officials (from the Health Department and BBMP), along with post-graduate students, have been asked to visit different areas to create awareness among citizens about water-borne diseases, besides asking people to drink only boiled water, and distributing chlorine tablets.

BBMP’s Chief Health Officer (Public Health) Dr. Vijayendra stated that medical officials met patients to enquire about where they source their food from. Water samples from these places have been collected. “We have written to the BWSSB to identify leaks in pipelines and collect water samples,” he said. The BWSSB is set to identify locations of possible leakage in the pipelines. With the threat of spread of communicable diseases during the summer months, the water board has been directed to increase the chlorine content in water.

Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (health and family welfare), told The Hindu that the Health Department will issue an advisory after they get the report. “Two confirmed cases of cholera have been reported in the city. I have asked the BWSSB chairman to get water samples from the affected areas tested.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cq41jk/article31029161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGROADSIDEVENDORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-bans-open-food-stalls-over-cholera-fears/article31029163.ece

The government’s decision to declare holidays for all lower primary schools (class 1 to 5) in Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts after a patient in Bengaluru tested positive for COVID-19 has thrown examination schedules awry. G. Jagadeesha, Commissioner for Public Instruction, said that a decision on examinations for lower primary section students in Bengaluru will be taken once classes resume. However, following the government’s decision, many schools have decided to end the academic year and assess students based on their academic performance earlier in the year.

Classes and examinations for students from Classes 6 to 9 will be advanced, and vacation will begin on March 23. The schedule for the class ten SSLC examinations (March 27 to April 9) remains unchanged.

All government aided and unaided schools across the State have been instructed to declare summer vacation for students in classes between 1 and 5 from March 16. For students between Classes 6 and 9, the vacation will begin on March 23.

A circular for the closure of pre-KG, LKG and UKG schools until further orders had been issued on Sunday.

Parents said that they are yet to receive a circular from schools declaring holidays. Working parents, especially, are worried about how they will take care of their children during the day. “My child’s daycare has also said that they would be closed. I will have to skip work to take care of my child,” said Prajwala S., a parent of a five-year-old girl.

Many are trying to find classes to keep their children occupied. “We had anticipated that schools will close for summer vacation only at the end of March.

344,2020/03/10,Restoration of prison complex inside Vellore Fort under way,"Repair work is estimated to cost ₹15.30 lakh

Not many people know that inside the ancient Vellore Fort, within a high-rise compound wall and beneath a lush green cover, lies a prison. Cobwebs around the horse stable mandapam, giving it a semblance of a ‘prohibited area’, dissuades visitors from exploring.

Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which maintains the Fort premises, has decided to undertake repair work in the Fort, thereby giving the Fort and the prison a facelift. Budget estimates and designs have been sent for approval.

The ASI-Vellore circle has begun clean-up work on the mandapam, which has sculptures of Hindu deities. The entrance of the mandapam is a tall structure with stone roofing and lizard patterns carved on the arches. This structure keeps the prison hidden.

Cleaning work complete

According to an ASI official, the prison will be spruced up at a cost of ₹15.30 lakh. So far, cleaning work is complete. Tenders were floated and awarded in July last year.

Repair work will include masonry work inside the buildings and cells, provision for a footpath leading to the prison block, door work, wall work and cleaning.

Having completed the removal of overgrowth of shrubs, the dismantling of modern structures in the sub-jail inner area, for a clear view of the Fort wall, is under way. Hand railings have been provided on the Fort ramparts, from where visitors can peep into the jail complex from a top angle.

“Every effort will be taken to protect this historically important landmark. One has to take all possible steps to renovate without spoiling ancient story concealed in them,” said the ASI official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ip3yfr/article31034100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10VELLOREJAIL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/restoration-of-prison-complex-inside-vellore-fort-under-way/article31034102.ece

Under the guidance of the Public Health Department, the Vellore City Municipal Corporation workers will spray hydrogen peroxide-based disinfectant in government buses.

Addressing the media while launching the disinfection process at Vellore new terminus on Tuesday, District Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram said Vellore was a transit point for many students, devotees and patients.

He said there was no need for panic over COVID-19 and added that a mechanism was in place to screen and isolate individuals displaying symptoms, as per the guidelines of the Health Ministry.

We have also sought permission for setting up a lab for testing patients showing symptoms. Vehicles from other States will be monitored and sanitised at 13 places inside the district, he said.

He added that more than 800 students from other States study in Vellore Institute of Technology and that they have been asked not to travel to affected States for sometime or receive visitors from there.

Awareness programmes will be held at schools, colleges, anganwadi centres, ration shops and other public places, where large a number of people would be expected to gather, he said.

The Health Department is also distributing information leaflets and brochures containing guidelines, besides prominently displaying them in public places, including the city bus stands and railway station.

A Health Department official said that government hospitals in Vellore and Tirupattur have been listed for the purpose of taking in any patient showing symptoms.

An isolation ward has been readied at Tirupattur Government Hospital with 14 beds. Oxygen cylinders, ventilators, dress kit, masks, separate nurses room, toilet facilities and examination room with all emergency drugs are in place to meet any emergency, the official added.

347,2020/03/10,Vandalur zoo becomes a bird watcher’s paradise,"With 21 species of birds, the zoo officials refer the lake inside the campus as ‘Mini Vedanthangal’

Otteri lake inside Aringnar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur is turning out to be a bird watcher’s paradise.

It has been a remarkable turnaround for the waterbody that had dried up totally until it was restored about three months ago to be teeming with nearly 21 species of birds now.

Open billed storks, night herons, little egrets, little cormorants, darters, white breasted kingfishers and cattle egrets dart the lake so much that Sudha Ramen, deputy director, Vandalur zoo refers to the lake as a ‘Mini Vedanthangal’.

According to a birds census in March, there were 3,481 birds of 21 different species. “Many visitors are surprised when they come to know that there is a lake like this inside the zoo campus and are excited to see the number of birds,” she says.

“In the last few days, we have spotted several new species including a Grey pelican and a Whistling teal which haven’t been seen at the lake before,” says G. Kamaraj, a biologist at the zoo. “From December to the end of April at least, we can expect migratory birds to flock here,” he adds.

The lake was restored around three months ago after a year long long effort by the zoo officials to become a haven for several species of winged visitors since December. The water body was badly affected during Cylone Vardah and in the following years, had dried up due to inadequate rainfall.

Now, the lake has become one among the major attractions in the zoo among visitors, especially school students and birders. For visitors to walk as well as sit and take in the view, stone benches have been installed along the concrete path near the river bank.

‘Waiting for ducks’

With the temperatures already rising in the city, the brimming waters of the Otteri lake are a sight for the sore eyes. Stating that the number of birds here was an indication of the rich biodiversity of the area, Mr Kamaraj said that they also expect flocks of ducks to make the lake their home soon.

Last December, Ms Ramen had tweeted about the transformation of the lake which went viral on social media. Her update a few days ago on the lake continuing to attract several species of birds too has come in for praise.

The transformation of the lake began in February last year after which lake as well as percolation ponds were desilted. The desilted soil was used to create mounds on the lake bed and the tree saplings planted on them now provide a perfect place for the roosting of birds.

The zoo management also identified channels leading up to the water body and ensured that they were all desilted and created trenches as well as bunds to direct excess water from the zoo campus into the lake.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6hz1md/article31031992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OTTERI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vandalur-zoo-becomes-a-bird-watchers-paradise/article31031993.ece
348,2020/03/10,COVID-19: Ritchie street feeling the pinch,"After the outbreak of Covid-19 in China, the city’s electronics grey market hub has been impacted. Traders say it could turn worse in three months.

Chennai’s Ritchie Street, the electronics grey market hub, is slowly feeling the pinch of Covid-19 that has impacted economy worldwide.

Dealers here indicate that if the situation does not stabilise in the next thirty days, their business will fall drastically. Shopkeepers in the street, which is off Anna Salai, said the stocks at their godowns are dwindling.

With over 2,500 shops, Ritchie Street is the second largest market for electronics in India after Nehru Place in New Delhi.

“Majority of the products and spare parts come from China. After the outbreak of Covid-19, the consignments coming in have decreased. There is a shortage of certain products and spare parts,” said R.Chandalia, secretary, Chennai Electronics and Infotech Traders Association, Ritchie Street.

“Local manufacturing units who buy Chinese spare parts for production will be worst hit. About 70% of manufacturing imports are from China. This will start affecting everyone if the situation does not stabilise by April,” he added.

Dharmendra Kumbhat, who runs Sunshine Tele Link, said, “I have a tie up with a Chinese manufacturer [in Shenzhen] for making mobile accessories – these are my own brands. We received our last consignment before the Chinese New Year.”

“In the last two months, new mobile brands have being introduced in the market and we don’t have accessories for these models. We have spoken to our manufacturers but considering the situation in China, we need to wait and watch,” he said.

Many manufacturers who source raw materials from this street are queuing up and there is a trend of panic buying. Sunil Pipada, who runs S.R.Electronics on Narasingapuram Street and supplies spare parts for inverters and stabilizers, said there is a panic buying. “Deliveries are getting delayed. We need components from China to run the show, there is no other alternative,” he added.

Local shops in the electronic market have started stocking goods so that they can sustain for few months. Now traders may be forced to import products from other countries like Taiwan and Japan at higher prices until China starts production.

“Students who come here for their school and college projects are also affected as prices have gone up and there is a shortage of components,” Mr. Chandalia said. “Students doing projects in robotics come here to source minute components which is not available elsewhere,” he said.

The street is a household name for electronics goods with a huge stretch covering Narasingapuram street, Wallers Street, Meeran Sahib Street, Mohammed Hussain Sahib Street and Guruappa Road.

The market sells products at a lesser price when compared to showroom price. TVs, laptops, home theatre systems, mobiles, instruments, led panels and all sorts of electronic equipment are sold.

Small retailers who operate out shops which are 100 sq ft in size said that wholesalers have hiked prices by 20-30%. “We are procuring products at the higher price,” said a retailer who wished anonymity. It was the response of five other retailers here. “We are sourcing products at a high price from the wholesalers,” they said. “We cannot pass on the price hike to our customers else we might lose them,” said another retailer here.

Wholesalers who have been running businesses here for several decades suggested that, this hub has to look at an alternate market. With Tamil Nadu being the MSME base, the government should encourage small units in and around Chennai to manufacture these components. “It can’t happen overnight but if we start doing it now we will be able to manufacture locally within next three years,” said another retailer on Narasingapuram streeet.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9thkk7/article31031051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RITCHIE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-ritchie-street-feeling-the-pinch/article31031052.ece
349,2020/03/10,Motorists bogged down by unauthorised parking on Medavakkam-Mambakkam Road,"The road is the main thoroughfare for several residents of Sithalapakkam, Vengaivasal, Medavakkam and Kovilancheri

Motorists are finding it hard to access a small stretch of Medavakkam-Mambakkam Main Road because of unauthorised parking of vehices on both sides of the arterial road, particularly during morning and evening peak hours.

Branching off from the Velachery - Tambaram Main Road, the The Medavakkam-Mambakkam Main Road is the main thoroughfare for several residents of Sithalapakkam, Vengaivasal, Medavakkam and Kovilancheri.

A small stretch of the arterial road houses a number of shops resulting in vehicles being parked on the roadside leading to in traffic snarls on a daily basis causing severe hardships to the motorists.

Also the presence of a number of hawkers and heavy vehicles including sewage tankers parked on the road margin has eaten into the road space, residents rued. Despite the State Highways department taking steps to widen the road, the motorists find it of no use because of the illegal parking of vehicles.

D. Krishnan, a resident of TNHB quarters in Sithalapakkam, said the stretch from Radha Nagar to Velachery Main Road junction houses more than five private schools and the unauthorised parking of vehicles causes severe incovenience to children. The parking of vehicles on both sides also poses the risk of accidents from the speeding vehicles.

The residents urge the City Traffic Police to take steps to remove the unauthorised vehicles being on the roadsides to ease traffic congestion. They also want the Traffic Police to remove a portion of the median of the arterial road, as it was causing traffic bottlenecks for vehicles at the intersection of Babu Nagar 3rd Main Road and Gandhi Street.

A senior official of the City Traffic Police said steps would be taken to prevent unauthorised parking of vehicles on the arterial road.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xc9vhb/article31030056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/medavakkam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/motorists-bogged-down-by-unauthorised-parking-on-medavakkam-mambakkam-road/article31030057.ece
350,2020/03/10,Industrial Tribunal rejects textile firm’s plea to dismiss workers,"Industrial Tribunal, Tamil Nadu, has rejected a textile firm’s plea seeking approval for dismissal of some of its workers.

352,2020/03/10,Disappointed by denial of RS seat: DMDK,"DMDK deputy general secretary L.K. Sudhish on Monday expressed disappointment over the AIADMK leadership ignoring the DMDK’s demand for a Rajya Sabha seat.

What has made it worse for the DMDK is that the AIADMK chose to give one of the three seats to G.K. Vasan, leader of the TMC, a minor ally in the AIADMK front. In the last Lok Sabha polls, the DMDK was allotted four seats while the TMC was given only one seat on the basis of its strength. Besides, in the 2016 Assembly polls, the DMDK headed the third front in which the TMC was a junior partner.

Mr. Sudhish had even met AIADMK co-coordinator and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on February 28 when he is learnt to have sought a Rajya Sabha seat for the party.

Mr. Sudhish told The Hindu, “I just want to say this: I congratulate three people who have been nominated for the Rajya Sabha, but we are disappointed…I have nothing more to say.”

Will the AIADMK’s snub affect its alliance with the DMDK? A senior leader in the DMDK claimed that it is unlikely that this issue would change the relationship.

“I don’t think this issue would define the alliance arrangement, but then, we have to see what the party leadership would decide,” he said.

Premalatha Vijayakant, treasurer of the DMDK, had earlier hoped that the AIADMK would accede to the party’s request.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/disappointed-by-denial-of-rs-seat-dmdk/article31028402.ece

354,2020/03/10,SC stays HC order on plea seeking CBI probe in bypoll bribery case,"Interim order comes in response to appeal by AIADMK MLA

The Supreme Court has stayed the operation of an interim order passed by the Madras High Court on January 29 permitting N. Maruthu Ganesh of DMK to seek a CBI probe into the 2017 Radhakrishnan (RK) Nagar bypoll bribery case in which Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar and many others were allegedly involved.

A three-judge Bench comprising Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant granted the interim stay, until further orders, pursuant to individual appeals preferred by AIADMK MLA P.M. Narasimhan and the Inspector of Abhiramapuram police station where a First Information Report was registered on the basis of a complaint lodged at the instance of the Election Commission in 2017.

While Senior Counsel Mukul Rohatgi argued the appeal preferred by the MLA challenging the High Court order, Advocate General Vijay Narayan and Additional Advocate General Balaji Srinivasan appeared on behalf of the Inspector of Police. The appellants contended that a Division Bench of the High Court had failed to appreciate that the FIR registered at the instance of the ECI had got quashed by a single judge of the same High Court in March 2018.

Since the single judge’s order had attained finality on not being taken on appeal, there was nothing left to be transferred to or investigated by the CBI now, they claimed. It was also pointed out before the apex court that the litigant before the Division Bench of the High Court was a political opponent of the ruling party and therefore his attempt to seek CBI’s interference in the case was ill motivated and clearly political in nature.

The issue dates back to April 2017 when T.T.V. Dhinakaran, now AMMK leader, contested as an AIADMK candidate in RK Nagar constituency which got vacated due to the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in December 2016. An Income Tax raid, then, in the residence of the Health Minister led to seizure of loose sheets containing names of several ministers to whom a total of Rs.89.65 crore crore had been supposedly given to be distributed to the voters.

The seizures were informed to the ECI which rescinded the bypoll election notification on April 9, just three days before polling, and lodged a police complaint. The police, in turn, registered a FIR without any mentioning any name in the column meant for filling up the names of the accused and let the FIR get quashed by a single judge of the High Court at the instance of Tiruttani MLA Mr. Narasimhan after he was summoned for inquiry.

The ECI was kept in the dark about the quashing of the FIR for long and it came to know about it only during hearing of the writ petition filed by Mr. Ganesh before the Division Bench in December 2018. It was in this background that the DMK man moved an application last year to amend his prayer and seek a CBI probe into the issue and the Division Bench allowed his plea.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sc-stays-hc-order-on-plea-seeking-cbi-probe-in-bypoll-bribery-case/article31027423.ece

Metro services were affected for nearly an hour and a half on Monday, as an overhead cable that was in a poor condition had to be changed thereby delaying trains and putting hundreds of passengers to inconvenience.

Around 3.30 p.m., all direct services from Chennai Central to Chennai airport were stopped. So passengers had to make a transit at Alandur station. Similarly, those travelling from Airport to Washermenpet had to change trains twice — once at Alandur and again at AG-DMS, sources said. Trains were delayed by nearly 15-20 minutes too, passengers said. For a brief period, trains stopped at LIC and Thousand Lights. Also, the passenger information display systems and announcements too were not working in many stations, a staff said. A source said these cables were not maintained properly which resulted in this problem.

Many passengers were clueless on why this occurred.

361,2020/03/10,"A war room approach is needed, says virologist Jacob John","""We are reacting to what is happening and not proactively changing our tactics,” he said

The country needs a war room where a designated group of persons think only about COVID-19, design strategies for the next week and the next month, renowned virologist Jacob John said.

Dr. John, retired professor of virology from Christian Medical College, Vellore, is of the view that the situation, both in India and worldwide, is “grim”, and that the country was merely reacting to what was happening. “My fear is that within two weeks, every State in the country will have COVID-19 cases. Hospitals will begin to see cases, and many hospitals do not have isolation facilities, respiratory support systems and trained intensive care personnel,” he said.

The situation is grim because of many factors, he said.

“Imagine, we are at war with a country. There will be one war room with designated people watching the battlefield 24 x 7, making assessments, advising tactics and strategies. Now, consider this a war against coronavirus. Where is the war room? Is it at the National Centre for Disease Control or at Indian Council of Medical Research or at Nirman Bhavan? It is the ad hoc reactive decision-making that disappoints me,” he added.

This need not be the case as the country has been well-trained to face various epidemics, he said, adding: “We know how to do it. This one is different from everything we have seen in the past, but it has two or three previous trainers for us – Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome has trained us, H1N1 pandemic has trained us and HIV/AIDS has trained us. But I do not see any lessons being applied from these experiences we went through. That is why I feel the Indian scene is a bit grim. We are reacting to what is happening and not proactively changing our tactics,” he said.

Tamil Nadu, he said, was probably better prepared because of its strong system of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare, and the presence of medical colleges in 80% of the districts. Yet, there are areas of concern. “My worry is that have they all been given clear instructions as to what they should do? Are we systematically diagnosing every pneumonia patient — whether it is bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia or viral pneumonia? Add coronavirus to the list. Is every case of severe pneumonia being diagnosed with the six categories of aetiology? If not, we are in a bit of a problem,” he observed.

What is also needed is a platform to provide authentic information for the public. “In the US, people look for authentic information from Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Today, when I make calls, it says wash hands repeatedly. Is that enough? People want to know if they can travel to places such as Mumbai or Delhi? If there are travel restrictions within a State? Having an official channel, consistently improving on yesterday's instructions today are the things we should be doing,” he said.

“NCDC is our CDC but it has no track record in providing health information to the public. The system is not robust in India to respond to a challenge like this. We need a 24x7 CDC-like platform for authentic information, game plan, response needed to be taken and places in the country where the problem exists. Without that, we are flying blind. We are hoping that things will not turn bad. But things will turn out to be bad,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cw65dx/article31027259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THJOCOBJOHN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-war-room-approach-is-needed/article31027260.ece
362,2020/03/10,"Pep talk, books help boost patient’s confidence","Doctors go all out to prevent COVID-19 patient from slipping into depression

For doctors of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), treating the 45-year-old male who tested positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was crucial. But they had another job on hand — preventing him from slipping into depression. They went a step ahead, helping him with pep talks over phone, providing him magazines and a special diet as per his health condition.

Recovering from COVID-19 at one of the isolation wards of RGGGH, he needed more than just medical attention. “He was confined to a room. We found him depressed for two days. The fear and stigma could have caused depression. So, we decided to do something to keep him motivated. The RGGGH dean started to talk to him over phone regularly. We gave him pep talks, giving updates on his parameters and told him that he was doing fine. We needed to boost his confidence,” a senior doctor said.

Sending a counsellor meant additional exposure to the infection, so doctors decided to help him in their own way. To help him overcome boredom, doctors provided books and magazines. “It was important for him to know that his wife had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. So, we conveyed the test result to him,” the doctor said.

Diet plan

The patient, being a diabetic, had an appropriate diet plan drawn up specially for him. He also got to place orders from the GH kitchen, a special privilege.

“We provided him food in disposable plates and cups. We served him nutritious food that will boost his immunity. This included food rich in vitamins. The diet also had juices and salads. We also told him that he can place an order for anything that he wants to eat as per his health condition from our kitchen,” the doctor added.

Not just him, the hospital also took initiatives to keep the separate team of medical and paramedical staff working for COVID-19 motivated. “We have three persons — a doctor, staff nurse and worker — per shift. So, there are a total of nine persons on three shifts. We are taking efforts to keep them motivated,” the doctor said.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said, “The doctors motivated him and got him books. He is out of danger.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pep-talk-books-help-boost-patients-confidence/article31027244.ece
363,2020/03/10,Health Minister warns rumour-mongers,"Govt. to set up quarantine facilities in Chennai, Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Madurai

There is no dearth of misinformation on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on social media. Now, the Health department has decided to act against rumour-mongers.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar on Monday cautioned persons who continue to spread rumours about COVID-19 on social media of police action.

“There is plenty of misinformation on social media. For instance, there was a question on whether two doctors in a medical college hospital were quarantined. All this is completely false. We are sharing official information. Beyond this, if any person spreads rumours, the department will lodge a complaint with the police and initiate action,” he told reporters after a review meeting convened by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

The Minister said the wife of the 45-year-old person, who tested positive for COVID-19 and has been quarantined at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), has tested negative for COVID-19. Similarly, a 15-year-old boy, who arrived from Texas, has also tested negative.

In addition to the 300-beds in isolation wards across the State, the department is all set to establish fully-equipped quarantine facilities in Chennai, Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Madurai on a war footing. These facilities would be located on the outskirts of the districts; for instance Tambaram in Chennai, he added. The newly approved testing facility at Government Medical College, Theni, was ready. Discussions are under way to start laboratory facilities in four more places, if required, the Minister said.

CM’s review meet

He said the Chief Minister held a detailed review meeting with Ministers and Secretaries of various departments including school education, higher education, social welfare, labour, transport and municipal administration. Department-wise instructions were issued. — for instance awareness on hand washing among school students during assembly and advising children with fever and cough from coming to anganwadi centres.

“Specifically, he told us to get more safety gear for medical and paramedical personnel undertaking screening at the airport. Our doctors and staff nurses, numbering 95 persons, need to screen about 8,500 passengers arriving in 52 to 57 international flights a day and it is important they they have adequate safety gear. We already have 10 lakh masks and 50,000 personal protective equipment, and the CM has directed us to increase it. He also told us to get sufficient drugs and saline,” he said.

To a question on hoarding and sale of masks at high prices, he said that there was no need for all to wear masks. “Such a situation is unwarranted in Tamil Nadu now,” he said. Who should wear masks? The Minister listed out: immune-compromised persons such as those who had undergone heart or lung or renal transplants, those undergoing treatment for cancer or had undergone bypass surgery, treating/screening doctors and paramedical, and airport/immigration authorities.

“We have readied a short film on dos and don’ts on coronavirus for public and this will be released soon,” he said.

Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said that the Government of India has cancelled visas granted for nationals of five COVID-19 affected countries-China, Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. “We have asked hotels to provide information on such travellers as they need to return to their countries,” she added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5z4jyx/article31027582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THCARDIOGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/health-minister-warns-rumour-mongers/article31027228.ece
364,2020/03/10,Metrowater’s pilot schemes to tap local sources and use recycled water set to be ready soon,"Chennai Metrowater's ambitious pilot projects to add more local drinking water sources and also implement indirect use of reclaimed water are set to be commissioned in a phased manner from June.

In a bid to decentralise water storage and distribution, the water agency had proposed to draw water from the neighbourhood lakes in Retteri, Ayanambakkam and Perumbakkam. Nearly 35% of the construction work of the modular plants to treat the water has been completed so far, said officials of the Metrowater.

The objective of the ₹53 crore project is to revive the local water bodies and tap them as drinking water sources. However, release of raw sewage into the lakes continues to be a challenge for the source augmentation project.

“We have identified points where sewage is being released. We plan to have constructed wetlands with layer of canna plants and other aquatic plants depending on the quantum of sewage discharge. A combination of other waste water treatment methods may be adopted to remove suspended solids in the sewage,” said an official.

The water agency has roped in Care Earth Trust, a city-based voluntary organisation and a team that was involved in restoration of Jakkur lake in Bengaluru, to assess and rejuvenate lake ecology. They would help in designing the model for improving water quality.

A total of 30 million litres of water a day (mld) would be drawn from the lakes, treated in the modular plants and transmitted to the nearest distribution station. For instance, water from Ayanambakkam lake would be conveyed to the facility under construction in Mogappair, officials noted.

Work is also progressing on a full swing to create infrastructure for indirect use of recycled water. Nearly 35% of the work has been completed to build 10-mld tertiary treatment plants in Nesapakkam and Perungudi.

Sewage that is recycled at the plants would be blended with freshwater in Porur and Perungudi lakes at a ratio of 1:100. The water would again be pumped, treated and distributed through drinking water supply network.

Officials said it has been found that the flow in Adyar and Cooum rivers has reduced owing to overexploitation of resources in the neighbourhood. Reuse of treated sewage has an important role in groundwater recharge and restoring lakes.

“We are improvising the technology to ensure high standard of water quality as we are pioneering in the project. For instance, there are three stages of disinfection in the treatment process-use of sodium hypochlorite, ozonation and UV dose at different stages,” said an official.

There are also plans to expand the project of blending recycled water in Retteri, Ayanambakkam and Perumbakkam lakes for drinking water supply in the next phase .",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vic0gm/article31027219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THAYANAMBAKKAMLAKEWATERTREATMENTPLANTCONSTRUCTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metrowaters-pilot-schemes-to-tap-local-sources-and-use-recycled-water-set-to-be-ready-soon/article31027220.ece
365,2020/03/10,Airfares nosedive as COVID-19 fears scare off passengers,"Low occupancy sees many airlines cancelling flights

With hundreds of passengers cancelling their travel plans owing to COVID-19, the airfares for domestic travel have nosedived across metro cities in the country.

Now, a flight to Bengaluru will cost a passenger only ₹1,000.

Similarly, the fare to Delhi is now around ₹3,000-₹3,500 and to Hyderabad around ₹1,200-₹1,500.

Cautious flyers

Many flyers say they have stopped travelling for work to other metro cities, as the companies have decided to be cautious. Srinivasan V., a frequent flyer, said, “Usually, I keep travelling to Mumbai or Delhi for work, but now, my company has told me not to travel. They don’t want us taking any risk right now. We are having conference calls to get work done for now. Safety is more important than anything else right now.”

Vaidyanathan and his wife had planned to travel from Kerala to Chennai late this month, but they decided to cancel their trip last week. “We were quite eager to visit Chennai but with so much going on across the country, we didn’t think it was wise to travel now. We will be travelling with many other people in the aircraft and we won’t even know if anyone has an infection. We can always come back much later when things get better,” he said.

Sources said the flight occupancy has been rather poor in recent times and they don’t expect it to change for quite some time. “Even peak hour fares are affordable now, because there is not much demand at all,” a source said.

According to officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI), there many flight cancellations as well on several days.

“Because there are barely any passengers, an airline decides to cancel a flight and claims it did so for some operational reasons. There are also flight cancellations to many destinations on a daily basis. Many are scared to travel now, unless it is extremely important,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eqzx2f/article31027207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th10citytravelcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/airfares-nosedive-as-covid-19-fears-scare-off-passengers/article31027208.ece
366,2020/03/10,End in sight to OMR commuters’ pain,"Highways Dept. to begin construction of Madhya Kailash flyover by year-end, complete it in 18 months

The Highways Department is expediting the process of construction of a two-lane flyover at Madhya Kailash junction, which will allow motorists from Saidapet to reach Rajiv Gandhi Salai (OMR) without having to stop at the traffic signal.

The 700-metre-long flyover will take off 200 m after the IIT flyover on Sardar Patel Salai and land near the Indira Nagar foot overbridge on the IT corridor. “Presently, the design wing is on the job and that work is likely to take another three months to be completed. The detailed project report for the flyover is ready and the estimate will be ready after the design is done,” explained an official source.

The process of land acquisition has been kick-started with the inspection of the site by the Revenue Department. The government order sanctioning funds for the land acquisition has also been issued. It is estimated that around 5000 sq m of land would be required for the formation of service lanes on either side.

G. Ramakrishnan, a resident of Besant Nagar, who welcomed the construction of a flyover, said that traffic jams are not uncommon on that road. “Even on Saturday afternoons, we have traffic jams on that road and they extend beyond Raj Bhavan. The same issue persists on both directions. A two-directional flyover or even an extension of the IIT flyover would be great,” he said. Since construction of a two-way flyover would involve more land acquisition, that is not being considered.

An Adyar resident Mithun Narayanan, who takes the MRTS regularly, said that pedestrians were at a great risk at the junction.

Violations galore

“Many people take the wrong side causing a headache for people like me who want to cross the road. And though there is enough police presence at the junction, most times they don’t seem to mind such wrong side driving,” he said. On completion of the facility, a foot overbridge has been planned. The department aims to commence construction by the end of this year and it would take around 18 months to complete the project. During construction some traffic diversions would have to be made. The junction witnesses traffic of over 1.25 lakh vehicles a day.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/n7o253/article31027203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THMADHYAKAILASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/end-in-sight-to-omr-commuters-pain/article31027204.ece
367,2020/03/10,"Allegation of money distribution imaginary, Chidambaram tells Madras HC","Chidambaram cross-examined in HC over an election petition

Former Union Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday stoutly denied the allegation of having distributed money to voters when he contested from the Sivaganga Parliamentary constituency in 2009, and claimed that the allegation levelled by his prime opponent R.S. Raja Kannappan (then in AIADMK, but now in DMK) was imaginary and not backed by evidence.

During the cross-examination before Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana of the Madras High Court in an election petition pending for over a decade, he said: “There is no evidence tendered before this honourable court about distribution of money at any place during the elections. Your allegations are totally imaginary and I deny your allegations.”

The answer was given in response to a volley of questions posed by advocates K. Rajendra Kumar and G. Saravana Kumar, who showed Mr. Chidambaram a paragraph from his book ‘A View from the Outside’ and asked whether money distributed to voters could be treated as an investment since the book claims that “politics, today, is business”.

Answering their questions, the former Minister said: “The reference to politics being business was in a different context as stated in the previous paragraph. The context was regarding allocation of petrol pumps and residential plots. That was the context in which I made the remark that you have quoted... I have not made any reference to money being distributed to voters.”

When the lawyers claimed that the results of all other parliamentary constituencies in the State were declared around 1 pm, but the results of Sivaganga constituency alone was declared only after 8 pm, he said: “I am not aware of the time when the election results were declared in all other constituencies. I know that some results were declared after Sivaganga.”

Denying a suggestion that around half past noon on May 13, 2009 the national trends showed that the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) would come to power at the Centre for a second consecutive term, he said, “At 12:30 pm, very few election results had been declared. Therefore, there is no question of coming to the conclusion that the UPA had won the election or will form the next government.”

Claiming that he officially came to know about his lead in the elections only when he was in the Returning Officer’s room between 4 pm and 4:30 pm on that day, Mr. Chidambaram denied the petitioner’s allegation that of the election officials, in connivance, having transferred the votes secured by Mr. Kannappan to his kitty.

After the counsel for the election petitioner completed the cross-examination, an advocate representing another contestant, R. Rajiv, who secured around 2,500 votes in the election, sought the permission of the court to cross-examine the former Minister. Taking strong exception to such a request, senior counsel G. Masilamani said it should not be acceded to.

“First, he (counsel for Mr. Rajiv) said he will ask two questions. Now, he is saying three or four questions. I say no question at all,” the senior counsel said and urged the court to discharge his client.

The election petition is listed for arguments on March 30.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/allegation-of-money-distribution-imaginary-chidambaram-tells-madras-hc/article31027132.ece

370,2020/03/10,Avvaiyar award given to crematorium assistant,"R. Kannagi is a social worker

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday honoured R. Kannagi, 52, from Tiruvannamalai, with the Tamil Nadu government’s Avvaiyar award for the current year, recognising her work for the uplift of rural women for over 18 years.

Ms. Kannagi, a burial ground assistant, is popular among the women’s self help groups (SHGs) in Tiruvannamalai district. She works in a crematorium near Esanyam Ground, a facility under the maintenance of Mahadeepam Makkal Nala Arakkatalai.

Dons many hats

She dons many hats — that of co-ordinator for women SHG training programmes and social worker — along with working as the burial ground assistant.

She has been a bridge between SHGs and various government agencies. She also started Vizhudhugal, an organisation that has benefited many women.

Ms. Kannagi faced severe opposition when she initially took up the job at the crematorium. Unperturbed by the activities in the graveyard, she continues to bury the dead, proving that women can take up such jobs too.

She has previously won the district level Women’s Day award in 2016 and Republic Day award in 2018. She was also awarded for her environment protection efforts in 2018.

‘Immense satisfaction’

While thanking the district administration for the Avvaiyar award, Ms. Kannagi said performing final rites of unclaimed bodies was possible because of the cooperation of Health and Police departments and that her work gives her immense satisfaction.

371,2020/03/10,Mumbai police arrests two people for fake currency printing and circulation,"On close examination, some watermark features found missing; paper used was also different

A Mumbai police team, which reached Ambur in connection with the printing and circulation of fake currency notes, arrested two people from Ayyanur, near Ambur, on Monday.

Police identified those arrested as Baskar, 43, from Saidapet in Vellore and Saravanan, 42, of Ayyanur near Ambur.

A team led by Rajesh Patil from Antop Hill police station, Mumbai, sought the help of Ambur police to nab the others connected in this case. Saravanan and Baskar have confessed to the crime of printing and circulating fake notes in several areas of Vellore district.

Machinery seized

The police team seized 1,477 ₹500 fake currency notes, and 86 ₹200 currency notes, amounting to ₹7,55,700 in total, from the house of Saravanan. Printing machine, papers, and paper cutting machine were seized from the premises.

They were produced before a court in Ambur and taken to Mumbai.

The Crime Branch police said that the Mumbai team reached Ambur based on a statement made by Ibrahim, one of the accused arrested four days ago in Mumbai. He mentioned Baskar, an ex-prisoner, who was involved in fake currency circulation in Mumbai. Baskar befriended Ibrahim while he was in the Vellore Central prison.

The duo decided to print and circulate fake currency in denominations of ₹200 and ₹500 in Saravanan’s house.

Baskar had already started circulating fake notes in Ambur, Vaniyambadi and Tirupattur. He had circulated a few notes through Ibrahim in Mumbai.

FICN racket

The Mumbai Crime Branch had busted a counterfeit currency notes racket run by three persons where superior quality Fake Indian Currency Notes (FICN) were being printed and circulated. The gang printed fake ₹500 notes and circulated them in the market by mixing them with original notes.

The investigating team found that the watermark was similar to those found on the original notes. Upon careful inspection, some features were found missing.

372,2020/03/10,The cost of a yes to a bank rescue act,"The Yes Bank plan is risky and there is little doubt that the State Bank of India is acting at the government’s bidding

The revival package announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to rescue insolvent Yes Bank smacks of desperation. Having placed a moratorium on the bank’s activities and capping withdrawals by depositors at ₹50,000, the government has called upon the State Bank of India (SBI), to lead the rescue. The SBI, which has its own share of problems to resolve, has responded with alacrity. Even before undertaking due diligence, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar has announced that his bank is willing to outlay as much as ₹10,000 crore to recapitalise ailing Yes Bank and restore it to health. There is little doubt that the SBI is merely acting at the government’s bidding.

Data | The Yes Bank crisis explained in six charts

The SBI ‘lifeline’

It is telling that the RBI, which has drafted the “Yes Bank Ltd Reconstruction Scheme, 2020”, has made the SBI the anchor investor in Yes Bank equity, paying a premium of at least ₹8 on a share with face value of ₹2, and purchasing as many shares as needed to acquire a 49% stake. Simultaneously, the authorised capital of Yes Bank is to be raised from ₹800 crore to ₹5,000 crore. So, to start with, the SBI would be investing ₹2,450 crore to become the dominant stakeholder. But that is only the beginning. In his statement to reporters, declaring ownership of the RBI’s plan, Mr. Kumar said that he has set his bank an investment boundary of ₹10,000 crore, with the amount actually invested depending on how much money is needed to keep Yes Bank afloat. His assumption is that Yes Bank would need about ₹20,000 crore, and at the valuation of ₹10 a share, that would require an investment of ₹9,800 crore from the SBI for it to keep its stake at 49%.

Interview | We expect moratorium to be lifted by weekend: Yes Bank administrator

This is a big ask of the SBI by the government, which clearly believes there is too much at stake. There are depositors big and small involved who were attracted by the higher interest rate offered by private banks like Yes Bank and who would lose hugely if Yes Bank is allowed to collapse. That would, besides making the government unpopular, most likely set off a chain of withdrawals from other private banks as well as some weaker public banks, with the contagion posing a systemic threat. Fearing that outcome, the Finance Minister and the Chief Economic Adviser have been straining their vocal cords to persuade depositors that their money is safe and that they should not be misled by rumours to the contrary.

Possible economic reaction

Moreover, firms and agents dependent on Yes Bank for credit to keep them in business may find their operations disrupted and new credit lines difficult to find. That could lead to their defaulting on debt they owe other creditors. There would also be adverse spin-off effects on investors in bonds and instruments issued by Yes Bank, triggering turmoil in other parts of the financial system. Not surprisingly, Mr. Kumar justifies the SBI’s action on the grounds that Yes Bank cannot be allowed to fail since that “would have consequences for the Indian economy”. That danger arises because the intervention has been much delayed. There have been reports of governance failures, accounting irregularities and balance sheet weaknesses at Yes Bank for more than two years now. It is because of the delay that escalated intervention is unavoidable.

The main planks

But is the SBI’s intervention likely to succeed. The RBI’s restructuring plan seems to be based on three principles. The first is that the government is not expected to directly invest in Yes Bank, perhaps because that would overburden its already strained finances, weakened further by a spate of recent tax concessions. The second is that Yes Bank is not to be merged with the SBI, but become a standalone subsidiary, equity in which could be sold on a later date if that proves feasible and the SBI so desires. Third, investors other than the SBI must play an important role in the revival of Yes Bank, since the equity of the bank is expected to rise from ₹800 crore to anywhere between ₹5,000 crore and ₹20,000 crore, with the SBI holding only 49% of the total. So the SBI’s role is not limited to immediately infusing capital into the damaged bank but also involves building investor confidence in the future of the bank through its dominant presence. Mr. Kumar claims that more than 20 potential investors have approached the SBI to join in the resuscitation effort.

Confidence is crucial, because in the absence of investor support the success of the restructuring exercise is not guaranteed. In fact, it is not clear as yet whether even ₹20,000 crore is enough to restore Yes Bank to health. What emerges from the available evidence is that Yes Bank had ramped up its lending in recent years, with gross advances doubling from a little less than ₹1 lakh crore at end of financial year 2015-16, to around ₹205,000 crore (or more than double) at the end of 2017-18 and about ₹245,000 crore at the end of 2018-19. According to reports, the bank’s exposure to bankrupt or heavily indebted corporate groups such as Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. (DHFL), Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG), Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) and Essel, besides the now stressed Vodafone, is substantial. This suggests that in search of high returns, the bank was engaged in risky leveraged lending or lending to already heavily indebted targets. This could make the asking sum to restore health much larger than initially estimated.

The RBI has implicitly provided for this possibility in its restructuring plan. It has announced that additional tier 1 bonds (AT1 bonds) issued by Yes, totalling close to ₹11,000 crore, “shall stand written down permanently, in full, with effect from the appointed date”. AT1 bonds offer investors a higher return because of the higher risk associated with them, including the possibility of being written down when a bank’s equity base is under threat. But investors, who bought into these bonds because of a thirst for higher yields are likely to approach the courts, hampering the restructuring process. Overall, given uncertainties of this kind and the gloomy economic climate, investors may not be willing to outlay large sums on equity of a shaky bank.

The approach and flaws

Meanwhile, narrow explanations are on offer to explain the crisis. Investigations into the dealings of Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor point to quid pro quo payments to family-controlled shell companies in return for large loans to entities such as DHFL, which were already stressed. But there is more to the crisis than just corruption. The government has been promoting a strategy in which growth is driven by a credit splurge, and large loans to shaky corporates are condoned or even encouraged, in the hope that they would drive investment. To that end bankers were offered a free run or even encouraged to do the wrong thing. This did raise investment levels, but very often in projects that were financially unviable. Such an environment also provided fertile ground for rogue bankers and felonious borrowers, resulting in large non-performing assets that must be written off. As of now, the SBI is providing the finances, but if the RBI’s scheme does not work and that investment is not recovered, the SBI’s stakeholders — the government and tax payers — must finally foot the bill.

The fact that the government does not want to have an immediate debate in Parliament on the Delhi violence shows how seriously the Constitution, upon which ruling party members too have taken oath, has been subjected to political assault. The strength of a government does not lie merely in its numbers, but in its responsibility and commitment to protect and preserve constitutional morality and through which constitutional culture has to be nurtured. The role of the Opposition, according to the codes prescribed, is to hold the government accountable to the people through a democratically managed process. Constructive criticism and placing restrictions on arbitrariness of the ruling party are important to preserve the values of democracy and uphold national interest in all ways possible. It is so sad to see how both the Opposition and those in power have resorted to political tactics to divert the attention of the nation (Editorial, “House matters”, March 9).

Beyond the bailout

The State Bank of India’s decision to bail out the beleaguered Yes Bank — otherwise a name with a positive connotation — by means of capital infusion could help hapless depositors. Knots of depositors queued up before branches in the aftermath of the bank’s collapse have again showed up the fragility of the financial sector. Meanwhile, urgent action should be taken to recover dues from borrowers who dodge paying their loans. The flip side is that there is a link between private commercial banks and crony capitalism. It has become a practice for companies and dummy companies to borrow loans and then plead ‘stress’ or ‘bankruptcy’ to explain defaults on repayment and force the government to step in ‘to rescue and reconstruct’ the ‘looted’ banks. The government is left with no option but to save the private commercial banks ‘from falling off the cliff’ for the sake of the customers. The rightness of using public resources to bail out failed private banks and thereby placing an additional burden on the tax payer is debatable.

The swift arrest of Yes Bank co-founder Rana Kapoor was most unexpected despite the wide-held perception that a bank would not financially run into trouble unless there is total mismanagement including financial embezzlement (Page 1, “After 15 hours of questioning, Rana Kapoor arrested by ED”, March 9).

There are numerous ways for top brass to make money unethically: the most common is to lend mind-boggling amounts to floundering or unestablished business enterprises out of which a substantial percentage is returned to the favouring officer by way of illegal gratification. Rana Kapoor’s case is not the first of its kind. The case has damaged the banking sector, which could hurt the country’s economy.

Adivasis as co-citizens

The denial of a rightful place to Adivasi culture, social capital, community-centric governance systems and ecological sensitiveness is nothing but a case of democratic decline (Editorial page, “Having an ear to Adivasi ground”, March 9). Mainstream society’s perception of Adivasis as being “uncivilised” or “underdeveloped” is a grave mistake and renders injustice to these communities.

SC/ST Commissioner B.D. Sharma once said that we need to empower the traditional governance systems of Adivasis rather than teaching democracy to them. C.U. Wills, a British Indian civil servant who served in the Central Provinces historically observed that there are “embryonic origins of constitutionalism” in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. It is high time we understand Adivasis communities in the right perspective and spirit in order to enrich our democracy. A strong political will and bureaucratic efficiency are the need of the hour.

The match Down Under

There are some lessons to be learnt from the Indian women cricket team’s humiliating defeat to Australia (‘Sport’ page, “Australia runs away with cup as India crumbles on the big stage”, March 9. The Indian team’s dropped catches facilitated the Aussie openers, Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney, to build a partnership. India’s wayward bowling also aided Australia. India must learn that “catches win matches”.

374,2020/03/10,This Japanese man in Chennai offers his own take on filter coffee,"At his Alwarpet cafe Coffee Trotter, Hirano Takeshi serves up cups of Joe and homemade pound cake.

Hirano Takeshi sells cars by day and lattes at night. His newly opened cafe, Coffee Trotter, is chic and pleasingly minimalist, with a long communal table that encourages conversation.

Although the cafe is just 140 square feet in total, it is intuitively designed, with a compact space for the barista facing a row of seats with thoughtfully placed hooks behind them for blazers and handbags.

Fragrant with the scent of espresso, it is bright and cheery in the morning, with a steady flow of customers despite the fact that it opened recently, and very quietly. “Hirano says we have a long way to go,” says Nandakumar Kaliappa, a partner in the venture, explaining why they are cautious about publicity. “We need to get better, and are working on it.”

The customers, however, seem pleased. A Japanese businessman puts down his empty coffee cup, pays and gives Hirano a thumbs up as he pushes open the glass door to leave. Hirano waves goodbye, clears the cup and washes it. Then he meticulously wipes down the space, and turns towards his next customer.

As he grinds beans and pulls a shot with his lovingly buffed Rocket espresso machine, Hirano grins and says, “This area can accommodate just one person, so the barista has to be able to do everything. This design is common in Tokyo, where spaces are small.”

He adds, “In Japan, people go to the cafe everyday for a cup of coffee before, or after, work. I wanted to create that culture.”

When Hirano moved to India six years ago, a career in coffee was certainly not part of the plan. “I was working in a Japanese automobile company, doing sales and marketing,” he says, adding with a chuckle, “I still do. I have been in this industry for 20 years, working in Japan, Dubai and Malaysia.”

Part of his job involves meeting estate owners to sell pick-up trucks. “I went to Chikmagalur to meet plantation owners, and wherever I went they would say ‘have a cup of coffee. My coffee is good.’ I ended up drinking 15 cups of coffee a day — and they were right. It was very nice,” he says.

Intrigued, he bought green beans from one of the estates and started roasting them at home. “I realised Indian beans are very nice, with well balanced flavours. The challenge is roasting them — if we do proper roasting, we can get a good aroma with fruity flavours.” Hirano was so pleased with the results, he decided to start a cafe with Nandakumar, a colleague at the automobile company. “Actually, he’s my boss,” says Nandakumar, looking up from a pile of cups he is wiping dry.

The duo has trained a barista to run the space while they are at their day jobs. “We come in the evenings. And my wife is supporting us,” says Nandakumar. “On weekends I am always here,” states Hirano, adding that he enjoys meeting customers, many of whom live or work in the neighbourhood and drop by multiple times through the week. “We only serve coffee and pound cake, which I make at home,” he says, “But people are asking for samosas!”

For now, they are keeping the menu deliberately small and simple, as they want to focus on coffee. “We roast at my house, maximum 600 grams at a time, as coffee must be fresh when we serve it,” says Hirano, adding that he still practises pulling shots on his espresso machine at home everyday.

Despite his romance with the cafe, his approach to making coffee is deliberately clinical. He weighs the beans and follows precise measurements and temperatures for each cup. “I even have a manual,” he says, emerging from behind the bar with a hefty laminated book. “Look. We have developed our own filter coffee: We use a French roast for the beans, make a single espresso and foam the milk to 80 degrees.”

The result is a comforting, creamy drink with shades of vanilla. Not even close to authentic filter coffee, admittedly. But still, a fascinating amalgamation: Tokyo-inspired, French-roasted, Chikmagalur-sourced and Chennai-influenced.

375,2020/03/10,How the ‘least smart smart kid’ made it to big league in business,"Stephen Schwarzman, chairman and CEO of The Blackstone Group, says he never had a problem working with people who were ‘smarter’

Businessman, investor and philanthropist Stephen A. Schwarzman never had trouble working with smarter people; he recognised rather early on that though he had a good sense of judgement, in matters of raw intelligence, he could not match up to many others.

Mr. Schwarzman, chairman and CEO of global private equity firm The Blackstone Group, was sharing anecdotes and insights from his recently released book, What It Takes – Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence, at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay campus in Powai.

In conversation with Unique Identification Authority of India founding chairman and Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani, Mr. Schwarzman spoke candidly about being the ‘least smart smart kid’.

Mr. Schwarzman said, “I was 17 years old when I found myself on the waiting list at Harvard. I called up the Dean of Admissions, thinking I could convince him that they had made an error by not admitting me. He, however, told me that I could not simply call him up, and had to go to Yale instead. Years later, I met the same man, who told me that he had been following my career graph over the last 30 years, and said that sometimes bad decisions are taken, which result in the right people not getting admission.”

Today, Mr. Schwarzman is an investor in several universities worldwide, including Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Oxford. “The reason I’ve invested so much in Oxford is because they are really focusing on ethics along with artificial intelligence (AI). They have the best humanities department. MIT, on the other hand, is more technology-centric, and hence I have only focused on boosting their infrastructure,” he said.

Mr. Schwarzman credited his foray into the AI industry to a chance meeting with Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba. The two tycoons met on a bus, where they got talking. “We had a long conversation about how AI is already so big in China and how it is only going to grow in the coming years,” Mr. Schwarzman said.

‘Being up to date’

Mr. Nilekani too recalled his experiences, highlighting the need to always be abreast of technological advancements so as to not be rendered obsolete. This, he said, helped him sustain a multinational corporation.

Mr. Nilekani also harked back to the time when he was setting up Infosys. “When you dream big, people just prefer to let you live in your fantasy world,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/q076xi/article31034485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMSTEPHENSCHWARZMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/how-the-least-smart-smart-kid-made-it-to-big-league-in-business/article31034486.ece

377,2020/03/10,BS-VI: Why are small-capacity engines losing power?,"The shift to BS-VI has resulted in multiple small-capacity motorcycles seeing a drop in power. Here is why...

The past few months have seen a steady stream of BS-VI two-wheeler launches, and almost every one of them has seen a small loss in power and torque. Why is this happening, and why didn’t we see anything as dramatic during the switch from BS-III to BS-IV? The reason is because BS-VI demands a huge step up in terms of emissions control, so much so that nearly every manufacturer has had to switch from carburettors to the more finely controllable fuel-injection (FI) systems. But simply moving to FI isn’t the only cost factor, as another big price implication to consider is the extra precious metal required in the exhaust catalytic converter.

To make a rather broad generalisation, engines that produce more power require more catalyst material. When your motorcycle is a premium machine, raising the price by a few thousands doesn’t really hurt, and that’s why most performance machines from TVS, KTM and others seem to be retaining their power figures. But, when you operate at the cutting edge of frugal engineering, every rupee counts, and so these manufacturers found themselves looking at a price-to-performance ratio that was extremely tricky to balance.

Most seem to have concluded that the riding experience for customers is more important than the specifications on paper. And that riding experience lies largely in the shape and altitude of the engine’s torque curve. With the switch to BS-VI, everyone seems to be trying to smoothen their engine’s power delivery and bring the torque curve lower down in the rev range to where the engines are operating more efficiently. Doing so results in more efficient combustion, which results in fewer emissions for the catalyst material to clean up — i.e. less catalyst material required! Stronger performance at lower RPMs will keep the target customers happy as well. Manufacturers like Honda have developed entirely new small-capacity engines to meet this objective.

Chatting with company officials reveals just how challenging this process was. For example, exhaust back pressure from all that catalyst material, and even the additional electrical load from addition of an FI system can have an effect, and this will be more noticeable on small engines.

Then, there is the fact that engines have traditionally been tuned to run very lean in India, and this is one of the reasons why our fuel efficiency numbers are so good. We could get away with this because India largely has the same topographic and weather conditions. However, lean burning causes more NOx emissions, so we now have to move closer to stoichiometric (or perfect) combustion where all the fuel is burnt. More fuel is burnt in this process, resulting in a small drop in fuel efficiency, but that should be offset by the lowered torque curves.

It is all quite fascinating and if you are out there riding a new BS-VI two-wheeler, it is nice to know just how much work has gone into making sure you have a cleaner mode of transport.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/vaa0jq/article31031430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bgmBS6jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/bs-vi-why-are-small-capacity-engines-losing-power/article31031431.ece
378,2020/03/10,Why Bajaj Auto decided to resurrect the Chetak brand,"Rebirth of a legend: It is hard not to comprehend the reasons behind Bajaj Auto’s decision to resurrect the Chetak brand as it steps into the realm of e-scooters

Nostalgia is such a powerful feeling; it can bring back fond memories of a time gone by. All you need is a trigger. Case in point: the Bajaj Chetak — a name so iconic that it instantly reminds you of the time when a horde of these humble two-strokes buzzed down the road, leaving a thrummy exhaust note and a plume of smoke in their wake.

Fast forward to the present, and it is hard not to comprehend the reasons behind Bajaj Auto’s decision to resurrect the Chetak brand as it steps into the realm of e-scooters.

It may be the marketing masterstroke of all time, but a boardroom decision can only influence the fate of a product to some extent. Beyond that, it is the product’s attributes that could either make or break it. A short spin on this reanimated classic should give us a fair idea.

How does it look?

Forget the marketing spiel for the moment; because as steeped in history as the Chetak name may be, the new e-scooter’s design is chic and contemporary. It is, by far, one of the most gorgeous scooters to hit Indian roads besides a Vespa, and this factor alone will pique interest. Elements such as the LED DRL inside the headlamp (also LED), faux grille on the front apron and a single-piece rear section, result in a design devoid of unsightly panel gaps. The tail-lamps with the integrated, dynamic turn indicators à la Audi cars, look great as well. Bajaj’s decision to employ a trailing link suspension at the front and a single-side swingarm at the rear is also clever, as it puts the alloy wheels on full display. I feel Bajaj has really upped the ante with the Chetak’s build. The paint finish is immaculate too — another area where the Chetak shines.

Features such as flush-style switchgear and a full-digital dash with Bluetooth connectivity round-off the list, and on the whole, the Chetak appeals to visual senses.

Does it perform like a normal scooter?

Don’t go searching for the same feeling you experienced aboard your dad’s noisy, old machine; this Chetak is all about the future form of mobility — electric. It obviously does not produce the mechanical sound, so some of that emotion is lost in the move to electricity.

The electric scooter is powered by a 3.8kW/4.1kW (continuous/peak power) motor that develops 16Nm of torque. The scooter picks up pace quickly as you open the throttle, making it easy to keep up with city traffic. Two ride modes — Eco and Sport — alter the urgency with which the scooter surges ahead; but here is the interesting thing: the ICU or Integrated Control Unit has a sensor that detects throttle position when the scooter is run in Eco mode. Every time the rider twists the grip past 85 percent, the system senses the additional demand for power and switches to Sport mode. This is great for making quick overtakes or while climbing a flyover, and it saves the pain of manually switching between modes. Bajaj has limited the top speed in the interest of keeping the range figure as high as reasonably possible, and we saw 69kph on the dash. A number of main roads in big cities like Mumbai and Delhi tend to host rather fast-moving traffic, so we wish the top speed was somewhere between 75-80kph, in line with the 125cc scooters here.

The IP67-rated Bosch lithium-ion pack is capable of powering the motor for 95 km in ‘Eco’ and 85 km in ‘Sport’. It is quite a practical range for everyday use, and we would like to put it through a thorough test when we get the scooter for a couple of days instead of a couple of hours. Speaking of time, it takes five hours to charge the Chetak’s battery from 0-100%, while 80% becomes available after 3.5 hours. Bajaj will supply a home charger with the electric scooter (included in the price) and get a company technician to install it. The charging cable connects to a 5A socket under the seat, which can be kept shut while charging, making it convenient to leave the scooter unattended. At present, there’s no provision for fast charging.

What is the ride like?

The Chetak’s suspension setup is like any other 110cc scooter, but the trailing link setup at the front does have its limitations. While the ride quality was pretty good over a few speed breakers that we encountered in Pune, the scooter thudded over large expansion gaps and sharp potholes. That aside, the suspension is quite pliant and the Chetak rides like any other petrol-powered, small-capacity scooter. It is also very planted around the bends, with a good grip from the MRFs shod on 12-inch wheels on both ends.

What is in the name?

Quite a lot, actually. After all, the Chetak name has a huge reputation and a deep emotional connect with the Indian populace. While our time with the scooter wasn’t enough to make conclusive verdicts about the overall performance, first impressions are mighty impressive — that the Chetak will make the transition from fuel to electric mobility feel natural and quite premium. The much bigger question of what it is like to live with can only be answered by a proper long-term test, which we can’t wait to get to!",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/qmn9th/article31031399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bgmbajajchetak1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/rebirth-of-a-legend/article31031403.ece

380,2020/03/10,Puducherry Social Welfare Minister threatens to resign,"“The tussle between Chief Minister and Lt. Governor has affected my department most,” says Minister M. Kandasamy.

Social Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy on Tuesday threatened to resign if Lt Governor Kiran Bedi failed to address issues pertaining to his department within a period of three months.

Speaking at a Women’s Day function in the presence of Ms Bedi, the Minister said the power struggle between the Lt Governor and Chief Minister has halted the progress of the Union Territory.

“The Lt Governor has proved her mettle as a police officer. Similarly, the Chief Minister has a proven administrative track record of several years. My wish is to see both functioning together for betterment of the UT. The tussle has affected my department the most,” the Minister said.

Stating that he was not able to explain to the people about the delay in giving free rice or non-payment of salary to hundreds of people in the cooperative sector, Mr Kandasamy said, “If I am not able to deliver, there is no point in continuing as Minister. I will wait for three months or else will inform Congress president Sonia Gandhi and resign from the post,” he said.

In a memorandum submitted to the Lt Governor after winding up his speech, the Minister said if the Lt Governor failed to resolve the issues, he would be forced to resign and “forced to join together with the people as a citizen of UT for launching a peaceful protest.”

Listing out his grievances, the Minister said the government was not able to pay cash or distribute rice to ration cardholders for the last 22 months.

Salary was not paid to employees of Public Distribution Outlets, Puducherry Agro Products Food and Civil Supplies Corporation Limited, Puducherry Cooperative Spinning Mills and Cooperative Sugar Mills.

“Anganwadi workers could not be paid salary on time. The L-G has no valid reasons for delaying the grants. By not filling vacancies, the L-G is trying to shut down Anganwadi centres,” the Minister charged.

Accusing the Lt Governor of blocking implementation of free higher education scheme for Adi Dravidar students, the Minister said, “Various obstacles are being imposed on the services by Adi Dravidar Welfare and Scheduled Tribe Welfare Department.”

Without mentioning anything about the remarks made by the Minister, Ms Bedi, in her address which followed, spoke about the advantages the UT has and also urged the women to participate actively whenever the local body elections are held.

The UT was in an advantageous position when it came to women’s security, women’s literacy, counselling centres and the keen interest shown by women in the education of their wards.

Appealing to the women to participate actively in the local body elections, the Lt Governor said grassroot democracy was vital to the development of a region. She also honoured women conservancy workers and women achievers in various fields.

381,2020/03/10,Old lighthouse to be renovated,"The 184-year-old heritage structure will be ready by March 2021

The iconic 19th century lighthouse, a Grade -I listed heritage building on the Beach Promenade, will soon regain its old glory with the Union Ministry of Finance giving the green light for its restoration.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) will take up the work estimated to cost ₹3.32 crore.

The renovated lighthouse is expected to be open to tourists by March 2021.

The 184-year-old heritage structure is a landmark that cannot be missed by tourists along Goubert Avenue. It forms part of an ensemble of important buildings such as the Mairie, Customs House and the French Consulate.

“The restoration work includes replacement of rafters and beams and re-plastering of the structure. CPWD will be taking up landscaping with proper pathways and greenery. Once the restoration is complete, the structure is going to be the pride of Puducherry and will be an added attraction on the Boulevard. Anybody who visits Puducherry must make it a point to visit the lighthouse said G. Ravindranath, Commissioner of GST and Central Excise.

The old lighthouse is said to be the highest point in Puducherry and the Department of Customs and Central Excise (C&CE) — which controls the building and has offices in a portion of it, is studying the feasibility of keeping tripod mounted binoculars near the dome for an aerial view of the city.

Tourists will be allowed in small batches in intervals and we are planning to bring out souvenirs including small replicas, key chains and T-shirts of the structure, he said.

First on east coast

Built by the French in 1836 to guide the mariners coming to Puducherry, the old lighthouse is said to be the first lighthouse on the coromandel coast and one among the 21 heritage buildings notified by the government as protected and to be restored.

“In March 1836, the lighthouse was erected by engineer L. Guerre. It started off with 12 oil lamps magnified by lenses and mirrors and the light was visible to a distance of 15 to 17 metres. The oil lamps were later replaced by a rotating battery-powered beam that could be seen 25 metres away. The lighthouse was last deactivated in 1979,” according to Ashok Panda, co-convenor of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH).

The lighthouse is a landmark that cannot be missed by tourists along Goubert Avenue. It is a load-bearing structure with Madras terrace and was built in brick and lime mortar with lime plaster. The fluted tapering tower standing tall about 29 metres was originally built on a square base with a room for a watchman and an inner staircase.

The upper storey with 218 wooden steps leading to the tower was added during the 20th century, Mr. Panda said.

Suggestions invited

Mr. Ravindranath said locals could come up with innovative ideas and suggestions on how best we could improve the experience of tourists visiting the lighthouse.

He also released the SBV’s revised policy on “Healthcare incubation and Startup”.

On the occasion, Prof. Parija said that, “constant introspection, scientific temper and indigenous thinking is the need of the hour.”

Startup India is a unique initiative by the Government of India to propel young professionals to choose entrepreneurship as a cherished career option.

The Healthcare incubation and startup facilitated at SBV would go a long way in encouraging innovation in health sciences that would eventually pave way for technology transfer in nodal areas that would be economically viable for all the stakeholders, he said. As a part of the endeavour, SBV will promulgate startup activities culminating in technology transfer for societal development, he added.

Chronic kidney disease on the rise: study

A survey by Sri Manakula Vinayagar Medical College and Hospital has found a surprisingly high magnitude of chronic kidney disease in rural Puducherry.

D. Rajagovindan, Director of SVMCH, said the survey among 500 people in 13 villages of Puducherry found that 24% people above 50 years of age had chronic kidney disease.

This study was done by P. Ravi Kumar, Amol Rambhau Dongre and a team from the Department of Nephrology and Department of Community and was supported by the SMVMCH management.

Though there is a rise in CKD problem globally, the magnitude of the disease in this region is much higher than expected, Dr. Ravi Kumar said.

Dr. Ravikumar and Dr. Amol Rambhau Dongre suspected the role of environmental origin of this problem as it has been linked to environmental toxins in the past research in other coastal belts in India and elsewhere.

Terminal stage of CKD leads to reduced quality of life in patients, sudden death and financial burden to patients and their caregivers.

The study found that the problem increases with rise in age, poor nutrition and presence of other chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.

The Commissioner, in his complaint, said the AIUTUC leader had approached him seeking action against two firms based at Sedarapet Industrial estate.

387,2020/03/10,New order to help students with diabetes in exam hall,"They are allowed to keep insulin pumps and food with them

Students with Type 1 diabetes can now keep insulin pump, insulin pen, water, sugar tablet, chocolate, candy, fruits, and snacks with them in examination halls after getting these inspected by invigilators.

This follows an amendment by the government of its earlier order issued in February last year that students with Type 1 diabetes could take their insulin pump, insulin pen, water, sugar tablet, chocolate, candy, fruits, and snacks into examination halls but had to leave these with invigilators and receive these whenever required. The amendment comes in the wake of the finding by the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights that taking off the insulin pump which could be attached to the body of a Type 1 diabetic student round the clock could adversely affect the student’s health.

In times of emergency, an invigilator might not be able to hand it to a student who required it immediately. In such cases, the student’s health could be adversely affected, the commission had found.

The Transport Commissioner has issued orders that all buses display the phone numbers of the regional transport officer, sub-regional transport officer, and police station concerned so that passengers, both children and adults, can complain about the problems experienced by them during travel.

The orders comes in the wake of a recommendation by the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights.

The order says that ‘travel committees’ should meet once every three months under the District Collector and review the problems faced by children in private vehicles.

Bus staff should not be encouraged to monopolise vacant seats at the expense of students. Inspections should be held regularly to check if the numbers have been displayed on buses. Strict action should be taken against bus owners and employees who do not follow the orders.

A committee presided over by the District Collector to address students’ grievances should meet once every three months, the order said.

Immediately after the completion of the pongala ritual, Railways operated the Thiruvananthapuram Central-Kollam Special from Thiruvananthapuram Central at 2.30 p.m. The second special train to Kollam was operated at 4.15 p.m. At 5.30 p.m, another special train was operated to Kollam.

The Kochuveli-Nagercoil special train left at 4.30 p.m. Train 56315 Thiruvananthapuram Central-Nagercoil Passenger, scheduled to leave Thiruvananthapuram Central at 5.10 p.m., was advanced and left here at 3 p.m.

Train 56317 Kochuveli-Nagercoil passenger train, scheduled to leave Kochuveli at 11.40 a.m., was rescheduled to leave Kochuveli at 1.45 p.m. to clear the extra rush of devotees.

Additional stoppages for 13 trains and augmentation of extra coaches in 10 passenger trains also helped to clear the rush.

Buses from various spots

The KSRTC pooled 270 buses in the capital for clearing the rush of women devotees. Till 5.30 p.m., the KSRTC operated 432 long-distance services. From Fort HS, Kamaleswaram, Pappanamcode, Karamana, Killippalam, Panavila, Bakery Junction, Statue, Velayambalam and PMG, the KSRTC operated 300 ordinary services for the benefit of the women devotees.

At many places, the KSRTC employees and the police personnel worked hand in hand to regulate traffic and enable the women to board the buses. The presence of the sub inspectors from the traffic wing also ensured there were no traffic snarls at the junctions from where the KSRTC operated the services.

Operation plan

KSRTC Chairman and Managing Director M.P. Dinesh talked to the police officials to ensure the smooth operation of services. Superintendent of Police V. Ajith visited the South Zone office of the KSRTC and held discussions. The KSRTC prepared the service operation plan for buses in consultation with Assistant Commissioner of Police, Traffic, South, M.K. Zulfikar.

391,2020/03/10,Huge participation for pongala as usual,"Some devotees sport masks in view of COVID-19

The number of COVID-19 cases may be inching up in the State but it hardly cast a shadow over the Attukal Pongala festivities in the city on Monday.

But for the presence of women sporting masks, surveillance by health authorities, and announcements by local organisers on precautions to be taken against the COVID-19 infection, the festival was held in the usual environment of devotion and bonhomie.

K. Lalitha Bai, a retired government employee who has been offering pongala at her apartment complex at EMS Nagar at Pattoor for the past 15 years, said the crowd near the apartment was more than usual.

She said she did not know of any women in the complex who had not offered pongala owing to fears over COVID-19. The Health authorities, she said, had conducted a survey and taken down names and details of women who had come to offer pongala from districts beyond Kollam.

Vijayalakshmi, a domestic worker, said she had turned up to offer pongala near Eenchakkal without any worries about COVID-19.

There was a good crowd present in the locality, and there was little talk about the disease among the women. As the festival was held once a year, nothing much could dissuade the women from attending it.

Some back off

Divya Dipu, a doctor, said she had offered pongala at her maternal home at Manacaud.

The crowd in her residents’ association seemed a bit thinner than usual, but the Attukal temple was crowded even at 1 a.m. early Monday.

Since she was offering pongala at her house and the people in the locality were local residents or people known to them, she was not worried about COVID-19. However, a few relatives who usually turned up to offer pongala had kept away this year.

Regular announcements were being made by the association on the precautions against COVID-19 and asking people with fever and cough to be extra careful.

Many wore masks, but nothing seemed to have dampened the enthusiasm of women offering pongala, Sharika, a homemaker who offered pongala opposite the AG’s Office, said.

The crowd, in fact, seemed more than that last year. She said she was not unduly worried about the COVID-19 scare.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/to2eap/article31027153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TVATTUKALPONGALA3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/huge-participation-for-pongala-as-usual/article31027154.ece

The police and Fire and Rescue Services personnel remained active during the Attukal Pongala on Monday to ensure the smooth conduct of the festival.

Officials of the Kerala Fire and Rescue Services attended to 97 devotees who had to be hospitalised. While many sustained burns, some others collapsed in the searing heat while offering pongala.

The fire force also ensured that a fire outbreak at the Manacaud market was doused quickly. The incident occurred shortly after the pongala ritual when fire from a hearth spread to a waste dump nearby.

Rajaji Nagar fire station officer G. Suresh Kumar said that a major disaster was averted owing to the presence of a large number of fire tenders in various parts of the city. As many as 32 fire tenders were deployed on account of the pongala from various fire stations from districts as far as Ernakulam.

Extinguisher points

A total of 426 fire force personnel were deployed as part of precautionary steps. Also, 97 fire-extinguisher points were set up. Sixty civil defence volunteers, including women, boosted the efforts of the fire force in providing first aid to people and assisting in shifting them, and clearing emergency routes for ambulances.

The deployment of around 3,000 police officers proved effective in crowd management and maintenance of law and order.

No major untoward incidents were reported, sources said. While vehicular traffic was largely restored within an hour of the completion of the pongala, traffic snarls were reported in certain parts, including Maruthoorkadavu and Kazhakuttam.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/police-fire-force-ensure-a-smooth-pongala/article31027128.ece
395,2020/03/10,Euro League | Leicester blanks Aston Villa,"Vardy ends goal drought to become the league’s top-scorer

Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy ended his long scoring drought with two goals after coming off the bench as it returned to winning ways with a 4-0 drubbing of Premier League struggler Aston Villa at the King Power Stadium on Monday.

Leicester’s goal-machine Vardy had not found the net since December but converted a penalty just past the hour to double Leicester’s lead shortly after replacing Kelechi Iheanacho.

Harvey Barnes had opened the scoring before half-time after a dreadful misjudgement by Villa ’keeper Pepe Reina.

Vardy struck again after 79 minutes to take his league tally to 19 goals for the season before Barnes claimed his second.

It was the Foxes first win in five league games, ending a slump that had put its top-four place and hopes of qualifying for Champions League football next season in peril.

Caputo shines

Francesco Caputo scored a double as Sassuolo beat Brescia 3-0 on Monday in a match which could be the last in Serie A for a month because of the coronavirus epidemic. In an empty Mapei Stadium in Reggio Emilia, Caputo opened the scoring just before half time off a Gregoire Defrel cross. He added a second on the hour to bring his tally this season to 13 goals.

The results: Premier League: Leicester 4 (Barnes 40, 85, Vardy 63-pen, 79) bt Aston Villa 0.

396,2020/03/10,Bagan regains I-League title in style,"Diawara’s spectacular strike does the trick; matches Dempo SC’s record

Babacar Diawara’s spectacular 80th-minute finish ensured Mohun Bagan’s crowning glory moment in the I-League at the Kalyani Stadium here on Tuesday. With the clash against Aizawl FC seemingly headed for a tame draw, Diawara’s winner ensured the full three points took Bagan’s tally to an unassailable 39 from 16 matches.

Bagan thus matched Dempo SC’s record — set in the 2009-10 season — of claiming the league title with four rounds to spare. If the NFL — the previous version of the league — and I-League are considered together then Bagan has also equalled Dempo’s tally of five titles. Dempo has three I-League and two NFL crowns while Bagan collected its second I-League title to add to the three NFL titles won previously.

Bagan, which will play in the ISL from next season having being acquired by ATK this year, thus made its last I-League season memorable.

Drab affair

The first half was a drab affair with neither opponent showing enough attacking intent.

The possession-based football that Bagan mastered under its Spanish coach Kibu Vicuna this season was largely absent as the host lacked the initiative to break into the opposition defence.

Aizawl FC, meanwhile, did a fairly good job in defence employing two towering centre-backs — Ghanaian Joseph Adjei and Ugandan Juuko Richard — whose strong physical presence posed a big challenge for Bagan’s attackers.

Aizawl, coached by Stanly Rozario, played the right game with regular counter-attacks that detained the host from going all out.

Good chance

Bagan created a good chance in the last minute of the opening half when Diawara released Tajikistan winger Komron Tursunov unmarked inside the box. The latter, however, failed to keep send attempt on target.

Bagan continued to struggle in the second half seeing most of its attacks fizzle out before the Aizawl FC box.

After a number of failed opportunities, emerging especially from set-piece situations, play-maker Joseba Beitia managed to create the opening that was finished brilliantly by Diawara. With this the Senegalese striker scored his 10th goal in 12 matches to become Bagan’s top scorer this term.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fe854n/article31033769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11BAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bagan-regains-i-league-title-in-style/article31033770.ece
397,2020/03/10,I-League | Mohun Bagan clinches title after beating Aizawl FC,"Senegalese striker Baba Diawara scored the all-important goal for Mohun Bagan in the 80th minute to beat former champions 1-0.

Indian football heavyweights Mohun Bagan clinched their second I-League title with a 1-0 win over Aizawl FC with four rounds to go in the season here on Tuesday.

Prolific Senegalese striker Baba Diawara scored the all-important goal for Mohun Bagan in the 80th minute to beat former champions Aizawl in their 16th round match and give their supporters a memorable Holi gift.

It was former Sevilla striker’s 10th goal from nine consecutive games.

With Tuesday’s win at the Kalyani Municipality Stadium, Mohun Bagan have 39 points from 16 matches.

They are 16 points ahead of second-placed East Bengal (23 points from 16 matches) who cannot catch up their arch city rivals even if they win all their four remaining matches.

Mohun Bagan, who won their first I-League title in 2014-15 season, also matched Dempo’s record of wrapping up I-League title with maximum matches left to play.

Dempo SC of Goa had also sealed the I-League title in 2009-10 season with four matches left to play.

The title in their pocket, Mohun Bagan will also enter their second leg Kolkata Derby match against arch rivals East Bengal on Sunday with a psychological advantage. They had beaten East Bengal 2-1 in the first leg on January 19.

Aizawl were not, however, intimidated either by the occasion or the 17,000 partisan home crowd which had packed the stands as they dished out a thoroughly professional performance in the first half.

Joe Zoeherliana and Rochharzela were a constant threat on the right and Paul Ramfangzuawa was also getting himself into a lot of space in the middle of the park.

Rochharzela, in fact, had the first crack at goal in the 12th minute and goalkeeper Sankar had to go full stretch to bring about his first save of the game. He had a second crack in the 34th minute, this time from a closer range, but was wide of the target.

The visitors’ defence was also much more organised and Ghanaian Joseph Adjei’s marking of Diawara was paying initial dividends.

Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, had more possession in the first quarter of the hour but were finding it difficult to get a clear sight at goal. Diawara almost dribbled through once from a Tursunov-Naorem move and Suhair had the first shot on target from a distance for the home side at the half-hour mark.

The deadlock remained at the end of the first 45 minutes and to Aizawl’s credit, they did not put a step back even in the second half.

Jaryan hit a free-kick early but it went straight to Sankar and that was probably the last strong approach Aizawl had in the game.

Mohun Bagan began to step up with around 20 minutes left on the clock. Naorem found Diawara with a fine ball inside the goalkeeper’s area but Zothanmawia did well to snatch it from his head and Ashutosh Mehta had a go at the Aizawl goal but missed the target.

Beitia then initiated a move that involved successively Naorem, Tursunov and finally Mehta, but the resulting cross which met with a Diawara header went off target.

The title-winning goal finally came in the 80th minute to send the Kalyani Stadium into a frenzy. It was Beitia again who began the move and after reaching near the box, squared the ball to Diawara.

Kasagga could have done better to stop the ball from reaching Diawara but once it was with the Senagalese striker and with space in front of him, it was always going to be dangerous.

Diawara once again came up with a clinical finish under pressure as he unleashed a fierce grounder which beat the Aizawl keeper all along to hit the net.

As Mohun Bagan saw off the final minutes, the stands erupted in colourful celebrations with emotions running high.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/m8xwzv/article31032295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FOOTBALLILEAGUEMOHUNBAGANVSPUNJAB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/i-league-mohun-bagan-clinches-title-after-beating-aizawl-fc/article31032296.ece

399,2020/03/10,"Coronavirus | Serie A, all sport in Italy halted","Italy’s National Olympic Committee (CONI), which has authority over all national sports federations, had recommended “sporting activities at all levels” be suspended until April 3 to help contain the Covid-19 outbreak

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the suspension until April 3 of all sporting events in the country, including the top-flight Serie A football league, as Italy grapples with the coronavirus crisis.

The final Serie A game before government announcement saw Sassuolo beat Brescia 3-0 behind closed doors in Reggio Emilia on Monday.

After scoring his opening goal Sassuolo striker Francesco Caputo held up a handwritten message on piece of paper, urging fans: “Everything will be fine. Stay at home.”

A few hours later the Prime Minister used similar words as he announced a countrywide lockdown.

“I am going to sign a decree that can be summarised as follows: I stay at home,” Mr. Conte announced in a dramatic evening television address.

The unprecedented measures limiting travel and banning public gatherings across the country of more than 60 million people came after 97 more deaths took Italy’s toll to 463.

The measures include the closure of schools, universities and the suspension of sports competitions.

“There is no reason why matches and sporting events should continue and I am thinking of the football championship,” said Mr. Conte.

“I’m sorry but all the fans must take note of it, we will not even allow gyms to be used for sports activities,” he added.

The decree allows the possibility of organising matches under international jurisdiction behind closed doors, such as ties in UEFA’s Champions League and Europa League.

Juventus are due to host Lyon in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie in Turin next week. Inter Milan are due to host Spain’s Getafe in the Europa League on Thursday while Roma welcome Sevilla a week later.

Earlier Monday, Italy’s National Olympic Committee (CONI), which has authority over all national sports federations, had recommended “sporting activities at all levels” be suspended until April 3 to help contain the virus outbreak and called for a government decree to enforce the request.

The decree, which goes beyond sport and provides for draconian new measures to combat the coronavirus, will come into force on Tuesday throughout Italy, the second most-affected country after China.

Since Sunday, there had been growing calls to stop sports competitions and in particular Serie A, with lower football leagues already paused.

Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora called for the suspension of Serie A while Italian Footballers’ Association president Damiano Tommasi tweeted that “stopping football is the most useful thing for our country right now”.

Other sports

On Monday several Italian federations, such as those in swimming and winter sports, announced the end of competitive activities, joining rugby and volleyball which had been already suspended.

Serie A is now frozen after 26 games out of 38 in the season, with eight-time reigning champions Juventus leading the table one point ahead of Lazio. Inter Milan are third, nine points behind, with a game in hand.

Questions remain about getting the season finished. At least three rounds of matches will need to be rearranged after April 3 before the end of the season scheduled for May 24.

There is little room for manoeuvre because of Euro 2020 beginning on June 12. And there are also concerns that Euro 2020, due to be hosted across 12 countries including Italy, might face an unprecedented cancellation.

400,2020/03/10,Bypassed devotees forced to walk two km,"Devotees visiting Mariamman Temple at Samayapuram by mofussil buses face much hardship as they are forced to trek a long distance to reach the shrine from Tiruchi-Chennai National Highway.

Mofussil buses, both private and government-run, plying on Tiruchi-Perambalur-Tiruchi and Tiruchi-Cuddalore-Tiruchi routes prefer to go via the highway, skipping the Samayapuram Four Roads Junction, which entails a detour of less than two km. Consequently, devotees have to board or alight from the buses at bus halts along the highway.

Persistent representations to authorities seeking operation of buses via Samayapuram Four Roads Junction, which is closer to the temple, have gone unheeded, complain a section of devotees.

They point out that before four-laning of Tiruchi-Chennai National Highway all buses went via Samayapuram Four Roads junction.

But ever since a bypass road was built as part of the four-lane project, to prevent congestion at Samayapuram junction, devotees have been forced to trek nearly two km to reach the temple. They contend that the bypass was meant for long distance buses and not for mofussil buses operating on short distances.

Recently, the National Highways Authority of India built a service lane from the left side of the highway providing direct access to the temple for vehicles coming from Perambalur/Chennai side. The service lane fulfilled a long-felt need, but has come as little relief to pedestrians.

“Even after construction of the service lane, mofussil buses from Perambalur and Cuddalore to Tiruchi do not go via them. I have submitted representations to Collectors of Tiruchi, Perambalur and Cuddalore pressing the demand. Previously, they said the problem will be sorted out once the service lane is built. But till today, the buses do not go via the service lane,” said Saravanan Natesan, a resident of Puthanampatti and regular visitor to the temple.

He also points out that buses plying in the opposite direction, from Tiruchi to Perambalur and Cuddalore, too do not go via the service lane. Most devotees reach Samayapuram by buses plying on Perambalur and Cuddalore routes. Hence, a large number of them face much hardship.

The Mariamman temple, situated on the outskirts of Tiruchi, draws devotees in droves on weekends and on Amavasya and Pournami. Annual festivals such as Thai Poosam, Poochorithal, Chithirai and Navarathri also attract thousands of devotees. This year’s Poochorithal festival began last Sunday and will continue over the next three Sundays during the Tamil month of Masi, when thousands visit the deity to offer flowers.

“The temple attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims right through the year and is said to be among the highest revenue generating temple in the State. The authorities should ensure that all necessary amenities were provided to the devotees,” Mr. Natesan said.

The bus terminus built in 2003 for mofussil buses near the Four Roads Junction was lying in disuse. Bus shelters on the highway do not have proper amenities such as drinking water or toilets.

Pedestrians risk their lives as they attempt to cross the highway to reach the bus halts on either side of the highway. In the absence of proper lighting, it has become a dangerous trek for devotees to and from the temple during the nights. People are even being waylaid, he lists out.

P. Ayyarappan, a resident of Allur, points out that women and senior citizens are the worst sufferers. Buses operating on Tiruchi-Madurai route still go via Viralimalai even after a by-pass road was laid around the town.

“Only a few passengers alight or board mofussil buses at Viralimalai. When buses plying on this route can go via an important temple, why not buses operating on Perambalur route go via Samayapuram, which attracts a huge number of passengers,” he wonders.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/73bw17/article31034292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY11-MOFUSSILBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/bypassed-devotees-forced-to-walk-two-km/article31034293.ece

This is to be carried out at all terminal/ originating stations.

The Principal Chief Mechanical Engineer has been asked to arrange for cleaning of coaches using disinfectant during every primary maintenance. The note instructed all Divisional Railway Managers of the zone to conduct awareness campaign among railway employees to prevent the spread of the cases and protect staff.

It asked the railway staff to seek medical care if they had fever, cough, difficulty in breathing and stay home. The medical department has been asked to maintain a close liaison with the State Health Department and take necessary measures in railways as required. The Principal Chief Medical Director and Principal Chief Commercial Manager have been instructed to keep a database containing the recent travel history of suspected passengers and staff along with their address, mobile and Aadhar number.

A senior divisional railway officer here said consequent to the Southern Railway administration’s instruction passenger coaches of express trains owned by the Tiruchi Railway Division were being disinfected intensively at the Broad Gauge Coaching Complex at Tiruchi and Villupuram Junction.

The exercise commenced from Monday onwards at the two coaching complexes, the railway official said adding that the Tiruchi Coaching Complex alone owned over 400 passenger coaches. This include compartments of the Chennai - Thanjavur - Chennai Uzhavan expresses, Tiruchi - Thiruvananthapuram - Tiruchi Inter City Expresses, Tiruchi - Howrah- Tiruchi and Mannargudi - Bhagat Ki Kothi - Mannargudi expresses. The coaches were being disinfected and when they come for primary maintenance at the coaching complex.

In addition to owning coaches of express trains, the Tiruchi Broad Gauge Coaching Complex also holds some rakes of passenger trains besides Diesel Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) rakes. Special attention was being to paid to vulnerable spots such as hand rails, water taps, gangways, toilet door handle during the cleaning exercise, the official added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ey47gc/article31034267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY11-VIRUSCOACH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-rail-coaches-disinfected-in-tiruchi-division/article31034268.ece
402,2020/03/10,Downward spiral in cost of chicken,"Customers fear contracting COVID-19 due to consumption, sellers say

The cost of broiler chicken has plummeted at retail points in and around the city even as poultries have seemingly gone for panic sale following COVID-19 scare.

A section of customers, sellers lamented, are gripped by the fear of contracting COVID-19 due to consumption of chicken after circulation os “misleading information” in social media.

“The situation was really bad a few days ago. We could not find buyers even when the dressed broiler chicken was sold for only ₹60 per kg, which was less than half the the usual price. Now, the price has stabilised to ₹100 per kg. But there is no indication that the price will improve any time soon,” Manimaran, a chicken outlet owner in Thuvakudi said.

A small solace is that the restaurants have not stopped their usual transactions, he said.

There is, nevertheless, a fear that the tough situation faced a few years ago in the wake of avian influenza outbreak may arise again.

“There were no buyers then even when chicken meat was sold for only ₹40 per kg. We earnestly hope that the price will stabilise further in the coming days,: Razaak, another chicken outlet owner based in Tiruverumbur, said.

Non-vegetarian hotels, meanwhile, continue to cater to the usual number of customers.

“There has been no notable decline in the number of customers in the wake of the COVID-19 scare,” manager of a leading non-vegetarian restaurants in the city said.

“The slump in sales can be because of the outbreak of bird flu in neighbouring Kerala. A drop in price of chicken at this time of the year is not unusual. But the steep fall can be attributed to the bird flu,"" Regional Joint Director of Animal Husbandry Esther Sheela said.

“There is no scientific evidence so far to establish bird to human or animal to human transmission of COVID-19 virus,” she said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/downward-spiral-in-cost-of-chicken/article31034234.ece
403,2020/03/10,Fisheries Department conducts first crackdown on banned nets,"3,700 kg of sardine confiscated by MEW personnel

In the first operation carried out at Poompuhar coast on Tuesday after deployment of Marine Enforcement Wing (MEW) personnel, officials of the Fisheries Department detained two vehicles transporting fish caught with banned purse seine nets and auctioned the catch.

About 3,700 kg of sardine fish that was confiscated at 2 p.m. was transported in a vehicle provided to the MEW team and auctioned at Nagapattinam within two hours of the operation, Amal Raj Xavier, Joint Director of Fisheries, said.

The mandate of the Marine Enforcement Wing was to curb banned fishing practices such as use of purse seine, pair trawling, and use of higher than permitted power of motors in mechanised boats.

“It is due to the presence of the MEW team that we can move out of the location immediately. Hitherto, the delay in operation due to dependency on local police used to lead to commotion caused by a belligerent section of fishers,” the senior official said.

The confiscated fish was auctioned for ₹70,300. The catch would have fetched much more had it been auctioned early morning hours when there would be Kerala-based buyers.

The amount would be deposited in the government account, Mr. Amal Raj Xavier said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/j284w/article31034211.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY11-FISHCONFISCATED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/fisheries-department-conducts-first-crackdown-on-banned-nets/article31034212.ece

405,2020/03/10,Impart self-defence skills to girls: Tamilisai,"Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan on Tuesday urged the State government to impart self-defence skills to girls in schools and colleges.

Speaking at International Women’s Day celebration organised by All Women’s Associations of Tiruchi and Shrimati Indira Gandhi College here, she said it was painful to read about incidences of crime against women such as sexual harassment, abduction and gang rape. No woman should undergo the predicament of sexual harassment.

Terming those who indulged in such heinous crimes as “inhuman”, Ms. Soundararajan said there was no need to show any mercy to them. Capital punishment was the best way to deal with them. It was important for girls to learn self-defence to protect themselves from sexual advances.

She said she had appealed to the Telangana government to introduce courses on self-defence to girls in schools and colleges. The Tamil Nadu government too should introduce such courses. It would not only build confidence among girls but also develop their physical and mental strength. It would also enable them to face unexpected circumstances and protect themselves.

Stressing the importance of empowerment, the Governor said there were many avenues for women to take up new challenges. They should not confine themselves to domestic chores. They could consider entering politics or make use of opportunities to take up jobs or turn entrepreneurs. Although women faced many challenges, they had inbuilt ability to face them successfully. They should never give up confidence under any circumstance.

K. Meena, former Vice-Chancellor, Bharathidasan University, said the country had produced a number of women stalwarts in various fields right from freedom struggle and politics to public administration, research, astronomy, education to sports. Many of them made their mark in their respective fields. Women power should be utilised well for the growth of the country.

Jambaga Ramakrishnan, co-ordinator, All Women’s Associations, and others spoke.

Ms. Soundarararjan gave away excellence awards to Saraswathi Ramanathan, Tamil scholar, Akila Narayanswami, spiritualist, A. Sarmila, gynaecologist, and Vijaya Vadivel, social worker.

406,2020/03/10,Will locals root for these young trees?,"Rooted tree branches planted along Needamangalam-Mannargudi Road in November last are to be watered this summer.

The idea to plant rooted tree branches (boanthus in Tamil), instead of regular saplings, was conceived by a Needamangalam-based NGO, Green Needa, as meteorologists had predicted good rain in December last.

Leaves began to sprout on nearly 80% of the 2,000 rooted tree branches, planted along a 12-km stretch by more than 800 people, mostly school and college students from Needamangalam, Mannargudi and nearby areas, said G. Rajavelu of Green Needa.

In order to sustain their growth, the trees would be watered once or twice a week using water tankers and by locals, wherever possible.

To begin with, ₹3,500 was contributed by locals and the rooted tree branches were watered using a mini-water tanker on March 1 and Sunday last. With summer approaching, at least two water tankers would be required to keep the roots wet. The NGO was hopeful that it would receive support from environment enthusiasts and locals to ensure that the young trees withstood the summer heat.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/will-locals-root-for-these-young-trees/article31032654.ece

Banana growers in Tiruchi-Karur belt are sore over crash in price of nendran variety early in the harvest season.

This is the second consecutive year that farmers are airing such complaints. Farmers complained that the field price of nendran banana has crashed to ₹10 a kg from the usual ₹35-40 a kg. The variety is mainly purchased by traders from Kerala, who supply the fruit for making chips there.

Banana is a major crop grown in the Tiruchi-Karur belt and a large number of farmers raise the nendran variety depending on the Kerala market, points out Puliyur A. Nagarajan, president,farmers wing of the Tamil Maanila Congress.

“Farmers raise the variety depending on the Kerala market. Now the fruit price has crashed to ₹10 a kg whereas farmers have to spend ₹50 for producing the same. The price crash has become a regular feature every year now,” Mr. Nagarajan claimed. Heavy arrivals of the fruit in Kerala market is said to have led to the price crash.

Putting forth a series of demands before the government as farmers are repeatedly suffering due to price fluctuations, Mr. Nagarajan urged the government to fix the minimum support price for bananas.

He also demanded that the government procure the banana at ₹50 a kg and supply a banana each to children under the noon meal scheme. The government should provide training to women’s groups on value addition in banana by promoting cottage units.

Cold storages should be created and storage space should be offered to farmers free of cost so that they can hold the produce till the price appreciates. Beside, the banana growing belt in Tiruchi and Karur should be declared as a special banana zone for promoting banana cultivation, value addition and exports, he demanded.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ulkjn2/article31029355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY10BANANATRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/price-of-nendran-banana-crashes-to-10-a-kg/article31029356.ece

415,2020/03/10,Phase III of UGD project awaits ADB’s nod,"Tiruchi Corporation is awaiting clearance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the funding agency, for issuing work order for the execution of phase III of the underground drainage (UGD) project in the city.

It is aimed at bring all households in wards 37, 39, 40 and 41 and a section of households in 31, 35, 36, 38, 42, 43, 45, 52 and 53 wards under the underground drainage systemy. Construction of seven pumping stations and 11 lifting stations, laying of pumping mains for 21.5 km and sewage lines for 331 are among the important salient features of the project. In all it has been designed to provide UGD connection to 32,000 households.

The Corporation, which had floated a tender for the project to be implemented at an estimate of ₹321 crore a year ago, aborted the tender process as the lone bidder quoted ₹60 crore more than the original estimate. It then revisited the project and the estimate was revised to ₹336 crore by taking into account the current year’s market price. After completing all mandatory practices, the Corporation called for re-tender a few months ago. It was learnt that the price bid had been opened and the civic body had short-listed Larson &Toubro for executing the project.

However, the Corporation is awaiting approval of the ADB for awarding the work order. A senior official of the Corporation told The Hindu that it had submitted all documents of the tender and technical competency of the successful bidder to the financial institutions, including ADB for scrutiny. It was under the active consideration of the ADB. Once it extended its approval, the work order would be issued to the successful bidder. The approval was expected shortly. The official added that it would take at least three years to complete the work on phase III of the UGD from the date of issuing work order. However, considering the capacity of the shortlisted company, the work was expected to be completed well before the deadline. After completion of the project, at least 85% to 95% of the households and commercial houses in the city would have access to underground drainage network system.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/phase-iii-of-ugd-project-awaits-adbs-nod/article31029347.ece

Sporting traditional attire, hundreds of Marwari men and women under the aegis of Rajasthani Sankrutika Samaj celebrated ‘Holika Dahan’ at RK Beach in the evening. They also celebrated ‘Chhoti Holi.’

“A sacred threat (Kachha Soot) is tied to ‘Holika Dahan’ marking the triumph of good over evil power burning negative energies,” Samaj executive member Naresh Agarwal said.

Dola Poornima

Dola Poornima was celebrated by Odias at a ceremony organised by Ukal Sanskrutika Samaj complex on Daspalla Hills. Dola Poornima or the full moon day of spring is celebrated as Holi every year a day before the festival of colours by Odias.

“It is also called Basant Utsav as the spring season culminates. It also commemorates the romance Lord Sri Krishna had with Sri Radha and the Gopis in Brundaban by playing colours with them,” an office-bearer of Samaj said.

The celebration commenced traditionally by offering colour powder known as ‘Phagu’ to the Lord Jagannath, considered an avatar of Lord Sri Krishna. Devotees rendered soulful bhajans and it was followed by keertan and prasad distribution.

420,2020/03/10,GVMC polls: political parties race against time,"‘Choosing right candidates amid tight schedule a tough task’

Political parties have to race against time to fight the local body polls, as the entire schedule have been compressed into a less than two weeks—13 days to be precise.

Though the government has been hinting at holding the elections at short notice, it is the delimitation of wards that has left the leaders with a difficult choice.

At present, the GVMC has 98 wards. Many corporators who had earlier represented the wards have found the same has been reserved for women after delimitation and this has turned out to be a limiting factor.

One ward is reserved for ST (general), four each for SC (women) and general categories respectively, 16 for BC (women) and 17 for BC (general), 29 for women (general) and 27 wards are unreserved. Of the total 98 wards, 49 are reserved for women.

“We have raised several objections to the delimitation, but now that the notification has been issued, we have to burn the midnight oil to finalise the nominees,” says TDP (Urban) general secretary Ch.V. Pattabhiram.

Women to the fore

Women will dominate the GVMC elections, with 50 % of the corporator seats reserved to them as per the announcement made by Collector and GVMC Special Officer V.Vinay Chand late on Sunday night. In the last election in 2007, the reservation was only 33 %.

“Though I want to contest, I cannot do so since the ward I had represented earlier is now a part of three wards and reserved for various categories,” rues a former corporator.

It is the predicament of the YSRCP leaders too as the number of women in all the categories has gone up.

For instance, 13 of teh 15 wards in Visakhapatnam East constituency are reserved for women, leaving only two for men. “Women have to be given a priority while selecting the right candidates with winning prospects within a short time is going to be a tightrope walk,” says a former corporator who is now a YSRCP leader.

A panel comprising Ministers K. Kannababu, V. Srinivas, A. Suresh Kumar and Anil Kumar Yadav is expected to finalise the nominees on Tuesday.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/gvmc-polls-political-parties-race-against-time/article31027405.ece
421,2020/03/10,GVMC to go to elections on March 23 after a long gap,"March 13 is last date of filing nominations; counting to be done on March 27

After a gap of 13 years, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) will go to polls on March 23. The last election was held in 2007 after the merger of Gajuwaka municipality and 32 peripheral villages with the erstwhile Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation.

After the term of the elected body ended, the limits of the GVMC were expanded further in 2013 with the inclusion of Bheemunipatnam and Anakapalle municipalities and 10 panchayats. Of them, five civic bodies— K. Nagarampalem, J.V. Agraharam, Kapuluppada, Chepaluppada and Nidigattu—abutting Bheemunipatnam opposed the merger. Later, panchayat elections were held and their term expired too. Officials carried out an exercise of gathering public opinion after the 2019 Assembly elections in the five villages. The State government by an order denotified the five panchayats and they were formed into the Ward IV during the delimitation.

A case opposing the merger is still pending in the High Court, it is learnt. “As no stay has been given on holding the elections, the process is being undertaken,” the officials said.

Schedule announced

As per the notification issued by the State Election Commission, Returning Officer will issue the notice on March 11. The last date for filing nominations is March 13 and the papers will be put to scrutiny on the next day. March 16 is the last day of withdrawal of nominations. Polling will be held on March 23. A re-poll, if necessary, will be held on March 26 and the counting will be done on March 27.

Election to Narsipatnam and Elamanchili municipalities will be held following the same schedule.

Arrangements reviewed

Meanwhile, in-charge Municipal Commissioner P. Koteswara Rao held a video conference with the officials and discussed the arrangements for the polls.

“A reception centre for distribution and receiving of polling material should be set up. A route map should be prepared and arrangements should be made by Zonal Commissioners for returning offices and assistant returning officers in the respective wards. Special care should be taken for the safe-keeping of poll material,” he said.

Mr. Rao asked the officials to keep the electoral roll handy and complete the appointment of nodal officers and route officers at the earliest. “The Model Code of Conduct should be strictly adhered to,” he said.

Additional Commissioner Thameem Ansariya and other officials participated in the meeting.

Visakh Refinery Modernisation Project (VRMP) Executive Director S. Raja on Monday said that they were aiming at increasing the capacity of the refinery from 8.33 million tonne to 15 million tonne and they had completed 28 million man-hours without any accident.

Speaking at a meeting organised by the HPCL Visakh Refinery in connection with the National Safety Day here, Mr. Raja said modern technologies were extensively used in the VRMP project sites right from the design stage to the execution.

Advanced technology

Visakh Refinery ED V. Ratanraj said the refinery had always been a frontrunner in the use of advanced technologies for enhancing safety in the work locations. “The online work permit system, online near miss reporting and management, online line clearance, online inventory management, the mobile safety training vehicle and use of CCTVs for monitoring of work sites are some of the examples of many initiatives undertaken by the refinery as a part of technological advancement in safety,” he said.

Using the operators were imparted training on the actual field conditions and emergency handling procedures making them better equipped to tackle any emergency situation. He complimented the employees and contractors for the completion of major revamp activity in the refinery for producing BS VI fuels without any incidents.

He also complimented all the employees and contract workers for actively participating in various competitions conducted during the National Safety Week.

Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories K.B.S. Prasad urged all employees to take pledge to the cause of safety. He mentioned that the employees and management should work towards reducing the number of deviations in the work areas.

Identification of near-miss incidents at work need to be further focused upon. Accident prevention is possible by developing safe attitudes and behaviours, he said.

‘No room for complacence’

Joint Chief Inspector of Factories J. Siva Sankar Reddy appreciated the management for achieving nil incident record at the construction sites. “Complacence is the worst enemy of safety. All safety related issues shouldbe addressed immediately,” he said.

423,2020/03/10,Licences of three medical shops suspended in Vizag,"They were trying to cash in on COVID-19 scare, says official

The licences of three medical shops in the city have been suspended for selling masks at high prices, following raids conducted by the Drugs Control Administration on complaints of masks being sold at high prices to cash in on the demand in view of COVID-19.

‘Mad rush’ for masks

It may be recalled that there was a mad rush to buy face masks and hand sanitisers in the city after a shortage of face masks and sanitisers was reported in Hyderabad last week.

Parents of children, employed in IT companies in Hyderabad, rushed to the shops and soon the stocks got exhausted at many shops and dealers began selling at high prices to cash in on the demand.

“We have conducted checks at around 70 medical shops in the city and the district during the past four days. We organised a decoy operation and caught three drug dealers for selling masks at high prices. We issued notices and suspended their licences,” assistant director K. Rajitha told The Hindu on Monday.

These stores are located at H.B. Colony and Seethammadhara, he said.

“The retailers are getting sufficient stock of masks and there is no cause for worry. The five Drug Inspectors in the district conducted the raids in their respective jurisdictions,” she said.

‘Hygiene comes first’

Ms. Rajitha explained that it was not necessary for everyone to wear masks.

More than face masks, personal hygiene like frequent washing of hands with soap, not touching the face, mouth and eyes frequently with hands and covering the face with a handkerchief while coughing and sneezing would go a long way in preventing spread of the disease.

However, people visiting the sick at hospitals and those who have cough and cold should wear masks for protecting themselves as also avoiding the prospect of spreading the disease to others.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/licences-of-three-medical-shops-suspended-in-vizag/article31027283.ece

Senior marketer Ajeesh Venugopalan has forayed into the literary scene with Obscurity of Life, a poetry anthology. He chose the genre as it brings a “certain rhythm to life”. He says, “I was always fascinated by the deeper meanings poetry conveys. In my view, Kalidas is one of the greatest of poets; Rumi and Gibran have have also inspired me.” In an interview, the poet talks about his “hunger to discover the truth.”

Tell us about your début book.

The book is a journey — where I poetically narrate my experiences of understanding love, women, life, social issues, Nature, and death. In it, you will find an innocent school student, a romantic college student, a dejected angry young man, a lover in a husband, love for parents and grandparents, a pragmatic man, an adult who rebels against the education system, and who is a voice for social causes and Nature. Finally, there is an evolved man who understands the reality of death — a man who has realised the meaning of spirituality in its complete sense while keeping religion out of context.

You have dealt with subjects such as exploitation of women, farmer suicides, poverty, education, female foeticide mangroves, tiger extinction...

Writing, for me, is not a deliberated effort; it comes to me naturally. Poetry as an art is dying because we do not focus on teaching art and philosophy to the current generation. The focus of education, for a long time, has remained on science and technology. Advancement in technology has also resulted in a dearth of readers. They now have a plethora of choices using which they can consume information; as a result, they end up staying within their comfort zone, which is dangerous for generations to come. If our education system focuses on teaching art, we may produce more compassionate people which may eliminate challenges that we as a country face today. Reading allows you to be connected closely with society, which provides awareness on social causes. I’ve always felt strongly about such issues and hence, it wasn’t difficult for me to write a few lines on them.

Observing one’s surroundings inspires poetry. How much of this is true in your case?

Observation is key for any artist, be it a writer, dancer whatever your stream of creativity. I grew up in different parts of this country as my father worked for a nationalised bank. I travelled along with him and experienced the length and breadth of our beautiful country. I am thankful to my parents for this and for the skills I have inculcated as part of this journey called life.

Was it tough to balance writing with your career as a senior marketer?

I find it easier to write poetry than a novel. A novel requires dedicated focus and it is linear in Nature. However, I believe poetry can be easily read because its non-linear. You can start and end wherever you would like to. Hence, balancing writing poetry and my profession was comparatively easier.

Was writing an organic process?

It was a 100% organic process. Since I am not a born English speaker, it took a long time for my language and writing skills to evolve. My love for poetry also made this process easier.

Are there more books in the offing?

I am contemplating fiction with a social message. I believe education today requires a transformation.

425,2020/03/10,Soap opera,"Mannem Sindhu Madhuri on her line of natural and organic products

She is a writer and the owner of a line of handmade soaps, shampoo bars, hair oils and face creams made with natural ingredients. Mannem Sindhu Madhuri owns ‘Kalapi Naturals’ that sources its raw materials from organic farmers in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Himachal Pradesh. “Kalapi means peacock. It is known for its natural beauty. My products are natural, ” she smiles.

The 46-year-old who has published 70 short stories in Telugu and Kannada says one of them is called Kalapi. That became so famous that people started calling her “Kalapi” Sindhu. “That is also why I chose this name for my brand.”

Born in Gangavathi town of Koppal district in Karnataka, she relocated to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, her ancestral home. Her foray into her line of skin care products began when a young girl in her family had severe skin allergy and was prohibited from eating dairy products, nuts, non-vegetarian food and almost all of her favourites. Still, there was no relief. Sindhu did some research and learnt that soaps and shampoos could cause skin allergies. “I was reminded of sunni pindi, the home-made herbal bath powder my grandmother used as a scrub to cleanse and make our skin softer. We used the same powder for the girl and the allergy disappeared.”

Sindhu pursued a diploma in cosmetology from Butic Institute. She researched for over a year on where and how to source natural and organic ingredients from, to produce ‘safe’ cosmetics. She then took up a six-month cold process soap-making course offered online by popular soap maker Ariane Arsenault.

She ordered soap moulds from China and began making them out of her home. “I started in a small way. I would make a kilo of soap and distribute half of it as samples to people requesting them to give their feedback.” Despite money constraints, she distributed soaps worth ₹6 lakh as samples and her efforts paid off as people started coming back to her. Later she added shampoo bars, hair oils, face cream and bath power to her collection.

Her confidence grew and she enrolled with Udyog Aadhaar, a Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises initiative that offers tax exemptions and subsidies to entrepreneurs. “But I wanted to reach out to a wider client base by selling my products through an online platform like Amazon for which I needed drugs and cosmetics license.”

She ran from pillar to post . “The application had 120 pages but I was not ready to give up.” As luck would have it, she was at a women entrepreneurs’ meeting attended by the then Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu.

“That did the trick and I got my license within the next few days.”

Today Sindhu’s products are available at local supermarkets and online. She is also exporting to The Netherlands and is in talks with a few firms in Latin American countries, who are currently trying out her samples.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/specials/women-in-action/5pjrgk/article31033908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BZ07PRODUCTS,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/soap-opera/article31033911.ece
