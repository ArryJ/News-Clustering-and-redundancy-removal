0,['18/01/2020'],"Real-life heroes talk about determination, films and politics in Bengaluru","The students and faculty members of St. Joseph’s College (Autonomous) were recently treated to a session of meaningful conversations at Open Heart 2020. The dignitaries present at the event were 15th Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar, ‘Asia’s Strongest Man’ Manoj Chopra and Sandalwood actress Meghana Raj, who shared their life experiences as they answered questions put forth by the students of the college. Here are the highlights…I saw my father, Jagjivan Ram, smile during an intense situation, and I thought to myself: ‘this is courage’. So, by smiling when under pressure and keeping the composure is how I did it. I was very inspired by my father and aspired to follow his footsteps. I wanted to do the same thing, even if it was in a minuscule form. I have grown up on discrimination, and this is something that I have taken in my stride. I have faced discrimination on the basis of caste. In London, too, I faced discrimination when I was looking for a house. I’ve faced discrimination on the basis of my gender; every day, we had to prove ourselves. However, as a speaker, I was never discriminated on the basis of my caste or gender. But within myself, I had this strong resolve that I must do well. And if I didn’t, people wouldn’t discriminate Meira Kumar, but would discriminate me for being a woman.Youngsters must take up politics and must remain dedicated to the ideology that they believe in. One must be able to differentiate between what’s right and wrong, and must stick by it. We must have the courage and we must educate ourselves, but always stand by the overwhelming majority of the downtrodden of this country.After I failed at my travel business, I was very low. Although I was into physical exercise from a young age, I took this up after my business failed to take off. And that is when I came across the ‘World’s Strongest Man’ competition, and was surprised to see that there wasn’t anyone representing our country. I wanted to be that person and after a lot of hard work, I competed. All I ever wanted to do was represent my country and make my family proud.I am six feet five inches tall, and weigh 175 kilograms. The question that I am asked often is about my diet. Well, it includes ‘see-food’, meaning the food that I see and I eat.I always knew that I would become an actress. As a child, I would see my parents go to film sets and work hard. I wanted to do the same. It was not easy though. I was mocked for my weight and my skin. I used to have acne issues, and people would constantly comment on that. But I chose not to listen to anyone and gave it everything I had. I always thought that the path for me would be easy because my parents were from the industry, but that truth is that it is a challenge for everyone, irrespective of who your parents are. I thought I will do films one after another, but not many people realise that cinema is not a destination, it’s a journey. What matters is what happens after your first film. Even though my parents were from the industry, it was extremely difficult for me to establish myself.My recent win at the State Film Awards gives me the confidence and courage to continue what I set out to do. Work hard and be the best. I have worked in four south Indian film industries, and, therefore, have made the effort to learn how to speak in all four languages. Individual efforts like these go a long way — in pursuing your passion, and achieving your dreams.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73327134,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-117504/73327134.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/real-life-heroes-talk-about-determination-films-and-politics-in-bengaluru/articleshow/73327134.cms
1,['18/01/2020'],"My guru told me, be a gaaja when learning, a raaja on stage: Aruna Sairam","Apart from preparing for the Times Thyagaraja Awards , to be held today, the finalists also got an opportunity to meet and interact with eminent musician Aruna Sairam . The finalists — Pranathi Ganapuram Samanvi , Kausthubh P Chandramouli, Srividya Vadlamani, Purva Dhanashree Cotah and Jayabhargavi — spoke to Aruna about their experience of participating in the competition, sharing the stage with accompanists, performing for a huge audience and the challenges they faced while singing within eight minutes (stipulated time).As Aruna patiently listened to their journey so far, she also gave an interesting perspective to their time challenge. She said, “Winston Churchill once said that if he has to speak for an hour, he will do it right away. But if he is to speak for half-an-hour, he needs 15 days to prepare. And if it is going to be a five-minute speech, he will need a month’s time. You youngsters have 16 minutes for the final concert. Give it your best.”Aruna also took time to explain to them what they should keep in mind when performing a classical concert. “Always keep in mind the three types of audiences who will come to your concerts. The pundits, who will know the in and out of classical music , the in-between crowd who will know some technical aspects, and lastly, the junta, who simply wants to enjoy a concert. So, think about what you want to do on stage so that you can cater to all the three types of rasikas. And no matter what, you will have to elicit feedback. People are generally polite and won’t say much. But if you get an opportunity, try and get an honest feedback from all of them. Once you can appeal to all the audiences, you will be an artiste who is loved by all,” she said.Someone asked her about singing in a traditional manner to grab the attention of the rasikas, and Aruna said, “Say, for instance, you have a performance tomorrow. You will practice the song a million times. But as you keep singing it multiple times, there will be a point where the technical predomination in your mind will recede. You will naturally enjoy and sing from your heart. My guru, Brinda ma, is a traditionalist. She has an image of being very strict. But when I was 10 years old, she told me when I am learning music, I should be a gaaja and when I get on stage, I should be a raaja. Perfection is a constant journey; but singing with confidence is what impresses the rasikas the most. You can always strive to attain the perfect, but don’t miss out on exuding confidence on stage.”The Times Thyagaraja Awards 2020 will take place, today, at the Music Academy, 5pm onwards.

2,['18/01/2020'],Chennai is my temple and my second home: Sukhwinder Singh,"Chennai will always remain special for Sukhwinder Singh . The city, after all, is what gave the dynamic singer Chaiyya Chaiyya , a crackling sensation he recorded with AR Rahman in 1998. Over 20 years since then, Sukhwinder, who was in the city for a Sufi performance recently, called Chennai his city of dreams. “This is the city that connected me and my music to the entire world,” he recalled, as we sat down for a chat to discuss the emerging trends in music, the remix culture and the #MeToo movement. Excerpts:This is the place where I met Rahman in the late 1990s. This is the city that connected me and my music to the entire world. This is not just a city for me. This is my temple and my second home. I often come here for film recordings. I have come to Chennai this time for a special reason. I have come here to perform for a special occasion at Rahman’s guru, Malik’s ashram in Kadapa. I would be singing a Sufi-style song.I knew that I had met a legend when I met Rahman. But when I got to know that he prefers working in the night, I began crying (laughs). But that is his style and legends have such styles. And I didn’t have any expectations from the song because all I did was record a beautiful song with Rahman. We didn’t even think about the response.He told me about the composition and asked me to complement it through my voice. He also told me that I was welcome to improvise it whenever I wanted. He told me, “Sukhi, enjoy”. He is the best person to have happened to the country.I adapt myself to the present trends. The past, of course, brims with memorable experiences. But I am a man who lives in the present. The changes are all technical. There is more equipment today and we have become more scientifically attuned. Even in the 2000s, when I met Rahman, he worked with the best of keyboards and mixers. While everything was electronic, the sur was natural. His way of working was very natural, acoustic and pious.Good technique enhances the sur of the song, giving it a clean sound. That is very important. But when you depend completely on technology, it only means you do not have the capability. People who are blessed with music do use technology, but they aren’t completely dependent on it.Just last month, a film’s team approached me to record a song with just my voice — with no orchestra or symphony. I was very impressed with it and went ahead to record it. It is for a film, which will be unveiled soon. I do realise that not every song can be like this. But I make it a point to upgrade myself with the changing times.People get angry about remixes, but I love to do it because I see it as a form of creativity. When the passion is the same, it is alright. There are so many remixes that sound wrong, but there are many that sound original, too. I appreciate such efforts.I am absolutely OK with being part of remixes, as long as it is for a special reason. I will not do it just for the sake of it. I have done only one remix till now. But people want hundreds more. But I will approach it in a slow and steady fashion.If songs and singers of the past have that charm in the voice, it is because of the winning combination of the composer and the singer. I always give the credit to the music director.Coming to the auto-tuning part, I cannot fault people who go for this practice, because at the end of the day, singers are trying their level best to become popular. They know very well that they might not be exceptional. You cannot find a Beethovan or Rahman or SPB everywhere. There are dedicated, devoted singers, but they are very less.You can find good-looking people in the music industry. There are many personalities in the West, who are extremely good-looking and present themselves with gravitas. There are many Hollywood star singers. But they do have talent. They practice a lot. Singers like Celine Dion and Whitney Houston are known for their electric performances. Many teenagers want to copy Britney Spears or Shakira. Style is necessary, but not at the cost of talent, which is supreme.There were a few people who realised that their cheap actions cannot be repeated again. There are many actors, filmmakers, composers who conduct themselves very well. But there are going to be exceptions. I think things are changing slowly and people have understood that this kind of behaviour is definitely not OK.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73328260,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-249795/73328260.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/music/chennai-is-my-temple-and-my-second-home-sukhwinder-singh/articleshow/73328260.cms

He admits that it is tougher for senior actors to find meaty roles in television. He tells BT, “Films are open to senior actors playing a prominent part, but on TV , it gets increasingly difficult as you become older.” The actor adds, “After you have worked in the industry for more than a decade, it’s not easy to switch careers. So, most actors continue to take up similar roles for the sake of earning a livelihood. Therefore, it’s important for every actor to contemplate from time to time whether he would want to continue doing the same thing, or have an alternative career on the side.”Himanshu also feels that television serials should now go the finite way. He shares, “Personally, I would want 26-episode finite series where the producers, broadcasters, cast and crew do not have the unnecessary pressure of ratings and delivery of episodes. An actor should be leaving the set with a sense of fulfilment, unlike today, when most people come to a set just because their survival depends on the job.”Meanwhile, on the work front, Himanshu will be seen playing a doctor in a show titled 'Dil Jo Dhadke, Dhadakne Do'.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73327509,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-49126/73327509.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/himanshu-malhotra-films-are-open-to-senior-actors-in-key-roles-but-on-tv-it-gets-tougher-as-you-age/articleshow/73327537.cms
4,['18/01/2020'],Every musician wants to perform in front of Bengaluru audience: TT Sriram,"As a group of youngsters, we remember visiting Bengaluru for many gigs. This city has a certain vibe to it that draws many. To perform in front of such lively and responsive audiences is a dream for many aspiring artistes,” says TT Sriram , the frontman of Chennai-based band, Skrat, that recently performed at a city music festival. Commenting on the recent scenario in Bengaluru that saw a number of popular venues closing down, he says, “While the local residents complaining about loud music in the neighbourhood might have a point, the fact that the closure has disrupted the indie and live music scene in the city cannot be denied. We should be able to strike a balance between the two things. Soundproofing the venues could help to a certain extent. Finding a solution to the problem rather than having an ongoing conflict on the matter would probably be a better option.”Cut to performing different genres together, particularly Rock ‘n’ Roll and indie rock, the artiste says, “Making music that doesn’t fall into any particular genre is quite risky. For instance, Rock ‘n’ Roll and indie rock together don’t have a rapid growth curve. And so, they seem to be ‘outdated’ for many listeners. As today’s musicians, our goal is to attract more and more audiences — making them groove to our original songs.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73329225,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-98831/73329225.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/music/every-musician-wants-to-perform-in-front-of-bengaluru-audience-tt-sriram/articleshow/73328875.cms

As we entered actor Smruthi Venkat ’s house to meet her pet Beagle Rowdy , the dog gave us a warm or rather a loving welcome into his home. It took him a good 15 minutes to shower us with unconditional love. Once he was used to us being around, we settled down to speak to Smruthi about her darling pet and her son, Rowdy. Excerpts:Smruthi says that she always wanted to have a pet dog. “My parents were against the idea. It is not that they didn’t like dogs, but it is a big responsibility. I have always liked dogs, though. I like big dogs, like German Shepherd and Indie breeds. But you can’t have them in an apartment. I finally decided to have a Beagle. Actually, a friend and I bought him together. I didn’t know much about this breed, and began researching about Beagle only after I bought him home. Initially, I was very scared as I didn’t know how to parent him. He used to play all night long and wouldn’t get used to the time pattern. It would took me a long time to put him to sleep in the nights and play during the day. But now, he wakes up only after I do. He doesn’t sleep on the floor and sleeps near my foot or head. He wants the bed to himself,” smiles Smruthi.The actor says that all Rowdy wants is attention. She says, “He wants to be pampered all the time. That’s the only thing he asks of you. He is a friendly dog and welcomes every one with his charm and love. After he came home, my parents, too, love and adore him. In fact, there have been moments when I learnt that they love him more than I do. My mother plays with him every morning before she leaves to work.”Smruthi says that her life has changed so much since Rowdy came. “I never felt this loved before. In whatever frame of mind I am in, my mood instantly gets better when I see him. He never lets me lose my cool. The way he reacts when I am upset or angry makes me feel sad. And that instantly changes my mood. There was a time when my friend and I had a huge argument. He sat in between and was literally trying to control our anger. It just took a moment for us to realise that it was Rowdy who was making peace between us. One another time, he couldn’t stop barking when he heard my friend’s kid cry. He stopped only after the baby stopped. He loves kids and goes crazy when he sees them.”Smruthi also says that there is so much to learn from a pet. “I have never seen him angry or upset. I learned to give back love because of him. I let go half of my arguments, too. They teach you patience. And yes, I used to have a messy room. Now, I keep it clean as he picks up whatever he finds on the floor and chews on them. I also ensure that everything at home is pet-friendly, including the floor cleaning liquid and tissues that we use. I have become more responsible because of Rowdy.”Smruthi says that she’s tried doing play dates for Rowdy. “Most of my friends have dogs. I took him to a friend’s place and she has a Labrador. Rowdy wasn’t too kicked about the idea and didn’t really play with him. He thinks he’s human. Over time, he got friendly,” says Smruthi.The actor also revealed that he’d developed an eye problem and was operated recently. “He had cherry eye, where the tear gland pops out. He had to be in a certain weight to be operated. We got it done recently. Now, I am really kicked about taking him to the beach,” says Smruthi. Rowdy recently turned one and Smruthi hosted a dog party along with her friends and their furry children.Smruthi says that her dream is to have an independent house and have plenty of dogs. “I have given myself three years to invest in an independent house. Like I mentioned before, I love Indie dogs. I want to buy an independent house so that dogs can move around peacefully.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73328359,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1109823/73328359.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/pet-time-stories-i-have-become-more-responsible-because-of-rowdy-says-smruthi-venkat/articleshow/73328359.cms

15,['18/01/2020'],"Unitech News: In relief for 30,000 homebuyers, Centre to take over Unitech","Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: In a major relief to around 30,000 homebuyers , the Centre agreed to take over troubled real estate giant Unitech to streamline the management of the company which is in a financial mess caused by siphoning off of more than 50% of money deposited by individuals and financial institutions.The funds were allegedly misappropriated by Unitech Group and its directors. This is the second time a big, high profile company has been taken over by the government after Satyam in 2009. Scandal engulfed Hyderabad-based Satyam after its chairman Ramalinga Raju admitted its books were cooked to the tune of Rs 7,000-odd crore. The software firm was later taken over by Mahendra Group’s IT arm.Agreeing with the Supreme Court’s suggestion to step in to protect the interest of homebuyers and investors, the Centre proposed the name of retired IAS officer Yudvir Singh Malik as chairman and managing director of the company. It also proposed names of six others, including NBCC CMD, to be made directors to run the affairs of the company to complete all housing projects.As was revealed by a forensic audit, the group and its promoters creamed thousands of crores of rupees and it became difficult for the existing management to complete the housing projects. The apex court then asked the Centre to take over the company though the government had way back in 2017 itself started proceedings to take over the group but was halted in its tracks when the SC stayed the process.In an affidavit filed by ministry of corporate affairs, the government, however, told the court that it will not infuse any funds for the projects and pleaded that its appointed directors be made immune to ongoing litigation against the company. The government pleaded that the court appoint a retired SC judge to supervise the resolution framework finalised by the proposed Board of Directors and that the Board be empowered to take steps to raise money for completion of projects.“This court may permit the proposed Board of Directors to raise funds due from home-buyers and to sell the unsold inventory of stocks and make the unclaimed inventory available for re-selling. Further the Board be allowed to monetise unencumbered assets of the company for completion of housing units. In addition, the court may release funds lying with the apex court pertaining to the company and its management,” the affidavit said while putting 11 conditions for taking over the company.It also said the government should be given the right to refer the company to liquidation or an Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) like resolution outside frameworks of the code in the absence of requisite resources to complete the projects. It said the working of the Justice S N Dhingra committee, which was given the task by the SC to sell assets of the company, be stayed after the government takes over the management.Unitech Group is involved in construction of 74 housing projects and around 29,800 home-buyers have invested in the projects. Due to its financial crisis, the Group has been unable to complete the projects, leaving buyers in the lurch. The apex court had on October 30, 2017 set a condition for depositing Rs 750 crore in the SC registry for grant of bail to Unitech honchos Ajay and Sanjay Chandra but they failed to comply.Giving details of the Group, the Centre told the court that there are over 250 subsidiaries under its umbrella including 32 foreign subsidiaries and three foreign associates which are incorporated in tax havens like Libya, Cyprus, British Virgin Island, Channel Island.Established in 1971 by a group of technocrats, Unitech Limited has been a pioneering real estate company. It started business as a consultancy firm for soil and foundation engineering and but later diversified to real estate. Unitech’s managing director Sanjay Chandra and his brother Ajay Chandra have been in jail since August, 2017 after being arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Delhi Police for not handing over possession of flats to buyers despite money was paid to the company.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73341009,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-136795,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/in-relief-for-30000-homebuyers-centre-to-take-over-unitech/articleshow/73340868.cms

NEW DELHI: Eyeing a comeback in Delhi assembly after 21 years of exile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced candidates for 57 out of 70 seats on Friday for the February 8 elections, giving precedence to old warhorses.There had been speculation that the saffron party may go for a “generational change” this time but 41 of 57 candidates announced on Friday had contested or won in previous assembly polls and 19 had successfully contested the 2012 or 2017 municipal elections, with some who had done both.In the list are 16 candidates who had won the 2013 assembly poll on a BJP ticket. In all, 29 candidates who contested the 2013 assembly poll and 30 who fought the 2015 election are in the fray. At least 11 candidates this year are over the age of 60 years, with S C Vats (74) being the oldest.Six sitting and 10 former municipal councillors, four of whom have been mayors in the three corporations, have also been included, keeping their “popularity and winnability” in mind, a senior party functionary said. Seven Poorvanchali leaders and two from Uttarakhand have been given tickets keeping Delhi’s changing demography in mind.BJP has not won a single election after 1993 when the Delhi assembly was reconstituted. It emerged as the single largest party in 2013 assembly polls, winning 32 seats. However, fighting its first election, Aam Aadmi Party formed the government with outside support from Congress. The 2015 assembly poll proved disastrous for BJP and only three candidates could win amid a huge AAP wave that saw the ruling party winning a record 67 seats in the 70-member House.BJP is yet to name its candidates for 13 assembly seats, including the prestigious New Delhi assembly segment, from where chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is contesting again. Sources said the party is still deliberating over a name that could challenge Kejriwal on his home turf. Four of the remaining 13 seats are likely to go to long-time ally Shiromani Akali Dal though a formal seat-sharing arrangement is yet to be announced.The names were announced by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari at a press conference, which was also attended by Union minister and Delhi election-in-charge Prakash Javadekar , national vice president Shyam Jaju and national general secretary Tarun Chugh. “The remaining candidates will be announced soon. BJP is sure to win the upcoming elections and form a government in Delhi this time,” Tiwari said.Senior party leaders held marathon meetings in the past one week deciding on the “best option” to challenge the ruling dispensation. Sources said the central election committee, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , cleared the names of 57 candidates late on Thursday. The committee members later passed a resolution authorising BJP national president Amit Shah to finalise the names for the remaining seats.The party has repeated all three sitting MLAs – Vijender Gupta from Rohini, Om Prakash Sharma from Vishwas Nagar and Jagdish Pradhan from Mustafabad. Two AAP turncoats – former minister Kapil Mishra and Anil Kumar Bajpai – have also been included in the list. Gupta is leader of the opposition in current Assembly. Mishra will contest from Model Town and Bajpai has been repeated from Gandhi Nagar.Former Congress MLA Surinder Pal Singh Bittu, who had won the 2003 and 2008 assembly polls but joined BJP last year after a short stint with AAP, has also been named from Timarpur assembly segment.Other prominent candidates in the BJP list include four-time MLA Mohan Singh Bisht from Karawal Nagar, three-time MLAs Ramvir Singh Bidhuri (Badarpur), Brahm Singh Tanwar (Chhatarpur) and Naresh Gaur (Babarpur), and two-term legislators S C Vats (Shakur Basti) and O P Sharma (Vishwas Nagar). Ravinder Gupta (Matia Mahal), Yogender Chandolia (Karol Bagh), Khushi Ram (Ambedkar Nagar) and Azad Singh (Mundka) have been mayors in the trifurcated municipal corporations in the past.Leader of SDMC, Shikha Rai (Greater Kailash), and North MCD standing committee chairman Jai Prakash (Sadar Bazar) have also been given tickets this time.Apart from Rai, the other three women candidates in the list are former MLA Moti Lal Sodhi’s daughter-in-law and former councillor, Lata, from Ballimaran, former councillor Rekha Gupta and Kiran Vaidya from the reserved seat of Kondli.Interestingly, Azad Singh (Mundka) and his son-in-law, Shailender Singh Monti (Malviya Nagar), have both been fielded despite the party’s stand against dynastic politics.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73341375,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-321294,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/old-warhorses-dominate-bjps-list-of-57-for-delhi-polls/articleshow/73341222.cms

22,['18/01/2020'],"This winter, you can flaunt the Cowboy style","Classic mainstays of cowboy fashion like the fringe-lined jackets, wide-brim hats and leather boots made a splash all of last year in the West, whether it was at red carpet events or on fashion magazine covers. Closer to home, our Bollywood actresses have shown how one can pull it off with sass and style. Here’s how you can nail the look...Cowboy boots, hats and fringe-lined jackets have been the mainstay of cowboy fashion, which is also referred to as ‘yeehaw fashion’ in some circles. You can mix-and-match and add some spunk to your wardrobe with high- heeled boots and accessorise it with a gold chain that’s elegant and chunky. Take your style a notch higher with a cowboy hat if you are stepping out in the sun, or opt for a pair of black leather pants that hug your curves and pair them with a pair of stilettos or go for a billowy check blouse. You can pair that with a shimmery skirt or a fringe skirt and high heels for an evening out.While animal prints and sequins are finding favour with those wanting to sport this look, statement belts and turquoise jewellery also go with it. Denim always works. Scarves and hats along with leather bags are a few elements you can play with. Sport pigtails, braids or simply let the wind play with your tresses.You can choose to don pants or opt for a more feminine style by slipping into a prairie dress. The look is modest, and gives you extra coverage on the neck and sleeves, and can be worn as frocks or skirts. As it covers you from head to toe, it’s ideal for this season. There’s also room to layer it with a jacket or a woollen poncho. Stylist Isha Bhansali tells you how to put it together. She says, “Cowboy fashion works brilliantly in this weather. Check shirts, fringe jackets, prairie dresses, hats and boots can keep you warm. Even ankle-length boots are an option depending on the outfit you choose.”The yeehaw or Wild West style is a classic look that can be given a modern take. The best part is you don’t have to go all the way. You can choose which elements you want to include in your closet and dress it up or down. Stylist Ayesha Nigam says, “We are seeing a modern way of incorporating the Wild West into one’s wardrobe, inspired by some of Bollywood’s leading ladies. Whether through the fringe or exaggerated thigh-high boots, it’s nice to incorporate one element into your outfit and have the focus on it. I love Shibani’s thigh-high boots and Deepika’s stylish leather pants.” The look also requires you to have a certain attitude and be comfortablein your skin.Model Gigi Hadid loves the Texan style, and has been spotted wearing it on several occasions. Recently, she wore pigtails and a cowboy hat, while Ciara chose to go with a bold all-black look.The term ‘yeehaw’ was coined by pop culture archivist Bri Malandro, whose Insta account showcases black cowboys and cowgirls in pop culture. Rather than going all out, most stylists recommend to pick out elements of the Wild West trend and make it your own. Here’s how to do it:If you want to go casual, pair your jeans with a statement big buckle belt that adds a whole new vibe to your outfit.You can opt for a full-sleeved floral shirt or go with something that’s embroidered or opt for a checkered, silk or lace blouse.Go with ankle-length or high-heeled boots and pair them with wide-leg jeans or a prairie dress.The key is to keep yourself warm yet stylish. Opt for fringe jackets, printed woollen ponchos or leather jackets.",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73328041,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-112740/73328041.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/fashion/style-guide/this-winter-you-can-flaunt-the-cowboy-style/articleshow/73327580.cms
23,['18/01/2020'],Are fellow audience members ruining your theatre experience?,"You have finally found some time out of your busy routine, bought the ticket, taken your seat, and are ready to immerse yourself in the sounds, sights and smells of a theatre about to come alive. But wait, all you can hear is phones ringing one after the other, snippets of personal conversations, and howling children drowning out the sounds from the stage. Some people have decided to walk in way after the play has started and others are munching on their crunchy popcorn as loudly as possible. To top it all, the distracted actor has now decided to walk off the stage.Earlier this year, irked by constant disturbance from audience in Nashik, Sumeet Raghavan, lead in the play 'Knock Knock Celebrity', walked off the stage midwayThis is not a completely imaginary scenario. In June last year, irked with the constant disturbance from the audience in Nashik, Sumeet Raghavan, lead actor in the play 'Knock Knock Celebrity', walked off the stage midway. He later tweeted about the interruptions he faced from the audience during his performance with the hashtags #ZeroTolerance and #NoMobileDuringPerformance.""During one of my performances, a person among the audience kept talking on the phone. When I looked at him, he gestured me to continue while he kept on talking loudly. While mobile phone jammers can be used to curb such nuisance, most people are against them. Then how do we educate the audience? It is usually the elderly people who are not too technology- savvy and whose phones end up ringing during the show,"" Sumeet says.In an earlier interview, veteran actor Naseeruddin Shah had told us, ""I’ve had to stop my act midway once or twice, because someone was using their phone. As theatre artistes, we have to learn to live with it, just like we have to live with latecomers, bags of chips and people coughing. We can’t determine the audience's priorities but we try to give them as good a performance as possible so that they don’t need to check their phones!""Navina Jaffa, academic and writer, says, ""Technology has intruded so much into our daily lives that even when people go to see a theatre or cultural performance, they are not able to leave that world behind and their attention is divided. The fact that one doesn’t switch off the phone or comes in late for a live performance is actually a reflection of the modern man’s alienation.""She adds, ""People who have put up their show are in their particular world of great focussed energy and want to give their best. This is their performance time, and that sort of commitment has to come from the rasika (a term for the audience) also, otherwise, the energy for building the rasa (aesthetics) gets fragmented. If you are coming in and creating a rupture for yourself as well as for others in that world, neither are you doing justice to yourself, nor for the space you are entering into and the activity you are going to be a part of.""Theatre director and actress Deepa Ranganath says, ""The entry time should be respected and the audience should not be allowed to step in at any point of time they like. Another problem is that some people are constantly using their phones and filming things that they are not supposed to, and that takes away the exclusivity of the play."" She adds, ""Unfortunately, phones ringing in between the performance have become such a common thing, but in that process, a good moment is lost. Some people in the audience are engrossed in taking pictures or shooting videos and they raise their hands from different angles.""Apart from phones ringing amid the performance, many times, kids can be seen running around and playing during performances. Theatre actress-director Deepa Ranganath says, ""Once, I had gone to watch a murder mystery and a kid started crying suddenly right when the whole momentum was being built up. On another occasion, there was a guy who kept swearing constantly. Sometimes people keep munching on chips or chocolate so noisily that it spoils the entire atmosphere.""Dhruv Arora, a theatre lover, says, ""While many among the audiences do put their phones on silent mode, they constantly keep looking at the screens, and the light from their phones is so disturbing. I had recently gone to watch a show, and the person sitting in front of me kept fidgeting and constantly kept taking pictures and videos.""Navina Jaffa, academic and writer, recalls incidents when performers improvised on stage and did not allow the audience to interfere with their creative flow. She tells us, ""In one of the plays, there was a scene in which there was a farce of the phone ringing. Just then, three more mobile phones rang together and the actor incorporated that into the scene. It was very well-timed."" She adds, ""In one of Birju Maharaj’s performances, a phone rang in between the performance. He used to do this footwork known as Telephone ki Tihai, so he immediately rendered this act. What a brilliant artiste to turn that disturbance into something so creative and create equilibrium!""Last year, popstar Rihanna sparked a debate on theatre etiquette after arriving 15 minutes late for a Broadway show, Slave Play, written by Jeremy O Harris. The singer was then spotted texting throughout the play. While the playwright didn’t seem to have a problem, theatre buffs called it ""rude"" and ""disruptive"".""Two things I learned today about the type of theatremaker I am: When my idol texts that she’s running late. I hold the curtain for her. When my idol texts me during a play I’ve written, I respond (sic),"" Jeremy had tweeted.Responding to it, an audience member wrote, “Texting during a show is unacceptable. As is starting late for anyone who thinks they're better than a paying audience of theatregoers."" Another wrote, ""Rihanna texting the playwright during a performance isn’t cool. It’s rude. Celebrating it is ridiculous and an insult to all other theatremakers working on the production. #sorrynotsorry, but you’re late AND texting? Put your phone away, @rihanna.""",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73330573,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1398023/73330573.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/spotlight/are-fellow-audience-members-ruining-your-theatre-experience/articleshow/73330306.cms

What’s interesting is Bratya Basu whose last film direction was Tara way back in 2010 will return to don the diretor’s hat keeping his busy theatre schedule aside.

25,['18/01/2020'],"Ditch the AC, go to a car wash: Here's your guide for an eco-friendly ride","If you live in a metro city like Delhi, you probably spend hours driving to and from work every day. Our cars are an integral part of our daily lives. So naturally when we talk about a push for more sustainable ways to living, driving and maintaining the car sustainably comes into the picture too. In India, where hybrid vehicles are out of the price bracket of most car buyers and eco-friendly CNG variants are available only among smaller cars, small steps to ensure how your existing vehicle can be used in a more eco-friendly manner can go a long way. The most common way to make a car more sustainable is by reducing its fuel consumption. This can be done through a number of small steps, which include reducing the use of AC, keeping the car fine-tuned, and reducing waste while cleaning the car. Removing unnecessary extra weight as it causes mileage to dip and regular servicing, every 5000 km or six months are small steps that you can start with to make your car more sustainable.Ashok Singh, who works with a car repair firm in Delhi, says, ""Of the people that come to us, two-thirds have incorrect tyre pressures and they don’t even know. Most people think getting tyre pressure regulated is a useless task but bad tyre pressure can reduce a car’s fuel efficiency by 20-30%.""Under-inflated tires lower fuel mileage by 0.2% for every 1 psi drop in the tire pressureIn Delhi, that thing that contributes most to air pollution when it comes to cars are the ACs. ""It’s a myth that if you open the windows, the wind resistance increases, which causes the mileage to dip. The AC draws power from the engine so it is actually lowering the mileage,"" says Jitendra Singh, a Gurgaon resident who swears by sustainable living and driving. ""In addition, AC also emits warm gases that further pollute the environment,"" he adds.A study by the Society of Automotive Engineers in 2004 found that rolling down the windows in an SUV actually helps the fuel efficiency as compared to using the AC. Even with sedans and hatchbacks, there was an improvement in fuel efficiency till speeds of up to 68 mph (110 kmph). The study also showed that there was no great reduction in the cooling inside the cars when AC was not in use and windows rolled down. ""Most studies are however conducted at 30 degree Celsius temperature so they don’t apply to peak Indian summers when AC is a necessity. But apart from that, rolling down the windows is a better option. My car’s mileage has gone up from13-14 to over 18 since I started doing this,"" says Delhi-based automobile engineer Akhil Taneja, who says he has made conscious efforts to make his driving more sustainable over the last two years.Running AC for an hour in the car can double the consumption of fuel during that periodThe general impression is that car washes waste water while a hose or bucket at home is more economical. However, a study by WaterWise found that professional car washes and garages actually save 50-60% of water as compared to washing it at home. Swati Singh, a water conservation expert, says, ""People think that hosing the car or wiping it with a wet cloth is the way to wash cars but both waste water. The best way is to use a wet sponge. Moreover, in Delhi, the dust particles will immediately settle back on the car as soon as you wash it. Clean and dry wipe it thoroughly every day and wait for the professionals to give it a wash.""A study by transportation advisor Paul Barter in 2019 revealed that most cars today are parked 95% of the time, which leads to increased maintenance to avoid breakdowns.

The first track,, is a remake of Guru Randhawa’s chartbuster single 'Lahorethat had released mid-December 2017. The original was one of the grooviest tracks and not much has changed. This version has additional lyrics written by Guru and sung by him along with Tulsi Kumar. The arrangements and programming by composers Sachin-Jigar add to the number.Initially composed by AR Rahman , 'Mukkala Mukkabala' ('Kaadhalan') featuring Prabhudheva, had become a cult hit in 1994, and now, for this film, Remo has used the iconic track after 25 years, which features the ageless ‘dance-god’ once more. A complete visual delight, ', which had debuted on our music charts at No 5 last week, has catapulted to No 1 this week. Musician Tanishk Bagchi sure has a hold on the pulse of the audience and has repackaged this track while making sure that it doesn’t lose its essence. Rahul Shetty and Raju Sundaram’s choreography is on point. Yash Narvekar (who has earlier sung for films like 'Marjaavaan', 'Mubarakan' and 'Half Girlfriend') along with Parampara Thakur have added to the sassy appeal of the song written by Shabbir Ahmed and Tanishk.Composers Sachin-Jigar’s expertise shines through in the next song.

Super-high on oomph, with signature drop beats, this ‘hot’ track is a complete Badshah number. He has composed, written and sung it — and we can easily say that he has scored in every department.

31,['18/01/2020'],"‘Parents take out padding, use kids' free helmets themselves’","This story is from January 18, 2020

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: The outcome of an initiative to provide free helmets to nearly 40,000 school students in five cities by a not-for-profit organisation in the past four years threw up a surprise when it was revealed that usage instead of going up had declined to barely 15% with several parents taking out the padding material from the child helmets so that they could wear it themselves.

But since the amended Motor Vehicles Act with provision for high fines came into effect from last September, usage has increased to almost 60-70% indicating how it’s not just awareness but fear of enforcement that brings behavioural change on the roads.

Indian Head Injury Foundation (IHIF) had started the initiative in Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad, Anupshahr (UP) and Jodhpur . The programme covered nearly 110 government and government-aided with most them being in Delhi and is still on.

While speaking on the sidelines of a conference of trauma care by FICCI and International Road Federation, IHFI’s honorary medical director Dr Rajendra Prasad said, “It was quite surprising to see how the usage of child helmets reduced despite we giving them free of cost. Many parents had taken out the pads and other materials so it could fit an adult’s head. So, this year we decided to give free helmets to the children and their parents as well.”

Prasad, who is also a senior consultant (neuro and spine surgeon) at Apollo Hospitals in Delhi, said this showed how people take the law for a ride unless there is stricter enforcement.

Though the amended law has made it mandatory for children above four years to wear helmets while riding two-wheelers, the provision has not been notified yet considering that there are not enough helmets for minors available in the market.

According to the 2018 road accidents report, at least 119 two-wheeler occupants who were killed did not wear helmets.

Highlighting how road injuries had a huge impact on the country’s trauma care, Dr Amit Gupta of JPN Apex Trauma Centre said that nearly 50% of the patients that they get are road accident victims. Director general of (roads) I K Pandey said good trauma care can reduce road deaths significantly while mentioning that the annual road fatalities in the United States are close to 40,000 while the number of accidents are over 20 lakh.

32,['18/01/2020'],SC seeks report from government on carrying out 2012 e-vehicle plan,"This story is from January 18, 2020

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Union government to detail steps taken to implement the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan-2020, a policy decision taken in 2012 to give incentives for adoption of electric vehicles and disincentives for fossil fuel-based vehicles.

It was not difficult for advocate Prashant Bhushan , who appeared for NGO ‘Centre for PIL’ and who of late has been often citing the dangerous effects of global warming in green cause litigations, to convince a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde, who himself has exhibited his sensitivity towards the environment, to seek a response from the Union government. The court asked the Centre to detail the steps in four weeks.

Bhushan said though prices of electric vehicles had reduced, the government had not taken enough steps to create infrastructure for charging of vehicle batteries. He said public buildings could be equipped with charging facilities.

The petitioner cited the 2015 Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid) and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME India) scheme, under which the government was to subsidise ‘initial cost of acquisition’ of electric vehicles. “Since the inception of the scheme and till December last year, the government has given financial support (demand incentive) for 2,61,507 electric/hybrid vehicles. Though electric buses were added to the scheme to support electrification of public transport, so far only 455 electric buses for nine cities in a pilot scheme have been sanctioned,” the peition said.

“Though NEMMP-2020 called for an investment of Rs 14,500 crore from the government, as of 2018, the total budget allocation has been less than Rs 600 crore which shows government apathy,” Bhushan said. He added that though NMMEP planned to adopt 7 million electric/hybrid vehicles, as of 2018, less than 0.3 million such vehicles were adopted.

Referring to the e-mobility programme, which mandated the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) to procure 5 lakh vehicles for government use, tenders for procurement of only 10,000 vehicles were awarded to Tata and Mahindra, he said.

Total petrol, diesel and CNG vehicles in India as of 2015 was about 210 million causing huge air pollution, he said and warned that if steps were not taken urgently, growth of fossil fuel-based vehicles would make the situation unsustainable and violate the principles of intergenerational equity.

Representational photo.

NEW DELHI: Forensic audit of Unitech Ltd, which was done on the orders of the Supreme Court, revealed massive diversion of funds by the company and its directors with the report saying that money invested by home-buyers and banks were used for purposes other than constructing houses and some of the amount was diverted to off-shore tax havens.

Around Rs 14,270 crore was deposited by 29800 home-buyers and Unitech took loan of Rs 1,805.86 crore from six financial institutions for construction of 74 housing projects. After examining the account books of Unitech Group and its subsidiaries, the auditor said Rs 5,063 crore or 40% of the collections from home-buyers were not used for the housing projects while outflows of Rs 2,389 crore were still to be ascertained.

The report said nearly 40% of the money raised from financial institutions amounting to Rs 763 crore had not been utilised for construction. The auditor filed the report after examining 51 projects and the rest 23 projects have not yet been analysed as the company failed to provide relevant data. A bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah, which directed forensic audit of the Group, incorporated the audit findings in its order.

Giving details of potential diversion of funds, the audit report said high value investments were made in off-shore tax-havens, which was later written off. “Between 2007-2010, three subsidiaries of Unitech made investments of Rs 1,745.81 crore in ten companies in Cyprus . Between 2016- 2018, an amount of Rs 1,406.33 crore or 80% of the total investment value was written off while the remaining amount of Rs 339 crore is appearing as equity investments in the books of accounts,” the report said.

“Similarly, in 2007- 2008, Unitech Global Limited, a company registered in Jersey and a subsidiary of Nuwell Limited, another subsidiary, advanced a loan of Rs 294.47 crore to Kortel Limited, another step-down subsidiary of Unitech. Kortel made investments of Rs 292.99 crore in three foreign entities based in Cyprus during 2015-2016. Rs 294.47 crore (100% of total investment value) was written off in the books of Kortel,” it said.

The forensic auditors have pointed out that between 2009-2011, Unitech sold five wholly owned subsidiaries to three undisclosed related parties at an amount of Rs 493.72 crore for which a balance of Rs 294.30 crore is receivable. “During March 2011 to October 2013, Unitech advanced Rs 237.63 crore to a related party, Millennium Construction Private Limited, for acquisition of shares of a company by the name of Grandeur Buildwell Private Limited. No shares of the company were allotted to Unitech and the entire advances are still receivable,” it said.

The report said diversion of funds was also done through transactions with undisclosed related parties. It said in 2011-2012, Unitech and two subsidiaries entered into transactions with Arkhion Design Private limited for availing of architectural services of a value of Rs 108.92 crore but it was Unitech employees who were involved in the management of operations of the said company. It said a subsidiary of Unitech made payments of Rs 224 crore, including to entities based in Abu Dhabi/Dubai

It said Unitech had in 2018 written off receivable balances of Rs 198 crore pertaining to 26 parties involved in transactions relating to the sale of steel/purchase of scrap with the group.

35,['18/01/2020'],Piyush Goyal: All investment as per rules welcome,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Union minister Piyush Goyal. (PTI)

AHMEDABAD/NEW DELHI: A day after he said e-commerce giant Amazon was not doing India a favour by investing $1 billion here, commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said the government welcomed all investments but they should be in line with domestic regulations.

On Thursday, he had said Amazon was investing because it was incurring losses, comments that ignited a debate whether the snub, at a time when the firm’s founder Jeff Bezos is in India, was intended to drive home a sharp point over alleged underpricing and product manipulation seen to hurt Indian businesses.

“I was only saying that investment should come as per rules and regulations,” Goyal said at an event in Ahmedabad, adding that his comments on Thursday should be seen in this perspective.

Critics had slammed Goyal’s statement on Thursday, arguing that India needed investment to accelerate growth. Officials, however, said Goyal’s comments betrayed a deepening frustration with Amazon and some other global chains refusing to be transparent in their methods.

Since taking charge as commerce & industry minister, Goyal has held several rounds of discussion with the Amazon India team led by CEO Amit Agarwal and had asked them to ensure compliance with domestic laws “in letter and spirit”.

The government believes that overseas retailer operations are multi-layered and they resort to predatory pricing, putting the livelihood of thousands of small traders in India at risk. Government sources said there were concerns that algorithms used by these firms allowed unfair competition by giving preference to related entities, some of which were partly owned by them.

Goyal on Friday amplified the point, saying big-ticket investments in the retail sector should not hurt small traders who do not have deep pockets. “Our country has some rules for the e-commerce industry. We welcome all those investments which come as per these rules. However, it should not create unfair competition for the small traders of India. They do not get 0% loans. They do not have lakhs and crores of rupees. They do business with small capital,” he said.

The minister said that if investments are not within the framework of law, then legal action would be initiated. “Our government wants to ensure that unfair competition is not created for crores of small traders and retailers of the country,” Goyal tweeted.

The country’s fairplay watchdog, the Competition Commission of India, has launched an investigation against Flipkart and Amazon to examine if they are complying with local laws. Globally, there is now a backlash against e-commerce players as they are seen to be disruptive for mom-and-pop stores.

36,['18/01/2020'],Nirbhaya convicts to be hanged on February 1 at 6am,"NEW DELHI: Hours after President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy plea of death row convict Mukesh Kumar Singh in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, a Delhi court issued a fresh black warrant, fixing the hanging of all four men for February 1 at 6am.Additional sessions judge Satish Kumar Arora also expressed displeasure over the delay while hearing the plea of Mukesh. The judge pointed out that all four convicts were given ample time to file mercy pleas but only one of them preferred to do so.“There might be delaying tactics. For how long will this go on? Had death warrant not been issued, the convicts would not have initiated using their legal remedies,” the court remarked, even as it passed fresh directions for a new date to execute the death warrants against the four — Akshay Singh, Pawan Gupta, Mukesh and Vinay Sharma.The court’s comments came after the jail authorities informed it about status of the convicts and how three of them are yet to exhaust all the remedies provided under law. Public prosecutor Irfan Ahmed also informed the court that Mukesh’s mercy plea was rejected by the President on Friday and that the convict had been duly informed.“None of the petitions of any convict is pending before any forum. So my prayer is that new death warrants be issued for execution of the four convicts,” the prosecutor submitted. Accordingly, the new death warrant also covers the 14 days in accordance with a rule in the jail manual that states convicts to be executed must have a two-week window from the time their mercy plea is turned down.During the hearing, A P Singh, counsel for the three other convicts, raised a fresh issue, claiming the four convicts cannot be executed until their appeal in a robbery case pending before the Delhi high court is disposed of.“The Tihar Jail authorities have concealed the fact that appeals of the convicts in a robbery case are still pending in the Delhi HC. Their execution is not possible until the robbery case is decided,” he claimed, referring to the 2015 order of a Delhi court where it held the four death row convicts guilty of robbing a carpenter named Ram Adhar hours before they committed the horrific gang rape.The court had convicted them for robbery, kidnapping, wrongfully confining a person, voluntarily causing hurt in committing or attempting to commit robbery, dishonestly receiving stolen property under the Indian Penal Code for beating up and robbing Adhar. It had sentenced them to 10 years’ imprisonment against which they filed an appeal in the HC which is still pending.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73343371,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148165,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nirbhaya-convicts-to-be-hanged-on-february-1-at-6am/articleshow/73343308.cms

SRIGANGANAGAR/BIKANER: Locusts have damaged crops across an area of at least 3.6 lakh hectares in 10 districts as western Rajasthan continues to reel under the longest and the worst attack of the pest in 60 years.Swirling swarms of the deadly grasshoppers have eaten up 75% of standing crops in the hardest-hit Sriganganagar district, according to assessments by officials and farmers. The other nine affected districts are Hanumangarh, Bikaner , Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Jalore, Sirohi , Nagaur and Churu.The first attacks were reported in May last year, when lakhs of pink locusts flying in from southern Pakistan damaged the kharif crop (July-Sept) in the 10 districts. Now, a major wave of fresh attacks have hit the rabi crop (October-March), leaving farmers devastated.TOI visited at least 60 villages and hamlets in Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts to see the damage wrought by locust attacks that began a fortnight ago. Many farmers said the current attack is the biggest ever seen in the region.Among the crops in the line of attack are wheat, gram, mustard, cumin and taramira (arugula). “Locusts are not eating the entire plant but are chewing the flowers, thereby damaging the crop,” said Shyam Somra of 20KYD village in Bikaner district.“Rajasthan witnessed first locust attack in May 2019 and since then, everyone — including the agriculture department, Locust Control Organisation (LCO) and others — has been merely spraying pesticides. This is the biggest-ever attack. Can’t they find out why the attack is still unstoppable and uncontrollable? If breeding is happening in Pakistan, the state administration should urge the Union government to talk to their Pakistani counterparts to control it,” said Subash Sehgal of Kisan Sangarsh Samiti.K L Gurjar, deputy director at LCO-Jodhpur, has been surveying the damage in villages of Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts. “I think the menace is under control in the state, except for Sriganganagar and Jaisalmer districts. A good monsoon, greenery and moisture have been the reasons behind the excessive presence of locusts this year. We have ample pesticides and are checking their movement to control them while they are settled in non-farming areas,” Gurjar told TOI.Farmers alleged that for the last eight months, the state government had neither completed girdawari (cross assessment report), nor had it taken any effective measures to check the swarms of locusts coming at regular intervals.“I have 75 bighas of land and ever since we witnessed fresh locust attack a fortnight ago, we have been spraying pesticides, playing loud music and doing everything to scare away these devils. Government authorities are merely coming and clicking pictures with their mobile phones,” said Soha Lal Bishnoi, a farmer of 12KND village in Sriganganagar.“Almost 1 lakh hectares in Sriganganagar and nearly 2.6-lakh ha in the remaining nine districts have been affected by locust attacks. We have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged his intervention in expediting the relief process. We demand a compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre to each farmer,” said Sehgal.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73343727,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-320529,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/3-6l-hectares-hit-in-rajasthans-worst-locust-attack-in-60-years/articleshow/73343726.cms

NEW DELHI: The foreign office on Friday summoned a senior official of the Pakistan high commission to protest against the abduction of minority Hindu girls in Pakistan.

""Pakistan has been conveyed the grave concerns as expressed amongst various quarters of Indian civil society at such a shocking and deplorable incident involving minor girls from the minority Hindu community in Pakistan. The incidents have been strongly condemned and immediate safe return of the girls to their families has been sought,"" government sources said.

Highlighting the travails of Hindus in Pakistan, MEA officials focused on reports of the recent case of two minor girls, Shanti Meghwad and Sarmi Meghwad, who were allegedly abducted on January 14.

""They belong to Umar village, Tharparkar, Sindh, Pakistan. In another incident, a minor girl, Mehak, also belonging to the minority Hindu community, was abducted from the Jacobabad district of Sindh province in Pakistan on January 15, 2020,"" the MEA said.

The Modi government's Citizenship (Amendment) Act is intended to make it easier for persecuted Hindus, and five other minority communities, from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to find an easier route to citizenship in India.

RUDRAPUR: A pet dog, Tiger, had to spend a night in police custody in Udham Singh Nagar, after two people claimed its ownership. Interestingly, the dog also seemed to know both the persons.

Sub-inspector Madan Singh Bisht, in-charge of Katoratal police station, said one Nirmal Singh had registered a complaint with the police that his pet labrador had gone missing on December 26.

""On January 12, one Amit Kumar posted on social media that he had rescued a labrador from railway crossing in Kashipur. Nirmal's son noticed the post, approached Kumar and returned home with his pet,"" Bisht said.

However, on January 16, another person, Anurag Chauhan, reached out to Kumar and claimed the dog was his. Bisht added, ""The photo brought by Chauhan resembled the one that Kumar had rescued. Chauhan then went to Nirmal Singh's place and claimed he was the dog's owner. When they reached us we found that the dog was responding well to both the persons. We then decided to keep it in our custody until the matter was sorted.""

Bisht said, ""But on Friday, we decided that we will leave the dog at a point from where he can reach his owner's house and keep an eye. Whichever house the dog chooses to go will be recognised as the owner."" The experiment worked when Tiger reached Singh's house on his own.

On a petition filed by BSP candidate Nawab Kazim Ali Khan, the Allahabad HC had annulled Abdullah's election on finding that he was ineligible to file his nomination in January 2017 as he had not attained the age of 25 years. Abdullah had challenged the decision in the SC.

Appearing for Abdullah, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said the HC judgment was not based on evidence, which showed that the appellant was born in 1990. But the bench asked why the senior advocate was shying away from showing the school leaving certificate. "" It is not that the HC has recorded a finding without any evidence. We will not stay the HC judgment,"" it said, but issued notice to Kazim Ali Khan.

Kapil said that the authorities had initiated proceedings to prosecute Abdullah for alleged forging of documents. ""That proceeding should be stayed,"" he pleaded. But the bench declined the plea.

MUMBAI: The CBI has registered a case of corruption, cheating, forgery and conspiracy against 17 people, including three Indian Revenue Service officers of the customs, in an import scam . Diamond merchants, with the connivance of valuers and officials, inflated the value of precious stones brought here and used the trade route to transfer black money out of the country.

The officials who have been named in the FIR are Vinay Brij Singh, then commissioner at Airport Special Cargo Commissionerate and deputy commissioners Ashiquzzaman and Chandravanshi Y Manikanhaiya, posted at Precious Cargo Customs Clearance Centre, Bharat Diamond Bourse. In July 2019, Singh was dismissed by the government invoking rule 56(j) of the Service Rules. Manikanhaiya is currently posted in Hyderabad while Ashiquzzman is posted in Rourkela.

The DRI said the importers inflated the value of the imports from Rs 1 crore to Rs 160 crore. DRI officials said over Rs 3,000 crore is believed to have been taken out of the country in 18 months.

The FIR says that one Girshi Kadel, based in Hong Kong and with operations in India, imported rough diamonds from Switzerland to Hong Kong in the name of his companies. Some of the same diamonds were sent to India. The total quantity of the diamonds was valued at Rs 156 crore.

The FIR says that the diamonds were put up for valuation to two specific valuers who said the declared value was 'fair'. Another valuer recorded his objections. The FIR says that Singh influenced the subordinate officers to call for a particular member in the customs panel and instructed the member to give a favourable report for the diamonds.

Students rehearsal of Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali human chain formation at Gandhi Maidan

PATNA: The final rehearsal for human chain formation was done at Gandhi Maidan on Friday. The participants formed the map of Bihar while the songs based on environment were being played in the background. The real human chain event is scheduled across the state on Sunday to promote the state government’s Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali campaign , along with creating awareness regarding prohibition and against child marriage and dowry. Gandhi Maidan will be its epicentre as chief minister Nitish Kumar will formally inaugurate the event here.

Patna DM Kumar Ravi said around 5,000 people, including Jeevika members, Asha workers, Anganwadi workers, students, role models, people belonging to third gender and representatives from all the religions participated in the rehearsal on Friday morning. “The final event will be organized similarly. People are free to participate wherever they feel like,” said Kumar, adding, “Safety of people is our prime concern and all the officials have been told to leave their place of duty only after each and every individual goes back home.”

He further said the event at Gandhi Maidan will be recorded by six drone cameras and the chains emerging out from here will move in four directions, touching the border of Bihar. In Patna district, the chain will be 696km long, including 167km on the main route, 256km on sub-routes and 273km on other routes.

However, the length of human chain across the state has been targeted to be 16,200km and over four crore people are expected to participate in it. This will be third such event in Bihar. The first human chain formed in 2017 was 11,285km long in favour of prohibition. The second human chain was against dowry and child marriage and it was 13,660km long.

Education department officer Vinodanand Jha said the entire event will be covered with the help of 15 helicopters, unlike earlier when only drones were used for photography.

Even though the opposition is targeting chief minister for the event, his alliance partner BJP has asked all its party cadres and leaders to participate in it. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and BJP state incharge Sanjay Jaiswal instructed all the party workers to make it a success. They not only appealed to the members of various wings of the BJP, but even appealed the traders and businessmen to stand outside their shops and form human chain.

“The motive is to connect common people with the cause of the event. In the next three years, the government will be spending Rs24,500 crore on renovation of ponds, puddles, aahars and paines,” said Modi though a press release.

Representative image

PATNA: There was 5% decline in the number of accidents and 6% fall in accident deaths in the state in the second half of 2019, said state transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on the concluding day of the Road Safety Week on Friday.

Speaking at an event on ‘Advancing Road Safety in Bihar’, Agarwal attributed the decline in road accident and death cases to strict enforcement of Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019. Seven districts in Bihar have registered a significant fall in road accident deaths in 2019 after the special drives. “In Bettiah, only 40 deaths were reported in 2019 against 54 in 2018, which is almost 26% less than previous year. Banka registered 14% fall in road accident fatalities, Lakhisarai 12% and Sitamarhi and Samastipur 5% each while there was 2% decline in Bhagalpur and Purnia each,” he said.

Agarwal said the department has targeted to make 100% helmet coverage for two-wheeler riders in all 38 districts in the state by the end of this year. The coverage is in the range of 90-100%. He said the situation in Patna is better with around 94% of the two-wheeler riders in the city wearing helmets. “It is now difficult to find people in Patna not wearing helmets while riding a two-wheeler,” he said and added: “Earlier, only 14% used helmets in almost all the districts. However, the situation has improved significantly in the recent months owing to awareness and strict enforcement of rules. Almost 45% two-wheeler riders in Munger are wearing helmets against 10% in 2018. Gaya stood at 46%, Darbhanga 63%, Muzaffarpur 59%, Chhapra 61%, Bhagalpur 58% and Purnia 32%.”

“The department issued e-challans through hand-held devices and driving licenses of a few people were also cancelled during the weeklong road safety week drive,” Agarwal said.

He said 1.5 lakh vehicles were checked and 1 lakh people were fined in the state in 2019 for violating new traffic rules, which included not fastening seatbelts and wearing helmets while driving and jumping red lights and over-speeding their vehicles. “Altogether 29,000 e-challans were issued through monitoring CCTV cameras at 35 major road intersections and crossings in Patna alone,” he said.

State transport commissioner Seema Tripathi said the department has targeted to achieve 7% fall in the number of fatalities in road accidents in 2020. “We have already initiated several measures like speed radar guns and speed governors in vehicles,” she said.

Seema said unlike earlier, nodal officers have been appointed in all the 38 districts to improve traffic management and ensure strict implementation of traffic norms.

Agarwal said after successful piloting of hand-held devices in Patna for issuing e-challans, the department is going to introduce this mechanism in other districts from February 15. The hand-held device was launched in Patna in 2018. E-challan device has a mobile phone to take record of violator, printer and a Wi-Fi device for network connectivity.

The secretary said the traffic police can maintain track record of violators and details of their previous offences by using the hand-held devices for issuing e-challans.

PATNA: All the teachers and non-teaching staff of Patna University (PU) will get their revised UGC payscale for the month of January. Retired teachers and staff will also get their revised pension with effect from January.

PU vice-chancellor (VC) Rash Bihari Prasad Singh told this newspaper on Friday that the state government has sanctioned Rs 60 crore towards the difference of revised pay from March 2019 to February 2020. “Therefore, the arrears of revised UGC pay from March to December 2019 will be paid to all the staff, both serving as well as retired, before Holi,” he said.

The state government has also reportedly released a sum of Rs 11 crore to PU towards the arrears of pension paid to its employees during the past several months. The VC said, “PU had made these payments from its internal funds.”

Now, the employees of all the universities will get their salaries and pension in the revised 7th payscales from February onward. Sources said the state education department is likely to release necessary funds to all the universities soon. Higher education director had already assured the universities of releasing the funds by January 15.

About a couple of months ago, the department had released funds for two universities — Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University and Pataliputra University. Now, the remaining universities will be getting the required funds from the department.

The state government had notified the implementation of revised UGC payscales for college and university teachers of the state more than a year back, but the same was not paid to the teachers till date due to delay in fixation of pay of university staff in the revised scale as per the pro forma designed by the education department. Ironically, all the government employees, including schoolteachers have been getting their salaries in the revised scale since long.

They were night guards. Action against them has been taken on the basis of CCTV footage showing the employees attempting to open the box.

The suspended employees were deputed elsewhere in the shrine and as such they were not supposed to be in the donation box area. The suspension letter was issued on Thursday.

According to Temple Management Committee member Arvind Singh, the shrine on an average receives about Rs 5 crore per annum from the offerings made by the devotees. The donation boxes are opened under strict vigil once every three months, said Singh.

In their written explanation, the night guards maintained that the donation boxes were sealed and as such tampering was not possible.

Confirming their suspension, Gaya DM Abhishek Singh, who is also the ex officio chairman of the shrine management committee, said the process to dismiss the employees from service has also been started. An FIR has also been lodged against them, the DM said.

RJD national spokesperson and MP Manoj Jha

PATNA: RJD will contest four out of 70 seats in alliance with Congress in the Delhi assembly election to be held on February 8.

However, RJD national spokesperson and MP Manoj Jha said his party would like to contest one more seat. “We have demanded one more seat. We have already scaled down from our previous demand of seven seats,” said Jha, who refused to share the names of four constituencies his party was allotted by the Congress.

Party national secretary general Qamar Alam, who along with Jha is looking after RJD’s Delhi assembly election preparations, said the talks were going on and by Saturday everything will be cleared. However, RJD sources said the party would contest from Burari, Kirari, Palam and Karawal Nagar as of now.

Interestingly, Burari is home to a large number of migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar . AAP’s Sanjeev Jha had won the seat last time against BJP’s Gopal Jha. Sanjeev is again contesting on AAP’s ticket, but BJP has not declared its Burari candidate yet.

Even Kirari has a sizeable population of Poorvanchalis and BJP has named Anil Jha as its candidate against AAP’s Rituraj Jha, the sitting MLA.

BJP is fielding Vijay Pandit from Palam and Mohan Singh Bisht from Karawal Nagar, while AAP has retained its sitting MLA Bhavna Gaur from Palam. Durgesh Pathak will be contesting on AAP’s ticket from Karawal Nagar from where rebel AAP leader Kapil Mishra had won last time.

While AAP has released the list of all its candidates, BJP on Friday released the names of 57 candidates.

PATNA: India's fundamental challenge is going to be creation of jobs as there is a large population of young people in the country, Professor Johannes Urpelainen from Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said here on Friday.

Delivering a seminar on ‘Powering Growth in India’s Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises’ organized by Asian Development Research Institute ( ADRI ) and International Growth Centre (IGC), Professor Urpelainen said: “Without jobs, one cannot invest in basic necessities of life. Small and medium-sized industries form an important component of these jobs.”

He said affordable, abundant and reliable supply of energy is an essential precondition for economic growth. “India's growth story is unusual as it has grown without any large contribution from the industrial sector. In India, household electrification has progressed rapidly, but productive use of energy remains constrained,” he said.

Analysing micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Bihar, Prof Urpelainen said, “Most of these firms use a large chunk of their power consumption on lighting and fans among electronic appliances. An exception that he came across in Bihar was flour mills. Only 17% of the GDP of Bihar comes from the industrial sector as compared to all India average of 23%. Government intervention is required to move to larger, electric pumps in Bihar for tapping groundwater as the overwhelming majority of pumps use diesel,” he emphasized.

Professor Urpelainen also explained the energy constraints that small and medium-sized enterprises in rural and urban India face. He also argued for a strategy that focuses on improving energy supply in towns that are ready for rapid economic expansion.

State industries minister Shyam Rajak said the MSMEs in Bihar face difficulties in marketing their products. He said efforts were being made to solve these problems. “There are a number of village-based industrial clusters in Bihar. These include cluster for leather works, rice mills and flour mills among others,” he said.

While introducing the speaker, ADRI member secretary Shaibal Gupta said Professor Urpelainen has been conducting research in Bihar for several years now on topics like how to improve energy supply. Kumar Das, the programme policy manager, IGC India, proposed a vote of thanks.

DARBHANGA: A youth from Mirzapur in Uttar Pradesh was thrashed by a group of people at Karamganj under Laheriasarai police station of the district on Thursday on the suspicion of gathering personal details of local residents as part of the CAA and NPR. Prince Singh’s repeated plea that he was working for a private TV news channel and not for any agency related to CAA or NPR, however, went unheeded.

The residents of the locality inhabited mostly by people belonging to minority community didn’t stop there. They summoned the councillor of ward No 37 and subsequently handed him over. He, in turn, lodged a complaint with Laheriasarai police station accusing him of illegal trespass and misbehaviour with women. Laheriasarai SHO H N Singh said the youth was booked under Sections 448, 419 and 504 of IPC.

The SHO further said the accused was released from the police station as the charges against him were bailable. As the youth was concealing his identity and not willing to disclose the name of the TV channel which had hired him for conducting the survey, the residents became suspicious of his activities.

The youth, on the other hand, claimed that other members of the team have also been assigned the task and doing the work in other parts of the district.

Kolkata: The SpiceJet staffer at the check-in counter who had refused a wheelchair to a woman with spine disorder has been dismissed by the carrier. The step followed an inquiry after a TOI reported on Wednesday.

The ground staffer at counter 15 had, on Tuesday morning, refused a wheelchair to Mamta Agarwala, who was travelling to Coimbatore for a spine operation. It was only when the airport director’s office stepped in that a senior airline official made the wheelchair available.

Following the TOI report on the incident, SpiceJet launched an investigation, speaking to the senior official who had resolved the issue, as well as other ground staffers working in adjacent counters that morning. The probe concluded that the staffer concerned was guilty of breach of the airline’s code of conduct.

“The incident was viewed very seriously and an inquiry was initiated. The said employee has been terminated. SpiceJet has a zero-tolerance policy towards such acts and takes the strictest possible action in case of any violation. Our code of conduct policy lays down guidelines for employees to follow and has to be strictly adhered to by all,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said.

Agarwala said she did not wish for the employee's dismissal and would have been happy if the woman had been told to be more sensitive.

MUMBAI: Piramal Enterprises (PEL) is divesting its healthcare insights and analytics business — Decision Resources Group (DRG) — to US-based Clarivate Analytics for $950 million (around Rs 6,500 crore). PEL had invested $650 million in 2012 to acquire DRG , of which $260 million was infused as equity.Through the deal, the group has realized 2.3X its initial equity investment.PEL-DRG Dutch HoldCo BV, a 100% subsidiary of PEL and holding company for DRG, has signed a definitive agreement for the sale of the insights business to Clarivate, a global leader in providing analytics with revenues of over $5 billion. The transaction includes $900 million on closing, and $50 million to be received at the end of 12 months from the date of closing. It is subject to shareholder approval, and is expected to be completed by February-end.Piramal Group chairman Ajay Piramal told TOI, “The deal is in the best interest of shareholders, with good returns. At 5X the company’s sales of $190 million (March 2019), it was the right time we think, while creating 29% for our shareholders. This transaction demonstrates our continued commitment to create sustained long-term value for all stakeholders. Along with the ongoing equity capital-raise in PEL, this transaction not only further strengthens the company’s balance sheet, but also marks another step towards significantly unlocking value in future.”PEL, with revenues of over $1.9 billion, majorly contributed by financial services and pharmaceuticals, sold its domestic formulations business earlier in 2010 to Abbott at an attractive valuation of 9X its sales. Later in 2014, Piramal sold his 11% stake in Vodafone India, reaping a windfall of around 52% return in two years.Sales of Piramal Dutch IM Holdco BV (consolidated) — which includes financials of wholly owned subsidiaries PEL-DRG Dutch Holdco BV and DRG — for FY2019 were at Rs 1,331 crore.

On the next day, Ajay sent a message on the mobile of his real brother Vishal Antala living in Varachha stating, ‘He is leaving this world’ at about 6.30am.

DK Bharwad, police sub-inspector at Kapodara police station, said, “Vishal saw the text message at about 7am. He immediately called up Prakash with whom his brother was living, but he was not there. However, he searched for his brother and found his motorcycle parked on Utran bridge. He informed police and fire brigade and the youth’s body was recovered from the river.”

Bharwad added, “The deceased was suffering from headache for a long time and taking medicines too. He was not using social media platform and had no love affair. We are investigating the case.”

When contacted Ajay’s brother Vishal Antala said, “We are shocked why he took such an extreme step. There was no financial issue as he was learning diamond polishing work. I am also working as diamond polisher for the last four years.”

In the second incident, Narayan Kakadia, 54, a diamond merchant operating in Mahidhapura diamond market, committed suicide by consuming poison on Thursday. Narayan, a resident of Sarthana, was shifted to SMIMER hospital where he died during treatment.

Nagpur: Under the pilot project of Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) to improve its anti-ragging policy, a committee headed by MUHS vice-chancellor Dr Dileep Mhaisekar on Friday visited Government Medical College Hospital (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH).

The team interacted with students and staff separately to take feedback on anti-ragging initiatives in these colleges.

The team is on a tour of all government and private medical colleges to collect ragging and discrimination-related data. The tour will be over by February 10 after which the team will present a comprehensive report in March.

“This information will be submitted to the government as well as to the Medical Council of India. It will be an important documentation while revising the anti-ragging policies in medical colleges,” Dr Mhaisekar said.

The VC informed that he met undergraduate, postgraduate students and staff members separately. He also interacted with the deans and in-charges of anti-ragging cells.

IGGMCH dean Dr Ajay Keoliya said that the visit was an important step towards updating anti-ragging policies. “Both UG and PG students gave their feedback directly to the VC. We are working towards achieving the goal of zero-ragging incidents in medical colleges,” he said.

GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra said that meetings were held in a positive atmosphere. “The committee members interacted with UG students and junior doctors independently without any pressure of seniors or staff. Anti-ragging cell in GMCH is functioning effectively,” he said.

MUHS formed this committee headed by VC especially after the suicide of Dr Payal Tadvi, a junior doctor in Mumbai, in May 2019. Tadvi committed suicide allegedly due to caste-based discrimination by her seniors.

66,['18/01/2020'],‘Future homes will be designed around tech’,"This story is from January 18, 2020

The model interiors on display at ABID, the interior fair at Science City.

KOLKATA: Home design is undergoing a metamorphosis from a demand for maximum space utilisation to appreciation of minimalist decor. In the years ahead, interior designers and architects foresee trends being driven by connected homes.

“Modular is the way ahead. Young customers do not like permanence. They are constantly changing jobs and shifting cities. Hence, they want furniture that can be easily assembled and dismantled. Homes in future will be driven by technology and everything else — furniture and furnishing — will have to fit into the design trends that the tech devices set,” felt interior architect Indranil Dey.

Other designers, too, feel devices will dictate the next change in the industry. While TV serials had ushered in bright colours, tech devices are usually white, black or grey and may usher in a preference for muted shades in future.

Another preference shift is in favour of trendy interiors that last only a few years from durable interi-ors that survive decades. “People now want to change the look every five years. They want excitement in life,” said interior designer Ritu Duggal.

While frequent makeovers mean more business, there are many challenges that designers have to confront now. If TV serials had introduced the masses to the world of interiors a )decade-and-a-half ago, frequent trips abroad and internet on cellphone have increased their exposure — so much so that designers say their creating instincts are being stifled by customers who hire them but believe they now know everything about the trade.

“The interior market has exploded. In the past 15 years, business has increased five times. If there were 350-400 designers in Kolkata earlier, now there are more than 2,000 in business. But only one in five customers actually gives designers the creative freedom. Most of them dictate what they want, and it is either something they have seen on a trip abroad or on the internet. We are becoming copy cats,” rued veteran interior professional Ajit Kumar Jain.

Speaking to TOI, many designers said they felt demotivated by clients’ demands to simply copy others’ ideas. “Interiors of a house should reflect the personality of people who live in it. The process of designing the interiors is a collaborative one, with us getting to know the clients and their requirements, designing the home, consulting the client, factoring in changes and then executing it. But when customers believe they know everything and dictate everything, one is left wondering what our role is,” said designer Abhijit Saha.

Two paramedics who saved the newborn girl

SURAT: A newborn girl , abandoned in a dustbin near the EWS housing society at Panas in the city was rescued by two paramedics of 108 emergency services. The infant was found wrapped in clothes with glass-coated kite flying string entangled around her body.

Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), Narendra Parmar and his colleague Ankit Parekh had rushed to the EWS housing society at Panas after they received a distress call from one of the residents about the infant in the dustbin at about 8.32 am on Friday.

The glass-coated kite string was tied in such a manner that it almost cut into her soft skin around her neck and we could see blood oozing from the wounds.”

According to Parmar, the infant was breathless and unable to move as she was wrapped very tightly in the clothes. The girl was taken out from the dustbin and the sharp thread had to be cut very carefully without damaging the girl’s body. any farther. The baby was later brought inside the ambulance and cleaned up. As her skin was getting pink she had to be kept under halogen lamp to keep her warm.

Parekh said, “This is first time in my many years of working with the 108 that I have seen such a condition of a newborn child. We were aghast to see kite string being used to tie the infant.”

“The girl’s condition improved after being given halogen light, fluids and suction. We immediately contacted our head in the 108 and decided to transfer the girl in the New Civil Hospital,” said Parmar. Iqbal Kadiwala, head of the nursing department of NCH said, “The infant girl weighs 2.2 kg and was doing fine. She has been kept in the critical care section of the hospital and is being looked after well by the staff.”

MUMBAI: The stock price of Vodafone Idea , which is expected to be hit the hardest by Supreme Court ’s rejection of a review petition relating to AGR dues to the government, lost more that a quarter of its value on Friday, while RIL , which runs Jio and is expected to gain the most due to lower competition, rallied over 3%.

Bharti Airtel, which is also expected to be hit by the AGR verdict but is in a better financial position, also rallied on Friday with the sensex scaling a new high at above the 42K mark.

On Friday on the BSE , the Vodafone Idea stock dipped nearly 40% in early trade on the back of the AGR order of Thursday evening, but closed 25.2% lower at Rs 4.5. A report by SBI Caps Securities said that after Thursday’s order on AGR, there’s a likelihood of Vodafone Idea shutting shop, unless the government agrees to a staggered payment of AGR dues, totalling about Rs 53,000 crore on it alone.

Bharti Airtel, on the other hand, will have to pay about Rs 35,600 crore. The report also said that if Vodafone Idea shuts shop, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio together will need to spend about Rs 1 lakh crore to acquire the customers of Vodafone Idea.

In Friday’s market, while Vodafone Idea tanked, RIL rallied 3% and closed 2.8% higher at Rs 1,581. Bharti Airtel, which recently went for an institutional placement of shares to meet AGR dues, rallied over nearly 6% and closed with a 5.5% gain at Rs 500.

Walls of a road leading to Uppuguda underpass in Old City

HYDERABAD: The underpass in Uppuguda, under GHMC’s Charminar zone , will become operational in February. The project has been pending for four years, primarily due to issues related to land acquisition and shifting of utilities.

One of the main features of the project is transformation of side walls. Artists have painted city monuments such as Charminar and Golconda Fort. Alongside, paintings of agricultural sector with ox-drawn ploughs and farmers can also be found. Part of underpass has been painted in blue, with stars and the sky as the theme.

The underpass, being built at an estimated cost of Rs 9 crore, is 7.5 metres wide and 310 metres long. Approach roads are also being laid. “Once the underpass becomes functional, it will ease traffic woes at Uppuguda main road,” said Sohaib Ahmed, a commuter.

Another commuter said that because the project was taking so long, the underpass turned into hub of anti-social activity. “Illegal activities such as drinking, people coming in groups and whiling away time on the dark roads was common,” said the commuter.

Varanasi: The Varanasi Municipal Corporation launched Material Recovery Facility (MRF) in Public-Private Partnerships mode at Bhawania Pokhri, Belupur on Friday.

The facility has been started in partnership with Tetra Pak, Deutsche Gesellschaft für International Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) as a part of Development and Management of Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) in India to increase collection of recyclable waste and help strengthen waste management in the city.

The NAMA project is funded by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU), Germany. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) is the nodal ministry for the NAMA project.

The new MRF will function as a waste sorting centre where plastic, mixed-waste paper, paper-based cartons will be separated and baled. While the MRF will focus on dry waste, the location of the MRF has been chosen strategically as the compound also hosts a VMC bio gas plant to process the wet waste collected and turn it into electricity, making it a truly zero-waste site.

Municipal commissioner Gaurang Rathi said this decentralized MSW management model is ideal for replicating in other parts of Varanasi and other cities.

The event was also attended by vice president Sustainability, Tetra Pak Asia Pacific Jaideep Gokhale, director-Climate Change, GIZ India, Ashish Chaturvedi, and director, Environment & Waste Management, TERI, Dr Suneel Pandey.

TNN

Mumbai: HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh has called for maintaining values of the Indian Constitution , stating that “while times and circumstances change, strong values and principles do not”.

The veteran banker recalled the words of late jurist Nani Palkhivala who said that the Constitution should not be subject to “hasty and ill-conceived” changes.

Parekh was delivering the vote of thanks at the 17th Nani Palkhivala memorial lecture . Earlier, in his address, Tata Sons chairman Chandrasekaran spoke of “suspicion and micro-management” as the impediments faced by businesses in India.

Parekh pointed out that this was Palkhivala’s birth centenary and his memories stayed because of values and beliefs. Quoting Palkhivala, Parekh said, “Our Constitution is primarily shaped and moulded for the common man.” “The great makers of our Constitution clearly intended that the integrity of the Constitution should be preserved against any hasty or ill-considered changes,” said Parekh. Palkhivala, who passed away in 2002, was a staunch defender of the Constitution and had argued in several cases of constitutional importance.

Pointing out that the quotes were 50-year-old, Parekh said, “The inferences are for you to interpret, but to my mind, it still seems starkly relevant in these present times,” he said.

Parekh highlighted another quote from Palkhivala: “With the growing powers of government all over the world, it is eminently desirable for any democracy to have fundamental rights which cannot be curtailed or abrogated.” He said that while we should hold on to the learning that Palkhivala left behind, it is important not to be consumed by “pessimism and doom-mongering”. “I am an optimist. I am confident about the future of India and that our youth will see India’s best days,” said Parekh.

Panaji: For only the second time during this season, the mercury dropped below 20C, as India meteorological department ( IMD ), Goa, recorded 18.3C on Friday morning - the lowest reading of minimum temperature of the season.

On January 5, the mercury had dipped to 18.3C after dropping below 20C for the first time this season. But the mild chill didn’t last long the wind changing its direction. December, the peak month of winter, in 2019 ended as the warmest during the last five decades, as not even once the mercury dropped below 21C.

On New Year’s day, for the first time this season, IMD, Goa recorded a minimum temperature below 21C at 20.4C.

During the last few days, after hovering around 21C, the minimum temperature came down to 19.8C, 1.4 below normal, on Thursday from 21.1C on Wednesday.

“This is due to northeasterly winds, but after two days, the mercury will rise again,” Krishnamurty Padgalwar, director, IMD, Goa said.

The northeasterly winds bring in the chill from the north, but on Monday, the wind direction is likely to change to easterly. “The minimum temperature may go down by half a degree or remain constant, but will rise after third day,” Padgalwar said.

The maximum temperatures have been below normal during the last few days. IMD, Goa recorded 31.3C, one degree less than normal on Wednesday and 30.8C, 1.6 below normal on Thursday.

TNN

Mumbai: Reliance Jio ’s average revenue per unit (ARPU), a key performance metric, stood at Rs 128.4 in the December quarter of fiscal 2020. It is down 1.2% when compared to the Rs 130 ARPU reported a year ago, and up 7% when compared to the Rs 120 ARPU reported in the previous September quarter of fiscal 2020.

ARPU is the total revenue of the telecom operator divided by the number of users on its network. Jio, which was launched in 2016, has 370 million subscribers, making it the world’s second-largest single country operator.

The 7% quarter-on-quarter rise is on the back of Jio ending free voice calls on its network and charging subscribers for the services. RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said Jio is focused on giving unmatched digital experience to consumers at most affordable price and accordingly expanding network capacity and coverage to keep pace with demand.

Surat: State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) department raided seven export units and unearthed input tax credit (ITC) fraud of Rs6.56 crore by them by showing fake supplies of goods in the city on Friday.

Official sources said the raids were conducted at 18 locations which included Begumpura, Magob, Sagrampura and Golvala Jakatnaka and huge amount of documents were recovered from the seven export firms. The scrutiny of the documents revealed that the firms had fraudulently claimed Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) from the government by showing fake supplies to the tune of Rs64 crore.

During investigation, it was found that these export firms availed fraudulent ITC for seeking IGST refund from customs formations. The exporters used to show entries of non-existent bogus firms with fake addresses, which had taken GST registration based on forged documents without paying GST.

The department has recovered about Rs2.5 crore from the seven export firms so far.

PATNA: The Centre is trying to divide the country and create communal strife in the society, said leader of opposition in Bihar assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on the second day of his ‘Pratirodh Sabha’ in Araria on Friday.

Tejashwi, who is on a tour of Seemanchal area against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), NRC and NPR, said Union home minister Amit Shah visited Bihar to create hatred but he does not know that people of this state are intelligent enough and will not be trapped by him. “It is the same Bihar which has once stopped Advani Ji’s Rath Yatra and now people will teach them the lesson in 2020,” he said and asked chief minister Nitish Kumar to stop NPR in Bihar, if he was against NRC.

“I will salute my sisters, even those sitting at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi and other parts of the country, for coming on roads to protect the Constitution. We all will win this fight and the dictators will have to step back,” he added.

On Saturday, Tejashwi will address another rally at Katihar.

Civic officials have installed four bio-toilets and stationed two water tankers inside Park Circus Maidan.

KOLKATA: Women protesting against CAA and NRC at Park Circus Maidan got some relief on Friday with the KMC providing them with bio-toilets and making arrangements for running water at the venue.

More than 250 women — with their children in tow — have been camping at Park Circus Maidan since January 7 to protest against CAA and NRC. The peaceful protest has also been referred to as Kolkata’s Shaheen Bag, referring to the venue at the Capital where thousands of women have been protesting since December 15.

Civic officials have installed four bio-toilets and stationed two water tankers inside Park Circus Maidan after they received criticism for ignoring the plight of women protesting there. The women were spending nights under the sky in the biting cold and had just one washroom at a nearby mosque that they could use. They also didn’t have permission to use microphones.

The protesters, however, had turned down the offer by the civic body to set up a tent and said they would do it themselves. At present, two small temporary sheds have been set up where the women are sleeping at night.

“It has come as a huge relief. Many women were unwilling to participate due to the absence of toilets and running water. We are thankful to the authorities for looking into our demands,” said Tarannum Khan, one of the protesters.

“Absence of basic amenities were hampering our movement against CAA and NRC. Women have been forced to step out of their homes because our existence has been threatened and fundamental rights are in danger,” said Ansari Begum, a homemaker from Topsia who has been a part of the protests for the past 10 days. “More than 70 women stay here at night. It is cold and we were not allowed to put up tents. But we are thankful the government has finally decided to accept our request,” she said.

Several halogen and LED lights have also been put up to illuminate the venue. The KMC has also assured protesters that conservancy staffers will regularly visit the venue to clean the place. Two ambulances have also been parked near the protest venue in case of emergencies.

“We have tried to provide whatever the protesters requested. In future, too, we will help them,” said local councillor Manzar Iqbal.

The protesting women have also decided to send 2,500 postcards to the Chief Justice of India requesting the SC to deliver a fair judgment when the case comes up for hearing. “We are not budging till the government rolls back CAA,” said Ladli Khatoon, another homemaker at the protest.

Elite club: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos with industry leaders on Friday

Bengaluru: E-commerce giant Amazon on Friday said it will create a million — or 10 lakh — new jobs by 2025. The announcement comes a day after commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal played down on Thursday the Seattle-based company’s $1-billion investment in India as “not doing a favour (to the country)”.

Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos on Wednesday had said he will invest $1 billion to digitise small and medium businesses and export ‘Make in India’ goods worth $10 billion to the e-tailer’s global markets by 2025. Amazon said it has created 7,00,000 jobs in India already, directly and indirectly, over the last six years and the total jobs created by the local arm would stand at 1.7 million by 2025. These jobs — both directly and indirectly — will be across industries like information technology, skill development, content creation, retail, logistics and manufacturing, the company said in a statement. The direct jobs created by Amazon in India stand at over 60,000. “We’ve seen huge contributions from our employees, extraordinary creativity from the small businesses we’ve partnered with, and great enthusiasm from the customers who shop with us — and we’re excited about what lies ahead,” said Bezos, the world’s richest man with a net worth of $115 billion.

His comments are of significance amid Amazon’s tension with government officials, who have been reluctant to meet Bezos, unlike his last visit in 2014 when he met PM Narendra Modi as well. To add to that, just before his arrival in India, the Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) opened an investigation against Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart over issues like deep discounting, favourable terms to select sellers. Goyal’s comments on Thursday made the strain in the relationship evident.

A TOI analysis of direct jobs on Amazon’s global jobs portal showed there has been a rise of almost 75% in India at 2,235 openings currently compared to 1,236 a year ago. These numbers of openings — the highest compared to other markets in Asia-Pacific — are across Amazon arms like e-commerce, payments and cloud. Amazon said its job creation is aligned with the Indian government policy that has prioritised this and skilling initiatives — including the training of more than 400 million people by 2022 — in rural and urban areas.

In his letter on the Amazon India platform, Bezos said he is adding 10,000 e-rickshaws in Amazon’s delivery fleet and that it will eliminate single-use plastic from its fulfilment network by June. “The boundless energy, innovation, and grit of the Indian people always inspire me,” he added in the letter. On Friday, Bezos also met senior business leaders in Mumbai including Reliance Industries’ Mukesh Ambani , Airtel’s Sunil Mittal , and Future Group’s Kishore Biyani .

81,['18/01/2020'],Customs dept waives off bank guarantee for Surat Hira Bourse,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Surat: Diamantaires in Surat are a relieved lot after the customs department of Ahmedabad waived off bank guarantee for Surat Hira Bourse (SHB). This means that exporters in Surat would no longer have to depend on Mumbai to export polished diamonds and jewellery.

The total export of polished diamond from India is pegged at Rs 1.50 lakh crore per annum. Majority of the exports is handled by BDB at Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai. The diamantaires send the diamond parcels to Mumbai for the direct export to various parts of the world.

SHB, operated by the Diamond and Gem Development Corporation (DGDC) at Katargam, had to provide bank guarantee under the electronic data interchange (EDI) system for export of high-value valuable parcels.

As a custodian, SHB was unable to pay bank guarantee for goods above Rs 100 crore. This complelled Surat exporters to send their consignments from the Bharat Diamond Bourse (BDB) in Mumbai without bank guarantee.

CEO of SHB, KK Sharma told TOI, “De-linking of bank guarantee from EDI has opened the doors for the SHB to carry out export of polished diamonds of any amount. Earlier, we had to keep certain amount reserved in the EDI for carrying out exports from Surat. In case of big export consignment of over Rs 200 crore, we were unable to process the same and that the exporters were forced to do it from Mumbai.”

According to Sharma, the annual export of polished diamonds from SHB is pegged at Rs 25,000 crore. After the delinking of bank guarantee, the export will double up in the next one year. Exporters from Surat will not have to send their parcels to Mumbai, bearing extra cost of shipment and insurance.

Atul Mehta, owner of Facet Virtue, a diamond exporter said, “Our parcels are high in value and we were facing lot of problems exporting them from SHB due to bank guarantee issue. As the problem has been resolved, we are all prepared to ship all our consignment from SHB. This will save us hugely on the transportation cost of the diamonds and other costs including agents.”

Girish Patel, chief accountant of KARP Impex, told TOI, “The parcels were held up for days due to the bank guarantee issue at SHB. Thus, we preferred to export our parcels from Mumbai. As now the bank guarantee has been waived off, we have an opportunity to use the SHB facility by exporting goods of any value.”

“The bank guarantee waiver will allow Surat diamantaires to export diamonds of any value, which was earlier impossible. We feel that the exports is going to double up from Surat in the next one year.

Mumbai: The Supreme Court ’s order on a review petition by telecom companies on AGR dues that went against Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel took its first toll in the mutual fund (MF) industry as Franklin Templeton MF wrote off its entire Rs 2,050-crore investments in Vodafone Idea’s debt papers.

According to sources, UTI MF , which had about Rs 560 crore invested in the struggling telecom company’s debt, is expected decide on its investments in Vodafone Idea soon. Mutual fund houses that also include Aditya Birla MF and Nippon India MF, had a total exposure of about Rs 3,400 crore in Vodafone Idea’s debt, industry data for month ended December 2019 showed. Aditya Birla MF had an exposure of about Rs 500 crore, while Nippon India MF had Rs 225 crore (see graphic).

In a communication, Franklin Templeton MF said Vodafone Idea’s securities held in its various fixed income schemes are still rated at investment grade, which currently limits the options available to the fund house. “Clarity may take some time to emerge even if the company takes recourse to a curative petition or other measures available to it. As a prudent measure, and in order to protect value for existing unit holders in these schemes…securities of Vodafone Idea held in various fixed income schemes of Franklin Templeton have been marked down to zero. The valuation adjustment only reflects the realizable price of the relevant securities on the date of valuation and does not indicate any reduction or write-off of the amount repayable by (the company),” it said.

Industry experts said other fund houses are also expected to write off their investments in Vodafone Idea, fully or partially.

CHENNAI: Chinese automobile major Great Wall Motors (GWM) will acquire the Talegaon manufacturing facility of General Motors (GM). The factory will be used by GWM for an Indian debut. GWM VP (global strategy) Liu Xiangshang said the transaction would underpin the company’s plan to enter and invest in India. “The Indian market has great potential, rapid economic growth and a good investment environment. Entering the Indian market is an important step for GWM’s global strategy,” said Liu.

A company statement said, “Under a binding term sheet, the GM India legal entity, which includes the Talegaon facility, will transfer to GWM. GWM will officially debut its Haval brand and GWM EV at the Delhi International Auto Show, and launch its Indian market plan.”

GM India’s other Indian plant at Halol has been taken over by MG Motor India, which is owned by another Chinese major — SAIC. “Since focusing the Talegaon plant on manufacturing for export markets in 2017, GM has been exploring strategic options for better utilisation of the site. Our decision to cease production at Talegaon is based on GM’s global strategy and optimisation of our manufacturing footprint around the world,” said GM senior VP (international operations) Julian Blissett.

Going forward, GM, he added, will “work closely with the state and national governments to secure the required approvals so that GWM can elevate production at the plant even further and maintain Talegaon’s status as a vibrant vehicle manufacturing region”.

GM will provide a separation package and transition support for impacted employees, as well as an orderly transition for partners. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. However, Chevrolet, he added, will continue to honour all warranties and provide aftersales support, including ongoing service and parts requirements for existing customers in India.

Representative image

PATNA: The state transport department will soon bring ‘ School Transportation Policy ’ to regulate buses, vans and auto rickshaws engaged in ferrying schoolchildren.

Speaking at an event on the concluding day of road safety week on Friday, transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said, “We are going to make rules and regulations for school vehicles to ensure safety of schoolchildren. It would be the responsibility of all schools to maintain a register of the number of vehicles engaged for ferrying children with details of the drivers, vehicle’s registration number and contact number of drivers. We have prepared a draft copy of the rules and regulations, which would be implemented this year after the state government notification.”

Under the new policy, the schools will also have to ensure that vehicles ferrying schoolchildren follow all safety measures, including installation of GPS tracking system, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, first-aid kit, fire extinguisher, speed governor and all required documents.

Agarwal said action will be taken against the schools for not following the rules. “We will also take feedback from people as well as private schools about the policy, which will be the first step to regularize school vehicles about which we don’t have any record now,” he said.

He also talked about other measures, including paid training for commercial drivers. “Experts are imparting training to the drivers of autorickshaws and other commercial vehicles at Bankipore bus depot in Patna on road safety and we are also paying them Rs300 and providing food packets to compensate for their daily earnings,” he said, adding that the initiative will soon be implemented in other districts as well.

Agarwal also that officials are identifying additional space for parking facilities in the city. “The number of vehicles in Patna is increasing at the rate of around 10% every year, but there is shortage of parking space. Thus, apart from identifying additional parking slots, we are also mulling hydraulic parking facility this year. Hydraulic car parking system is a mechanical device that multiplies parking capacity at a particular slot,” Agarwal said.

He said an automated track will come up at the upcoming transport complex at Phulwarisharif for conducting driving test of those seeking driving licences,” he said.

89,['18/01/2020'],Bihar: Candidates protest over delay in results,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: Hundreds of candidates staged protest outside Bihar Staff Selection Commission (BSSC) office in the state capital for several hours on Friday over delay in declaring results of preliminary test (PT) for recruitment against 13,120 vacancies at Intermediate level in several departments. The advertisement for the PT was published in September 2014.

Agitating candidates also entered the commission’s office premises and damaged a door and nameplate of BSSC chairman Ravindra Kumar. Later, the security guards locked the main iron grills after chasing protesters outside the premises. None, including media persons, were allowed to enter the premises.

Police personnel from Airport police station reached the spot with reinforcement and took control of the situation.

The preliminary tests were conducted on January 6 and January 9, 2017. But after the allegations of question papers leak before the exam started, a probe was ordered. Then BSSC chairman Sudhir Kumar and secretary Parmeshwar Ram along with several others had been sent to jail on the charges of passing students after taking bribe and leaking question papers.

The entire examination was scrapped on the direction of CM Nitish Kumar on February 8 that year. Around 13 lakh candidates were scheduled to write PT that time for recruitment as panchayat sachiv, revenue employee, lower division clerk, typist and for several other positions.

Around 8.5 lakh candidates appeared in the fresh preliminary tests conducted in December 2018, but results have not been declared yet. One of the agitating candidates, Abhishek Tiwari, said, “Mains, typing, physical examinations still remain to be completed. In these years, several more retired and vacancies increased. Instead of making recruitment, government is either hiring retired employees on contract or taking work of 20 people from one employee, leading to inefficiency and corruption.” The chairman says copies are being examined, he said.

Sarvajeet Kumar Singh said the secretary attributed the delay in declaring results to lack of manpower and resources.

Another candidate Nandan Kumar said the commission kept extending the deadline to declare results since October last year.

Mukesh Kumar said a government institution like BELTRON declared its results for recruitment of data operators on Friday for which examinations were conducted hardly a month back.

When asked, Airport police station SHO Arun Kumar said students had met the chairman and only they can say what transpired in their talks.

90,['18/01/2020'],"Bihar: Allies must be realistic on seat-sharing issue, says Congress","This story is from January 18, 2020

PATNA: Seat sharing is likely to be a bone of contention in the Mahagathbandhan in Bihar. Congress legislator party leader Sadanand Singh on Friday said allies must be “realistic” as his party will not compromise on seats in the assembly elections to be held later this year as there was great resentment in the rank and file over the issue in the Lok Sabha elections last year.

Talking to TOI a day after BJP national president Amit Shah announced at Vaishali that NDA will fight the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar under the leadership of JD(U) national president and CM Nitish Kumar, Sadanand said though incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad enjoys amicable relations with the Congress high command, but it is his party which compromises to follow the gathbandhan dharma (coalition principles).

“It has mostly been seen that Congress makes compromises in terms of its share of seats in Bihar, which creates resentment among the rank and file of the party as witnessed in the last parliamentary elections. Still, it was only Congress among the opposition parties, which won a seat in Bihar,” Sadanand said, adding that Congress is making preparations in all 243 assembly constituencies in Bihar.

Sadanand, the eldest member of Bihar assembly at present, said, “It does not serve any purpose to want higher number of seats but winning none. We would like other Mahagathbandhan partners to take a cue from the last Lok Sabha elections and be realistic.”

As the Sadanand’s statements indicate, there are many ifs and buts in the Mahagathbandhan while NDA in Bihar seems to be moving ahead in terms of sorting out coalition issues. Shah’s announcement in Vaishali has at least put a lid on any speculations on the CM face and only seat sharing remains to be finalized.

But the Mahagathbandhan is still struggling over the issue of CM face as most of its constituents are not willing to accept RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav as the CM face despite the party led by Lalu making its stand clear on the issue on several occasions.

“It is true that RJD has announced Tejashwi as its CM face, but our party high command has not sent any directive on this matter so far to the state unit,” Sadanand said, adding that the party is open to forming alliance with like-minded parties.

The Mahagathbandhan constituents have also been staking claims on higher number of seats. Jitan Ram Manjhi-led HAM(S) has recently demanded 85 seats, while RJD is not ready to contest less than 150 seats out of the total 243 assembly segments in Bihar.

Lack of unity and coordination among the allies had cost the Mahagathbandhan dearly in the last Lok Sabha elections as only Congress could have won one seat of the Muslim-dominated Kishanganj out of total 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar.

PATNA: An assistant sub-inspector and a civil jamadar were arrested in an inebriated state from Motihari and Gaya police lines respectively in a statewide inspection of barracks on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday following allegations of smuggled liquor supply. The raids were conducted on the directions of state police headquarters.

A retired policeman and three others in an inebriated state managed to the Gaya police lines during inspection. This was first-of-its-kind action taken since prohibition in state on April 5, 2016.

Barracks of Patna police lines were also inspected, but neither liquor was recovered nor anyone was found drunk.

Sources said the decision of simultaneous inspection was taken to induce fear in policemen living at police lines from where several of them had been arrested with liquor or in an inebriated state in the past.

Two days back, several empty liquor bottles were spotted lying inside Patna police lines. Several police personnel had been arrested from Patna police lines in the past for consuming liquor.

Gaya SSP Rajeev Mishra said three civil jamadars, one havildar and a retired police personnel at the police lines were drunk during inspection. “Civil jamadar Binda Lal Munda was arrested and sent to jail on Friday. He was also suspended,” he said, adding an empty and a partially filled liquor bottle were seized during the inspection of barracks.

He said the retired policeman was identified as Tudu Ji, who was a court subedar while others were civil jamadars Mangal Tigga and Lakhan Oraon and havildar Javed Minj. “They all escaped,” Mishra said adding all five were made named accused in an FIR lodged with Rampur police station.

Motihari SP Naveen Chandra Jha said the arrested ASI was identified as Rajendra Singh. “He is a native of Aurangabad district. He was placed under suspension with immediate effect and was sent to jail on Friday,” Jha said.

When asked, ADG (law and order) Amit Kumar said a detailed report on simultaneous inspections of all 40 police lines across state was awaited. Kumar is also handling the additional charge of ADG (headquarters).

Rel Jio’s ARPU drops by 1.2% to Rs 128.4

MUMBAI: Reliance Industries ( RIL ) reported a 13.5% rise in profit in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 to Rs 11,640 crore, benefiting from higher price realisations in its refining, retail, media and digital services businesses. The company’s revenue in the December quarter, however, fell 1.4% to Rs 1.68 lakh crore due to an 11% decline in its traditional petrochemicals and refining businesses and a 7% fall in Brent crude price.Operating profit in petrochemicals, the biggest contributor to RIL’s earnings, declined 29% to Rs 5,880 crore due to inventory overhang and global demand slowdown. On the other hand, refining, the second-largest contributor to RIL’s profit, increased 12% to Rs 5,657 crore because of better margins. RIL’s Jamnagar refinery , the world’s largest, earned $9.2 from every barrel of crude it processed, higher than $8.8 it earned in the third quarter of fiscal 2019.Retail, media and digital services ( Reliance Jio ) zoomed 58%, 309% and 63% to Rs 2,389 crore, Rs 237 crore and Rs 3,857 crore respectively.RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said the results of the energy business reflects the weak global economic environment and volatility in the energy market. “Within our oil to chemicals chain, downstream petrochemicals profitability was impacted by weak margins across products with subdued demand in well-supplied markets. While refining’s performance improved given our focus on cost positions, high operating rates and product placement.” He added that RIL’s consumer businesses continue to establish new milestones every quarter.Ambani had said that he wants the retail and digital services businesses to contribute as much to RIL’s earnings as that of its traditional units like petrochemicals and refining. The retail and Jio divisions accounted for 37% of RIL’s operating profit in the December quarter of fiscal 2020, up from 26% a year earlier.

AHMEDABAD: Two debt-ridden men came into contact with each other on social media, when they put post to sell their kidneys on a Facebook page named “Kidney Sellers”. As this advertisement did not work, and to get out of debt, they decided to try to break into an ATM to get money.

The two men — Aloksingh Rajput, 25 and Uttam Savalia, 32 — who live at Punyakoti Apartments in Vejalpur, were arrested by city police on January 15 when they were trying to cut into an SBI ATM near Polytechnic in Ambawadi.

Rajput dropped out from school after finishing his Class XII in the science stream, while Savalia failed his Class X exam.

During their interrogation, they told cops police they had met about two years ago.

“Rajput had a debt of Rs 6 lakh and Savalia had a Rs 3 lakh debt, as they had borrowed money to set up their own construction businesses. Both of them had put up a post advertising their kidney for sale. First Savalia, and then Rajput. Savalia first contacted Rajput, asking if he had got any bidders for his kidney. They gradually began talking to each other,” said a city police official.

Official said as they did not get any takers for their kidneys, and moneylenders were harassing them, they decided to make a quick buck by breaking into an ATM.

“The duo first watched videos on YouTube and decided to make their first attempt at a Union Bank ATM in Ambawadi. As they had bought gas cutters and other tools for their construction business, they used these for their first ATM breaking attempt,” said an official of Ellisbridge police, where a complaint for the ATM break-in attempt was lodged on January 15.

“On December 25, 2019, they had made a failed attempt to cut into the Union Bank ATM in Ambawadi. They later tried to break into an SBI ATM in Ambawadi, but were caught as a security systems alerted bank officials, who informed the police and cops nabbed them red handed,” the official said.

VADODARA: At least 40 railway staffers associated with Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh (WRMS) were detained by cops on Friday.

Nearly 400 staffers were protesting against ‘privatization’ of high-speed Tejas Express , which made its inaugural run between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.

The railway unions were protesting at Vadodara railway station shouting slogans against the IRCTC-operated train which they said will not only add to burden of travellers but also compromise on safety of railway network.

Those detained by the cops included WRMS president Sharik Khan and divisional secretary M K Mahani. The protesters were taken to police headquarters and released after nearly two and a half hours.

“We were just holding a peaceful demonstration outside the railway station. It was a peaceful protest based on Gandhiji’s ideology. Yet, we were detained by the cops,” said Khan.

“Currently, AC chair car between Ahmedabad and Mumbai costs Rs540. But IRCTC will be charging Rs1,450 for the same duration. At the same time with the introduction of flexi-fare system, the travelling charge will further increase,” he said.

WRMS has been protesting against privatization of Indian Railways. “They will be using our own resources including drivers, trackman and all category staffers. IRCTC, which is not capable of providing proper food to passengers, is being asked to run trains. What efficiency are we talking about?” Khan asked.

The running staff including loco pilots, guards, ticket checking staff and the staff belonging to other categories joined the protest and shouted slogans against privatization, corporatization of railway colonies, production units and workshops.

A CID crime official said the scam is worth about Rs 35 crore. “The accused persons formed eight cooperative societies in which they made dummy members and opened account in their names. They later obtained loans of nearly Rs 35 crore by providing forged documents,” said a CID official.

They availed of the loans in 2006-07 but they did not repay them. When the bank enquired into it, they found that eight cooperative societies had carried out irregularities to avail of the loans, which the accused spent on their personal use, the official said. Four of the societies were registered in Abdasa and the other four in Mandvi.

The inquiry into the alleged scam had begun in March 13, 2015, but a local court in Naliya had granted a stay on the probe. The investigating agency then challenged the stay in the Gujarat high court which set aside the Naliya court order on October 8, 2018.

MADURAI: The Trichy Corporation has been directed by the Madras high court to disburse terminal benefits to the family of a deceased sanitary worker within 12 weeks more than eight years after the civic body rejected the benefits.

R Rajeswari filed a petition at the high court Madurai bench in 2011, seeking to quash a August 5, 2011 rejection order and sought to pay the terminal and other benefits of her deceased husband. She also sought to consider her for employment under compassionate ground.

The petitioner’s counsel stated that Rajeswari’s husband Rajendran was appointed as sanitary worker in the corporation on compassionate ground in 1999 after the death of his father. He submitted that based on an anonymous petition stating that Rajendran had obtained employment by suppressing the fact that one of his family members was already working in the corporation, the authorities dismissed him from service after conducting an inquiry.

Challenging his dismissal, Rajendran filed a petition before the Madras high court, which on December 23, 2003, set aside the dismissal order and granted liberty to the authorities concerned to proceed with disciplinary proceedings.

Pursuant to the court order, the corporation commissioner reinstated the petitioner’s husband into service in 2004 and when the departmental inquiry was pending, he died due to ailment in 2007.

The counsel stated that the petitioner submitted a representation to disburse terminal benefits and to provide her employment on compassionate ground. Since, there was no reply, she filed an application under the RTI Act and the authorities passed an order on August 5, 2011, stating that since the disciplinary proceedings cannot be dropped, pensionary benefits cannot be given to the petitioner.

The government advocate submitted that Rajendran had obtained appointment under compassionate ground by suppressing the fact that his mother was employed in the same corporation.

He submitted that the petitioner was paid money under the group insurance scheme and final settlement of eligible days of earned leave and therefore the sanctioning of pensionary benefits does not arise.

On perusal of the submissions, justice J Nisha Banu observed that the authorities concerned cannot take such a stand when the disciplinary proceedings were dropped after the demise of the petitioner’s husband.

Hence, by partially allowing the petition, the judge set aside the rejection order and gave the direction to the Trichy Corporation.

The judge further directed the authorities to consider compassionate appointment to the petitioner in accordance with law.

109,['18/01/2020'],Acid Test For Officials; Low Awareness On Burning Issue,"Acid being sold openly in an Old City market

BHOPAL: When a homemaker asks for a bottle of acid to clean her washroom and sanitary wares or kitchen tiles of her house from any grocery shop or picks a bottle at a superstore, little does she realise that she can’t do it without obtaining a permit from sub-divisional magistrate of her area. In fact, there are stringent laws in place both for sale and purchase of acid.But in the absence of proper enforcement at least a lot of buyers of acid don’t know about those laws and many shopkeepers also feign ignorance about them. “I was never told by anyone that I need a licence from no less than the district collector to sell the acid,” said a shopkeeper at Six No. market in Shivaji Nagar when TOI sought to know whether any restrictions in place for sale and purchase of acid are followed.On the other hand, an overwhelming majority of people who purchase acid for household use would assume why should there be so many restrictions on sale/purchase of something as “innocuous” as acid. But, it is that miniscule minority, who use acid as a “lethal” weapon to disfigure someone— more often a girl— that the stringent laws are in place both for the purchasers and sellers.Activist, Roli Shavhare, told TOI, “Purchasing acid is so easy that even a child could fetch it from any grocery shop. She said what does acid do to body and psyche of a survivor could only be felt when you meet a victim or see a sensitively made film or documentary and therefore, it’s absolutely necessary that acid sale is restricted.” It’s also a fact that enforcement agencies and their officials were not themselves aware of the rules applicable on sale/purchase of acid and only after CM’s order to ensure that acid is sold /purchased in accordance with the law on Friday.SDM, Huzur, who seized about 100 bottles of acid during raids, told TOI that according to rules someone selling certain types of acid which includes the acid used for cleaning of glazed tiles in households should get a license from the district magistrate and who-so-ever buys acid must obtain a permit for the purpose and the seller should maintain a record on who bought the acid, its quantity and purpose. However, there is no restriction on quantity of purchase, if one has permit from the SDM.When asked whether the rules are observed either by the seller or the buyer, he said, “It should be observed and if it was not happening till now, it would definitely be enforced now.”",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73348021,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-798193,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/acid-test-for-officials-low-awareness-on-burning-issue/articleshow/73340437.cms

Nashik: The Trimbak Municipal Council removed all the encroachments on the roads and open spaces on account of Nivruttinath Yatra, for which pilgrims from across the state and the country are flocking to the temple town of Trimbakeshwar .

Chief officer of Trimbak Municipal Council Pravin Nikam said, “We removed the temporary encroachments on the streets, open spaces and gardens to ensure the safety of pilgrims.”

The action comes a day after district collector Suraj Mandhare warned of taking strict action against the officials of the municipal council, who are vested with authoritative powers under the Disaster Management Act, if they failed to remove the encroachments.

Mandhare had clearly pointed out that all the commercial establishments would have to be confined to a particular area, keeping in mind the safety of the 5 lakh-odd pilgrims who come to Trimbakeshwar, which has a population of less than 13,000.

“We made the road from the Nivruttinath temple till the bus stand and also the entry of Trimbakeshwar town free of encroachments. All this was done in the interest of the pilgrims. They will now get ample space to walk on the streets without any hindrance,” said Nikam.

The authorities brought down all the encroachments, including the pandals and the structures raised on the pavement and footpath of the roads. The belongings of 11 vendors, which included utensils, hand carts, temporary carts used for cooking and serving food for commercial purposes, were confiscated. All those who want to serve food free of cost or even otherwise have been asked to shift their stalls to specific areas.

The vendors have also been warned against drawing power illegally. The MSEDCL has been asked to keep close tabs on such people.

The district administration has warned that it would take strict action against those who are found indulging in the illegal construction of a temporary shed.

112,['18/01/2020'],Dist admin to extend RTS to 80 more services,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Nashik: The district administration has decided to extend the provisions of Right To Service Act ( RTS ) to 80 more services than those that have already been stipulated by the state in the act. The extension will be applicable from Saturday.

“We have decided to extend the RTS Act to 80 more services in the district. The services will be in addition to those that have already been prescribed by the government,” district collector Suraj Mandhare said.

The administration has decided to extend the ambit of the RTS and thus bring in more services under it so that citizens get better services. As of now, people have to wait endlessly for services and there are also chances that the file submitted to the offices goes missing.

“At times it so happens that a person applies for a permission or requests for a particular work to be done and then makes two or three visits to the collector’s office, but the task remains pending. After several attempts, the person gives up and eventually stops following up with the concerned department which leads to the file lying unattended,” Mandhare said.

In order to cut down such experiences in the district, the administration has decided to implement the RTS to 80 more services that will ensure the applicants’ get timely and prompt services.

“Currently, the services provided by us are not up to the mark. Of the total number of services sought, as many as 82% are delayed. We have now asked the officials improve their services and also include 80 more services in the RTS act. With this new addition, the total number of services under the RTS act will not go up to 200,” Collector said.

During his tenure as the chief executive officer of Pune zilla parishad, Mandhare had brought in more than 120 additional services under the ambit of the RTS and he plans to introduce the same here.

Under the RTS, citizens who submit their applications to any office will be intimated about the time frame for the completion of the task.

If the decision cannot be taken with the given time limit due to any reason, the applicant will be notified about the same well in advance.

“The office has to decide on the application in the stipulated time and deliver the service and the failure would lead to escalation of the application. If in the inquiry the personnel or the officer is found guilty, he will be slapped with Rs 5,000 fine. Also, other action may follow,” a senior officer from the collectorate said.

The services to be included in the list of RTS are getting certified copy for 7/12 extract from talathi, permission for fire crackers, getting certified copies from record room and many more, the officer added.

MADURAI: The Madras high court has sought a response from the state government on a plea seeking to construct a foot overbridge across the surplus water channel at Sengulam village in Virudhunagar district.

S Karuppaiah, a resident of Madurai district , in his petition stated that there are nearly 50 families belonging to the scheduled caste families residing near the eastern side of the irrigation tank at the at Sengulam village in Aruppukottai taluk.

Since a surplus water channel is situated near the residential area and when the tank is full, water flows through the surplus channel. During the rainy season when the water flows across the surplus water channel, people in the area face difficulty to cross the area.

Though the residents of the area have submitted several representations to the authorities concerned to construct a foot overbridge there, no steps were taken in this regard so far.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction. Hearing the plea, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran sought a response from the state government and adjourned the case to a further date for hearing.

Girish Bapat

PUNE: Senior BJP leader and MP Girish Bapat on Friday said the British-era cantonments across the country should be abolished.

Speaking during his maiden appearance at the general body meeting of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) as a nominated member on account of being Pune’s MP, Bapat said the cantonments were raised by the British administration, but they were no more relevant to the prevailing situation.

“An army officer of the Brigadier rank heads the cantonment board. Why does he need to worry about civic issues like drainage work, school functioning or paucity of funds? Their (Army’s) charter of duty is different and important. Why should we involve them in these of kind of issues? I believe they should manage exclusive military areas. I shall take up this (cantonment) issue with the ministry of defence and the authorities concerned,” he said.

Both, Bapat and Pune Cantonment MLA Sunil Kamble promised Rs1 crore each from their local area development funds to the PCB.

The PCB’s chief executive officer, Amit Kumar, said, “We shall utilize the MP and the MLA funds to effectively run the newly constructed maternity ward at our general hospital.”

Bapat said the elected members of the board should have filed a petition in the court against the state government on the issue of the cantonments’ share in the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

“As people’s representatives, they should have explored the legal aspect in the past,” he said, questioning the elected board members as to why they did not do so.

A section of the elected members, representing BJP, stated that they could not have gone to the court against the state government which was, till recently, led by the BJP. Six of the eight elected members in the PCB are from BJP and two are from Congress.

Bapat urged the members to submit a copy of the proposals related to key development projects in the cantonment areas.

“My endeavour is to resolve issues related to people in the city. Once we get proposals in writing, I shall take them up with various government departments. Necessary funds and development schemes will also be implemented in the cantonment areas,” he said.

Kamble, who was also the standing committing chairman of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said he would take up the finance issue of the board with the city’s civic body. “In the past, the PMC had made special budgetary provision for the board. On similar lines, I shall take up the issue with the civic authorities,” he said.

Some of the board members claimed that Bapat made “irrelevant” statements instead of providing solutions to the problems of the PCB.

“We had discussed the GST share issue with him when he was Pune’s guardian minister, but he did not resolve it. He needs to understand that the PCB was one of the wealthiest cantonments in the country. As the government abolished Local Body Tax, its financial condition has taken a severe beating,” said a BJP member, who did not wish to be named.

The centre would organise events throughout the year including a project on Kumbh Mela, a brainstorming session, documentation of Kumbh Melas as a case study to help scholars understand the nuances of cultural site over other geographical spaces.

Besides, the facility would also document the past and future Kumbh Melas, enlisted as ‘Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity’ by UNESCO, as a case study to help scholars, said the director.

Shivam, an accounts and finance professional from New Zealand who is on a month-long leave to serve pilgrims at Magh Mela. “I am here to get peace which can be attained by serving devouts, collecting their pattal (plates made of leaves) and help other volunteers” he said.

Another volunteer Yashdeep, who is a national-level tennis player and is busy with training at Rafael Nadal Tennis Training Academy in Spain, is also serving pilgrims and performing odd jobs entrusted to him. Sanyam, pursing his engineering studies from Noida is happily serving food to pilgrims and seers. Likewise, Naman, a BCA student from Delhi’s Jagannath Institute of Management Studies helps others in the kitchen.

“Everyone is equal at this place and everyone tries to get solace and cleanse atma (soul) by performing voluntary seva (service),” said Mahant Swami Satyam.

124,['18/01/2020'],Goa: Five men accused of tiger killings in Golauli get bail,"This story is from January 18, 2020

The tigers were found dead last week

VALPOI: The Valpoi JMFC on Friday granted conditional bail to all the five accused who were allegedly involved in the deaths of four tigers at Golauli, Sattari, last week.

Bail was granted on a personal bond of Rs 15,000 each. The five accused are required to report for 10 days to the investigation officer at Mhadei Wild Sanctuary office in Maloli between 10am and 5pm.

Vitho Pavane, 60, Malo Pavane, 50, Bomo Pavane, 45, Jyotiba Pavane, 25, and Bhiro Pavane, 22, were accused of poisoning meat that was consumed by the tigers, leading to their deaths. Three were arrested on January 8 while the remaining two were arrested on January 10.

Advocate Yeshwant Gauns, who represented the accused, said he objected to the forest department’s claim that the five men would influence witnesses and tamper with evidence if they were let out on bail. He told the court there was nothing that could be tampered with as the carcasses of the tigers were already disposed of by the forest department and the evidence required had already been collected for forensic investigation.

“Among the other aspects that the court considered was the health condition of the family members of the accused in their absence,” Gauns said.

Counsel for the forest department Nikhil Vaze, said he sought an extension of remand for the accused, but the court refused it. “We had opposed bail as we still require the tigers’ claws, which are still missing. The court, however, has granted bail to the accused but has imposed certain conditions,” he said.

Nashik: Woollens were out and bonfires were seen at many places as the mercury plunged to the season’s lowest of 6 degrees celsius in the city on Friday.

The minimum temperature was 4 degrees below normal and lowest in city as well as in the state, said the weather department.

The nip in the air was felt during the day time also in the city as the maximum temperature too was 4 degrees below normal at 25.1 degrees celsius.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned that the temperatures in Nashik region are likely to dip further in the next 48 hours.

The head of IMD (weather), Pune, Anupam Kashyapi, said that for the first time, northerly winds have penetrated in north Maharashtra which is bringing down the mercury.

Citizens were caught unawares by the sudden dip in the temperature. “We have been suddenly feeling cold for the past two days. I had kept my sweater in the cupboard around a week ago, but have again pulled it out,” said Rajesh Jadhav, a senior citizen.

“It was extremely cold in the morning. My daughter, who is studying in junior KG, woke up late and did not want to go to school. I did not send her to school due to the cold weather. I myself woke up late and wore warm clothes,” said Sonali Khairnar, housewife.

The residents are seen lighting bonfires at nights in old city areas for the last two days.

Meanwhile, Jalgaon city recorded the second lowest temperature of 7 degrees and Malegaon town 8.2 degrees.

Niphad records 2.4C, grape farmers worried

Niphad taluka — the grape-growing belt in Nashik district —recorded the season’s lowest temperature of 2.4 degrees celsius on Friday, said the Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri.

The record minimum temperature in Niphad had been recorded at 1.8 degrees celsius last year.

The growth of berry gets affected if the minimum temperature falls below 6 degrees and fruits develop cracks if the mercury plunges below 4 degrees.

The sharp drop in the temperature has increased the worries of the grape farmers. The vineyards, which are ready for harvesting, are most likely to be affected.

“The fruit may develop cracks. Moreover, the growth of berry that is in developing stage is affected as its size will be stunted,” said Kailas Bhosle, senior official of the Maharashtra Rajya Draksha Bagayatdar Sangh, an association of grape growers.

He said the effect of the very cold temperature on grapes will be seen after two three days.

Grape farmers have started taking measures like making bonfires in vineyards to maintain the temperature.

“Some farmers are watering the vineyards at dawn through the drip irrigation method to bring the temperature under control,” said Bhosle.

HYDERABAD: A 22-year-old hotel management student, who was also training to be a disc jockey (DJ), died under suspicious circumstances at a hotel in Kondapur on Friday. The deceased, H Rathna Vara Prasad Rao, son of a private teacher, H Muralidhar, was from Shivaji Nagar in Sanatnagar.

Vara Prasad along with his girlfriend, an MNC employee, and two other friends, including Madhapur pub manager Rana Pratap and his girlfriend, checked into two separate rooms of a hotel around 12.30am on Friday, police said. “The four friends went from Revolt Pub in Madhapur to the hotel. The couples checked into separate rooms. At 2am, according to Rana Pratap, Vara Prasad went to his room and borrowed a cigarette and that was the last time Rana spoke to Vara Prasad. Prior to that, Rana and his girlfriend heard Vara Prasad assaulting his girlfriend in his room and they stopped him,” Gachibowli inspector Srinivas said.

At 9am, Vara Prasad’s girlfriend woke up from sleep and saw that he was lying on the floor next to the bed. Upset that he assaulted her the previous night, she left for work without trying to wake him up, the inspector said.

Subsequently, Rana and his girlfriend went to Vara Prasad’s room and saw him lying on the floor. “Rana thought that his friend was too drunk and passed out. He took a photo of Prasad lying on the floor to make fun of him later. He did not realise that Vara Prasad might not be alive. Rana and his girlfriend lifted him and put him on the bed. Even after they sprinkled water on his face, Vara Prasad did not wake up. The couple left the hotel assuming that he might wake up later,” the inspector said.

Around 1pm, the hotel manager became suspicious as Vara Prasad did not come out of the room. “The hotel staff called us and ‘108’ staff declared him dead. There were no external injuries and, based on the victim’s father’s complaint, we registered a suspicious death case. The cause of death can only be ascertained after we get the post-mortem report,” he added.

128,['18/01/2020'],"Farmers will be compensated for crop damaged by hail, assures Kamal Nath","This story is from January 18, 2020

Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: On the last day of the two-day special session of the state assembly, opposition BJP staged a walk-out dissatisfied with the state government’s answer on the fate of guest teachers who have been on an indefinite protest since December 28 demanding regularization in their jobs here at the Yaadgaar-e-Shahjahani Park. As House commenced on Friday morning, opposition raised two major issues – first, of crops affected by hailstorms in the Chambal districts and second, the protest by guest teachers.

Former minister and BJP’s chief whip Narottam Mishra said hailstorms have hit the districts of Datia and Gwalior where paddy crops have been badly damaged.

He argued that it is an issue of public interest. In reply, minister for cooperatives Dr Govind Singh said that information is being collected on the extent of damage.

LOP Gopal Bhargava said that since assembly is in session, then issues like guest teachers and rains affecting paddy crops should be discussed.

CM Kamal Nath told the House, “I am glad that attention has been drawn to the paddy crops and the hail storm. In the past four to five months there have been historic rainfall in the state in which damages were equivalent to Rs 8,000 crore. Just bridges and infrastructure damages add to Rs 2,000 crore. Even ten days ago, I spoke to the Union home minister and asked for assistance. On January 27-28, we have a meeting with the Union Home minister regarding these issues in Raipur.”

Kamal Nath further said“Survey of the hailstorm will be conducted and compensation will be paid,” he assured the House.

“Everyone cannot be made happy but overall we will try to resolve the problem,” he said. The chief minister told the House that if any MLA knows of difficulties faced by farmers in procurement of paddy, then he can call the chief minister and inform of the same.

The query on guest teachers was left to minister for higher education Jeetu Patwari to answer. The minister said, “Government is trying to resolve their problems. The challenge is that over the past 30 years there was no appointment of professors. The government’s intention is to regularize all guest teachers, not a single teacher will be left out. Between January 20 and 25, they will be allotted their schools.”

But BJP was not satisfied with the answer. LOP Bhargava said, “These teachers have been teaching for 15 years and 8,000 posts are vacant. This is a humanitarian issue. Guest teachers have been sitting out in the winter for days shivering in the cold. This government has become inhuman. We are walking-out against this.”

Pune: The general body of the Pune Cantonment Board on Friday resolved to construct a dedicated shed for stray animals.

One of the board members, Atul Gaikwad, moved the proposal for a shed for stray animals in the meeting chaired by Brigadier Kuljit Singh, the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) president. Gaikwad said, “About 400 stray animals, mainly cows, wander in the cantonment areas. They not only create a traffic issue but also affect cleanliness of roads. A dedicated shed can help resolve this issue.”

Chief executive officer Amit Kumar said the board would construct the shed. “But the location of the facility needs to be selected in a such way that the transportation of these animals is carried out smoothly,” he said.

The board members as well as nominated representative also urged the board to appoint an agency to address the stray dogs’ problem.

Kumar said, “The board has floated a tender for catching, sterilizing and immunizing of stray dogs for six times in the past two years. But no agency has responded.”

Kumar said according to the direction received from the director-general defence estates (DGDE), the board had created five zones of the cantonment as per the land records.

“It will be submitted to the DGDE once I get suggestions and objections from the members in next 10 days,” Kumar said. TNN

AFP photo used for representational purpose only

HYDERABAD: Respondents to the National Population Register ( NPR ), 2020 questionnaire will have to tell the government if their parents were born in India or in a foreign country, if the trial run conducted last year is any indication. If the parents were born in India, one will have to indicate the state and district. If they were born outside India, the country will have to be mentioned.

This is one of two new questions that the questionnaire had for the trial run conducted in select states between October and December. The second question was about giving Aadhaar number, PAN number, driving licence, mobile number and voter ID. Both these questions were missing in the 2010 final format NPR.

The pre-test is a mandatory exercise conducted to find out if there are any difficulties in obtaining answers. It also gives an indication of how people are responding to the questions. Sources in the government said that there can be small modifications in the final format of the questionnaire when NPR is finally rolled out.

Sources said that asking for details of country of origin of parents could become a contentious issue given the ongoing protests in different parts of the country over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and other opposition leaders have been alleging that NPR is backdoor entry for a country-wide National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC).

TOI got a copy of the pre-test questionnaire and found that details on place of birth of parents have been asked for in Form B as question number 12. “Place of birth of father and mother. If within India, write the name of the district and state; if outside India, write the name of the country,” the question reads.

Madabhushi Sridhar, legal expert and former central information commissioner, told TOI, “In census, respondents can give answers voluntarily. In NPR, all residents are supposed to give answers to every question. Providing false information is punishable by law.”

Interestingly, pre-test questionnaire had 13 questions, one less than NPR 2010 final format. Other questions such as marital status, educational qualification, occupation and other sub-parameters remained the same in both formats.

Smart City construction work in Madurai is resulting in heavy dust pollution

MADURAI: The ongoing Smart City construction work in the city is resulting in heavy dust pollution and causing lot of inconvenience to the public, who use important roads regularly, feel many residents.

There are four major works - the Natham flyover, Bypass road flyover, Pandikoil junction flyover on the inner ring road and Periyar bus stand - being carried out under the Smart City programme of the Madurai Corporation. All the works are being carried out on important roads connecting the city with the arterial roads and highways.

General secretary of the Madurai Consumer Protection Centre, G Muniasamy said the authorities should have given some consideration before starting these major works simultaneously, as the delayed projects are making people suffer due to high pollution. “If one work was started after the completion of another, people in one part of the city at least would have better environmental condition and lesser pollution,” he said. In the name of development, many are developing health complications, he added. Muniasamy said that the Kalavasal flyover which was not yet completed, was slated to be completed on October 12, 2019, as per an RTI, but three months have lapsed and there are no signs of the work getting completed. As many as 1.42 lakh vehicles pass this junction on a daily basis, and the pollution and roads are so bad, that it takes the vehicles 15 minutes to cross the traffic signal. “This long wait at the junction affects many most importantly those on two-wheelers, bicycles, autorickshaws and pedestrians,” he said.

At the Pandikoil junction, a vehicle which has go go towards Othakadai and return has to take a detour for about two km on an extremely bad stretch of road. “Apart from the pollution, smaller vehicles can meet with fatal accidents due to the road conditions,” said S Ganeshan, a resident of Anna Nagar.

Environmental expert A Nedunchezhian, who studies the environment of the city, says that one of the main reasons for the dust pollution is because the contractors do not spray water on the work sites as per rules, to ensure that the dust does not pollute the surrounding air.

“Rules say that dust pollution should not exceed 150mg per meter cube, at a given time but in many of the sites it is above 600mg. This dust is of two types that is 10 micrometers or less in diameter or that which is 2.5 micrometers or less. Both can enter the lungs and cause many health issues. Dust that settles on hair follicles is also a reason for hairfall,” he said.

Dr Prem Ananth P, pulmonologist, said exposure to cement-related dust can cause a range of respiratory disorders. Even healthy individuals develop allergies due to dust. Long-term exposure can cause serious chronic respiratory diseases.

About 70 foreigners were brought to the venue by district tourist officer S M Sribalamurugan

MADURAI: Foreign tourists brought by tourism department officials to view Alanganallur jallikattu had to wait for over two hours to enter the gallery. Although they reached the venue well before 8am, the gallery which was specifically meant for tourists and constructed using funds from the tourism department was occupied by VIPs and their family members.

Many lost patience and returned as they were made to stand for more than two hours. Even after they got to enter the gallery, they were allowed in batches and view the action only for a few minutes.

About 70 foreigners were brought to the venue by district tourist officer S M Sribalamurugan. The tourism department usually brings tourist groups to the Alanganallur event , which is a government event, free of cost to promote tourism. The group included 10 from Israel, 12 from USA, four from Japan, three each from Denmark and France and 24 from Malaysia.

Randee and her friend Carrie from California in the US left the venue as they were exasperated by the long wait. Randee, who runs a dance company, said, “We lost patience and decided to leave. We were made to wait for three hours without access to toilet, water or food. Some of them started to faint. VIPs kept going into the gallery, pushing us aside as we waited endlessly,” she said.

Many others too left the venue as they were exhausted. Ranjini Marimuthu from Malaysia said, “We started at 7am and it is well past 10am, but we are yet to get into the gallery. We are yet to have our breakfast,” she said. Ranjini, whose roots are in Kumbakonam, said she has seen jallikattu only in movies and she came to Alanganallur so that she could see it in person for the first time.

An official from tourism department said that most of the visitors reached gallery in batches and they allowed them to witness the event for a few minutes. He said that tourists had to wait long since a large number of VIPs were seated in the gallery, the official said.

Another group consisting of 55 members from Chennai were also brought there by Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation as part of a two-day jallikattu tour, which is a paid facility. They too had to wait for a long time before being taken into the gallery in batches.

Sharad Pawar

NASHIK: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Friday criticised Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut for making statement against former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi about her association with yesteryear underworld don Karim Lala.

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Pawar said Raut should not have spoken against Gandhi and should refrain from making such statements in future.

“This issue is closed now as Raut took back his statement. His statement will not impact the functioning of the coalition government in the state,” Pawar said.

“This is a coalition of three parties and we are working on creating jobs for youths, strengthening the industrial sector with major focus on farming. This coalition government will complete its tenure of five year,” he added.

The NCP supremo informed that the state government has decided to waive farm loan up to Rs 2 lakh and around 85% of the farmers will benefit from this scheme. “Loan waiver for the remaining 15% farmers will be considered during the state budget,” he said.

Being asked about the demand of farmers to withdraw ban on onion export, Pawar said he will meet union minister of commerce Piyush Goyal and discuss the issue.

Earlier, Pawar inaugurated the grape crushing season at Wine Park and then inaugurated a new school building of Rayat Education Society at Vinchur in Niphad tehsil of the district.

While addressing the gathering during commencement of grape crushing season, Pawar said he will take up taxation and excise related issues of farmers with the state government. “I will organise a meeting of wineries with state finance minister and excise minister shortly,” he said.

“Wineries should focus on cultivating those wine grape varieties that have demand in the global market,” he added.

Pawar also assured the wineries of providing any kind of assistance for the growth of the wine sector.

Pawar also stressed upon the need of providing new technology-based education to children. “Developing skills related to various sectors along with research to make students employable is also important,” he said.

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi has urged Prahlad Singh Patel , Union minister of state for tourism , to engage the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) to revive Sanskrit Vidyasthana at Bahour on the outskirts.

Bedi told the minister, who was on a visit to Puducherry, that the inscriptions in the ancient Moolanathar Swamy Temple in Bahour have a reference to a once-flourishing Sanskrit school in the region in the past.

Bedi said the minister has agreed to rope in ASI to renovate Moolanathar Swamy Temple on a priority with a provision for a light and sound show in association with South Zone Cultural Centre (SZCC), Thanjavur.

The lieutenant governor said the department of Hindu religious institution in association with the creative team of Raj Nivas had brought out a directory of temples in the Union territory. She added that the minister accepted to reimburse the cost of production and publicity incurred for making the directory.

Workers involved in cleaning the roads in Trichy

TRICHY: Trichy Corporation has appointed night-watchers in a couple of wards to identify and penalize people dumping waste at public places during the night. The civic body has simultaneously launched night sweeping activity on arterial roads to clear garbage mounds in the city.

Ever since the corporation removed around 1,200 odd garbage bins from public places, waste mounds has been appearing on arterial roads and vacant lands in the city, which has affected the city’s reputation in cleanliness.

The team of workers will carry out the cleaning work from 10 pm to 6 am. The time period has been identified as the vulnerable hours for mass littering by commercial establishments. “We have deputed night-watchers in ward number 44 and 46 falling under Ponmalai zone covering Cantonment localities to identify the people littering at public places. They will be penalized heavily,” an official with the corporation said. The night-watchers are equipped with smartphones and will collect evidence such as photographs. Subsequently, through the sanitary supervisors or sanitary inspectors, the people or shops or vehicles caught littering will be punished. “For now, the night-sweeping is restricted to Central bus stand and Cantonment locality. Plans are there to expand the mechanism to other parts of the city,” the official added.

Representative image

PUNE: The Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Friday cracked the murder mystery of a woman (40) with the arrest of her 25-year-old former paramour.

The probe revealed that Deepak Sukale of Kapurhol in Bhor on Tuesday (January 14) had beaten the woman to death. He then put her body in a gunny bag and took it near Jambhulwadi tunnel on a motorcycle with the help of one of his minor relatives and a friend, Dharmendra Tadsar (28) of Dhayari. After dumping the gunny bag along the Mumbai-Bengaluru highway, they fled.

The Bharati Vidyapeeth police on Wednesday found the body. “We did not have any clues to establish the identity of the woman. From the type of the clothes she had worn, we suspected that she could be from one of the slums in the city,” sub-inspector Mahendra Patil of the Bharati Vidyapeeth police said.

He said the police team, including constables Bhushan Kote, Vinod Bhandalkar and Shridhar Patil, went to almost all the slums in the city with the woman’s photograph. “When we went to a slum in Kothrud, the woman’s son saw the photograph and identified her,” Mahendra said.

During the probe, constables Pranav Sankpal and Harshal Shinde received a tip-off that the woman was in relationship with Sukale. “We went to Kapurhol and took Sukale into custody for questioning. During the sustained questioning, he admitted to his involvement in the murder,” constable Mahendra said.

He said Sukale revealed that despite their break-up the woman was harassing him for money. On January 14, she had gone to Kapurhol to get money from Sukale.

“When Sukale refused, she created ruckus in front of his house. Furious by this, Sukale killed her,” constable Mahendra said.

Sukale is a driver. His accomplice, Tadsare, too is in the same profession. “We have detained Sukale’s minor accomplice,” the constable added.

Two-wheeler riders waiting below Melapudur subway

TRICHY: Two-wheeler riders taking a brief halt while crossing the Melapudur subway when there is a train movement on the tracks above has become a common sight. They are waiting to take cover from the waste water often flushed out from the trains over to Madurai road below.

Motorists who have been getting a ‘sprinkling’ of it have urged the city corporation to take up the issue with Southern Railway and save them the embarrassment and inconvenience.

Melapudur subway situated beneath the Trichy-Karur railway tracks between railway junction and Palakkarai railway station is used by thousands of people to reach Trichy old city locality.

The subway situated on Madurai road has multiple stakeholders. With the road maintained by state highways, cleaning activities are overseen by the Ponmalai zone of corporation. Melapudur residents said wastewater now spills on them from the railway tracks whenever there is train movement . Though metal sheets are placed below the railway tracks to prevent such water from falling on the road, locals said the mechanism is not effective all the time. “The metal sheets beneath the tracks often fail to stop the water discharged from trains, so we wait for the trains to pass,” P Vijayasankar, a local resident said. Road users have urged the corporation to report the issue to southern railway. “We were told that bio-toilets are installed on most trains to prevent wastewater from reaching the tracks. But we will take it up with Southern Railway for a solution,” an official said.

141,['18/01/2020'],Pune: Ridership key challenge for new PMPML boss,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Bus breakdowns remain a major concern for the transport body

PUNE: Reducing bus breakdowns, increasing ridership and ensuring proper maintenance of buses are some of the challenges before V N Suryavanshi, the new chairman and managing director of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited.

He replaced Nayana Gunde, a 2008 batch IAS officer. Gunde had taken over the charge of Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) in February 2018 from Tukaram Mundhe.

Mundhe, a 2005 batch IAS officer, had tried his best to bring discipline in the functioning of the transport utility and did not shy away from taking action against erring staffers.

“It was no surprise that Mundhe, who had upset many, including some corporators, was transferred in February 2018, only after 10 months of service in the transport utility. But the transfer of Gunde, who was one month short of completing two years in the PMPML, was not quite expected,” a source in the PMPML said.

Only one officer, R N Joshi, completed the full tenure of three years as the CMD of the PMPML since 2007. Joshi had been appointed the CMD in January 2011 and he remained in the post for a period of three years and nine months. “The PMPML has had 16 CMDs but apart from Joshi, no one completed their tenure. The officials are not given adequate time to settle in. And in some cases, like in case of Gunde, once they settled in and had a grip on things, they were removed,” said Sanjay Shitole, a member of the PMP Pravasi Manch.

Gunde was successful in controlling incidents of fire in buses, but breakdowns still remain a major concern.

“During her tenure, the PMPML procured many new buses, including midibuses and e-buses. She also introduced 24-hour bus service from Pune station. But things did not change much as far as breakdowns are concerned. The first eight months of this fiscal recorded around 4,800 buses breaking down each month,” another source said.

“This year is crucial as the PMPML will get more new buses and there is also the question of the last mile connectivity in connection with the Pune Metro project. The focus must be on improving the basics. The biggest question is if the new officer will be allowed to stay for a longer period,” the source said.

TRICHY: A 55-year-old man was gored to death by a bull in the jallikattu arena at Avarangadu village of Manapparai in Trichy district on Friday. The deceased, N Palaniyandi, was a bull owner from Pudukottai.

He was waiting to receive his bull exiting the vadivasal when another bull charged at him from behind, police said . The bull lifted him with its horn and flung him to a distance. Seriously injured, he was rushed to the government hospital where he was declared dead.

Avarangadu hosted the second jallikattu of the season in the district after Periya Suriyur jallikattu that took place on Thursday. The event saw a total of 592 bulls and 289 bull tamers take part. Excitement peaked as one bull owner from Ponnamaravathy in Pudukottai district challenged bull tamers with Rs 1 lakh bounty to tame his bull. True to his claim, the bull remained untamed despite persistent efforts from the tamers.

A total of 804 bulls took part in the jallikattu organized at R T Malai in Karur district on Friday. R T Malai village near Thogaimalai is the only jallikattu venue in Karur district where the event was being organised for the last 58 years.

The event started with temple bulls entering the arena at 8.40 am. Bulls were brought from Trichy, Pudukottai, Perambalur, Thanjavur and Dindigul districts. Pudukottai district, known for hosting the most number of jallikattu events in the state, witnessed jallikattu at Vanniyanviduthi village on Friday. The jallikattu event had the participation of 654 bulls and 217 tamers. A total of 54 people including two police personnel were injured in the event when a portion of the stage came down during the event. A poorly erected stage using makeshift arrangement was the reason for the fall which led to the injury of the police personnel.

The three-day Goa Yuva Mahotsav, which was inaugurated at Margao on Friday, will see nearly 10,000 youngsters ... Read More

MARGAO: Chief minister Pramod Sawant on Friday said that with the Supreme Court having lifted the suspension on the construction of the Mopa airport , the project, once complete, would hugely contribute to Goa’s development by generating a large number of employment opportunities for Goan youth.

“The Mopa airport will thus prove to be of immense benefit to the youth,” Sawant said after inaugurating the Goa Yuva Mahotsav organised by the Konkani Bhasha Mandal at Ravindra Bhavan, Margao. The three-day youth festival, which will see a congregation of nearly 10,000 youngsters from across Goa, will conclude on Sunday.

Decrying the fact that many development projects were affected due to opposition from environmentalists, Sawant stressed on the need for debates on all such controversial issues at the youth festival so that the youth get equipped about proper facts about various aspects of the issues at hand. These youth could thus further educate the people on those matters so that people are able to discern facts from falsehood, he said.

“This government is that which listens to the voice of the people. I am all for the welfare of the people. I am willing to listen to criticism and if I am convinced that a particular step would be in the interest of the state, I am willing to consider it. But don’t criticise for the sake of criticism,” Sawant said.

Further stating that protection of Goa’s identity also lay in protection of nature, Sawant called upon the youth to shoulder the responsibility of protecting the state’s forests, rivers, mountains and natural resources.

He also said that Goa lacked leadership in social, cultural and economic fields and called upon the youth to assume the mantle of leadership in all these fields.

Responding to demands for government patronage to Konkani, the chief minister said, “Konkani will get ‘rajashray’ only when people put Konkani to use widely in their official communication as well... We need to start with ourselves,” he said.

A bull tamer is embracing a charging bull in an effort to tame it in Alanganallur jallikattu event on Friday

MADURAI: There were gritty performances at the Alanganallur jallikattu which kept spectators and event organisers guessing for the probable winners throughout the day. K Ranjithkumar, a native of Alanganallur, was one among them.

Tamers were allowed to take part in batches and Ranjithkumar got his chance only in the last round. Undeterred by the lack of time, he started taming bulls one after the other and had 10 to his name. At one point, it looked as though he tamed every other bull that came out of the vadivasal, giving jitters to M Karthik of Ayuthanpatti who was leading until then.

A tough competition ensued as the two were in a neck-and-neck competition. If Ranjithkumar tamed one, Karthik also kept his score ticking. Ranjithkumar, the local boy, was the clear favourite for the spectators who encouraged him with loud cheer and applause. Utilizing the 30 minutes time extension given by the committee, Ranjithkumar went on to tame 16 bulls while Karthik, who missed crucial chances, finished second by taming 14.

Interestingly, Ranjithkumar’s younger brother Ramkumar tamed 15 bulls last year and and walked away with a car for the first prize. “It is all because of the support of my friends, who constantly helped and motivated me. I am very happy to have won to make my village proud,” said Ranjithkumar, a diploma holder in engineering.

Karthik won a bike while Ganesan from Arittapatti tamed 13 bulls and finished third. Karuppan, a bull from Kulamangalam belonging to M Marnadu, stole the show by displaying aggression for 52 seconds. It was adjudged the best bull and selected for the car prize. The bull belonging to S I Anuradha from Avaniyapuram was adjudged second, whereas the bull belonging to G R Karthick from Avaniyapuram was adjudged third best. Cash prizes of Rs15, 000 and Rs10, 000 were handed over to the bull owners as second and third prize respectively. Cows were also handed over to Marnadu and Ranjithkumar as prize.

Kanyakumari district superintendent of police (SP) N Sreenath said they were booked under three Sections – 13 (punishment for unlawful activities), 18 (punishment for conspiracy, etc.) and 20 (punishment for being member of a terrorist gang or organisation) – of the UAPA for operating against the country.

Earlier, the Kaliyakkavilai police booked the duo under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 506(ii) (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 7 read with 25(1A) and 25(1B) of the Arms Act for illegal possession of the weapon that was used in the murder.

Police said they will move the Kuzhithurai court in Kanyakumari district on Monday, seeking police custody of the duo.

Meanwhile, the national investigation agency (NIA) is all set to take over investigation from the Tamil Nadu police, as the case has been altered to UAPA. “Kanyakumari district police is continuing investigation and will be taking the accused into custody for interrogation. NIA officials will visit Kaliyakkavilai soon and will take up the case for further investigation within a month,” said a source.

“We will conduct preliminary inquiry with the arrested duo and will send a report to the ministry of home affairs (MHA). In the report, we will mention the gravity of the case. After getting order from the MHA, we would take up the case for further investigation on the role of the two Islamic State (IS) cadres in the murder of SSI Wilson,” said an NIA source.

The source added that the investigation agency has to file a chargesheet against the arrested people who were booked under UAPA, within 180 days. “We would file a chargesheet before the special court for NIA cases at Poonamallee in Chennai. The electronic gadgets seized from the arrested people will be sent to forensic laboratory for further investigation,” the source said.

Pune: Altogether 515 senior residents of Kasturba Vasahat and Indira Vasahat in Aundh have benefited from the community-based programme for the ageing population launched by the NGO School for Development and Impact (SDI) about eight months ago.

The uplift model focuses on building support structures, resilience and intergenerational discourse with the youth. Chief executive officer of SDI Benazir Patil said, “We have also set up Vriddhanchi Anganwadi centres for the elderly population. We provide them with medical necessities and care. The idea is to implement the model in other slums and promote the concept of age friendliness.”

Patil added that, at the start of the initiative, they went to each home in the slums and took stock of the condition of the elderly population. “Some of them were bed ridden and there was a need for adult diapers, medicines, wheelchairs among others. We also helped them out with the paperwork to seek pension and what schemes are available, including getting hospital check-ups done,” she said.

Project manager Kalpana Kavadi said, “We tried to train them on minor activities to keep them occupied. This will also help generate income. We showed them how to make garlands and paper bags. The aim is to promote healthy living,” she said.

Panaji: Less than 45% of the structures in CRZ areas that were issued demolition orders by the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority have been demolished, the authority has informed the National Green Tribunal.

A total of 70 structures were demolished across the state while the rest have received stays from courts with some pending hearings.

Of the 90 demolitions ordered in North Goa, 10 were executed by the collector. In South Goa, out of the 76 demolitions ordered, 35 were executed by the collector and 25 were executed privately.

At the last hearing, the NGT had warned of doubling the state’s environmental compensation to Rs 2 crore and taking other punitive action even as it had directed the authorities to file a compliance report against illegal structures on the Morjim, Mandrem, Galgibaga and Agonda beaches, which are designated turtle nesting sites.

In an order dated November 2, 2017, the Delhi bench of the NGT had directed the GCZMA to initiate action against temporary structures erected without its permission in the no-development zones (NDZ) of the four beaches protected for turtles under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011.

Taking serious cognisance, the bench sought details of demolitions and amounts recovered — as per its earlier order — and even warned of suspension of officers’ salaries and other punitive actions. Goa Paryavaran Savrakshan Sangharsh Samitee had filed an execution application alleging inaction by the GCZMA where structures in North Goa were concerned.

The bill proposes to make all land records available in one office

PUNE: The land titling bill is likely to be cleared in the upcoming budget session, senior revenue officials in the state government stated.

The bill proposes to make all land records available in one office to give people easier access to information. At present, records pertaining to immovable properties are available with different agencies.

The previous state government had released a draft land titling act in June last year. But the erstwhile cabinet could not clear it because of the elections and change in government.

State settlement commissioner S Chockolingam, who has been working on the land titling bill at the state and the centre, said that that the bill will soon be circulated to all states for approval while the state government is expected to take up its clearance in the upcoming budget session at the end of next month. “The passage of the bill will help bring transparency, objectivity and easy accessibility of information on land and land transactions,’’ he said.

“Once the bill is passed, benami owners of immovable properties will be under radar,’’ said officials. A single act of transfer of property involves a minimum of four legislations and two authorities. The bill aims to improve land administration system and ensure security of title over properties with focus on those whose titles are being created and properties allotted by government and semi-government authorities.

Nashik: The defence PSU, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), has started waiving off operational charges for all civilian flights using the Ozar airport near Nashik city under the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS).

The instructions for the same were issued by the ministry of defence ( MoD ). Moreover, HAL has also started providing night landing facility to all commercial flights and aircraft at the Ozar airport if they inform HAL about the same at least 10 hours prior to the landing.

HAL sources said that the MoD recently issued instructions to the company to waive off operational charges at the airport including landing and parking fees for all flights operating to and from Nashik Airport under the Centre’s Udan or RCS scheme.

The ministry also asked the airlines to rope in more flights for Nashik. At present, Nashik airport facilitates air connectivity to Hyderabad, Pune and Ahmedabad.

Alliance Air, a subsidiary of Air India, is operating from Nashik to Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Pune. In addition, private airline TruJet is also operating on the Nashik-Ahmedabad route on a daily basis.

“Following the instructions from the union ministry of defence, we have waived all operational charges at the airport for the flights operating under the RCS. The ministry had recently issued such circular directing us waive of all the charges,” said HAL sources.

The Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had also given its approval to the night landing for passenger aircraft at the Ozar airport.

“Earlier, we would provide services at the airport till 7 pm. But, after the DGCA’s approval for landing for passenger aircraft, we have extended our service hours till midnight. The night landing facilities are also free for flights under the Udan scheme,” said HAL sources.

“We provide night landing facility all though the night, but the airline has to inform us about it at least 10 hours prior to the landing,” added sources.

The state government and HAL had jointly developed the new airport terminal at Ozar at a cost of Rs 84 crore in 2014.

The government spent the said amount while the land was owned by the HAL. But, it took almost four years to start operations from Nashik airport and Regional Connectivity Scheme benefited the city as many airlines expressed interest to fly on different routes from Nashik.

A small structure made of hollow block bricks in which SSI was murdered on January 8

KALIYAKKAVILAI (KANYAKUMARI): The district police are working on improvising the safety features and amenities at border check posts following the murder of special sub inspector Y Wilson by two extremists on January 8.

A small structure made of hollow block bricks with an asbestos sheet and tarpaulin on top and pieces of wornout cardboard boxes acting as window was the check post on the Kaliyakkavilai Market Road where the SSI was murdered. It is one of the 36 police check posts on the inter-state border of Kanyakumari district and this is the plight of most of the check posts. Policemen said the check posts don’t have power supply and are at the mercy of residents to draw electricity for lighting or for a small fan. Without toilets, the personnel posted on 12-hour duty also find it difficult to relieve themselves.

These checks posts are under the jurisdiction of six bordering police stations – Kollam Code, Kaliyakkavilai, Palugal, Arumani, Kadayalumoodu and Arugani. They include eight major check posts such as the ones at Kaliyakkavilai, Cheriyakolla, Netta, Choozhal and four others on the main roads while the rest are on smaller roads. Most of them except Netta have structures similar to the ones in which Wilson was at work.

Initially, less than a handful of these check posts were established to man important roads and prevent smuggling of PDS goods, sand or contraband items like arrack. More were set up on smaller roads to check illegal transportation of medical and poultry waste from Kerala to Tamil Nadu. But the strength of the police stations was not increased despite drawing the station strength for the check posts too.

Field level cops at these check posts said 11 of these check posts are in Kaliyakkavilai police station. “The station has a strength of 51 that was sanctioned about 35 years ago which has not been revised yet,” said a policeman. They expressed the need for a special unit to man check posts with at least four police personnel each, focus lights and CCTVs, speed breakers or ‘Z’ barricades and basic amenities.

Kanyakumari SP N Sreenath said, “We are in the process of rationalising the check posts for better surveillance. We will be deploying at least two personnel at manned check posts and installing CCTV cameras at unmanned check posts. The cameras will be monitored from a centralised place,” he said, adding that they will work out with the highways and other departments concerned on installation of speed breakers on the roads.

MADURAI: While the recently held local body elections saw women getting 50% representation in all posts across the state, Dindigul district has earned a unique distinction with about 80% women representing most of these coveted posts, including 12 of the 14 panchayat union chairpersons’ posts.

Dindigul district has 14 panchayat unions including Athoor, Reddiarchathiram, Natham, Batlagundu, Nilakottai, Palani and Kodaikanal.

The DMK, which gained majority in the local body polls in Dindigul district after nearly 40 years, contested most of the seats by giving preference to women in even general category posts. For instance, the Palani panchayat union chairman post is open to all in the general category.

The DMK fielded K Eswari and she emerged victorious. Similarly, in Thoppampatti union, R Sathiyabhuvana was elected panchayat union chairperson, while S Palaniammal was elected chairperson of Sannarpatti panchayat union. Out of the 14 panchayat union chairman posts, the DMK secured nine of which seven were allocated for women.

The party has allocated the posts of vice-chairman of many panchayat unions for women, though there was a demand from the elected male representatives. D Rajeswari, M Hemalatha and Gayathiri were elected vice-chairpersons of the Reddiarchathiram, Athoor and Oddanchathiram unions respectively. Even in the panchayat unions of Nilakottai, Vadamadurai and Vedasandur, which were won by the AIADMK, women have been elected chairpersons.

The chairperson of the Gujiliamparai union and vice-chairpersons of Vedasandur and Vadamadurai are also women. DMK deputy general secretary I Periyasamy, who was instrumental in picking the candidates for the rural local bodies , said that women had a better people connect when it came to villagers. “The fact that many of them were elected unopposed proves this,” he added.

BHOPAL: Army deserter Harpreet Singh, who had escaped from Punjab police custody after being arrested for stealing two rifles from the Pachmari Cantonment, was rearrested in Delhi on Friday morning. He will be brought to MP’s Hoshangabad soon.

Harpreet was nabbed at Connaught Place around 9am, say police sources in Bhopal . During interrogation, he said that he didn’t want to be jailed and was trying to flee to Nepal.

Harpreet, a havildar, is accused of stealing two Insas rifles from sentries at Pachmarhi Cantonment in December last year after posing as an officer and sending the guards on a fake errand. After a five-day chase, he was arrested in Chautala village in Punjab’s Tanda tehsil by Madhya Pradesh ATS in coordination with Punjab Police, Intelligence Bureau and Military Intelligence. His alleged accomplices Jagtar Sing ‘Jagga’ and Sonu were arrested from Miani village in Jalandhar, about 190km from Chandigarh.

Since then, Hoshangabad police had been trying to get him on production warrant. On December 31, Harpreet was admitted to a civil hospital in Hoshiarpur, under Punjab police custody, to have his fractured arm treated. On January 14, he escaped on the pretext of going to the washroom. After a three-day manhunt, he was nabbed in Delhi.

“We tried twice to get him on production warrant but Punjab Police cited shortage of staff to escort him here. We have written again to a senior official there. Now that Harpreet has been arrested again, we are hopeful that he will be brought here,” said Hoshangabad SP M L Chari.

Investigations revealed that Harpreet Singh had undergone two months’ training at Cariappa Music Wing at Army Education Corps in Pachmarhi, and was aware of the cantonment and security set-up. Security agencies could zero in on him because he had withdrawn cash from an ATM outside Pipariya station before renting a car for Pachmarhi around midnight last Thursday. Details of the havildar’s bank account and CCTV footage from inside the ATM led to his identification, say sources.

According to sources, Harpreet told interrogators that he stole the rifles to sell them and arrange money for the bail of his brother, who was arrested while trying to enter USA illegally from Mexico.

Kanpur: The residents of the Faithfulganj area of the city, which is also known as Dari Bazar, and its surrounding localities were in a state of shock after the arrest of Jalees Ansari aka ‘Dr Bomb’ on Friday.

They said that they were shocked to hear that he could be involved in terrorism.

“He was looking like any other ‘namazi’,” said a youth, who lives next door to Oonchi Masjid (mosque) in Faithfulganj. We saw some sleuths putting him inside an SUV and speeding away. We thought as the person, whom they were putting inside the vehicle, was ill and they were rushing him to a hospital”.

“However, we were shocked when we saw breaking news being flashed on TV channels wherein told about the arrest of ‘Dr Bomb’— alias Jalees Ansari from the area,” the youth said and added, “People from different areas are here and we all know each other, but we had no idea that a convicted terrorist, who had jumped parole, is roaming in our locality.”

As per the STF sources, Ansari, after deboarding Mumbai-Lucknow bound Pushpak Express at Kanpur Central on Friday morning, reached Oonchi Masjid (mosque) in Faithfulganj area where he inquired locals about his two old friends--Abdul Rahman and Abdul Qayyum. “Locals, however, told him that Rahman had died in a road mishap while Qayyum shifted from there,” the STF sources further said.

The residents of the area have urged the authorities to strengthen security arrangements in the area to protect it from anti-social elements.

Ansari, the 68-year-old convict of the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case, serving a life term, was on parole for 21 days from the Ajmer Central prison. During the parole period, he was ordered to visit the Agripada police station every day to mark his attendance. However, he did not visit the police police station on Thursday during the designated time.

The victim has been identified as N Sasikumar from Santhosh Nagar near the Trichy International Airport. Police said, Sasikumar, who is unmarried and running the academy for the past two years in his house, shot himself with a .22mm rifle from close range inside a room around 10am.

On Friday, he was reading a newspaper, when he suddenly went to his room and locked himself up from inside. His mother heard a gunshot and came running to his room. As her attempt to open the door failed, she called her neighbours who broke open the room and found Sasikumar lying on the ground profusely bleeding from his forehead. They rushed him to the Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) to revive him, but doctors declared him brought dead. The airport police took up the investigation. An engineer by profession, Sasikumar had a passion for shooting and has won several competitions. As he decided to teach the shooting aspirants, he started an academy.

Kolhapur: District guardian minister Satej Patil said that the state government was planning atleast four flyovers at the entry points of the city to avoid a situation similar to the August floods in future.

Talking to mediapersons, Patil said that financial assistance would be sought from the Asian Development Bank and that he would also try making budgetary allocation for the four flyovers. The detailed project report of the flyovers would be ready in a month.

Recalling that the floods in August had completely marooned Kolhapur city as all the entry and exit points had been blocked, Patil said that the flyovers would be used only during emergency while existing routes would continue to remain in operation. Under normal circumstances, only light vehicles would be allowed to ply on the flyovers.

He added that the condition of roads in Kolhapur and Sangli districts, which incurred maximum damage during the floods, was in a dilapidated state. “The National Disaster Management has sanctioned Rs 956 crore for the road works in the country. I will try to get maximum funds for the two districts,” said Patil.

“The government has sanctioned road works worth Rs 1,100 crore, but has allocated only Rs 150 crore for Kolhapur district. Special efforts will be taken to ensure maximum budgetary provision for the road works in the district,” he said.

Talking about traffic congestion in Kolhapur and rural parts of the district, Patil said that he would allocate Rs 3 crore for traffic discipline. “The government is thinking of allotting the contract of traffic discipline to a private company. The contract will be for a period of five years. The company will be responsible for the installation and operation of traffic signals, traffic furniture, maintenance of black spots and other works,” said th guardian minister.

Patil said other works like installation of CCTVs in the city, land acquisition for ring road, muti-storey parking near Mahalaxmi temple and extended limits of the municipal corporation were among the other issues that he would handle on a priority basis.

Patil added that the district administration had spent only Rs 35 crore of the Rs 270 crore sanctioned through the District and Planning Development Committee. He said Rs 25 crore allocated for providing houses to Dalits had also not been spent.

Aurangabad: NCP legislator Durrani Abdullah Khan has said there is enough evidence to prove that Saibaba was born at Pathri and there is a fear if the town in Parbhani district of Maharashtra is developed, the importance of Shirdi, which has a grand temple of the saint, will fade.

Devotees in large numbers throng the Shri Sai Janmasthan Temple at Pathri and during a recent visit there, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced a grant of Rs 100 crore for development of the town.

“People of Shirdi, in Ahmednagar district, are afraid that if Pathri is developed, the importance of Shirdi will decline,” Khan said.

There is enough evidence to prove that Pathri is the birthplace of Saibaba and President Ramnath Kovind has also endorsed the fact earlier, the NCP leader added.

“While Shirdi is Saibaba's karmabhoomi (work place) and Pathri is janmabhoomi (birthplace) and both these places have their own importance,” he said.

Tourists from across the country and world visit Pathri in large numbers, he said, adding that the town lacks good infrastructure.

“The chief minister has agreed to grant Rs 100 crore to Pathri. People of Shirdi don't have an issue with the funds, they just don't want Pathri to be called Saibaba's birthplace,” he said.

Shirdi residents fear that if Pathari comes under the limelight, the flow of devotees to their town will come down. The Saibaba temple at Shirdi draws lakhs of devotees and is one of the most popular pilgrim destinations in the country. PTI

Jaipur: Four months have passed and shopkeepers at Chandpole market are still waiting for repair of the buildings damaged due to the construction under the Smart City Project Ltd (SCPL).

Verandahs and pillars in front of shops no. 149, 150 and 151 at Chandpole market developed cracks when the work of the duct under Smart City project was going on. Looking at the cracks, authorities put iron pillars to support the structure and prevent it from falling down, but the need of their restoration has been neglected since then.

Sundar Lal, one of the shopkeepers, said that they went to all the authorities and they are trying to shrug off their responsibilities. “Officials in Smart City Project Ltd say that it is the work of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) and JMC officials say that as the damage was done by the Smart City department, they will repair it. We are stuck and our business is getting affected by it,” said Sundar Lal.

Senior officials of the Smart City Project Ltd were not reachable for a comment. An official of SCPL who did not wish to be named said, “The outer part of the verandah comes in the domain of Smart City but the verandahs have to be repaired by the JMC. We have asked them to do the needful and will see what will be decided finally.”

Subhash Goyal, president of Chandpole Vyapaar Mandal said that the work of smart city is delayed and now the cracked verandahs are creating problems. “We have complained to all the officials in both the departments but no step has been taken. When the construction of the duct was started, smart city department promised to finish it within 90 days, which got extended to eight months. Still, they have completed just one side and now work of another side has started. It will take another eight months to complete it. Our business has been affected but government is yet to respond.”

Sanjay Raut

KOLHAPUR: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut , who caused a controversy because of his series of statements, has now taken on Sambhaji Bhide , the much respected figure among Hindu organisations.

Reactingto Sangli bandh call, by Shivpratishthan Hindustan, an outfit formed by Sambhaji Bhide, Raut said on twitter, “People will not forgive who were creating unrest in Maharashtra”.

Raut’s reaction came few hours after Sambhaji Bhide demanded his removal from the post of Shiv Sena’s spokesperson. Without mentioning anybody’s name, Raut said. “Few people, who are now politically unemployed have got work contract. Let them get benefits of it but people will not forgive them”.

Several parts of Sangli district and Miraj observed the bandh. However, the bandh disturbed Sena cadre as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray was scheduled to visit Sangli for the first time after assuming the office.

Bandh call was given by Shivprtishthan Hindustan to condemn Sanjay Raut’s demand to Udayanraje Bhosale, the 13th descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to submit evidence that he was from the family of Maratha warrior. Sambhaji Bhide is highly respected by the Satara branch of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Addressing the workers in the morning, Sambhaji Bhide refused the request made by local Sena workers to withdraw the bandh. “Our bandh is not against Shiv Sena. I wish Shiv Sena does well in the country, but we cannot tolerate the humiliation of the family of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj” he said. . He also said that the comparison between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and anybody else was objectionable.

Sambhaji Bhinde said that Uddhav Thackeray should demonstrate some political sagacity and remove Sanjay Raut from his post. “Raut is bringing bad name to Shiv Sena,” Bhide said.

Raut, in his earlier comment on twitter, said, “I would have been happier if the call for bandh was given when Narendra Modi was compared to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. It’s ok. I will continue to respect you”.

Several BJP workers were present when Sambhaji Bhide demanded the removal of Sanjay Raut. A group of BJP workers held demonstrations demanding an immediate apology from Raut. BJP workers also burnt effigies of Raut at various places in Sangli district. Similar bandh was observed in Satara on Thursday.

Representative image

SECUNDERABAD: The fear of vigilance raids, criminal cases and heavy penalties over illegal water connections have compelled residents to line up at the water board to get connections regularised.

Across the city, consumers are queueing up at water board offices to apply for regularisation.

In November 2019, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) had introduced voluntary disclosure scheme (VDS) and given citizens time until February 21 to regularise their illegal connections.

The scheme was introduced to bring revenue to the board that was losing out on nearly Rs 20 crore per month due to illegal connections.

Since November, the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Division-VII (Marredpally) in Secunderabad area alone has received 400 applications from costumers.

As per the HMWS&SB records for the O&M Division-VII, there are over 65,000 registered consumers receiving potable water. The number of illegal connections in the division is touted to be around 600. “We expect another 100 to 200 applications seeking regularisation under VDS drive. We will have the final number after February 21,” general manager, O&M Division-VII, K Raghunandan Reddy told TOI.

Special teams have been constituted to popularise VDS in areas such as Sitaphalmandi, Boiguda, Marredpally, Srinivas Nagar, Prakash Nagar, Tarnaka, Lalapet and Mettuguda.

“If consumers do not utilise this scheme within the stipulated period, the water board will impose payment of three years worth of water bills, Rs 300 towards service charge and payment of double charges towards connection charges to regularise illegal water connections,” added the official.

The consumer account number (CAN) will be given during the process of regularisation and consumers will get monthly water bills as per tariff, he added.

A water board official said, “To regularise an illegal connection, the consumer has to pay connection charges and pay the current monthly bill. Consumers can also contact HMWS&SB’s customer care number: 155313 to clarify their doubts.

Police said the accused may have committed similar crimes in other states also. Cops were investigating the details of three mobile phones recovered from him to track other gang members. He had come to visit Ugandan nationals residing in Katara Hills area in November 2019 and stole data from the ATM during that period.The most shocking part is that he fitted the skimmer at the ATM for eight days to leech data from ATM cards, but neither the guards nor the bank officials maintaining spotted his activities. DIG Irshad Wali said that the accused is also a football player and currently stays in Bengaluru, where he is pursuing BCom at a private college.DIG said in November 2019, police received complaints from around a dozen people that money was withdrawn from their bank accounts. Police found that common factor in all the complaints was that money was withdrawn from a nationalised bank ATM booth located at Amaltas, Katara Hills. Cops realised that it was part of a skimming fraud and registered a case with cybercrime branch against the accused.ASP (cybercrime branch) Sandesh Jain said that during investigations, police zeroed in on Mukasa in Bengaluru. A team was sent to nab him and he was detained on January 13. He told police that he had come to Bhopal in November to visit his friends. He fitted the skimming device in the ATM booth for over 8 days and then calmly left after stealing data.Jain said that Mukasa is a hardcore fraudster and got rid of his skimming device before police nabbed him. He, however, confessed that he stole ATM cards data by installing skimmer in ATM booth and transferred it to blank ATM cards to withdraw money. Police have found evidence that he may have been involved in similar frauds in various cities. He is being interrogated further.",bhopal,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73347366,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-270916,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/ugandan-national-held-for-skimming-atm/articleshow/73340526.cms

MADURAI: Four people were arrested on Friday on charges of murdering an AIADMK functionary from Kovilpatti in Thoothukudi district.

The victim, Balamurugan R (40), was on his way home riding his two-wheeler when he was attacked by four men with sickles. The functionary subsequently bled to death on the spot. His body was later recovered by the local police and sent to the Kovipatti Government Hospital. A case was registered at the Kovipatti East Station and an investigation is underway.

Initially, police suspected political enmity as the motive for the murder since Balamurugan was reportedly said to have had a good reputation among the locals and was even favoured to win local body polls if held. However, the police on Friday arrested Thangapandian K who lived in the same locality in connection with the murder.

There was reportedly a rift between Thangapandian’s family and Balamurugan’s family ever since Balamurugan’s family allegedly attacked Thangapandian last year, during a temple festival. According to Thangapandian, he and three of his friends, Mandiramoorthy K (20), Karuppasamy M, and Madan K, hacked Balamurugan on Thursday night since he was met with cold stares from Balamurugan and his family when he returned to Kovilpatti from Coimbatore for Pongal holidays.

Earlier on Friday, AIADMK party workers and the victim’s kin held a road roko in front of the Kovilpatti GH demanding for the arrest of the accused. However, after police intervened and gave their assurance, the protesters dispersed. Balamurugan is survived by his wife Malliga B and two children.

Kolhapur: Judicial magistrate first class S S Raul has issued arrest warrants for two former Kolhapur municipal commissioners and other civic serving and a number of former civic officials in a case involving land development and encroachment.

The warrants were issued on December 30 last year against former civic chiefs Vijayalaxmi Bidri and P Siva Sankar, along with former assistant directors of town planning Dhananjay Khot and Maruti Rathod, retired deputy city engineers S K Mane and Sajiv Deshpande and serving chief city engineer Netradip Sarnobat.

However, two of the accused have got anticipatory bail, a legal official of the KMC said on condition of anonymity on Friday. “We have obtained bail for Netradip Sarnobat and Sanjiv Deshpande. For the others, we have filed a plea before the court.”

All the accused have been charged with IPC sections 217 (Public servant disobeying direction of law with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture) and section 218 (Public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture) under Indian Penal Code (IPC).

In its order, the court asked police to arrest and produce the accused before it on January 29.

Bhushan Gandhi, city-based developer, has stated in his petition that he had sought to develop a site (623 A/4) in the Jawahar Nagar area and the layout was sanctioned by Bidri on the condition that rehabilitate the people who had encroached upon a proposed development plan road.

The builder has stated that he had been asked to rehabilitate four families and that he had agreed to do so on humanitarian grounds. However, the local leaders started forcing me to rehabilitate all the families who have encroached upon the proposed DP road.

“When I refused to rehabilitate all the families, the new commissioner, P Shiv Shankar, cancelled the layout of the development I had proposed,” Gandhi has said.

Bidri is currently posted as regional director, Staff Selection Commission, while P Shiva Sankar is now Parbhani district collector.

186,['18/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Disabled workers of rural job scheme yet to receive wages for last year’s work,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: More than 500 people with disabilities from various parts of Tamil Nadu have written to the government saying their wages are due for the last six months for work done under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( MGNREGA ).

“There are more than three lakh disabled workers awaiting the money. We are representing all of them,” said V Christuraj, one of the workers from Perunkozhi panchayat in Uthiramerur taluk, who lost his leg a few years ago. He pointed out that it was the first time in three years that such a delay had occurred. “People like us find it hard to find employment. This is our only means to make ends meet and we are struggling without money,” he said.

Under MGNREGA, people in rural areas, including those with disabilities, get 100 days of wage employment. The daily wage is Rs 229. People with disabilities do odd jobs like looking after children of labourers in creches, distributing water and food, among others. If they are able, they are assigned tasks like digging ponds or roads. Though the rules mandate that they be given full payment within 15 days, workers allege they are yet to receive wages for the work they put in six months ago.

“We all worked for around 40 days. We are only asking for our due salaries. It is demeaning to repeatedly ask for it,” said K Arumugam of Kancheepuram.

Muthu Meena, joint director of the rural development department, said, “Our current liability is Rs 800 crore. We are expecting Rs 500 crore to be released by the Centre in a few days and the amount will be deposited in their accounts.” Muthu Meena added that all dues until October 4, 2019, have been settled and only those who had worked since October 5 were yet to be paid.

“This is a completely false claim,” said S Namburajan, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Differently Abled and Caregivers.

“Workers have shown their bank statements to them, which proves that most haven’t received anything for the work done before October,” he said.

“We are still not sure about the claims, but will look into it again,” said joint director Muthu Meena.

Kanpur: A special court is likely to deliver its judgment on Saturday on the massacre of 20 people by bandit Phoolan Devi in Behmai village of Kanpur Dehat nearly four decades ago.

The court had asked him to file citations by January 16.

District government counsel Rajeev Porwal said the court could deliver its judgment on Saturday as the defense counsel had submitted rulings in support of his claim.

She was allegedly held captive by the gang of dacoit Lala Ram Sri Ram and sexually assaulted for several days.

Phoolan not only looted the village but also dragged 20 men outside the village and shot them around 5 pm.

Besides Phoolan, accused Ram Autar, Mustaqueem, Balram, Moti, Vrindavan, Ram Prakash, Ram Pal, Lallu Baghel, Balwan, Lallu Yadav, Ram Shankar, Jaggan, Prem, Nanda and Baladeen either died or were gunned down in police encounters.

The present trial is being held against four accused – Bheekha, Posa, Vishwanath alias Putani alias Krishna Swarup, and Shyam Babu.

Posa is in jail while Vishwanath alias Putani, Shyam Babu and Ram Singh were released on bail. Three dacoits, including Man Singh, Vishwanath alias Ashok and Ram Singh, are on the run.

Earlier, the survey was carried out but compensation was denied to these families claiming that scrutiny is incomplete. A delegation led by activist Gani Ajrekar met Patil and raised the concern.

Ajrekar said, “It has been almost six months since the flood hit the city. However, these 131 families are still making frequent trips to the government offices to get the compensation. We met the minister and told him that these are genuine cases but did not receive compensation. The civic officials were called and they were told that a fresh scrutiny of damages should be carried out and accordingly the compensation amount should be fixed and released immediately. The earlier survey was carried out by the Talathi’s deployed by the state government. However, they lacked technical skills.”

“Reports made by Talathis were submitted to the tehsildar office that rejected the claims stating that there is no scrutiny by technical authorities. Around 900 houses were affected badly and around 11,000 citizens were displaced during the August floods,” he added.

The state government had assured compensation of up to Rs 50,000, however Patil then in the opposition had demanded Rs 1 lakh for houses that were completely damaged.

Meanwhile, civic officials claimed that they will consider the option of Prime Minister Awas Yojana to provide housing units to flood-affected citizens and the idea has been put forth to rehabilitate the citizens permanently.

The delegation will comprise of transport committee members and officials of the KMT. A similar study tour was conducted to Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad in June last year.

The KMT has submitted a proposal to the central government for 50 electric buses. The central government sanctions subsidy amount up to Rs 50 lakh per bus to buy the e-buses. The officials claimed that the proposal is in the final stages of the approval and before the procuring of the buses start, the corporators and the officials will gain knowledge about the operations of the e-buses.

A senior official of KMT requesting anonymity said, “We will get the details required to run the electric buses in the city. The demonstrations of the electric buses will be held at these two transport undertakings. A plan to run the electric buses will be prepared as it requires expertise. We are expecting the approval to the proposal submitted by us soon.”

The members in the delegation will travel in the electric buses to gain experience. Also, they will speak to the transport officials. The electric buses are costly and one bus can cost up to Rs 80 lakh.

The KMT does not have adequate funds to raise its share of the cost and may request the state government to sanction the funds. “Apart from the roads, the infrastructure for electric buses is different. The charging stations have to be set up and the technical expertise needs to be recruited for the maintenance of the buses. Some of the civic transport undertakings are facing challenges to run the e-buses. We will take all the challenges and difficulties into consideration before the actual operations of the e-buses. The fares of the e-buses will be different considering the huge cost required to run and maintain them. Also, the delegation will study the amount of reduction in air pollution after induction of the e-buses,” said the official.

The study tour was planned for last week, however, it has been postponed owing to several functions coming up. The study tour is expected to take place early next month.

Seeking responses to Sengar’s appeal, the HC also asked the CBI and the survivor to give their stands. A bench comprising Justices Manmohan and Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal, however, granted Sengar two months to deposit the fine of Rs 25 lakh ordered by the trial court; of this, Rs 10 lakh will be released to the rape survivor.

During the hearing, the bench indicated it wasn’t inclined to suspend the sentence or fine amount as Sengar was on trial in other cases too. His counsel then withdrew the application for suspension of sentence.

“Too much tragedy happened with the victim in this case. In the facts of the case, we are not inclined to suspend the sentence. You have to pay Rs 10 lakh to the victim. There can be no condition to it,” the bench said, adding that Sengar “can’t be released because he is an undertrial in other cases also in which trial is going on”.

Sengar’s advocate claimed his client did not have the money to deposit the fine.

Snow and rain threw life out of gear in many areas as some roads got temporarily blocked

NAINITAL/PITHORAGARH/BAGESHWAR: Several districts of Kumaon, including Nainital, Almora and Udham Singh Nagar received heavy rainfall and snowfall since Thursday night.

Meanwhile, Mukteshwar also received some rainfall on Friday though it kept raining most of the day. “It has been raining here since last night. Several roads are blocked due to snowfall while the hill station is also draped in snow ,” said Pradeep Dharamwal, a resident of Mukteshwar.

Snow and rain threw life out of gear in many areas as some roads got temporarily blocked. Kilbury Road as well as the road to Mukteshwar was covered in snow leading to traffic snarls. “Although the administration did not close the road, drivers refused to go that side as roads had become slippery,” Dharamwal said.

The Thirumangalam police adopted the Municipal High School in Padikuppam this week

CHENNAI: The 135 students of Municipal High School in Padikuppam near Thirumangalam are a happy lot. Police personnel teach students here, clean the premises, provide the students nutritional fruits occasionally and inculcate moral values.

The Thirumangalam police , who adopted the government school this week, take delight in fulfilling even the modest demands of the students.

The institution, which was launched as a primary school in 1966, was upgraded to a middle school in 2002 before a high school on July 18, 2017.

Maintaining a positive image of ‘khaki’ has always been challenging and police are taking serious efforts to earn the love and respect of the students in the school. Police personnel have also taken up the responsibility to revamp the dilapidated school building.

Apart from the 135 students, the school has eight teachers handling various subjects.

The innovative idea to adopt the school was mooted by Chennai police commissioner A K Viswanathan after which M S Muthusamy, deputy commissioner, Anna Nagar, and inspector M Ravi made the dream come true. “This has given us more chances to interact with students. People and children no longer fear us but willingly co-operate in maintaining law and order,” said Thirumangalam inspector Ravi. This would help police curb crime in the area in the long run, they believe.

So far, the policemen have bought tables, chairs, plates, a march-past drum for the students and a bureau to keep the certificates of the children safely. They have also taken up restoration work of the school building by raising funds so that poor students get to experience better facilities. Earlier, it was a place for anti-social elements who used the campus to consume liquor and discard the bottles on the premises, setting a bad precedent for the students, sources said.

M Maheswari, headmistress, told TOI that the police personnel were a blessing in disguise for them.

“They meet even the smallest demands made by us. With better amenities, the students are able to concentrate on studies better,” she said.

The school is set to get a new library soon.

Nashik: Commissioner of Police Vishwas Nangare-Patil said that 60% road accidents in the city last year were hit-and-run cases.

Expressing displeasure with the attitude of motorists involved in hit-and-run, he said that tracing such motorists would become easier if the CCTV cameras were set up on the city roads under the smart city project.

Nangare-Patil was speaking at the inauguration of the road safety campaign 2020 organised by Nashik First and Hero MotoCorp Ltd at the Children’s Traffic Education Park.

Besides Nangare-Patil, Nashik RTO Bharat Kalaskar, Deuty RTO Vinay Ahire, ACP (Traffic) Mangalsingh Suryawanshi and directors of Nashik First organisation which has been operating the Traffic Education Park over the past five years, were present during the function.

Expressing his view at the inauguration of the road safety campaign, the city’s police commissioner said that improving the vehicular traffic system has always been the police’s top priority and with strict action against erring motorists, there were 48 lesser road deaths last year as compared to 2018.

Nangare-Patil said that road accidents claimed 1.5 lakh lives in 2018. He said that it should be a collective responsibility of everyone to wage a war against this problem so that no one loses their life due to someone else’s mistake.

Stressing that road safety was based on three Es comprising Enforcement, Engineering and Education, the CP said that while the police and the RTO are doing their work properly, Nashik First was doing a commendable job of educating motorists about road safety.

The top leaders of the state, ministers and representatives of progressive outfits are expected to attend the ceremony. After the inauguration, the dignitaries will give a speech from the dais set up at the Dasara Chowk.

The roads leading towards the Nursery Baug area located near the Chhatrapati Pramilatai Raje (CPR) Hospital and the Dasara Chowk will remain shut for vehicular traffic.

A senior traffic official, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The roads along these two points will remain shut until afternoon. We are concerned about the traffic moving from the Shivaji Bridge towards the city. The commuters will have to take a longer route to cross the city. The vehicular traffic will be diverted from Jamdar Club to Gangavesh from where it will lead towards Papachi Tickti and from there to Shivaji Chowk and futher towards Bindu Chowk and then moving towards the outskirts of the city from the Temblaiwadi Flyover. Since it is a Sunday, the entry of vehicles from outside to the city is more as compared to intra-city traffic. For the commuters of the second category, the diversions will be from collectors office, Venus Corner, Ayodhya Talkies and the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation building.”

Parking arrangements will be made at Venus Corner. The parking of the vehicles of the dignitaries will be reserved at the Panchaganga Ghat.

JAIPUR: For two years, Akhil Jain and Parth Dwivedi of Kota, have shared the common space from morning till evening with a difference of a wall, literally. They studied at a same school but sections were different in the first half and prepared for JEE in a common coaching institute but batch was different in the second half. The unusual bond resulted into a rare coincident. Both made into the super league of nine students who scored 100 percentile at JEE Main I 2020 result announced on Friday against 8.6 lakh students appeared in the exam.

“Every day we use to greet each other during morning prayers in the school, sometimes in science labs and at coaching centre. I remember at some occasions we consulted each other to clear our doubts but never had the idea that we will score the same percentile and rank one after another,” said Jain, a resident of Vigyan Nagar, Kota. His schoolmate also scored same marks.

Born and brought up in Kota, Jain has been inspired by the success stories churned out by coaching industry.

“It’s like a dream come true. I have not decided anything on the IITs and will decide after IIT-Advanced,” said Jain. Both study from Disha Delphi Public School and prepared for IITs from Allen Career Institute. Inspired from his father Vineet Dwivedi who is a general manager, Centre for Railway Information System (CRIPS) Vineet Dwivedi and mother Neeti Dwivedi additional SP of Lucknow, Parth is keen to follow the footsteps of his parents by serving the nation. “I am least interested in going abroad for studies or job. I take it as my duty to build the nation and contribute in its progress,” said Parth, who is eyeing to pursue Computer Science from IIT-Bombay.

Reacting on the ongoing protest, Parth feels that students’ primary objective has to study. “Before participating in any protest students should work with some NGOs or at the ground level for the last man standing,” said Parth.

Sharing tips on how to crack this exam, Parth says that focus should be given equally on all subjects.

Jaipur: The state road safety council at its meeting here on Friday proposed the removal of the BRTS corridors from the roads in Jaipur.

Transport minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas said the state road safety council has found that the ill-planned BRTS corridors is one of the main reasons for accidents in the city and has recommended to the urban development and housing department to remove the BRTS corridors on city roads. The minister said this at a media briefing at the secretariat on Friday.

The minister said as per the good samaritan guidelines, all private hospitals were duty-bound to provide treatment to those injured in accidents. If they are not doing it, legal action would be initiated against them.

He said the officials in the medical and health department have been instructed to display the good samaritan guidelines in both private and government hospitals, and give wide publicity through advertisements to create awareness.

The minister expressed concern over the high rate of accidents in the state. The past year saw a spurt in accidents and casualties. Compared to 2018, 1,737 more accidents were reported in 2019 while the injured and dead were also higher by 1,432 and 243 respectively. Khachariyawas said that all the related departments have been directed to work in tandem to reduce the accident rates in the current year.

About 40% of the accidents in the state are reported at the national highways. The main reason is there are no barricades on the side of the roads which is resulting in stray cattle and animals entering the highways. He directed the NHAI officials to ensure construction of proper barricades on both sides of the roads, removing the black spots, proper maintenance of the facilities to road users, emergency services and lighting as the commuters pay toll tax for road use.

ADG Pankaj Kumar Singh, said over 31 lakh were penalized last year for traffic violations, earning a revenue of Rs 48 crore by traffic police. He said the police department had sent to the transport department over 65,000 licenses for cancellation for various periods as compared to 2018.

RUDRAPUR: In an unusual incident, a pet dog had to spend a night in the custody of Katoratal police in Kashipur area of Udham Singh Nagar district, after two people claimed his ownership. Police had initially sought some time from the claimants to settle the dispute as both sides were unwilling to budge. Interestingly, the dog also showed liking for both the persons.

Sub-inspector Madan Singh Bisht, in-charge of Katoratal police station, said that Nirmal Singh, a resident of Shiv Nagar colony, had registered a complaint with the police that his pet ‘Labrador’ had gone missing on December 26. “On January 12, Amit Kumar, a resident of Pant Park in Kashipur wrote a post on social media saying that he had recovered a Labrador from railway crossing in Kashipur. Nirmal’s son, Anand Verma, noticed the post and claimed to have identified his dog by the photograph. He approached Kumar and after sharing the dog’s old pictures, reached his home and returned with his pet,” Bisht said.

However, the incident took a twist when on January 16, Dr Anurag Chauhan, a resident of Shubh Vihar colony in Awas Vikas of Kashpur, reached out to Amit Kumar and claimed that the dog about whom Kumar had posted is his.

Kumar said, “When Singh approached me with his pet dog Tiger’s picture, it resembled with the dog that I found and, therefore, I handed it to him. But when Dr Anurag Chauhan reached out to me and showed me his pet dog named Broonie’s photo, I could not make any difference.”

Bisht added, “The photo brought by Dr Chauhan resembled the one that Kumar had rescued. Dr Chauhan then went to Nirmal Singh’s place and claimed ownership of the dog. The matter was then brought to us and to our surprise we found that the dog was responding well to both the parties. We then decided to keep the dog in our custody till the time the matter was sorted.”

After keeping the dog in their custody for a night, Katoratal police then came up with a unique idea. Bisht said, “On Friday, we decided that we will drop the dog at a point from where he can reach his owner’s house, while keeping an eye and then whichever house the dog chooses to go will be recognised as the owner.”

The experiment became a success when Tiger reached Singh’s house on his own.

Singh told TOI that Tiger has been a part of his family for the past two years and he could never make a mistake in identifying him.

“All’s well that ends well. It was the best possible way to reach a solution and even Dr Chauhan seems happy with the outcome,” Bisht said.

We will not bow down before central government for any help,”” Thackeray said.

Thackeray also announced loan waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh to the farmers. The leaders from the region claimed that the loan waiver will not give respite to the farmers in Kolhapur district. “I had promised to waive the loans of farmers. Now, loans of up to Rs 2 lakh are waived. The farmers paying loan amount regularly will also be taken care of,” added Thackeray.

214,['18/01/2020'],District judge recruitment: Lawyer moves SC on cut in age limit,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Supreme Court

CHENNAI: A city-based lawyer has moved the Supreme Court challenging the notification issued by the Madras high court for direct recruitment of district judges, alleging that the upper age limit for OBC/MBC candidates had been ‘arbitrarily’ reduced to 45 from 48 years.

Advocate N S Sivakumar also wanted the Supreme Court to permit him to apply for and participate in the recruitment process, as an interim relief, pending disposal of the plea.

Sivakumar, who had originally approached the Madras high court challenging the notification dated December 12, 2019, has now approached the apex court since the high court refused to pass any interim order permitting him to participate in the recruitment, pending disposal of the petition. The plea moved as a special leave petition before the Supreme Court is scheduled to be taken up for hearing on January 24.

The primary contention of the petitioner was whether it’s legally sustainable in taking away the age relaxation granted in the January 13, 2019, notification by the authorities prescribing maximum age limit of 48 for all reserved category (BC/MBC) candidates and reducing it to 45 years without valid and proper reason in the notification dated December 12, 2019, in the same calendar year for filling vacant posts of district judges (entry level) by direct recruitment.

“About 3,562 lawyers, pleaders, assistant public prosecutors and serving judicial officers who wrote the preliminary examination for appointment as district judge in February, subsequent to the January 2019 notification failed to clear the exam. Therefore, the latest notification issued for filling same vacancies, in the same calendar year, infringes on the legitimate expectation of the petitioner in taking part in the selection process, particularly when there was no recruitment during the time the petitioner crossed the age limit,” Sivakumar said.

Kanpur: The effluent of notorious Sisamau nullah once again started pouring into Ganga following two days of heavy downpour in the city. Besides. Sisamau nullah, other nullahs too discharged their effluent into the river in the past two days.

As soon as the news reached the officials, municipal commissioner and other officials inspected the nullah. Chief engineer, Jal Nigam, AK Gupta said that Sisamau nullah had been tapped in such a way that in normal days all its effluent could pass into the sewage treatment plant (STP) but the system failed to bear the load of excess water.

He said as there are no separate channels in the city to control rain and domestic water separately, and even deep sewer line of the city was not able to balance the overflow, therefore, it was necessary to pass the rainwater in the river by opening the channels otherwise, the overflowing sewer would have inundated a large area of the city. Teams have been pressed in to control the situation, said KMC sources.

DM Brahmadev Ram Tiwari said, ""The tapping was designed for normal climatic conditions. And, if the flow of the nullah increases due to rain, then channels will have to be opened so that excess water can be discharged otherwise the localities situated under the tapping point can be affected with waterlogging"".

Hyderabad: An Enforcement Directorate investigation has discovered the role of employees of Leo Meridian Infrastructure Projects & Hotels (LMIPHL) in the loan fraud case. ED is also probing the involvement of the family members of Leonia MD G Chakravarthy Raju.

ED has so far unearthed 33 shell companies and more than 40 shell vendors/contractors. ED has identified diversion of loan funds up to Rs 250 crore. The total outstanding loan against the company is Rs 1,768 crore. ED has identified certain companies like Sri Pragna Farmsand Tech Planet Solutions, which pumped in money into LMIPHL.

ED said that the low level employees of LMIPHL were registered as the directors in most of the shell investing companies. A total bogus share premium of Rs 360 crore was pumped in and share capital of Rs 12 crore was infused. ED alleged that even the contractors and vending companies are registered in the name of low level employees of LMIPHL.

The agency is also probing into the alleged benami assets in the names of the relatives companies and other benamis.

ED has arrested Chakravarthy Raju and Prasad in the case. ED alleged, “By using bogus capital equity and bonus shares taken on fake balance sheets, Raju and his family came to own 95% of the company without investing any real personal money. The resort project, though grossly over-valued in the balance sheets, was built from a portion of the sanctioned loan. But he was not eligible to get the loan and it was illegally obtained. The rest of the loan amount was siphoned off.”

LUCKNOW: The house of a government bank officer was burgled in Vikasnagar while he was out of town. Cash and jewellery worth lakhs was stolen from his house.

Bank employee Pradeep Mishra, who returned home after 10 days of vacation on Friday, has lodged an FIR of theft.

Vikasnagar sub-inspector Bahadur Singh said: “Pradeep owns a newly constructed three-storey house in sector 1 of Vikasnagar. He and his family had left town on January 5. When he returned on Thursday night around 10.30pm, he found that the iron grille on a window was broken. He entered the house only to find that everything was scattered and a cupboard was open. He checked and found that Rs 70,000 and gold and silver jewellery had been stolen.” A forensic investigation team scanned the house and collected fingerprints. The burglars had scaled the boundary wall to enter the house. There were at least two burglars, police said.

“We are scanning the area for CCTV camera footage. Locals say they have not spotted any suspect. The miscreants must have kept a watch on the locked house,” said Singh.

Both Mishra and his wife work in government banks. They had moved in the new house in October.

Vinod Kumar Bishnoi works at his field in 13 KND village, Sriganganagar.

SRIGANGANAGAR/BIKANER: Farmers in the locust-affected areas of Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts are not satisfied with the state government’s compensation guidelines. They alleged that Girdawari (crop assessment report) is yet to be initiated by the local administration. Farmers question the government’s norm that allows compensation only to those farmers whose 33% or more cultivated areas have been damaged in the locust attacks.

“As per norms, compensation is given to farmers who have lost at least 33% or more crops due to locust attacks. The damaged crop of entire village, hamlet or panchayat, and not for an individual farmer, is taken into account for calculating 33%. The government should, instead, check damaged areas of individual farmer’s cultivated area for compensation purposes,” says Amar Singh, a farmer and secretary at the Kisan Sangarh Samiti, Sriganganagar.

Annoyed with the alleged inaction and poor response of the authorities, the Kisan Sangarh Samiti has written a letter to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and submitted it to the Sriganganagar district collector Shiv Prasad for further action.

“They should start the process of Girdawari. Instead, we are told that the admin does not have enough resources to initiate Girdawari and is engaging Girdawars (crop assessors) of other villages to visit the affected areas,” says Subash Sehgal, a farmer leader who was part of a delegation that met Prasad on Friday. Farmers allege that there are many farms in which more than 80% of the produce has been damaged by the locust attacks. “I was expecting a good yield of mustard this time as we received good monsoon. Now, over 80% of my crops are damaged. I am yet to find a single government officer visit me and my farm. I had taken a loan of Rs 5 lakh this season from the bank,” says Manzoor Khan, a farmer at 3KNM village near Ravla where four locust attacks were witnessed in past one fortnight. Many farmers in Ravla, Gharsana, Raisinghnagar in Sriganganagar and Khajuwala in Bikaner tehsils believe they won’t be getting any major relief from the government.

On Friday evening, 200 anglo-Indians gathered near Beach Station for a candlelight protest

CHENNAI: In a unique protest , the Anglo-Indian (AI) community members will light candles in their homes on Friday nights across the country to challenge the cabinet’s decision to discontinue Constitutional provisions guaranteeing them reserved seats in the Lok Sabha .

On the ground, the community is holding protests, forming confederations and preparing memorandums seeking extension of the special reservation accorded to the community.

On Friday evening, 200 anglo-Indians gathered near Beach Station for a candlelight protest. “We are planning another protest in 15 days,” said Jennifer Herft of Perambur, who led the gathering. Last week, representatives of 10 associations from across the country, headed by former MLA Barry O ‘Brien, met in Kolkata to discuss on state and nation-wide protests along with a plan to meet the President.

Augustine Roy Rozario, founder and president, Anglo-Indian Suburban Front, said while spelling out the reason for continuing special reservation for the SC&ST community and discontinuing the same for anglo-Indians, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had stated there are only 296 anglo-Indians in India as per 2011 Census. “This is not true. We are a 4 lakh strong community,” he said.

Dr Nancy Ann Cynthia Francis, member of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly, said over the years, the community has been stripped of a lot of benefits. “We had reservation in colleges, in the railways. But all that has gone now,” said Francis, who was the last of anglo-Indians to avail a reserved medical seat in 1972.

CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh bench of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Friday quashed last year’s appointment of Dinkar Gupta as the director general of police (DGP), Punjab. The two-member bench, comprising CAT chairman L Narsimha Reddy and M Jamshed, accepted the plea moved by two senior IPS officers, Mohammad Mustafa and Siddharth Chattopadhyaya, challenging Gupta’s appointment.

Gupta, a 1987 batch IPS officer, had become Punjab DGP on February 27 last year by superseding five senior officers, including Mustafa (1985 batch) and Chattopadhyaya (1986). Mustafa and Chattopadhyaya had contented in their plea that both of them were ignored by the UPSC panel for appointment as the state’s DGP.

The tribunal also ruled that the procedure adopted by the UPSC and empanelment committee, which examined the police officers empanelled by Punjab to select and appoint the next DGP, “is patently opposed to and is violative of the one stipulated by the Supreme Court in its judgment in Prakash Singh’s case (supra), apart from being otherwise illegal and arbitrary.”

Documents found from the body suggested that Dua was a resident of Dharamkunj apartment in Rohini in the national capital, police said.

When police officers in Bulandshahr contacted their counterparts in Rohini, they were told that a missing complaint in the name of Dua was filed on January 6. The body was sealed and sent for post-mortem examination.

“Prima facie, it looks like murder. But, we will be able to ascertain the exact cause of the death only after postmortem report is available. FIR will be registered at Sikanderabad police station,” Gopal Krishna Chaudhary, additional superintendent of police (Bulandshahr) said.

Deserted stretches of western UP and its canals have long been used as “duping ground”. According to sources in police, criminals dump the bodies in the canals and in deserted pockets in hope that they will get decomposed and their identity will becomes difficult.

In May last year, a headless body of a 23-year-old woman, with her fingers missing and torso bearing several brutal injury marks, was found dumped in a cane field in Bulandshahr. Local police are yet to solve the case.

A few months later, body of a 25-year-old woman was found dumped in a sack in Bulandshahr’s Gulaothi area.

COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore region of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation ( TNSTC ) has earned Rs 3.76 crore from operating special buses during the Pongal season. The district was the highest grosser at Rs 1.38 crore followed by Erode , which accounted for Rs 1.3 crore.

TNSTC had operated a total of 1,781 special buses from Coimbatore, Erode, Tirupur and Nilgiris to various districts across the state, to clear the Pongal rush. Of them, 577 buses were operated from Coimbatore.

The special buses were operated for five days from January 11 to 15. While only 97 buses were operated on the first day, the number of buses went up to 112 on the second day and to 158 on the third day. On January 14, TNSTC introduced a total of 966 buses and the number came down to 380 on the fifth and the final day (January 15). All the special buses were ordinary, non-AC (air-conditioned) town buses.

The special buses benefitted many commuters who were otherwise dependent on private bus operators, who usually hike their rates during the festive season. “Private non-AC seater buses had increased ticket fares to the down south districts to upwards Rs 900,” said G Anuja, a college student in the city. However, TNSTC special buses were available to almost every district from Rs 550 onwards. “It has also become simple to book a ticket online, instead of waiting in queues at the bus stand with uncertainty,” she said.

TNSTC usually operates special buses during festive seasons like Pongal, Diwali, Ayudha Pooja and Tamil New Year. These buses are operated in addition to the 127 buses to Salem from Gandhipuram, and 55 buses to Trichy from Singanallur bus stand. During the festive season, all the buses to the two destinations departed from CODISSIA grounds to reduce congestion in the main bus stands.

“TRS is managing elections and not really contesting them. Everyone knows that TRS had copied Congress manifesto and announced it with minor changes in the December 2018 Assembly elections.

Tirupur: The Tirupur apparel cluster has failed to streamline the disposal of plastic wastes despite the state government giving its exemption a year ago to the export units to utilize banned single-use plastics.

The apparel units use single-use plastics with thickness of 20-60 micron to pack finished goods and wrap fabrics and other materials. In a month, 500 metres of plastic wastes are generated in the cluster.

“The corporation receives only around 6mt plastic and other non-biodegradable wastes daily. Going by the number of industrial units from all sectors, the number is very less. We handle more than 460mt wastes, including 207mt wet wastes and 253mt dry wastes daily,” corporation city health officer C Boopathi said.

An official of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board said, “Many industrial units dump plastic wastes and other non-biodegradable wastes in open or sometimes in waterbodies.”

The corporation has signed a memorandum of understanding with Nothing Is Waste, a non-governmental organisation, for collecting and disposing industrial wastes. The organisation operates two segregation-cum-baling units at Thennampalayam.

“We mainly receive plastic wastes, carton box wastes, clothes and other office-use wastes. Though many plastic or other wastes can be recycled, it could not be done because the industrial units fail to segregate them properly. We could see that dumping of foams utilized in embroidery units were major wastes that hurt environment,” Mohammed Rizaz of Nothing Is Waste said.

Owner of a computer embroidery unit said, “More than 250mt foam wastes would be generated in Tirupur cluster in a month. Since there were no takers, most of the units would be sending those wastes to other processing units to utilize them as fuel in boilers, which is also harmful to the environment. Some of the embroidery units were dumping them in open and waterbodies. A private firm offered services of disposing the foam wastes, but it demanded Rs10 per kg. We would be ready to engage such firms only if they demand Rs2-3 per kg for the disposal.”

Tirupur Exporters’ Association president Raja M Shanmugham said, “We expect the corporation to come up with a plan for disposal.”

CHENNAI: An accident claims tribunal in the city directed an insurance firm to pay Rs 1.82 crore to the family of a man who was killed after he was struck down by a tipper truck at a dam site in Kashmir. The city resident was working as a manager at a dam site in the north Indian site when the accident happened in 2013.

According to the petition filed by Pushpa Latha and her two sons, her husband S Soundararaj was working at Gurez dam site in Kashmir when he met with the accident. A heavy tipper lorry came from behind and knocked Soundararaj down. In the impact, he sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot, the petition stated.

The counsel for the truck owner denied the allegations stating that the truck driver had operated the vehicle at normal speed and unexpectedly, the deceased fell in front of the vehicle. Despite attempts by the driver to avoid hitting the man, the accident happened due to the negligence of Soundararaj, the counsel stated. After perusing the submissions, the tribunal held that the accident happened only due to the rash and negligent driving by the truck driver. The tribunal noted that the deceased was 50 years old at the time of the accident and was working as a manager at a construction company and was earning over 1lakh per month.

MEERUT: The recovery of the carcass of a dolphin killed by a harpoon in Hastinapur wildlife sanctuary recently has exposed the chinks in the measures to conserve the endangered Gangetic dolphins .

According to experts, around 3,500 dolphins live in Ganga and its tributaries in India. The species is concentrated in the upper periphery of Uttar Pradesh close to Uttarakhand where a Ramsar site (Between Garh Ganga and Narora) is earmarked exclusively for dolphin conservation. Other such regions in UP are Kanpur, Allahabad, Mirzapur, Etawah etc. In Bihar and West Bengal, the habitat is uniformly divided with the highest concentration in Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary developed in late 1990s.

Despite concerted efforts by various agencies, a plethora of factors still continue to pose grave threat to the species. These include poaching for oil, pollution and increased traffic in waterbodies.

Shahnawaz Khan, a WWF India field unit officer currently involved in the conservation of dolphins in the Upper Ganga region near Bijnor and Ramsar site of west UP, said, “The species is generally killed for its oil which makes an excellent bait for catfish, considered to be prize catch for a hunter. Catfish easily gets attracted to the smell of the oil.”

River dolphin expert Sunil Chaudhary said, “We have worked strenuously to increase the dolphin population in Vikramshila since late 90s. Due to this, the count rose from 95 to 237 within a couple of years. However, there is a sharp decline of around 20% in the last two years due to the introduction of inland waterways. Government has declared the stretch between Haldia in West Bengal and Varanasi in UP as National Waterway Number 1 in which ships and huge boats require a continuous depth of at least three metres for travel. This requires dredging, a process that emits powerful vibrations. As Gangetic dolphins are blind, they navigate according to their own sound vibrations. The manmade ones greatly unsettle them. That is one of the major reasons behind the decline in their population.”

Notably, development of waterways is one of the key projects of BJP government at the Centre.

Syed Ainul Hussain, senior scientist at Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun, said, “Even though the government is keen on dolphin conservation, infrastructure development is also high on its agenda. Water transport system and aquatic life, particularly dolphins, cannot coexist. One has to be sacrificed to save the other.” “We have identified 12 zones of 30km each that can be developed into sanctuaries. One of them has already been approved by the UP government near Allahabad,” he added.

The only authentic comparative statement can be made from a yearly census by the WWF India along with the UP forest division in the Bijnor-Narora stretch. While 30 dolphins were spotted in the stretch in 2015, the number rose to 36 in October 2019.

Suresh Babu, director of River Basins and Water Policy, WWF India, said, “The key element to conservation of wildlife is engagement of local communities. Over the years, we have developed Ganga Mitras and Dolphin Mitras in Bijnor-Narora region, and sensitized them towards conservation of dolphins, gharials and turtles. The results have been quite encouraging. Engagement of riverbank farmers not only reduced the use of harmful pesticides but also decreased illegal fishing considerably. Continuous dialogues with government agencies have also helped. A dip in effluent emissions has also helped dolphins thrive. We look forward to replicate the model in other areas like Kanpur downstream and Chambal in Etawah.”

231,['18/01/2020'],Chennai: Three bridges to be retrofitted at Rs 15 crore,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Parthasarathy bridge in Old Washermenpet is one of the three structures set to undergo retrofitting

CHENNAI: Three bridges in North Chennai, each more than 50 years old, are set to be retrofitted this year as the city corporation has found out, after various tests, that the bearings have worn out and repair is imminent. In coordination with the city police, Greater Chennai Corporation will also work out a traffic plan to ensure that commuters are not affected when the work is taken up.

The Vaithyanathan bridge in Tondiarpet, Parthasarathy bridge in Old Washermenpet and the bridge across the Captain Cotton Canal along Meenambal Road in MKB Nagar will be taken up for rehabilitation and retrofitting at an estimated Rs 15 crore, corporation officials said.

An official with the bridges department said retrofitting is an economical alternative to replacing or reconstruction. “These are old bridges and if retrofitted using modern techniques, they will be able to withstand wear and tear for another decade or two,” he said.

The civic body, which doesn’t have structural drawings of the bridges, opted for non-destructive testing which showed spalling of concrete (where water enters the structure) and exposure of rebar reinforcement were the most common reasons for the damage. The bridge bearings, under the decking (over which vehicles ply), shifted positions over the years due to vehicle movement and will have to be replaced. “A hydraulic jack will be used to lift the decking and replace the bearings,” he said.

With traffic expected to be hit when the repair work is doen, corporation officials will meet police officers to chalk out a plan. “If everything falls in place, the project can be completed in 18 months. Traffic can be allowed only on one side while work is on at the other side,” the official said.

Tenders have already been floated for the three projects.

While the estimated cost of renovating Parthasarathy bridge is Rs 8 crore, work on the Vaidhyanathan bridge and Captain Cotton Canal bridge is estimated to cost Rs 4.7 crore and Rs 1.7 crore, the official said.

Bridges department officials said that dynamic lighting of flyovers, grade separators, rail over-bridges (ROBs) and the subways , both vehicular and pedestrian, will also begin this year.

CHENNAI: A bullock cart race marked Pongal celebrations on the city outskirts in the early hours of Friday with six such carts participating in the competition organised on Jawaharlal Nehru Road in Padi. The event was held on the arterial road between Padi junction and Kolathur junction.

A Saravanan, one of the organisers of the annual event, said that contestants sped on their bullock carts reaching speeds of 40 km an hour. “The event was held for 30 minutes from 5am to 5.30am. The carts covered the distance of five kilometres within this time,” Saravanan said.

While most of the bullock carts were brought for the event from villages in and around Avadi and Red Hills, some came from Parry’s in the city. Participants on the four wheel carts vied with each other to reach the destination first.

Though bullock cart racing is an annual event, the organisers said that police have been refusing permission for the traditional sport every year.

Saravanan, a farmer hailing from Vellanur village near Avadi in Tiruvallur district, said that the traditional sport has been a part of Pongal festival for several years. Noting that bullock cart race is permitted across the state, he wondered why police were denying permission for a similar event in and around state capital.

For the past three years, bullock cart race is organised along highways on the outskirts of the city.

“The race is part and parcel of Pongal festival,” Saravanan added.

COIMBATORE: The Coimbatore region of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation ( TNSTC ) has earned Rs 3.76 crore from operating special buses during the Pongal season. The district was the highest grosser at Rs 1.38 crore followed by Erode , which accounted for Rs 1.3 crore.

TNSTC had operated a total of 1,781 special buses from Coimbatore, Erode, Tirupur and Nilgiris to various districts across the state, to clear the Pongal rush. Of them, 577 buses were operated from Coimbatore.

The special buses were operated for five days from January 11 to 15. While only 97 buses were operated on the first day, the number of buses went up to 112 on the second day and to 158 on the third day. On January 14, TNSTC introduced a total of 966 buses and the number came down to 380 on the fifth and the final day (January 15). All the special buses were ordinary, non-AC (air-conditioned) town buses.

The special buses benefitted many commuters who were otherwise dependent on private bus operators, who usually hike their rates during the festive season. “Private non-AC seater buses had increased ticket fares to the down south districts to upwards Rs 900,” said G Anuja, a college student in the city. However, TNSTC special buses were available to almost every district from Rs 550 onwards. “It has also become simple to book a ticket online, instead of waiting in queues at the bus stand with uncertainty,” she said.

TNSTC usually operates special buses during festive seasons like Pongal, Diwali, Ayudha Pooja and Tamil New Year. These buses are operated in addition to the 127 buses to Salem from Gandhipuram, and 55 buses to Trichy from Singanallur bus stand. During the festive season, all the buses to the two destinations departed from CODISSIA grounds to reduce congestion in the main bus stands.

SRIGANGANAGAR/BIKANER: Locusts have damaged crops across an area of at least 3.6 lakh hectares in 10 districts as western Rajasthan continues to reel under the longest and the worst attack of the pest in 60 years.Swirling swarms of the deadly grasshoppers have eaten up 75% of standing crops in the hardest-hit Sriganganagar district, according to assessments by officials and farmers. The other nine affected districts are Hanumangarh, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jodhpur, Jalore, Sirohi, Nagaur and Churu.The first attacks were reported in May last year, when lakhs of pink locusts flying in from southern Pakistan damaged the kharif crop (July-Sept) in the 10 districts. Now, a major wave of fresh attacks have hit the rabi crop (October-March), leaving farmers devastated.Locals in 60 villages of Sriganganagar and Bikaner visited by TOI said the latest attacks began a fortnight ago.Many farmers said the current attack is the biggest ever seen in the region.Among the crops in the line of attack are wheat, gram, mustard, cumin and taramira (arugula). “Locusts are not eating the entire plant but are chewing the flowers, thereby damaging the crop,” said Shyam Somra of 20KYD village in Bikaner district.“Rajasthan witnessed first locust attack in May 2019 and since then, everyone — including the agriculture department, Locust Control Organisation (LCO) and others — has been merely spraying pesticides. This is the biggest-ever attack. Can’t they find out why the attack is still unstoppable and uncontrollable? If breeding is happening in Pakistan, the state administration should urge the Union government to talk to their Pakistani counterparts to control it,” said Subash Sehgal of Kisan Sangarsh Samiti.K L Gurjar, deputy director at LCO-Jodhpur, has been surveying the damage in villages of Sriganganagar and Bikaner districts. “I think the menace is under control in the state, except for Sriganganagar and Jaisalmer districts. A good monsoon, greenery and moisture have been the reasons behind the excessive presence of locusts this year. We have ample pesticides and are checking their movement to control them while they are settled in non-farming areas,” Gurjar told TOI. Farmers alleged that for the last eight months, the state government had neither completed girdawari (cross assessment report), nor had it taken any effective measures to check the swarms of locusts coming at regular intervals.“I have 75 bighas of land and ever since we witnessed fresh locust attack a fortnight ago, we have been spraying pesticides, playing loud music and doing everything to scare away these devils. Government authorities are merely coming and clicking pictures with their mobile phones,” said Soha Lal Bishnoi, a farmer of 12KND village in Sriganganagar.“Almost 1 lakh hectares in Sriganganagar and nearly 2.6-lakh ha in the remaining nine districts have been affected by locust attacks. We have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged his intervention in expediting the relief process. We demand a compensation of Rs 20,000 per acre to each farmer,” said Sehgal.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73347630,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-271837,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/flying-terrorists-take-western-raj-hostage/articleshow/73341876.cms

Hyderabad: After staying away from each other in the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress , CPI and TDP have come to an informal understanding in elections to municipalities in Khammam, Kothagudem and Suryapet districts.

However, this electoral understanding is not for an entire municipality but depends upon the political equations and winning prospects in wards and divisions of municipalities and municipal corporations.

Congress, CPI and TDP were part of People’s Front (Praja Front) along with TJS that was routed in 2018 Assembly polls. Though the Congress-TDP-CPI-TJS alliance was not disbanded formally after the Assembly polls, the gathbandhan was discontinued with Congress going alone in 2019 Lok Sabha polls. The TDP did not contest the Lok Sabha elections while CPI and CPM forged an alliance and unsuccessfully contested four Lok Sabha seats.

In the elections to be held to about 130 urban local bodies on January 22, the contesting candidates from Congress, CPI and TDP have come to an informal electoral understanding in select wards of various urban local bodies.

For instance, there are 20 wards in Wyra municipality in Khammam district where the Congress is contesting only 10 wards, giving space to TDP which has fielded candidates from 6 wards and CPI from one ward. In Madhira municipality, which has 22 wards, the Congress has fielded just 10 candidates, with TDP fielding 7 candidates, CPI 2 candidates and CPM 3 candidates.

The Congress has already announced that it will go for an electoral understanding at local level with any political party except the TRS and BJP . The CPI too has announced that it would agree for a poll understanding with any party except the BJP.

CHENNAI: Concluding over a decade-long legal battle between more than 1,300 sub-inspectors (SI) of 1994-95 batch falling under direct recruitment and in-service cadre, in connection with fixation of service seniority, the Madras high court has upheld the decision of the state to place the seniority of 267 in-service candidates above direct recruits, though both were recruited through the same recruitment drive.

“Government thought it fit that those in-service candidates are already aged when compared to the directly recruited candidates and therefore, if they are given preference in fixation of seniority, they could get promotional prospects before their retirement, otherwise they could not. In such view of the matter, we are of the view that the amendments brought to the Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Special Police Subordinate Service is proper and we do not see any reason to interfere with the same,” a division bench of Justices R Subbiah and C Saravanan said.

The issue pertains to a batch of plea moved by 20 sub-inspectors belonging to 1994-95 batch. On January 1, 1994 the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board (TNUSRB) issued a notification for selection and appointment of 500 SIs through direct recruitment.

Though departmental candidates were also permitted to apply, most of them became ineligible as the cut-off ages was 30 years. Aggrieved, the in-service candidates moved the erstwhile Tamil Nadu Administrative Tribunal.

Since the tribunal ruled in favour of the departmental candidates, TNSURB earmarked 20% vacancies in the selection for direct recruitment of SIs. Subsequently, the board decided to recruit 1,100 persons as against the proposed 500 posts.

As all the 1,100 candidates cannot be accommodated altogether for training, the recruitment was made in three phases – 500, 600 and 267 (in-service).

After the first batch of 500 were imparted training and absorbed into service, the remaining 600 and 267 were sent for training together. However, as far as, seniority was concerned, in order to give preference to in-service candidates who were appointed against 20% quota, the state fixed them over and above the remaining 600 direct recruits.

Aggrieved, they have approached the court assailing the decision.

Plants destroyed by locusts at 13 KND village in Sriganganagar on Friday.

RAISINGHNAGAR/RAVLA: Farmers baffled with the biggest-ever locust attack alleged that Chloro, a pesticide sprayed from the tractor mounted drums in the affected areas by the teams of agriculture and revenue department, is ineffective. They claimed that it merely makes locusts drowsy.

Farmers have demanded to provide them Lambda, a stronger pesticide. However, agriculture experts and officials of Locust Control Organisation (LCO) said that use of Chloro is suitable and environment friendly.

TOI visited several villages in Sriganganagar, Barmer and found that at many villages farmers are spraying the pesticides on their own.

“Chloro se vadiya Lambda hegi, tussi Lambda lao,” said Harjeet Singh Neki, a farmer at 28 RB village near Raisinghnagar while talking to Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director of Locust Control Organisation (LCO).

Farmers said that the pesticide Chloro merely makes the locusts drowsy and within six hours, they again start flying. “We have sprayed Lambda, another pesticide which is very effective and kills the locusts immediately. Why the government is not supplying us this pesticide?,” said Sohan Singh, a native of 25 RB village in Raisinghnagar tehsil of Sriganganagar.

When contacted, Gurjar, said, “Once a locust falls on the ground after the spray, it can never fly and do the damage. Chloro is suitable for them.”

Elaborating more on the issue, Dr GR Matoria, deputy director, agriculture department, Sriganganagar, said, “Lambda and other stronger pesticides are avoided since they can also harm the crop and pests which are actually beneficial for a better yield of crop. It is seen that locusts get stuck onto the crop in the evening, while its wings are moist. This is the time while we use spray and they fall on the ground. In the morning, while they get dried up, they start flying. So, our job is just to stop them from sticking to the crop in the evening to ensure no damage to it.”

COIMBATORE: Functionaries of Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam (DVK) on Friday sought action against actor Rajinikanth for his speech against social reformer Periyar.

The functionaries, led by party’s district president M Nehru Das, lodged a police complaint against the actor and demanded that police register an FIR against him under sections 153 (a) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.

While attending the 50th anniversary of Thuglak, a Tamil news magazine, in Salem, the actor had stirred controversy by saying that Periyar had in 1971 taken out a procession after garlanding the images of Lord Ram and Sita with chappals.

The petitioners demanded unconditional apology from the actor for spreading false information about Periyar. “Rajinikanth should apologise for the wrong statement. Otherwise, we will stage protests at all cinema theatres in the district where Rajinikanth ’s Darbar is screened,” said Das. “Party cadre have taken efforts to file petitions seeking legal action against the actor in all districts.”

Acknowledging the complaint, the city police issued receipt of community service register (CSR).

DVK functionaries at Tiruchengode in Namakkal district also filed a police complaint seeking action against the actor on Friday.

SRIGANGANAGAR: The Locust Control Organization (LCO) and other experts said that Rajasthan as a whole witnessed the attack of pink locusts which needs to be controlled before they become fit to breed and multiply their numbers.Pink locusts, according to them, is a baby (adult takes yellow colour and is fit for breeding) but it is very lethal for the crops. Experts of LCO, agriculture department and other departments said that since May 2019 when Rajasthan had witnessed its first locust attack in the western Rajasthan, including Barmer and Jaisalmer, there has not been any movement of yellow locusts.“Yellow locust is an adult form and can lay 80 eggs per day while the pink locust is a baby form. Pink locust and its swarms are dangerous. So, we are focusing to control them at this stage only. If they survive and become adults they would be multiplied and it would be very difficult to check their movement,” said Dr KL Gurjar, deputy director, Locust Control Organization (LCO), Jodhpur who is into the control action in 10 affected districts across the state. Camping at Sriganganagar Gurjar along with his team of agriculture experts and others are visiting various affected villages and are following the directions of swarms of the locusts. “In the evening due to excessive moisture their wings get wet and they settle on the tree, farms, forest area and crop area. So, we would be successful if we don’t let them grow as yellow locust. Since May we have not seen any such conversion,” he added.According to experts, it is the winter breeding season for the yellow locusts especially in Pakistan’s Sindh and Balochistan. “Also, pink locusts are immature but are very aggressive in behaviour,” he added.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73351609,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-213726,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/need-to-control-pink-locusts-from-breeding-say-experts/articleshow/73341882.cms

Amaravati: The high-power committee comprising ministers and senior officials met chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on Friday and gave a presentation about their study into the issue of decentralization of administration.

The committee took suggestions from the chief minister and decided to incorporate them in its final report. The committee is scheduled to meet on Saturday to submit the final report to the cabinet. The cabinet will also meet on Saturday.

The committee’s meeting with the CM is significant in the wake of the assembly taking up the issue of three capital cities on January 20.

Minister for municipal administration Botcha Satyanarayana said the government was ready to discuss all issues related to decentralization of administration, capital city and other related issues during the three-day assembly session commencing from Monday.

The minister said the CM has advised the committee to give more thrust to addressing the farmers’ grievances, said Botcha. “The CM directed us to take care of farmers’ grievances. We will make recommendations in such a way that no farmer in the capital city will feel the pinch,” said Botcha.

He said that the committee has more or less agreed to the proposals of the experts’ committees about decentralization of administration as well as development. “TDP is thinking about only 29 villages where as our government is concerned about all the 13 districts, including 29 villages,” said Botcha. He said they would make use of all buildings including the Secretariat structures in Velagapudi. He said they would complete the ongoing structures in Velagapudi and put them to best use

“We will not confront anyone on the issue of the capital city. We are committed to the comprehensive development of the state,” said the minister. He said that they have taken the sentiments and aspirations of people of different regions in the state and working to meet their aspirations.

Botcha appealed to the farmers not to fall prey to Chandrababu Naidu’s designs. He said no one, including local farmers, has asked Naidu why he had failed to issue a notification recognizing Amaravati as the capital city.

He said the government had sympathy for the problems of the farmers and they would address all of them.

Lucknow University

LUCKNOW: Soon, all 43 departments of LU may have their own YouTube channels, where professors will upload lectures, tutorials and other academic-related videos. The move will help in making Lucknow University a brand. This was the suggestion given by LU’s vice-chancellor prof Alok Kumar Rai during his first official interaction with faculty members at Malviya Hall on Friday.

“Also, every faculty should adopt one student and sponsor his/her education in best possible way,” said Rai. The main focus, he added, will be to make LU a student-centric system for which every faculty should at least reserve one hour exclusively for students so that they can get faculty’s support in solving any personal, professional or academics related issue.

“We have a Padmashri professor and several others of national and international repute, our 43 departments should make lectures of such professors available online via YouTube channel , this will help in making LU a brand ,” said the V-C.

He said university holds an excellent academic record and despite running primarily traditional and conventional courses still it has highest citation in reputed journals like SCOPUS and Web of Science. The citation index of the LU is higher than several notable central universities.

The V-C asked professors to focus more on research and every faculty of the university should have atleast two research scholars and a project work.

He also shared that with the focus to give a technological boost to the university’s academic functioning soon facilities like a digital locker—availability of the academic document online and use of smart classes for learning and video making will be mobilized.

All professors were also asked to assure flag hoisting at respective departments and hostels during Republic and Independence Day.

Vijayawada: Two persons died on the spot while seven others suffered ghastly injuries in a tractor accident at Jonnalagadda in Nandigama mandal of Krishna district on Friday morning. The deceased were identified as G Triveni and V Nagamani – both farm labourers.

According to Nandigama Town sub-inspector Hari Babu, the incident happened around 8.15 am when they were ferrying nine farm labourers to Damluru village for work. The speeding tractor lost control when the driver applied brakes at a sharp turn, causing the vehicle to crash sideways.

Two persons fell down and were crushed under the trolley. Locals alerted police who rushed to the spot and moved the victims to Nandigama Government Hospital in the town. Cops said one more person was identified as critical and receiving treatment. Preliminary investigation revealed that the tractor was overcrowded which was the main reason for the mishap as it resulted in the vehicle losing its balance and crashing sideways. Sources told TOI there was poor visibility in the area at the time of the accident due to heavy fog. Meanwhile, both Triveni and Nagamani’s bodies were taken to a local government hospital for post-mortem and later handed over to family members for final rights.

Cops said that both of them were married and are survived by their husbands and two children each.

A case under section 304A of IPC (causing death due to negligence) was registered at Nandigama town police station.

A farmer beats a steel plate at 64NP village in Sriganganagar to drive away locusts on Friday.

SRIGANGANAGAR: The farmers are having sleepless nights since the arrival of locusts in Sriganganagar . But they have taken things to their own hands and trying their best to curb the menace.From child to old man in a family, everybody is engaged in dealing with the pests. They are beating drums, playing loud DJ music to scare insects away.“Raat ko paani lagatey hain aur din main tiddi bhagatey hain (During the night, we water our crops and during the day, we scare away locusts),” said Suresh Godara, a native of 14 KND village near Ravla tehsil of Sriganganagar district.At some of the villages, the farmers get upset and start crying in apprehension. “Rs 3 lakh loan liyedo hai bank se tiddi kha gi to ke bachsi (I have taken loan from the bank. If locusts eat our crop what will be left),” said Mohammed Noor a native of 18 KND village near Ravla.Since the famers get irrigation water in irregular intervals, they are already troubled during winters. “In the evening, when locusts get onto the mustard crop, we start beating the utensils, step up accelerator of parked trackers and make various sounds to scare them away. For the past fortnight, we are living in fear,” said Harnam Singh Neeta, a native of 63 NP village near Raisinghnagar tehsil of Sriganganagar district.Some of the farmers are also bursting firecrackers.Farmers in Sriganganagar have also created whatsApp groups to share the movement of locusts and their fear too.“In these groups, we are getting regular updates on the movement of locusts.

HYDERABAD: Special judge B R Madhusudan Rao of the ED court on Friday dismissed an application filed by YS Jaganmohan Reddy and his associates urging the ED court to defer the trial under prevention of money laundering Act (PMLA) till CBI court concludes its trial in the same quid pro quo case.

Jagan’s contention is that if the alleged original crime is proved in a CBI court, then the question of trying the accused for acquiring proceeds of crime would arise and not prior to that. Conducting trial in both cases simultaneously would be unfair to the parties involved, his counsel argued. ED’s counsel T V Subba Rao opposed this line of argument and said that PMLA court is a special court which has the mandate to try both the cases jointly under Section 44 of the PMLA.

The judge also dismissed the plea of Jagan and other accused seeking a joint hearing of the discharge pleas filed by several accused.

He agreed with CBI counsel K Surender’s contention that all the 11 chargesheets in the case deal with distinct and separate crimes, though emanated from a single FIR. The CBI counsel said that discharge petitions filed by accused should be dealt with separately.

250,['18/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: RPF to use dogs to sniff out wildlife contraband,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Two RPF handlers and a dog at Police Training School (Dogs), Bhopal

CHENNAI: For the first time, the Railway Protection Force (RPF) will be using trained dogs to track and detect wildlife being smuggled through the railway network. The dogs are currently undergoing a drill at the Police Training School (Dogs), Bhopal, under TRAFFIC and WWF-India’s pioneer wildlife sniffer dog training programme, ‘Super Sniffers’.

“This is the first time we are training sniffer dogs for the RPF. We have seen that in the north and a few other areas railway network is being used to smuggle wildlife products,” says Dr Saket Badola, head of TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network, adding the training for the two dog squads – each consisting of one dog and two handlers began a couple of months ago. “They are being trained for the northern and eastern regions of Indian Railways. The training will be completed by June.”

The RPF is responsible for the protection and security of Indian Railways, considered the fourth largest railway network in the world by size. The network is often being used to smuggle illegal wildlife products within the country and to border areas for cross-border trafficking. To help curb this illicit trade of protected and endangered wildlife species, RPF is now planning to use sniffer dogs.

“We have seen many cases where wildlife is smuggled interstate by rail,” says A K Kunnu, assistant commissioner, RPF, eastern region.

“Since the eastern zone is adjacent to countries like Bangladesh, we have seen that several species of tortoises and snakes are also being trafficked by rail. Employing sniffer dogs will help us detect such illegal transport better.”

TRAFFIC’s ‘Super Sniffers’ programme was launched in 2008 in India. “Earlier, we had sniffer dogs to detect narcotics and arms but not for wildlife products,” says Dr Badola. “We usually invite enforcement agencies such as the forest department to collaborate with us. Once they show interest, we get in touch with national-level dog training institutes to design with them a training curriculum focussed on combating trafficking in wildlife products.”

The programme covers sniffing, searching, tracking, and general obedience training of dogs. “We procure pups from a recognised kennel,” says Dr Badola, adding two breeds German shepherd and Belgian malinois are popularly used as they are the best at sniffing and tracking. “Conan, the dog that was used to track Islamic State founder and chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was a Belgian malinois,” adds Dr Badola.

Under the TRAFFIC’s programme, 66 sniffer dogs have been trained so far. “We have worked with about 19 states, including Tamil Nadu . “While we arrange for procurement of pups and training, the agencies working with us, assign two of their staff members designated as handlers and assistant handlers, who are responsible for their use and upkeep after their deployment in field. These staff members also undergo the rigorous nine-month-long training along with the dogs” says Dr Badola.

According to him, more dogs will be trained for RPF in the future.

“These two squads will be deployed in the northern and the eastern regions. This is a pilot programme and considering the interest shown, we will be training more dogs for RPF for different regions across the country,” says Dr Badola.

COIMBATORE: While tiger deaths are coming down across the country, Tamil Nadu recorded a rise in the big cat mortality.

In 2019, the country saw tiger deaths drop to 95, from 115 in 2017, with Madhya Pradesh topping the chart at 31 deaths. But Tamil Nadu, home to four tiger reserves, reported an increase from three tiger deaths in 2017 to six in 2018 and seven in 2019.

Mudumalai Tiger Reserve in Nilgiris recorded the highest of three deaths while Sathayamangalam, the youngest tiger reserve recorded one. Three other deaths were reported outside the tiger reserves in the jungles of Megamalai and Nilgiris.

Forest officials say there was nothing to be worried about the phenomena. For one, the tiger deaths in Tamil Nadu were not due to poaching and were due to natural causes and territorial fighting among the species. Besides, there was an increase in tiger population in the state and it was normal for death rate to spike corresponding to the rise in births.

“If the mortality is due to an unnatural or man–induced cause, then there is something to worry about. But in the last four years there was no such untoward incidents reported in the state,’’ said Anurag Mishra, additional principal chief conservator of forests, Project Tiger , Tamil Nadu.

Forest officials say that the seven deaths reported in the state last year were due to natural causes according to preliminary examination. There was no instance of teeth or nail of the animals missing, as in the case of poaching. There was nothing to suggest poisoning too. However, forest officials treat the deaths as suspicious until forensic reports come in ruling out unnatural causes of death.

“The one death that occurred in Sathyamangalam was due to territorial fighting between two tigers,’’ said Arun Lal, deputy director of Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.

Environmentalists point out that the increase in tiger population calls for additional measures. According to the latest tiger census, the big cat population appears to thrive in the state’s forests rising by leaps from 76 in 2006 to 264 in 2018.

“Tiger is a territorial animal. When the population surges beyond the holding capacity of a tiger reserve, they tend to stray out of the reserves. That could be the reason for three deaths outside the tiger reserves,’’ said environmentalist Osai Kalidas. He said tigers used to venture from Mudumalai and Bandipur tiger sanctuaries into Sathyamangalam forests ten years ago when latter was not a sanctuary. Eventually, Sathyamangalam was declared a tiger reserve. “The point is, the tiger reserves get additional funds and heightened vigil whereas those out of the reserves don’t get that. The government should provide the similar attention to these areas abutting tiger reserves,’’ he said.

Hyderabad: Residents of Manikonda expressed their angst over the lack of amenities ahead of municipal polls at a meet on Friday. Representatives from political parties as well as residential welfare associations attended the meet.

Highlighting the issue of encroachments was Dr P Avinash, president, Tirumala Hills Residential Welfare Association, Puppalaguda. “A park of 6,050 square yards is being encroached upon by land grabbers and officials have turned a blind eye to it. The encroacher is now trying to sell this land which must be protected. It is part of the HMDA approved layout.”

Kantha Rao of Sriramnagar Colony Resident Welfare Association also talked about land grabbing. “Nearly three acres of government land is under threat. With prices soaring in the area, safeguarding public spaces has become a huge problem.” He also asked that work on a community hall — which has been halted — be finished.

At the face-to-face programme, the main concern however remained the lack of water supply to the area. Sitaram Dulipala, president, Federation of All Colonies’ Residents Welfare Associations, said, “Water remains the key issue. All the colonies in Manikonda are facing a severe water crisis, especially during the summers.”

Responding to the concerns, Narender Reddy, former sarpanch and a BJP candidate, said, “Officials have asked residents to bear 50% of the cost for laying pipelines which is unfair. The funds from the municipality itself are enough to address the water issue.”

TRS representative P Jangaiah said, “Our MLA has spoken to the CM on the water issue. I have been helping two colonies myself by providing water and will continue to ensure they get it even after the elections.”

Lucknow: A museum dedicated to the Sikh religion will soon be coming up in Agra. The museum, dedicated to Guru Nanak on his 550th birth anniversary, will highlight the cultural, historical and art associated with Sikhism and seek to educate the younger generation about the history of the religion.

RS Bagga, president of Lucknow Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee, told TOI that the project will be executed by the Centre and is likely to come up on an area of 5 acre. “If government land is acquired then the cost of the project will be Rs 10 crore and if private land is acquired, Rs 5 crore will be spent. The proposal was floated by our committee during the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak in November 2019 and chief minister Yogi Adityanath agreed to it immediately,” he said.

At a meeting chaired by principal secretary culture Jitendra Kumar recently, Lucknow was among the two cities being considered for the project but Agra won due to its proximity to both the state and national capital. Bagga said Agra was also important as Guru Teg Bahadur and his three aides had been arrested by Aurangzeb from the city and it is an important place of pilgrimage for Sikhs.

The museum and research centre will focus on generating awareness about the Sikh religion and highlighting art and craft, culture and history associated with it. Part of the project would be to identify contribution of Sikh films, music, art, science to India, identification of important sites linked with Sikhim and their beautification and promotion.

Coimbatore: A kabaadi contest that was conducted near New Dhamu Nagar in Ammankulam here as part of Pongal celebrations took an ugly turn when a three-member gang stabbed a 23-year-old player for inducting guest players into his team on Thursday night. The injured player is battling for life at the intensive care unit of the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). The Ramanathapuram police on Friday arrested one of the gang members in connection with the incident.

Police identified the victim as K Naveenkumar, of Slum Clearance Board Colony at Ammankulam. He has more than four assault and ganja peddling cases pending against him with the Race Course, Ramanathapuram and Saibaba Colony police stations.

An investigation officer said the match was organized by a section of youths from Ammankulam. “Naveenkumar included three guest players in his team and bagged the first prize.”

After the match, Naveenkumar and one of the guest players - Logeshwaran, 26, of Highways Colony on Trichy Road - went to New Dhambu Nagar to freshen up. Suddenly, R Vijayakumar, 23, of Rajivgandhi Street at Nehru Nagar in Vadavalli, his younger brother R Kannan, 21, and his friend A Hariharan, 21, of Jothipuram near Periyanaickenpalayam waylaid the duo and scolded Naveenkumar for preferring guest players to local youths.

“As they entered into a heated argument, Vijayakumar pulled out a knife from his pant pocket and stabbed Naveenkumar on his chest and abdomen five times. Logeshwaran also suffered a stab injury to on his hand while trying to save his friend. The gang fled immediately after attacking the duo,” the officer said.

Logeshwaran, meanwhile, rushed Naveenkumar to CMCH. Based on Naveenkumar’s complaint, the Ramanathapuram police registered a case against the trio under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 75 (i) (c ) of the Tamil Nadu City Police (TNCP) Act and arrested Vijayakumar on Friday. He was later lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under judicial custody.

“Vijayakumar is facing more than five assault and ganja peddling cases in the city. We have formed a team to nab the remaining two, who are on the run,” the officer said.

The change, made ostensibly because a Muslim (Munqad Ali) is already UP BSP chief, and Mayawati wanted social equilibrium, has been questioned openly by former bureaucrat and party member Fateh Bahadur Singh.

In a series of tweets, Singh, who served as principal secretary in the CM office and of home under Mayawati and joined the party in 2017, said: “Leaders of the party in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha from the same community (Brahmin) symbolises what? Is it according to BSP’s idea of social change? Did Kanshiram found BSP to achieve this goal? The bahujan samaj wants to know.”

Singh confirmed to TOI that he had raised these issues on social media and these were “genuine concerns”. On Twitter, he added that in the past eight months since the current Lok Sabha members had been elected, BSP had changed its leader of the House five times “in the name of social equilibrium”.

Asked about his statement on Twitter, Singh said he was not questioning Mayawati’s decision but just expressing his worry. “Is the current leadership trying to achieve the goal set by Kanshiram when he formed the party? Will bahujan samaj get social, economic and political rights? Will social transformation take place? Bahujans will have to think about this,” he said.

A similar concern has been raised by several others in the party, though nobody would speak out openly. Sources in BSP said Singh currently does not hold any post in the party and was free to air his opinion. “Others too have questioned the idea behind this social equilibrium. If two Muslims are not acceptable, how are two Brahmins in high positions?” asked a senior party member.

So far, four people have headed BSP in the Lok Sabha since May 2019.

260,['18/01/2020'],Nizampet: A bustling place with no basic amenities,"Representative image

HYDERABAD: Land prices are soaring and construction of new buildings is going on at a rapid pace in Nizampet . This should mean the area is thriving. However, lanes and by-lanes of colonies here are dotted with to-let boards. The main reason: Acute shortage of water, which pushes monthly water charges over Rs 5,000.This results in a cut down on rents and difficulty in finding tenants as well as buyers. Deteriorating level of air quality only makes matters worse say residents. While locals are weighing in their options ahead of the municipal elections, they point out the issues they want to be resolved at the earliest.In fact, many colonies in Nizampet also witness a deluge — triggered due to encroachment of lakes — every year. Owners in the affected parts are on the lookout to sell off or rent out their properties. P Ramesh, from Srinivasa Nagar Colony, said: “I have been trying to sell this house for the past two years, but have been unable to find a buyer. While tenants are available, I get Rs 6,000 for a two bedroom apartment. Because the building gets a daily supply of tanker water, it results in a monthly charge of Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000 depending on the season. The municipal water supply is only there for an hour here, which clearly isn’t enough.”Although several other house owners admit to the issues, they cite other reasons for moving out of the area. Apart from water woes, air pollution is a big problem. Stench of pollutants released by industries in neighbouring areas force residents to keep doors and windows closed for a good part of the day. The ones heading out frequently complain of breathing problems.Jagdish Babu, a resident of Reddy Avenue Colony in Nizampet, said: “Every day, morning or evening, there is a stench strong enough to give a headache to most people. It gets worse for children and the elderly. Also, there isn’t a single park for recreational activity in the area despite of having over one lakh people living here.”Problems for residents are compounded by the continuous construction activity in the area, which gives rise to loads of dust throughout the day. Amid the entire huge commercial bustle in this developing area, there is hardly any greenery to counter the impact of pollution. “If you look around, you can see dust rising all through the day,” BN Sridhar, a shop-owner near Ambedkar Statue Junction. “No matter how many times one cleans the place, there is always a thick sheet of white dust. Many a times, it drives away customers.”Condition of the road is also a huge problem. Potholes and partially filled up stretches, dug up previously, can be seen everywhere. “After driving through such precarious roads, coming back to a pollution filled and waterless house is a big issue. Most vacant houses are put on rent and tenants keep moving out frequently. Even with tanker supply, it’s a headache every second day when the tanker gets delayed, and the entire day goes for a toss, delaying daily work,” said a tenant in Sri Sai Nagar.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73350503,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-89034,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/nizampet-a-bustling-place-with-no-basic-amenities/articleshow/73341898.cms

KANYAKUMARI/COIMBATORE: Abdul Shameem and Thoufiq, who were arrested in connection with the murder of special sub-inspector (SSI) of police Y Wilson, 57, at Kaliyakkavilai checkpost on the inter-state border in Kanyakumari district on January 8, have been booked under sections of The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act ( UAPA ).

Superintendent of police (SP) of Kanyakumari district N Sreenath said they were booked under three Sections – 13 (punishment for unlawful activities), 18 (punishment for conspiracy, etc.) and 20 (punishment for being member of a terrorist gang or organisation) – of the UAPA for operating against the country.

Earlier, the Kaliyakkavilai police booked the duo under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 506(ii) (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 7 read with 25(1A) and 25(1B) of the Arms Act for illegal possession of the weapon that was used in the murder.

Police said they were not booked under UAPA earlier as they were yet to ascertain their terror links. Following their arrest and investigation, they have been booked under UAPA also. Police said they will move the Kuzhithurai court in Kanyakumari district on Monday, seeking police custody of the duo.

Meanwhile, the national investigation agency (NIA) is all set to take over investigation from the Tamil Nadu police, as the case has been altered to UAPA. “Kanyakumari district police is continuing investigation and will be taking the accused into custody for interrogation. NIA officials will visit Kaliyakkavilai soon and will take up the case for further investigation within a month,” said a source.

“We will conduct preliminary inquiry with the arrested duo and will send a report to the ministry of home affairs (MHA). In the report, we will mention the gravity of the case. After getting order from the MHA, we would take up the case for further investigation on the role of the two Islamic State (IS) cadres in the murder of SSI Wilson,” said an NIA source.

The source added that the investigation agency has to file a chargesheet against the arrested people who were booked under UAPA, within 180 days. “We would file a chargesheet before the special court for NIA cases at Poonamallee in Chennai. The electronic gadgets seized from the arrested people will be sent to forensic laboratory for further investigation,” the source said.

UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh after his re-election with CM Yogi Adityanath on Friday

LUCKNOW: Seeking to raise nationalist pitch, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev Singh on Friday said those who demean ‘Bharat Mata’ should be taught a lesson.

Talking to party workers after being reelected as UP BJP chief, Singh said, “Bharat Mata ke khilaf agar koi ek shabd bhi bola to uski zuban kheench li jayegi...”

Talking to TOI, Singh later clarified that he meant to say that party workers should teach a lesson to those who demean the country. “Party workers should have a cool mind and take party forward,” he added.

Singh was the only BJP leader to file nomination for the post of UP BJP president and his reelection was announced by BJP national general secretary Bhupendra Yadav in the presence of UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath at party headquarters.

“I will not hesitate to give my blood for a worker who toils to take the party ahead. This is not the time to lead a luxurious life but to work harder. A party worker should not be disappointed if he or she does not get a post. Posts of party leaders keep changing,” he said.

“Party workers may get angry with me but not with ‘Kamal’ (BJP’s election symbol) as it would amount to cheating the country,” Singh said. Mounting an attack on Congress, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party for calling RSS, the ideological fountainhead of BJP, a ‘Hindutva terror organization’, Singh said RSS was a pavitra (pious) organisation which gave seers to the country. “It is rather the opposition which is neck deep in corruption,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, CM Yogi said: “I hope that the BJP organisation will become stronger and more aggressive and help the party to achieve 3/4th majority in 2022 assembly elections.” “The present generation is lucky to see BJP moving to the top. Many generations of BJP leaders have struggled for this,” he said.

CHENNAI: Southern Railway officials have ordered a probe to check if workers at a food stall on Platform 7 at the Egmore station used water from the hydrant on railway tracks to prepare tea/ milk.

The action came after a video shot by a passenger, showing the stall worker fill a tea kettle with water from the hydrant, went viral on social media over the past two days. This led to users posting on social media that the water, sent to the toilets of trains, was being used to adulterate milk used for making tea and coffee.

On Friday evening, the divisional railway manager of Chennai tweeted that the stall was closed immediately pending an investigation. The tweet also clarified that the salesman had used the water only to refill the outer wall of a double-walled electric milk boiler and not for diluting the milk.

A senior official told TOI that rumours of ‘toilet water’ being used to make tea and coffee at railway stalls were false.

“The salesman seen in the video is filling water from the hydrant, which is supplied by Chennai Metrowater Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB). The same water is available in taps at stations as well,” the official clarified. However, the water cannot be used for mixing with water as it contains chlorine and that it would instantly spoil the milk.

“The water was being used only for the external jacket in the boiler that keeps the milk or tea warm,” the official explained.

For food preparation, only RO water sourced from cans should be used by licensees, the official said. “We conduct periodic checks to ensure there is no drop in quality,” the official said.

However, the official said there were shortcomings in the work habits of catering staff at these stalls. “We have instructed them to avoid such (filling water from hydrant) practices as the public will perceive this as wrong. But in this case, the salesman was lazy and did not go up to the tap to fill water,” he said.

It was the only stall on Platform 7 at Egmore station and ultimately, the passengers would stand to lose by its closure, he said.

BJP

MYSURU: BJP, which is at the helm in the state, is leaving no stone unturned to capture power at the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) despite the opposition — Congress and JD(S) — coming together to jointly fight the upcoming mayoral polls. Even though BJP functionaries are publicly stating that they are ready to sit in the opposition, they are working behind the scenes to engineer defections from JD(S).

As the election for the pivotal posts is scheduled on Saturday, both Congress and JD(S) have shifted their corportors to separate resorts on the outskirts of the city fearing poaching from BJP. They will be ferried directly from the resort to the council hall on the day of election.

However, BJP’s confidence seems to stem from the fact that former minister and JD(S) leader GT Devegowda has distanced himself from the party and moved closer to BJP. The saffron party leaders are hoping that Gowda’s supporters in the JD(S) will revolt and support BJP in mayoral polls.

Speaking to TOI, a JD(S) corporator, who is housed in the resort, said that the party high command fears that Devegowda may influence his supporters during the election.

“So the party has issued a whip to its corporators and warned action if they go against the party’s decision and involve in cross voting. The corporators, especially those who are close to Devegowda, are being watched closely,” the corporator said.

JD(S) MLA SR Mahesh, who visited the resort on Friday, asked the party corporators, who are being lodged from past two days, to stay together and work as per the direction of the high command.

“Earlier GT Devegowda was in charge of the district. But now he has decided to remain neutral. The party has instructed me to manage the election,” he said.

While sources in BJP said that they will adopt wait and watch strategy. “Till now we have not decided anything regarding trying to come to power with support from corporators from opposition parties. The leaders will discuss and take a decision,” said BJP city president BS Manjunath.

COIMBATORE: A kabaadi contest that was conducted near New Dhamu Nagar in Ammankulam here as part of Pongal celebrations took an ugly turn when a three-member gang stabbed a 23-year-old player for inducting guest players into his team on Thursday night.

The injured player is battling for life at the intensive care unit of the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). The Ramanathapuram police on Friday arrested one of the gang members in connection with the incident.

Police identified the victim as K Naveenkumar, of Slum Clearance Board Colony at Ammankulam. He has more than four assault and ganja peddling cases pending against him with the Race Course, Ramanathapuram and Saibaba Colony police stations.

An investigation officer said the match was organized by a section of youths from Ammankulam. “Naveenkumar included three guest players in his team and bagged the first prize.”

After the match, Naveenkumar and one of the guest players - Logeshwaran, 26, of Highways Colony on Trichy Road - went to New Dhambu Nagar to freshen up. Suddenly, R Vijayakumar, 23, of Rajivgandhi Street at Nehru Nagar in Vadavalli, his younger brother R Kannan, 21, and his friend A Hariharan, 21, of Jothipuram near Periyanaickenpalayam waylaid the duo and scolded Naveenkumar for preferring guest players to local youths.

“As they entered into a heated argument, Vijayakumar pulled out a knife from his pant pocket and stabbed Naveenkumar on his chest and abdomen five times. Logeshwaran also suffered a stab injury to on his hand while trying to save his friend. The gang fled immediately after attacking the duo,” the officer said.

Logeshwaran, meanwhile, rushed Naveenkumar to CMCH. Based on Naveenkumar’s complaint, the Ramanathapuram police registered a case against the trio under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 75 (i) (c ) of the Tamil Nadu City Police (TNCP) Act and arrested Vijayakumar on Friday. He was later lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison under judicial custody.

“Vijayakumar is facing more than five assault and ganja peddling cases in the city. We have formed a team to nab the remaining two, who are on the run,” the officer said.

As the saffron party bagged the Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency in the parliamentary elections held in 2019, the contest appears to be heading for an interesting finish.BJP’s charge is being led by Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar , while state minister Gangula Kamlakar is TRS’ go-to man in the civic body.

At the end of withdrawal of nominations, 363 candidates were left in the fray.Both BJP and TRS delayed giving nomination forms to aspirants till the last day as there was intense competition within the parties as well. Both Sanjay and Kamalakar were involved on war of words, with the MP strongly defending the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).In 2014, when the civic polls were conducted for 50 divisions, TRS won 24 wards, while Congress bagged 14 wards.

KOZHIKODE: Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fasal , the CPM workers who were arrested for the alleged links with Maoist’s, were using SFI and party as a cover, said CPM state committee member P Jayarajan .

Speaking at a session on ‘Maoism and Islam’ organized as part of the Kerala Literature Festival here on Friday, Jayarajan said Allan and Thwaha had tried to spread Maoist ideology in SFI.

“The Maoist document, Strategies and Tactics of Indian Revolution, asks Maoist cadres to set up party fractions in other organizations,” Jayarajan said adding that the youth were implementing the directions of the document.

The CPM leader said that the BJP government at the Centre handed over the case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) realizing that the state government will drop UAPA charges when the case would come for scrutiny.

Jayarajan also accused that the Popular Front of India (PFI) and the Jamaát-e-Islami are functioning as cover organization for Maoists in India. Jamaát representative participated in the meeting of the Committee for the Release of the Political Prisoners (CRPP), which is also the cover organization of the Maoists.

Jamaát-e-Islami leader C Dawood said the CPM raised the issue of Maoist-Islamist nexus when two of its cadres, who are Muslims, were caught by police. “This is the same tactics the CPM adopted to deflect the attention after the murder of T P Chandrasekharan.

BIJNOR: Despite setting up eight cages and installing over a dozen camera traps in Mohandiya jungles of Bijnor district , forest officials have still no luck with the ‘killer’ leopardess. Believed to have killed at least three persons and injured many more, the leopardess left the foresters flummoxed when she didn’t even go near any of the cages in the past, letting alone falling for the bait.

This comes even as the forest officials are conducting awareness drives in nearby villages to spread information about the dos and don’ts while going to the jungle or when they spot a leopard.

Panic has gripped the region following surge in leopard attacks. A group of angry villagers had recently killed a leopard and dragged its carcass all the way to their village when a 16-year-old boy was attacked and killed by the big cat.

The leopardess has got her pair and their movement was captured in camera traps in Mohandiya area. Forest authorities are visiting the place and checking footages captured in the cameras regularly.

On their routine visit to check these cages, the officials jumped with joy when they saw the cages from a distance and found them shut. As they reached closer, they found two stray dogs, who fell for the bait, trapped in the cages.

In their bid to lure the leopardess into the cage, the officials frequently changed the bait from chicken to mutton to a live goat but had no luck with the elusive big cat.

Bijnor divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “Two dogs were trapped inside cages on Thursday night. Our staff spotted them and freed them. They fell for the bait of chicken and mutton.”

Semmaran further said, “We have got tranquilizer gun from Meerut division on Friday. Moreover, we have arranged two drones also to search for big cat inside sugarcane fields.”

Notably, no picture of the leopardess was captured in camera traps in the past two days.

After the pipeline project is ready, the city is likely to get 2.8 TMC water from the Bhama Askhed dam

PUNE: The state government has set a month’s deadline to resolve the issues delaying completion of the Bhama Askhed pipeline project.

This was decided at a meeting chaired by Pune’s guardian minister, Ajit Pawar, on Friday. Sanctioned in 2013, the Bhama Askhed pipeline project was expected to be completed by July 2017. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) subsequently pushed the project deadline to January 26, 2020.

The PMC could not complete the project and its officials attributed the delay to the agitation by the farmers’ at the site. In December 2019, the civic administration had said it wanted to complete the pipeline and jackwell work of the pipeline project by March 2020.

After Friday’s meeting, it was decided that the PMC and the district administration have to complete the land acquisition process within a month. The work had stopped due to the agitation by farmers aggrieved over compensation.

“We have received directives to complete the compensation process within a month. We will coordinate with the district collector to get details of the beneficiaries. The disbursement of the compensation for their land will be done accordingly,” said Pravin Gedam, project-in-charge for the PMC.

A PMC estimate states that nearly 1,400 farmers have been affected by the pipeline project. The authorities have offered two options of compensation — one is in the form of cash and the other is allotment of new land. Gedam said the PMC has started disbursing cash as compensation and so far spent around Rs35 crore.

Once the project is ready, the city is expected to get 2.8 TMC water from the Bhama Askhed dam via the closed pipeline. The water is expected to meet the requirements of 14 lakh people living in areas along Ahmednagar Road.

The project will cost around Rs380 crore, of which nearly Rs280 crore have been spent. The civil work of the jackwell is complete. At present, work on power supply is on.

BAREILLY: With the arrest of eight people, including three women, police have solved the robbery bid that place on January 9 at exporter Dipanshu Gupta’s house at TDI City locality in Ramganga Nagar of Moradabad .

Four armed men had barged into the house but Gupta’s mother and wife foiled the robbery bid.

During investigation, police found that Guptas’ maid and her two sisters were allegedly involved. On Friday, eight of the suspects, including the three sisters, were arrested. Two cars and three countrymade pistols were seized from them.

Superintendent of police (city) Amit Kumar Anand said, “We have arrested eight of the suspects, including three women. Two of their accomplices – Babbu and Fakira – are on the run. We are conducting raids to nab them. We seized two cars and two countrymade pistols with cartridges from them. All accused have been sent to jail.”

According to police, on January 9, as many as four armed persons had barged into the house when there were only five people there – Gupta’s mother, Lata, wife Sonal, two kids and maid Shama. As soon as they entered the house, they took Lata hostage at gunpoint. She raised an alarm and Sonal locked herself in a room and informed police and her husband over the mobile phone.

Realizing that they could be caught, the robbers left the house. One of their accomplices was waiting in a car outside the house and they fled in it.

Police had registered a case under IPC section 398 (attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon) in that matter.

During investigation, police found that maid Shama had allegedly hatched the conspiracy along with her sisters, Saniya and Sabina, after she found out that the Guptas had gold in their house. The trio met one Babbu, an absconder who arranged five goons for committing the robbery.

The five miscreants were identified as Jitendra, Gopal, Dharmveer, Arjun and Raghunandan. Police are looking for their accomplices, Babbu and Fakira.

Five persons accused of killing a youth in the village were charged with murder and others section of IPC by the court last year. Soon after the death, two youths allegedly involved in the murder were caught and lynched by a mob in the same village. The three murders, coupled with vitriolic speeches made by the local leaders from almost all the political parties, set the communally-sensitive region on the fire.

According to the politicians’ lawyer Naqli Singh Tyagi, “Additional district and sessions judge Ram Shudh Singh announced January 27 for framing the charges against 10 accused on Thursday.”

Communal clashes in Muzaffarnagar and adjoining areas in August and September 2013 had claimed 60 lives and displaced over 40,000 people.

Leaders from various political parties-- BJP’s Suresh Rana, Umesh Malik, Kapil Dev Agarwal, Balyan, Kunwar Bhartendu; BSP’s Kadir Rana and Noorsalim Rana; Congress’ Saiduzzaman -- were booked for making inflammatory speeches.

VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh high court on Friday found fault with the state government for huge deployment of police force and imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 30 of AP Police Act and Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in villages of capital city Amaravati .

Hearing a batch of petitions moved by capital city farmers, the high court bench comprising Justice MV Sesha Sai and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy asked the state government why police told locals to carry identity cards.

Justice Satyanarayana Murthy said police had even troubled him when he was going in a private car. The bench observed that the police imposed too many restrictions and sought explanation from the government.

The high court questioned why policemen manhandled women protesters. The high court specifically pointed out the incident of a woman being kicked in her stomach by policemen wearing heavy boots.

Arguing on behalf of the state government, advocate-general S Sriram said promulgation of Section 30 of AP Police Act or Section 144 of CrPC in capital city villages was not new.

Both sections have been in force since 2015. The previous government extended the sections from time to time and the present government continued that in view of the prevailing law and order situation.

The advocate-general said all the photos that appeared in the media were not true. Some were morphed with images of incidents that took place in Bihar.

‘Let other countries try out Hyperloop first’

Longer routes on the anvil

PUNE: Deputy chief minister and district guardian minister Ajit Pawar on Friday directed Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) to explore the possibility of a new Metro line connecting Swargate and Hadapsar.Pawar held a meeting to review the Metro project in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad. At the meeting, Pawar told PMRDA officials to study both the elevated and “underground for the new route.“The Swargate-Hadapsar route is the need of the hour for the city and a feasibility study should be done for this route,” Pawar said, instructing officials to submit a report in a fortnight.Further, the deputy chief minister directed officials to change the proposed extension of the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar Metro route to Hadapsar — Pawar said the line should be extended to Kadamwak Vasti and said this would ease traffic woes in the city.PMRDA is executing the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar line on the public-private partnership basis. Pawar said the same model could be used for the extension. PMRDA had proposed the extension to Hadapsar last year, adding 12km to the 23.3km elevated route.This was part of the detailed project report proposed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which the PMRDA had approved in 2016. The original route — Hinjewadi-Shivajiagar — would have 23 stations, while the extension would require an additional 12. PMRDA officials said the average cost of each kilometre of Metro was around Rs260 crore, taking the cost of the extension at Rs3,000 crore.“Now, with a further extension, the cost would increase,” an official said.Pawar, when asked about the ambitious Hyperloop project, said the concept needs to be properly tested by other countries before it goes on trial in the state. “Unless the project is tried and tested, it cannot be implemented here,” he said.Also on Friday, the District Planning and Development Council (DPDC), at a meeting chaired by Pawar, cleared funds to the tune of Rs520.78 crore for 2020-21. At the meeting held at council hall, Pawar told officials to carry out repair works to schools and toilets on their premises. He also touched upon the traffic congestion issue and told officials to consult local authorities and solve the problem.Pawar said he was keen on extending the Vanaz-Ramwadi Metro line to Wagholi via Chandni Chowk. He further backed extending the PCMCSwargate line on both ends, making it a route from Nigdi to Katraj. The deputy CM further said the government would allocate Rs200 crore for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers affected by the Civil Court Metro station.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73349123,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-324889,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/dy-cm-wants-line-from-swargate-to-hadapsar/articleshow/73340670.cms

Pune: Deputy chief minister and district guardian minister Ajit Pawar on Friday told civic officials to study the feasibility of introducing the ‘Metro Neo’ service on the High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR).

‘Metro Neo’ — a hybrid of Metro, tram, bus and BRTS — runs on rubber tyres and is powered by overhead electrical cables.

At a meeting to review the ongoing projects of Pune Municipal Corporation on Friday, Pawar told a technical committee to submit a detailed proposal within a fortnight. The meeting was attended by NCP legislators Chetan Tupe and Sunil Tingre.

“I have told PMC to check if the road width can be reduced to 8 metres, as it would reduce the overall cost. I have discussed the same with the municipal commissioner and will ask BJP (the ruling party in PMC) to deliberate this,” Pawar said.

PMC has already said the cost of HCMTR was too high and that it needed to to explore financing options. Under the existing proposal, the HCMTR has two dedicated lanes for the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) and four lanes for private vehicles. The total width of the road has been proposed at 24 metres. PMC has not floated the tenders for the project yet.

BAREILLY: After a tiger mauled a 50-year-old man to death on Thursday in a sugarcane at Bojra village in the buffer zone of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve (DTR) in Lakhimpur Kheri district, forest officials have decided to use a drone camera to check if the big cat is hiding amid the cane stalks in the field.

Forest officials told TOI that farmers who want to harvest their cane can make a request to them to use a drone camera over their field to see if all is clear.

Deputy director, DTR (buffer zone), Anil Patel told TOI, “If any farmer wants to harvest the cane, he can inform our department. We will fly the drone camera over his field to check if any leopard or tiger is hiding there. Besides, flying a drone in the field will disturb the big cat living in cane field and it will move. The aim behind the exercise is to minimize man-animal conflict in the area. We are informing village heads that our team will help them.”

Forest department has identified 45 villages which are situated in the buffer areas of DTR as “sensitive”. Forest officials said the buffer team has one drone camera and if they need more, they will borrow from the DTR team. There are more than 20 tigers in DTR’s buffer zone.

A team of forest department officials had used the drone camera at Bojra village, under Bheera police station, on Friday to trace the tiger which had killed the farmer when he was working in the field. The forest staff also conducted an awareness programme among villagers. “Though we will use the drone if any farmer makes a request to us in this regard, we are informing the farmers that they should change the direction from which they start harvesting sugarcane to avoid conflict with big cats. For instance, they should not start cutting the crops from the side of the forest but from the opposite direction.”

Among the guidelines issued by the forest department to villagers living in proximity with the forests is to work in the fields in groups. They have been advised to sing or make noises while working in the field to scare away any big cat lurking nearby.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Nine months after elections were held in the state, the AP government is to yet clear rentals for vehicles used by officials to oversee polling. It owes about Rs 250 crore for vehicles requisitioned during polls.

Election Commission, which utilised the vehicles, said it has released funds to state government, adding it should clear the dues.

“We have already released Rs 250 crore to the state government. The government should disburse the amount through district collectors,” K Vijayanand, chief electoral officer, Andhra Pradesh, said.

Election Commission is legally empowered to take any vehicle for election duty after serving a notice to the vehicle owner under Section 160 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951. State officials took private vehicles for official use during the state assembly and Lok Sabha polls held in April 2019.

When the issue of non-payment of rentals was brought to the notice of district officials in Visakhapatnam despite the EC clearing the dues, they refused comment. “I can only say we have already verified the bills. But funds are yet to reach us,” a senior official from collector’s office in Visakhapatnam said.

Ghatpande practised as a doctor for 79 years in Pune, since 1941

PUNE: Balwant Ghatpande , one of the oldest practising physicians in the world, died of cardiac arrest moments after closing his clinic in Raviwar Peth on January 9. He was to turn 105 in March.

Ghatpande was climbing the stairs of his home situated just above the clinic when he suffered the cardiac arrest, his family members said.

Born on March 15, 1915, Ghatpande had received his medical degree during the British rule in 1941 from Pune’s BJ Medical School. He was perhaps among the few living doctors with Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery that he received in 1941. The degree was replaced with Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery at Bhore Committee’s recommendations in 1946.

Ghatpande had been practising as a doctor in the city since 1941, spanning an exceptional 79-year-long medical service to the community. “He left this planet while actively working, just the way he always wanted,” Ishita Ghosh, his grand-daughter-in-law, said.

Reminiscing, she said, “In all these years, he had been a complete workaholic. He exercised without fail. He loved hot and spicy food, although his meals had to be blended to a mush for a while now.”

Ghatpande had reversed his highly diabetic condition through sheer discipline and lifestyle changes. “Nothing that he did really conformed to what lifestyle gurus will tell you. One thing, however, remained unchanged all these years, he had never missed going to work in spite of life throwing whatever curve balls it wished to,” Ghosh said.

“Unfazed, stoic and with tremendous will power, he would go back to his clinic after briefly attending weddings, last rites, birthdays and other celebrations. When his wife passed away, he was at the examination table at his clinic soon after returning from the crematorium. Such was his dedication and commitment,” she recalled.

Ramchandra N Gaikaiwari (70), a family friend, said, “He was my father’s friend. He had a very sharp and unfailing memory. He would narrate past incidents with vivid details to us. Many would consider him to be a serious person by nature. In reality, he was, however, intrinsically witty and would often crack jokes.”

In an interview to TOI last year, Ghatpande had said he relied more on clinical assessment for arriving at a diagnosis. “I use stethoscope, take pulse rate and make use of my palms to sense a patient’s body type. This triad forms the core of my clinical diagnosis,” he had said.

He used to charge a patient only Rs 30 for consultation and this amount had remained the same for the last many years.

Ghatpande’s eldest daughter is 78-year old. “She is a psychiatrist and lives a retired life in the US,” his aide Mangesh Darje said, adding that his two sons were also doctors. While the elder one, Swanand, is 74-year-old, the other son, Sudhir, passed away in 2018 at the age 69 following illness. His wife also passed away five years ago at the age 92.

When asked about the secret formula for keeping fit, Ghatpande had stressed on staying busy. “There is no secret formula. You have to make your own formula and follow it religiously,” he had said.

BAREILLY: Winning a bet of drinking liquor proved too costly for a 55-year-old man as he died an hour later after returning home in a village in Izzatnagar area of Bareilly district on Friday morning.

Deceased Rajendra Singh, a farmer from Uganpur village, had placed a bet with his nephew, Pradeep, to drink four quarters of country-made liquor within 20 minutes in presence of nine others, including Singh’s son Dharmendra.

The loser was supposed to pay for all the eight quarters bought from a nearby shop. The liquor was brought by a youth named Khayaliram.

According to Dharmendra, his father emerged winner by finishing his quota of liquor within 10 minutes without adding water to it.

After an hour, he reached home, lied on a charpoy kept outside his house and slept. Sometime later, he started vomiting blood and died before getting any medical attention, Dharmendra said.

“I am not sure exactly what happened to my father after drinking alcohol. He was forced by Pradeep to place a bet and the liquor was brought by someone else. We have given a complaint to police to identify the reason behind my father’s death and take action against the guilty,” the deceased’s son, Dharmendra, told TOI.

SHO of Izzatnagar police station AK Verma said, “Prima facie, Rajendra died due to excessive drinking. We have sent the body for autopsy. We have detained Pradeep who is extremely drunk. But, he doesn’t appear to be guilty of poisoning Rajendra. We have recorded the statement of all the people present when the bet was placed between Pradeep and Rajendra. We are waiting for the autopsy report before coming to any conclusion.”

Manjinder Singh Sirsa won the 2013 assembly poll on his own party symbol, but lost the 2015 election.

NEW DELHI: BJP ’s all-weather ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) will contest four of the 70 seats in the upcoming assembly polls .

Incumbent MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa said he met senior BJP functionaries on Friday to seal the seat-sharing pact. While the decision that BJP will contest from 66 seats and leave four for its ally has already been taken, it is yet to be formally conveyed to the top leadership of the Sikh party. The two parties jointly contest the Punjab polls with a pre-decided seat-sharing arrangement.

Sirsa, who represents Rajouri Garden assembly constituency, said his party will contest from Rajouri Garden, Hari Nagar, Kalkaji and Shahdara seats where Sikhs and Punjabis are in a sizeable number. “We have already shortlisted our candidates. We will have a party meeting on Saturday in which the names will be finalised and announced,” he added.

SAD and BJP have been fighting the Delhi election together for quite some time now. The Sikh party always gets four candidates, though the constituencies change. While some of its candidates fight on the party’s election symbol, the weighing scale, some contest on BJP’s ticket.

Sirsa had won the 2013 assembly poll on his own party symbol, but lost the 2015 election. In the 2017 bypoll, he contested on the BJP symbol and won. He is likely to recontest from Rajouri Garden. SAD Delhi unit chief Harmeet Singh Kalka may contest from Kalkaji seat. He had won the 2013 election, but lost in 2015.

While there is no official confirmation, sources said AAP MLA Jagdeep Singh, who won both the 2013 and 2015 elections, may contest from Hari Nagar on a SAD ticket this time. He is among the 15 MLAs who were denied a ticket by AAP. From Shahdara, the party may field former MLA Jitender Singh Shunty, who had won the 2013 election. However, Sirsa said there are a couple more contenders and the final call will be taken on Saturday.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Friday issued notice to the state government in response to a petition filed by two activists, after city police denied them permission to them to hold a peaceful protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Khamasa Crossroads on Sunday.

Justice A Y Kogje sought a reply from the authority and posted a further hearing for Thursday. This led the petitioners to wait for the outcome of the litigation and postpone their programme from Sunday.

The petitioners – Mudita Vidrohi and Mujahid Nafees – approached the high court after city police did not take a decision on their application for permission to hold a protest against the CAA. The HC had ordered police to take a decision before Sunday so their application did not become infructuous.

On Wednesday evening, Gaekwad Haveli police station refused permission, saying that Khamasa is a congested area and people gathering there could create a law and order issue. The petitioners moved the HC again against this rejection, and claimed that it is their fundamental right to protest peacefully in this democratic country.

The petitioners’ advocate K R Koshti contended that the Lord Jagannath rath yatra has been passing through Khamasa every year for the last 130 years. More than one lakh devotees participate in the procession. Similarly, nearly 30,000 people participate in the procession of Eid-e-Milad every year, and this procession also passes through Khamasa. This area has never witnessed a law and order problem in the past.

In this petition too, the petitioners reiterated that the state administration immediately grants permission to the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) to hold demonstrations in support of CAA. There have been 62 such permissions granted to the ruling party, but the administration has been denying other people the permission to protest.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran defended the tweet on the official Kerala Tourism handle promoting a beef recipe, which triggered sharp reactions from several social-media users. The minister asserted that communally inclined people were behind this ‘malicious campaign’.

“Here in Kerala we don’t mix up food with religion. Kerala tourism has been promoting all kinds of Kerala delicacies including beef and pork. We don’t give any communal perspective to such promotions,” the minister told reporters here on Friday.

Pointing out that Kerala tourism was far ahead of tourism departments in other states in terms of its visibility on social-media platforms ‘thanks to its efficient marketing strategies’, the minister said tourists visiting the state ask particularly for dishes which are promoted on the internet. “Our marketing is a model for the whole world. Kerala Tourism has 18 lakh followers on Twitter, 35 lakh followers on Facebook and 2 lakh followers on Instagram,”’ he said.

Kerala Tourism’s Twitter handle on Wednesday had posted a photo of a ‘Beef Ularthiyathu’ dish with a link to the recipe. The tweet went viral and several people maintained that it was an insult to Hindus.

“Communal forces are trying to project that beef delicacies are made from cow meat, which is not true. Someone was asking if we promote pork dishes, which we have already done. We do such promotions, including those on art, culture, festivals and heritage of Kerala, besides our cuisine, on a regular basis,” the minister said, urging people to discard such false campaigns.

The discrepancy in the date of the issuance of the marriage certificate and the actual date of the wedding was holding her back in India. She was denied visa on this ground. The high court has quashed the marriage certificate and has ordered the authority concerned to issue a new certificate with the date changed on her application for the certificate.

In this case, Bhatt and Milind were to marry on December 11, 2017, upon Milind’s arrival in India. Milind’s grandfather’s health deteriorated on the day and the wedding rituals were postponed. Milind’s grandfather passed away on December 17, 2017, and the wedding took place on January 27, 2018.

Since the couple had applied for the marriage certificate on December 11, 2017, anticipating that the ritual would take place on the same day, the registrar of births, deaths, and marriages issued the marriage certificate on December 18, 2017.

After the marriage, when Bhatt applied for visa, the German authorities rejected her application on the grounds that the couple’s wedding had taken place on January 27, 2018, but the marriage certificate had been issued by the Indian authority 40 days earlier.

Bhatt applied to the registrar to rectify the marriage certificate. The request was rejected by the authority in September 2019 stating that the certificate was issued upon their declaration and they cannot ask for a correction at a belated stage.

This led Bhatt to approach the high court. Justice A Y Kogje observed, “The petitioner (Bhatt) is left without a remedy as on the one hand it cannot be said that Respondent No. 2 (registrar) has fallen in error, on the other hand, the date of marriage in the marriage certificate does not reflect the date of marriage accordingly. This is attributable to the factual prevalent circumstances in which petitioner has no role to play.”

The HC considered this a fit case to interfere. It quashed the registrar’s decision not to make changes in the marriage certificate, quashed the existing marriage certificate, and ordered the registrar to issue a new certificate with changed date upon Bhatt making a fresh application.

318,['18/01/2020'],Farmers from capital region seek more time to file grievances with CRDA,"This story is from January 18, 2020

People participate in bike rally organised by Amaravati Parirakshna Samithi JAC in Vijayawada on Friday

Vijayawada: Farmers from the capital region moved the high court with a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition seeking an extension to submit their grievances to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) over the proposed shifting of the capital from Amaravati. In their petition, the farmers argued that the CRDA has given them very little window of opportunity to submit their grievances.

The state government on January 14 told the farmers to submit their grievances to CRDA by Friday evening. However, the farmers argued that the time given to them was very little as three of the alloted days were holidays and on Friday—the last day to submit their grievances—they faced technical issues with the CRDA website.

The high court bench comprising Justice M V Sesha Sai and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy observed that sufficient time needed to be given to the farmers to respond to the notice issued to express grievances. Responding on behalf of the state government, advocate general S Sriram told the court that there was no issue with the CRDA website.

The advocate general further said that the CRDA had received more than 7000 grievances through various means. He said farmers had queued up at Thullur CRDA office to submit their grievances to CRDA officials. He told the high court that they do not have any problem to extend the time till Monday afternoon.

The farmers further argued in their petition that the CRDA had not given notices properly. “The notices should be given on what the government intends to do with the capital,” they said.

Taking the arguments of both sides, the high court directed the state government to extend the time till 2:30 pm on Monday to submit the grievances and posted the matter for further hearing on the same day.

Guntur: TDP MLC and Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman Payyavula Kesava has urged the Centre to intervene and address concerns about AP’s capital. He asserted that the Centre was duty-bound to protect the interests of the people.

Speaking to reporters here on Friday, Kesava said Amaravati may be a big issue for the state, but not for the Centre. “We request the Centre to play the elder brother’s role in resolving the issue of the capital city. The Centre is a stakeholder in the capital city and it can’t remain silent,” Kesava said.

He added that the BJP’s growth in the state depend, among other things, on how the party would tackle the issue. The Centre has taken bold decisions on many sensitive issues including Jammu and Kashmir, and so Amaravati was not a big issue for them, he said.

“BJP leaders have been speaking in different tones about the capital city issue. We expect them to jump into action at least after joining hands with Pawan Kalyan,” said Kesava. He said that BJP had failed to fulfil the promises on SCS and special package in the past and people were keenly watching for the Centre’s support at least on capital city issue.

He said that shifting of High Court was not possible without the Centre’s support and people were puzzled to know as to how YSRC leadership moved the proposal without having backing from the Centre.

Swachhata app is a citizen grievance platform to get feedback from people regarding the city's sanitation

BHUBANESWAR: Just about 7,500 people have downloaded the Swachhata app in the city this financial year, indicating a poor response from the public to the Centre’s cleanliness initiative. A city can earn 440 marks in Swachh Sarvekshan (cleanliness survey) if more people download the app.

The 440 marks for downloading the app is out of 1500 that has been set aside for citizen feedback under the survey. Swachhata app is a citizen grievance platform to get feedback from people regarding the city’s sanitation.

BMC sources said at least 15 per cent of the city’s population should download the app to fetch 440 marks. So far, 4.5 per cent people of the total 10 lakh population of the city have the app available on their smartphones. The app was launched by the Centre in 2016, but the evaluation as to how many people use it is done every year afresh.

Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) deputy commissioner (sanitation) Subhendu Sahu said to generate awareness among the people, the Swachh team from the BMC visit schools and colleges on a daily basis. “We have intensified the awareness drive so that more people use the app. The team helps the students download the app on their smartphones by giving them demonstration,” Sahu said. But he claimed they are hopeful that very soon they would achieve the target.

Bhubaneswar is one of the 4,830 cities participating in Swachh Sarvekshan (cleanliness survey) contest. In 2019, the city had slipped to 288 rank from 245 in 2018. It had lost considerable marks under the citizen feedback category as it couldn’t achieve the target of getting people to download the Swachhata app.

From 94th rank in 2017, when 500 cities were surveyed, the city had slipped to 288 last year as it lost around 1,000 marks due to poor solid waste management. There were several parameters and solid waste collection, disposal and processing plant were significant among them.

Recently, the BMC declared the city open defecation free (ODF++) for ensuring zero open defecation. A city can be declared as ODF++ on the basis of several parameters such as feedback from resident welfare associations, citizens, voluntary organisations, schools and college principals and other bodies. The city also has to ensure that it has enough public and community toilets to meet the requirement apart from effective feacal sludge management system.

The ODF ++ status is basically a self-declaration by BMC, which will later be validated by a central team from the ministry of urban and housing affairs (MoHUA) for according the status by a certification.

KOTTAYAM: Students of CMS College organized and protested against the unit committee of the SFI leading to a tense situation in the campus on Friday. Police were deployed in large numbers and the cops resorted to mild lathicharge to disperse the crowd outside the entrance of the college.

The students got together in the morning to protest against the attack on two second-year graduation students by SFI college unit leaders. The college management as well as teachers too came in support of the students. The students did not allow the SFI leaders who allegedly orchestrated the attack to enter the campus. Students in large numbers stood at the entrance gate shouting slogans and blocking the way for the SFI leaders.

The situation became tense as more and more SFI activists from other city colleges arrived at the scene and waited at the entrance. Following the intervention of police, holiday was declared for the college in the afternoon and students were asked to leave the campus. SFI unit office bearers who were waiting outside the gate were taken into custody and shifted into police bus. CPM district leadership held talks with police and the protesters were removed from the scene. SFI leaders who were taken into custody were later let off.

SFI leaders alleged that a ganja mafia is operating inside the campus. “They are attacking the students and the SFI will put an end to this,” they said.

The controversy that lead to the incident began during a recent college tour. Two students were suspended for allegedly attacking a SFI student during the tour. The suspended students were attacked by armed men allegedly under the direction of SFI leaders.

328,['18/01/2020'],Will Sahebrao walk with a prosthetic limb today?,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Nagpur: Even as the stage is set to for tiger Sahebrao to get a prosthetic limb, wildlife veterinarians, orthopaedic surgeons and forest officials are keeping their fingers crossed hoping for the experiment to be successful. The animal is now housed at the Gorewada rescue centre here.

Sahebrao, a 9-year-old male, will be fitted with an artificial limb on its left paw on Saturday by experts from MAFSU’s Wildlife Research & Training Centre (WRTC), city orthopedician Dr Sushrut Babhulkar and professor of orthopaedics in University of Leeds Dr Peter Giannoudis. Officials of Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra (FDCM) too will be present.

As reported by TOI earlier, Sahebrao will be the first tiger in the world to get an artificial limb. Earlier, it has been done for dogs and elephants. Sahebrao lost its paw on April 26, 2012 in a trap set by hunters outside Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Chandrapur district.

On Friday, experts and officials discussed the arrangements. “This being the first case on a tiger, we don’t know how the animal will react. The chances are 50:50,” said wildlife veterinarians.

“Tigers don’t even tolerate ticks on their body. Will Sahebrao adjust to the prosthetic? The first 10 minutes post recovery will be very crucial to see whether the tiger feels comfortable or not,” they said.

“The artificial limb should reduce pressure on its other three legs. If the tiger does not respond well to the prosthetic, we may have to take it into a trap cage and then remove it,” said experts.

Sources said designing a prosthetic limb is a complex process. Sahebrao’s limb has been prepared under the guidance of Dr Babhulkar with technical know-how from Germany’s AO Foundation, well-known name in fracture fixation of humans and animals.

The carbon fibre limb made for Sahebrao is strong and durable, and weighs only 1.5kg. It is covered with foam padding for comfort and is skin-coloured. It will be fitted with screws so that the tiger is unable to remove it.

The operation will start by administering anaesthesia to the tiger at 8am and will last or over two hours. In case the tiger removes or damages the prosthetic while attempting to walk, it will have to be tranquillized again.

The decision to fit Sahebrao an artificial limb was taken on February 3, 2018 when Dr Babhulkar adopted the tiger. The first step to fit an artificial limb started in August 2018 by taking 12 X-rays and blood samples of the limb.

After clinical examination it was found that the fracture had caused non-union of bones in three places. There was a painful scar formation and its fifth toe was damaged and was affecting the 200kg tiger’s walking.

Based on the radiology reports, a team of WRTC experts operated on Sahebrao on October 9 for neuroma and arthritis, and took measurement for prosthesis. Post-surgery, Sahebrao’s surgery wounds have healed and pain has apparently reduced drastically.

“After fitting the artificial limb, vets will be monitoring Sahebrao regularly. Gorewada officials will have to ensure that the tiger doesn’t gain weight or else it will make the prosthesis ineffective,” say wildlife vets.

SATURDAY PLAN

* Sahebrao will be tranquillized around 8am

* It will be fitted with the artificial limb by WRTC experts and orthopedicians

* The experts will watch the movement of tiger post revival whether it is walking normally

* If the tiger feels uncomfortable and removes the prosthetics than it will have to be again tranquillized to remove the limb

* Entire process from giving anaesthesia to reversing it and observing the tiger respond will take more than 2 hours

Bhubaneswar: The state government has decided to broadcast messages related to the amended Motor Vehicles Act as fillers and through radio jingles for the next six months.

The move aims to create awareness about the consequences of violating the new traffic rules.

“The M/S UFO movies has already submitted a proposal for the screening of fillers related to road safety in cinema halls following a Supreme Court directive. We have decided to implement it not only in cinema halls, but also in radio channels,” a transport department official said.

Apart from this, the state government has also decided to make a video on road safety and broadcast it near educational institutions. The objective is to make students aware about under-age driving and other traffic violations.

Meanwhile, the state government will also set up a control and command centre where people can call and get answers to queries about the amended road safety rules.

“The command centre will not only address the queries of the general public, but also help enforce the new rules through a camera surveillance system. We have already initiated the process of setting up the command centre,” the official said.

NEW DELHI: Laxmi Nagar has an unenviable image. It not only has perhaps the highest population density in Delhi, but it also struggles with a multiplicity of urban woes — unregulated constructions, massive encroachment, unchecked commercialisation, deplorable sanitation and inadequate infrastructure. Walk around in Ganesh Nagar, Pandav Nagar, Laxmi Nagar or Shakarpur and you will find electricity wires dangling dangerously overhead, a sight that sends a chilling warning of the disaster that could overtake the overcrowded, ill-appointed localities crammed with humanity.While some voters in the Laxmi Nagar assembly constituency argue that little has been done to improve conditions in the past 5-7 years, others reason that the region is so overcrowded so to render any overhauling of infrastructure in a single legislative term impossible. Satish Gupta, a Laxmi Nagar resident, said with conviction that it would be unfair to expect the MLA to widen roads, lay sewer lines or remove encroachments in five years.“AAP has worked hard regarding education, water supply, electricity and roads and I have seen major change in the state of the school building where my son studies,” Gupta said. “The government has also impartially considered residents’ issues.

332,['18/01/2020'],Kolkata: Romanian gang’s Gaya aides held,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Cloned ATM cards seized from the accused.

KOLKATA: The second Romanian skimming gang members may be behind the bars but their Indian counterparts — Gaya gang members — are still in operation across the city. Kolkata Police arrested two Gaya residents, Mudassar Khan and Irfanuddin, on Thursday night for allegedly duping senior citizens on the pretext of helping them withdraw money from the ATM kiosks where security guards were not present.

The duo landed in the police net from Sealdah station where they had come to catch Darjeeling Mail.

The second modus operandi of the Gaya gang left the police more worried.

The accused took the help of restaurant staff and tipped them a fixed amount every time they accepted a card and swiped it on behalf of diners. “The duo used skimming machine that they had bought online for around Rs 6,000. Using the machine, they copied the diner’s personal data from the ATM card and uploaded it in a computer,” said joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.

According to the police, the duo used to operate in several restaurants situated at Jadavpur, Garfa, Kasba and Tiljala. Sources said that nearly 38 cloned cards had been recovered from the possession of the accused.

Cops seized a laptop from them and found that more than 300 customers’ data had been stored in it.

Besides, cops recovered a skimming device and a magnetic stripe reader writer used to copy data on the duplicate card. This is the second time Gaya-based skimming racketeers were nabbed in the city.

The accused had prepared cloned cards with the stolen data and withdrew money, using the PIN numbers from other ATM booths in far off places. “They were staying in the city with their families at rented houses in Jadavpur and Tiljala. But they would travel to Siliguri, Darjeeling, Kurseong and Shillong to withdraw the money,” said Sharma.

After the skimming the accused would make two transactions — one before midnight and the other after 12am. This allowed them to make maximum withdrawals for two consecutive days, according to a police officer. The police are trying to establish the money trail to ensure that a stronger chargesheet can be made against the accused.

“Establishing the money trail will help us know how the accused had parked their money. It will also help us reach the gang leader who is probably operating outside the state,” added the officer.

Students gather at Freedom Park on Friday

BENGALURU: A 48-hour hunger strike, organised at Freedom Park on Friday evening in memory of Hyderabad Central University student Rohith Vemula, who committed suicide four years ago alleging discrimination, threatened to snowball into a confrontation between students and police. The students, however, vacated the venue later in the night after much cajoling and pressuring by police.

Over 100 protesting students left the venue around 9.30pm, calling off the two-day strike.

The silent stir began around 7pm, with students paying tribute to Vemula by lighting candles. They sat in groups, with some of them singing shayaris. Slogans hailing azadi and crticising BJP and the RSS rent the air.

The number of participants kept growing through the evening. Though they had no police permission, the organisers had told the students that they be prepared to get detained and that legal aid would be provided.

Though there was no permission, west division police said students could stay at the venue till 9.30pm but not beyond. However, the youths said they were ready to be detained and insisted on continuing with the strike for the next 48 hours.

Though the organisers agreed to the condition laid down by police, the youngsters appeared restive and determined. However, the organisers were able to convince them to leave the place.

Representative image

BENGALURU: If you thought ranting about poor customer service on social media could get you a quick response, think again: you could even fall prey to online fraudsters.

A city-based cybersecurity specialist lost Rs 50,000 when he took to Twitter to complain about a bank after multiple attempts to recharge his FASTag wallet failed. A complaint to this effect was lodged with Hennur police on Wednesday. This is the first online fraud being reported in the city with FASTag as the bait.

The victim, Nikhil (name changed on request) of Banaswadi, told TOI: “On January 11, I raised a complaint on Twitter about problems with recharging FASTag issued by Axis Bank. The bank staff responded and sought the registered number and contact details. In my response, I provided my contact details. On January 13, I got a call from a person who claimed to be from Axis Bank’s customer helpdesk.”

Nikhil took it to be a genuine response. “The caller sent me a link through SMS which said, ‘Axis Bank — FASTag form’ and asked me to provide a few details in order to activate my FASTag wallet. In the form, I provided details like my full name, registered mobile number and Unified Payment Interface (UPI) PIN. I thought the application itself served as a point of recharge. I typed the PIN and submitted it. Subsequently, I was told that the helpdesk had generated a one-time pass (OTP) which was sent to my phone. The caller told me to send the OTP to a different number and I did accordingly.”

The moment Nikhil shared the OPT, he got a notification stating Rs 5,000 had been debited from his account. “I realised someone had hacked my UPI and was transferring the money. I quickly logged into my account and tried to block it, but it was too late. They had already withdrawn Rs 50,000 from my HDFC account and Rs 750 from my ICICI Bank. The UPI was linked to both the accounts.”

Nikhil said he should have been more cautious and not shared the UPI PIN. “They withdrew money in less than eight minutes. I was able to save Rs 30,000 by transferring the amount to a different account before they could lay their hands on it,” he added.

Nikhil started probing on his own and collected details pertaining to the fraud before approaching police. “Miscreants were sending these forms sitting in West Bengal and siphoning off money,” Nikhil said and added: “I have learnt a lesson. I appeal to others not to fall prey to scamsters.”

Nagpur: Shrichandra Srivastava (78), who retired as a class one officer from the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) in 2001, never made a nameplate in his career spanning 39 years. Though it was a matter of pride for people working in government departments between the 1960s and the 1990s, Srivastava kept himself away from the honour for want of the title ‘Dr’.

On January 18, the Srivastava family’s 58-year-old wait will end when Nagpur University (NU) formally confers the doctorate of philosophy (PhD) on him during its 107th convocation at Suresh Bhat Auditorium at 10.30am on Saturday.

Srivastava is probably the oldest student in the history of the university to get a PhD, which will fulfil his long-cherished dream of using ‘Dr’ before his name.

“We have ordered the nameplate and it will be a surprise for papa when we return from the ceremony on Saturday afternoon,” said Ashish, Srivastava’s eldest of the three sons.

Srivastava’s first attempt to pursue PhD under the then Laxminarayan Institute of Technology (LIT) professor SP Sangal came undone in 1982 when he had to give it up within a year because of his busy work schedule and frequent foreign tours.

With the passage of time, Srivastava got promoted and became busier due to the new challenges in mining and exploration. He was hard up for time to do his PhD research.

“I spent two months on the high seas of the Indian Ocean for manganese exploration. IBM had nominated me for this assignment in the 1980s. In 1985, I was sent to The Netherlands and later, to France for training. Very often I had to travel to Bangalore to analyse samples,” Srivastava said.

After retirement, Srivastava dropped his PhD plans and started teaching at NU’s department of geology as a visiting faculty. Till 2014, he taught students techniques to analyse ores and minerals.

“One of my students, Alka Humne, who now teaches in the same department, prodded me to register for PhD. We went to the department of chemistry and started the process under professor LJ Paliwal who guided me,” he said.

A determined and resilient Srivastava overcame every hurdle that came his way. While researching, writing thesis and attending the viva-voce, Srivastava battled ill health, exertion and a minor heart attack with a lot of guts and gumption.

Despite wanting to pursue further studies, Srivastava had to migrate to the city in 1961 after completing his BSc (chemistry, geology and geography) from Banaras Hindu University. “In 1962, on the basis of my geology background, I got a job with IBM as a core inspector. Later, I did my diploma from the Institution of Chemists in analytical chemistry,” he said.

As his diploma was not recognized by NU, Srivastava took leave without pay and did his MSc in Chemistry. His wife Nilu is also an NU student. She did her MA in Sanskrit from the campus.

Srivastava’s study is about preventing soil and water pollution and also winning the values. “The developed terpolymers can uptake the metal ions through chelation (bonding of ions) and adsorption.

NU plays spoilsport

Shrichandra Srivastava’s accomplishment of completing PhD at the age of 78 has been marred by Nagpur University’s apathy. The NU’s exam section has failed to recognize him as the rightful claimant for the Vitthalraoji Jibhkate Award which is conferred on those completing PhD after the age of 65. Though the NU has no specific guidelines for the award, it has announced another candidate, aged about 66 years, as the recipient. Srivastava said he wasn’t aware of such an award which called for an application. TOI has been consistently highlighting the fact that NU does not have a method in place to identify real toppers or award winners.

Nagpur: A 25-year-old alleged woman thief, Purnima Kamde alias Pinky, a MEd degree holder, argued her own case before the magistrate and outdid the lawyers arguing for the cops in court on Thursday. Suspecting Purnima’s involvement in more offences than the 15 already detected, the cops had applied to obtain her remand custody for the third time. However, the educated thief managed to convince the magistrate that the investigating agency does not deserve any further opportunity.

Purnima was sent to jail by the magistrate after the Tehsil police team was denied remand custody following her cunning arguments in court.

The police had arrested Purnima on January 7 and recovered stolen properties worth more than Rs21.01 lakh from her residence at Palora in Parseoni tehsil. They said she was to get married soon to a suitor from Ramtek, and was keeping the stolen booty for the expenses. After the Tehsil police exposed Purnima’s crimes, the suitor has backed out of the marriage.

She had been arrested in 2016 too by Sitabuldi police after being caught red-handed. She nabbed red-handed by citizens recently while trying to steal valuables from a woman at Sarafa Market, Itwari, but she had managed to flee by pretending to be an educated and respectable citizen.

However, Tehsil police team had been alerted and managed to nab her. The Tehsil police team under PI Ajaykumar Malviya had unearthed 52 tola gold worth Rs17.80 lakh, kept in a tin container in Purnima’s kitchen.

Police feel Purnima may be a kleptomaniac as she said during interrogation that she feels a strong urge frequently to steal things.

The third among five siblings, Purnima belongs to a family of farmers. Purnima owned a tailoring unit and under its garb she used to steal purses in busy market localities like Sitabuldi, Itwari, Khaparkheda, Ramtek, Parseoni etc. She can speak English and keeps receipts of some jewellery shop ready in her purse to show in case she is caught with some stolen jewellery.

Senior PI Malviya said she had tried to hoodwink police but her lies were exposed during a search of her place. Police recovered 15 mobile phones, a dozen wrist watches and cash Rs52,387 from her residence. “She would steal purses from inside bags in busy streets or shops. She kept all the valuables at home and had not gone to dispose them for money,” he said.

The investigation team comprised Second PI Dilip Sagar, PSI Swapnil Wagh, head constables Laxman Shende, Pramod Ghate, Pravin Manapure and others under the supervision of Zonal DCP Rahul Maknikar.

M K Kanimozhi

KOCHI: DMK leader and MP from Tuticorin, M K Kanimozhi said it is women who have to bear the brunt of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Inaugurating a women’s meet against CAA organized by the Muslim Educational Society (MES) at Ernakulam Town Hall on Friday, Kanimozhi said land title deeds would be the most important proof that they would take into consideration. “I want to ask you how many women in India have title deeds of land in their name?” she said.

Criticizing the RSS, Kanimozhi said it is not an organization just against Muslims. “It is an organization against anybody who thinks India is a secular country,” she said.

The Act which provides citizenship to persecuted communities like Hindus, Christians and Parsis left out Muslims and atheists, she said. “I am an atheist, I would be affected as much as you are. I don’t have God, I don’t have religion. I would be affected as much as you are,” she said.

She also flayed the AIADMK for supporting CAA in Parliament. “If AIADMK had voted against this bill in Rajya Sabha, it would not have passed. I am upset, annoyed and hurt that a so-called Dravidian party supported this discriminatory bill. If they had not supported this bill, we would not have met here to protest it,” she said.

Kanimozhi also had words of praise for the Pinarayi Vijayan government. “You cannot protest in Tamil Nadu because it is not the AIADMK government which rules but the shadow of BJP government. But people of Kerala , you chose well, you made a sensible decision. Today one of the strongest voices against CAA comes from your CM,” she said.

People gather at the accident site

BHUBANESWAR: A day after the Mumbai (LTT)-Bhubaneswar Lokmanya Tilak Express derailed in Cuttack district, Abhai Kumar Rai, commissioner of railway safety (CRS), south-eastern circle, Kolkata, visited the accident site on Friday before starting his inquiry into the incident.

At least 24 passengers, including five women and two children, were injured when the train derailed after hitting a stationary goods train between Salagaon and Nergundi stations on Thursday morning.

Rai discussed with railway officials about the accident. He also met the injured passengers undergoing treatment at SCB Medical College and Hospital, Cuttack. As many as 21 passengers were admitted to the hospital on Thursday.

Out of which, 11 of the injured persons are getting treatment in the hospital on Friday. Their health condition is stable, hospital sources said.

The CRS will formally start his inquiry into the train accident case at Cuttack from Saturday. Any person having knowledge of the accident can give evidence to the commission on the date of inquiry, said JP Mishra, chief public relations officer of East Coast Railway (ECoR).

The affected railway line due to the derailment was cleared late on Thursday night. Train services were normal on the route on Friday, said ECoR official sources.

The ECoR has already issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for field staff to tackle fog condition during winter. Sources said the staff concerned had not followed this SOP on Thursday.

According to the SOP, the train driver should have reduced the speed limit to around 8 km per hour to tackle the dense fog condition in the morning. But the speed of the Lokmanya Tilak was high, said a senior railway officer. “However, the speedometer of the train can reveal the answer about the speed,” said the officer.

Another railway officer said the Lokmanya Tilak train is equipped with Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches. These coaches are designed to prevent coaches from crumpling and piling on top of each other in case of accident. It ensures safety of passengers in accidents. Had these been conventional coaches, scale of the tragedy would have been bigger, said the officer.

CHENNAI: A year down the line, you could grab a coffee, lounge on a lawn watching cars zip past some of the busiest stretches and then board a metro train or drive away in your car parked in an underground lot.Three infrastructure projects being built by Chennai Metro Rail Limited ( CMRL ) are taking shape at Central, Shenoy Nagar and Guindy. These complexes — which will have parking, food courts, entertainment options and integrate multiple modes of transport — will be complete by the end of this year.If Central Square will boast of a 30-storey plaza, there will be an underground passenger amenities centre with a mini-mall in west Chennai at Shenoy Nagar and an urban square for south Chennai at Guindy. The facilities are being developed to generate additional non-ticketing revenue for CMRL.“The landscaping on street level above Central metro will begin after Pongal holidays. In six months, there will be lawns and greenery. The underground parking at Central will be ready in a year and the one at Shenoy Nagar by March 2021. The Kathipara project will be completed this year,” said a metro rail official.Amid public outrage, the underground centre below Shenoy Nagar’s Thiru Vi Ka park, which lost more than 138 trees to make way for the station, is taking shape. Construction slowed down when residents, concerned over losing their only green space, moved court to stop work. Officials said work has picked up pace after the court ruled in CMRL’s favour.“Shenoy Nagar will become like Anna Nagar in a few years and we want to have a facility which people can utilise. We will begin restoration of the park after construction is complete,” an official said.Laying the foundation for the 30-storey central plaza is underway. It will double up as an underground parking facility. The square will be a multi-modal hub for commuters who can park vehicles and board buses, trains or metro trains. Work is on to build two new pedestrian subways that will link the government hospital with Central station and Evening Bazaar Road. “Central Square will be an identity for the city. It will decongest the road by taking the pedestrian crowd underground and by providing space for vehicles parked on the road,” an official said. Kathipara will become a multi-modal hub linking Alandur and Guindy metro stations , Guindy suburban railway station, and Alandur and Guindy bus stops.But experts said CMRL should invest more on last-mile connectivity that will encourage people to use public transport. “Central Square is a great opportunity to seamlessly integrate long-distance trains, metro and sub-urban rail, and buses. But destroying a park to build off-street parking is outdated. Paris followed such old-school principles in the 1960s, but today it is reducing parking requirements.

CM Naveen Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Friday asked each bureaucrat to share one transformational game-changing idea with him directly to improve the governance and delivery of public services.

Addressing the bureaucrats at the senior officers’ conference, the first of its kind meet, that was attended by all secretaries, all collectors and all IAS officers , Naveen also administered the pledge to the officers with the message that people are the masters. The pledge was in accordance with his government’s new governance model — Mo Sarkar.

“I have a family of 4.5 crore people of Odisha. With their blessings, I am serving them for the last 20 years. I want our children to have quality education. Our brothers and sisters to have good jobs. Our elders to have good healthcare facilities,” said Naveen, while hailing the bureaucrats as the drivers of this transformation agenda.

Though the state government generally holds annual conference of district collectors, the first conference in Naveen’s fifth term was held in a different and inclusive manner. Instead of only collectors, officers right from the rank of chief secretary to junior IAS officers (sub-collectors) attended to brainstorm on emerging issues pertaining to governance.

“It was conceptualised as a platform for all officers to discuss challenges of public service delivery in the next five years,” said an officer in the know.

“Though a lot of development has taken place in various sectors in the past two decades there are emerging challenges before us like urbanisation, rapid industrialisation, mobility and climate change. We need new technologies and new professionalism to tackle these issues. The young officers, who have joined services recently, will be in lead positions in the next few years,” said chief secretary Asit Tripathy.

Though senior officers used to speak on governance issues in the previous conferences, the district collectors, divided in groups, spoke in length on different subjects like livelihood issues and governance options, healthcare, school education, women empowerment and challenges in service delivery on the ground.

Issues on which the group of secretaries brainstormed earlier on the day include new-age technology and innovation. Experts were also part of the discussions.

Good ideas generated during the discussions by group of secretaries and group of collectors will be compiled by the general administration department. A report in this regard will be submitted to the chief minister by January 22, said the chief secretary.

Ganjam collector Vijay Amrut Kulange, a young officer, said it was a good platform for idea sharing. “We got some good inputs from senior officers during the presentations. From our side also, some of the senior collectors deliberated on key issues. We got a lot of guidance,” Kulange told TOI.

After a day-long deliberation, the officers headed for an off-site session at the ongoing Konark Eco-Retreat. On Saturday, the officers would attend the Odisha Knowledge Hub lecture series to be delivered by Ramesh Ramanathan, co-founder, Jana Group.

Kolkata: Over a century-old IBM has kick-started the process to transform itself into a major artificial intelligence ( AI ) player in consonance with the rising demands from international business giants. The computer hardware major is eager to gain a foothold in the Indian market by reaching out to leading companies here with a new business model based on data strategy.

Inderpal Bhandari, global chief data officer of IBM, told TOI that currently, IBM’s clientele in the data business sector stems from about 19 business sectors, including banking, finance, supply chain and retail. The internal business assessment shows growth of revenues in cloud and cognitive software segment and global business services provided by IBM, which has been on a “digital reinvention mode”.

“The ladder to AI enterprise is our prescriptive approach to enable clients to link data with AI in a unified platform. This also helps them understand where to put more focus on their business,” said Bhandari, who flew down to the city on Monday for the Indo-French workshop on data science (statics and AI) at Indian Statistical Institute (ISI).

On IBM’s future business plans pertaining to data strategy, Bhandari added, “In the changing business world, data can fetch revenues to any technology giant like IBM when it is monetised. With the new concept of data strategy, new products can be rolled out. We are placing our bets on being the world class leader in AI and hybrid multi-cloud business.”

However, Bhandari called for a change in the workflow of leading business firms across India. “There is no denying the fact that the concept of AI is not clear to many people. But it is time for all to realize that the new system can simplify a business process by saving time and resources,” said Bhandari.

As for the Personal Data Protection Bill introduced in Parliament in December, last year, Bhandari said, “We welcome the decision and look forward to a progressive bill that strikes a balance and protecting privacy and harnessing data and technology to expand the economic opportunity for the people of India.”

Pachauri’s music videos, uploaded on YouTube, are sponsored by a well-known music company.

NEW DELHI: This 22-year-old not only faked a job proposal from Delhi Metro Rail Corporation and a certification from Indian Engineering Services, but also used them as a means to arrange for funds for his music album. He went around telling people that he could help them get “secure jobs” with DMRC. Instead, he pocketed the money thus accumulated to further his music dreams.

The accused, Prafull Pachauri aka Honey, was arrested by Delhi Police recently. Pachauri had even got an article published in a local newspaper in Uttar Pradesh to gain publicity. His music videos, uploaded on YouTube , are sponsored by a well-known music company.

Police said Pachauri belonged to Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. DMRC had approached the cyber unit of Delhi Police about the fraud. As police started investigations, they got on the trail of mails being sent through a spoofing application, the developer of which they had arrested in the last week of December.

As the probe progressed, it was found that Pachauri had got a profile of himself published in a local Hindi newspaper, wherein he claimed to have cleared Indian Engineering Services. He also boasted about his songs that had been uploaded on YouTube.

“After the article was published, he used an email spoofer application to send a message to a well-known music company claiming that the newspaper would be the official sponsor for his album. He also showed emails ostensibly received from DMRC and UPSC to claim that he had been selected for the post of a junior engineer with DMRC and also cleared IES,” a police officer said.

To earn a quick buck, Pachauri duped people by promising them jobs in DMRC. He sent them mails using the spoofing application to claim that their jobs had been confirmed. He duped at least four people of Rs 70,000, police said. The only child of his parents, Pachauri had indeed completed his electronic engineering from a university in Greater Noida, an officer revealed.

In December, police had arrested Rupesh Bhandari, the developer of the spoofing application from Bengaluru. Even though the application has been disabled, it can still be viewed on Google Play Store.

Publishers said they put extra effort to make covers of children’s books interesting

CHENNAI: ‘Don’t judge a book by its cover’ is a cliché and passé. Gone are the days of bland book covers . With the modern reader spoilt for choice, publishers are going the extra mile to bring out books whose crisp pages are bound by sharply designed covers.

Thousands of titles at the book fair at YMCA, Nandanam, highlight the trend.

Publishers said covers played a significant role in attracting readers. G Dasarathan, a publisher, said design components are given equal mileage. “People expect white pages over dull yellow book prints. We give attention to a cover because it is one of the most important elements and adds value to the book,” he said.

Tamil titles are printed on book print quality paper ranging from 70 to 100 grams per square metre (GSM) depending on the content. As higher GSM increases the price of a book, several publishers attempt to stick to lesser GSM. While maplitho paper is used for print, book covers get glossy and matte lamination. Publishers also spend about 15% of the total expenses on design elements.

A Hendry, employed at a publishing house and associated with printing books for 15 years, said several elements, including colours, make a good book cover. “This is essential in kids’ books. Design is important to attract readers,” he said.

The impact is such that a biography publisher has replaced the portrait of the subject on the cover after observing that a graphic design will appeal more. Light weight paper is preferred as it reduces a book’s volume.

Vellore resident P Vijayan, who visited the fair, said attractive covers influence his purchase. “When I buy books for my children, I am drawn by the cover and then skim through it to have an idea on content,” he said.

File photo of former Delhi law minister Jitender Singh Tomar

NEW DELHI: Terming it a “corrupt practice”, Delhi high court on Friday set aside the of former state law minister Jitender Singh Tomar as an MLA in 2015 for furnishing false information of his educational qualification.

The court held as “void” the election of the AAP member since he had made a false declaration that he had an LLB degree. Later, a probe found the degree was a fake one.

The bench said that Tomar — who has again been declared an AAP candidate from the same Tri Nagar constituency — “lied qua his/her educational qualification and vocation”, which resulted in “inducement and thwarted free exercise of electoral right of the voter.”

Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw noted that as a citizen and elector, “I would want the election of the candidate who had lied qua his/ her educational qualification and vocation, to be set aside.”

Since Tomar was not a graduate and ineligible for the three-year LLB programme, his law degree cannot exist, the court pointed out in a 40-page judgement, allowing the plea of BJP member and rival candidate Nand Kishore Garg, who had challenged the election.

HC further observed that Tomar “published statements of fact that were false to unduly influence the voters, which amounts to a corrupt practice.” It noted that the AAP politician didn’t obtain a valid law degree nor was he properly enrolled as an advocate at the time of filing his nomination, adding that his nomination was improperly accepted.

“On first principles, without adverting to law, I, as an elector, would feel cheated if the candidate I vote for and who is elected, is ultimately found to have made a false representation while canvassing his candidature and particularly qua his/her educational qualification and profession/vocation,” Justice Endlaw noted.

The court said Tomar’s graduation — BSc programme from Avadh University — was also fabricated and Garg was successful in disproving Tomar’s claim, observing “educational qualification and vocation/profession is a significant part of one’s persona. A person is assessed by others, in the initial interaction, by his/her educational qualification and vocation and only after making an initial breakthrough, may in the course of subsequent interactions, be assessed by other facets of his/her persona.”

It said election is purely and simply a statutory right and once Tomar is found to have been elected in violation of the statute, he cannot be permitted to remain elected.

“Moreover, need to maintain the purity of the stream of elections is the need/right, not only of the petitioner, but of the other citizens as well and once it is found that the respondent has secured his election by violating the statute, the election cannot be permitted to stand, irrespective of whether the petitioner who has challenged the election is estopped from doing so,” the court held.

It said unless Tomar felt that he would be able to influence the electors to vote in his favour by representing himself to be an advocate, there was no need for him to say so and he could have claimed to be having the qualification of senior secondary school certificate, which he alone held.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As Kerala turns out to be the political epicentre of protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act, BJP leaders from Kerala have rallied behind state governor Arif Mohammad Khan who has proved himself to be the most vocal advocate of CAA in the state.

Putting his weight behind the governor, Union cabinet minister V Muraleedharan said the governor did nothing wrong by going public about his difference of opinion with the state government. “Nobody is above law. The governor has only reminded the same. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan who chose to lock horns with governor, an expert in law and constitution, must be penitent now. He must now be aware about the futility of having so many advisers. The governor needs no support of the Centre. He has the support of the President of India,” Muraleedharan said. Mizoram governor and former BJP state president P S Sreedharan Pillai too expressed support to his Kerala counter part by saying that the governor was only talking sense.

Kummanam moves Supreme Court

Meanwhile, BJP former state president Kummanam Rajasekharan approached the Supreme Court on Friday, urging the apex court to direct the Kerala government against utilising public money for challenging a central act. The governor, who is constitutional head in the state, was in favour of the CAA and the state government had kept the governor in dark while filing a suit against the Centre, Kummam told the court. He wanted the SC to direct Kerala government to recoup the expenses for suit from the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues.

“There is no legal dispute between Centre and Kerala government with regard to CAA. The difference is only political. The state government has not clarified how the amendment would affect Kerala.

Shibani Gulati, who underwent a

kidney transplant

a decade ago

MUMBAI: Two years after Pune youngster Shreya Siddanagowda became the country’s first patient to undergo a bilateral upper hand transplant , she will attempt the Dream Run at Sunday’s Mumbai Marathon to help get new hands for Monica More—the Kurla resident who as a 16-year-old lost both her arms in a 2014 railway accident.“Shreya wants people to know that hand transplants are a reality. Even transplant coordinators working in hospitals don’t know about hand transplants and hence fail to ask donor families to donate hands,” said Shreya’s mother Suma. Shreya lost her arms in a bus accident while travelling from Pune to her engineering college in Manipal and Monica has registered for hand transplant with Global Hospital in Parel.Shreya, though, is only one among the many transplant patients who will run on Sunday along with 300-odd runners to create awareness about transplants.Forty-year-old Shibani Gulati , who underwent a kidney transplant a decade ago, will run the half marathon for the seventh year in a row. “I have been running in a bid to take my health to the ‘next level’ and to let people know that being a transplant patient doesn’t mean one has to sit indoors,” said Gulati, who had initially planned to run the 42km marathon but changed her mind in order to run alongside her husband Gautam on his first half-marathon.Considering that Mumbai registered 79 deceased donors in 2019 and is way ahead of other cities in transplants, several doctors and NGOs said this is the right time to create more awareness about this branch of medicine. “Around 100 people will run as ambassadors for the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre,” said ZTCC Mumbai’s president Dr S Mathur.Mohan Foundation, an NGO working in the sphere of organ donation, has another 100 runners. “What is unique about this group is that it includes kidney recipients, liver recipients, heart recipients and hand transplant recipients. They want to demonstrate to the world that transplant recipients enjoy a great quality of life simply because someone gifted them with a life-saving organ,” said Mohan Foundation’s Jaya Jairam, herself a kidney recipient who will run the Dream run.The foundation team will also have Kishor Suryavanshi, a kidney recipient who features in the Limca Book of Records for being was the first to marry another kidney recipient, as well as the parents of heart transplant recipient Hvovi Minocherhomji doing the Dream Run.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73349768,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-226928,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/many-transplant-patients-to-run-tomorrow/articleshow/73342182.cms
351,['18/01/2020'],No ‘love jihad’ case in last 2 years: Kerala DGP Behera,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Loknath Behera

KOZHIKODE: Maintaining that there is no ‘ love jihad ’ in Kerala, state police chief Loknath Behera said not a single case has been reported in the last two years. Behera told reporters on Friday that Kerala Police would submit a report in this regard to the National Commission for Minorities. He added that the allegation of the Syro-Malabar Church in this regard would also be probed.

The controversy resurfaced when the Church synod alleged that many Christian girls were being converted to Islam through ‘love jihad’. The minorities panel has sought a report from the state police on the allegations.

Meanwhile, Fr Kuriakose Mundadan’s article in Sathyadeepam, published by the Ernakulam-Angamaly archdiocese of the Syro-Malabar Church, criticizing the timing of the church’s stand on ‘love jihad’ has created ripples with a section of the laity coming out in support of the priest and others protesting the article.

The Kerala Catholic Youth Movement (KCYM) burned a copy of Sathyadeepam in Kanjirapally while ‘Almaya Munnettam’ — a laity group — in Kochi threatened dire consequences if the campaign against the weekly was not stopped.

File photo. (ANI)

AGRA: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said that the Sangh's role in creating public opinion and awareness about the importance of construction of the Ram temple has ended after the Supreme Court's judgement in the matter. The Sangh supremo also said that shrines of Kashi and Mathura were not its agenda.

Answering queries from RSS volunteers during a question-answer session on the first day of his four-day visit to Moradabad , he said that it is now up to the government and the trust to start the temple's construction. He further said that Vishwa Hindu Parishad's role, however, will continue till the construction of the temple is started.

According to sources, Bhagwat, who interacted with province (prant) and area (chhetra) office-bearers of Braj, Meerut and Uttrakhand regions, said that Sangh's interest was limited only to the Ram temple and they did not have the reclamation of disputed religious sites at Mathura and Kashi on its agenda. Around 90 volunteers were present in the session.

Replying to the queries of volunteers over the ongoing protests and nationwide unrest over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Bhagwat reiterated the Sangh's support to Modi government on the issue, saying that the organisation would not step back on the issue as it is beneficial for people. He also exhorted the volunteers to sensitize people on the Citizenship Act.

Sources told TOI that Sangh volunteers will participate in a rally which is being organised by the BJP in Agra on January 23 to spread awareness about CAA. They said that around 1.5 lakh people will be gathered at Kothi Meena Bazar for the rappy to spread the message that CAA was beneficial for everyone.

Talking to TOI, a senior RSS functionary said that Bhagwat emphasised on expansion of the organisation to the basti and mandal level to reach out to every section of the society. He said that Bhagwat wanted to add more good people in the organsation.

353,['18/01/2020'],Nirbhaya case: Prison rule stands in way of quick hanging,"This story is from January 18, 2020

File photo of four Nirbhaya convicts. (Photo: PTI)

NEW DELHI: A proviso in the revised 2018 Delhi Prison Manual now stands between the timely execution of the four Nirbhaya convicts on February 1 and the possibility of a further delay.

Rule 854 of the manual, which governs the administration of prisoners in Delhi’s jails, says that in case of multiple death-row inmates, the sentence will not be executed until the Supreme Court dismisses the appeals of all convicts.

It adds that if the death sentence has been awarded to more than one person in a case and if only one of them moves a mercy plea, the execution of the others, too, has to be postponed till it is decided.

With three of the convicts — Askhay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma — yet to file a mercy plea, the new deadline fixed by a trial court on Friday runs the risk of being reduced to one of “academic” significance.

The AAP government on Wednesday described in Delhi high court the January 22 execution date as academic, citing Delhi Prison Manual that mandates a 14-day window between the rejection of the mercy plea of a death-row convict and the actual hanging .

Delhi government had also expressed apprehensions that the convicts might try to “frustrate” and “defeat” the judicial process by filing a mercy plea before the President one by one, each earning them a 14-day breather even if it was rejected.

A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal had taken a dim view of the AAP government stand. “Then your rule is bad, if you cannot take action till all the co-convicts have moved a mercy plea. It seems there has been total non-application of mind (while framing the rules). Every mercy plea is on different grounds, you can’t frustrate the judicial finding that has attained finality.”

The court pulled up Delhi government and the prison authorities for creating a system that was “suffering from cancer” and “capable of being exploited” by death-row convicts who wanted to “strategically” delay their execution.

Apprehensions along the same lines were also expressed by Nirbhaya’s parents. “In this country, justice for women seems to be difficult to get,” said the mother.

AURANGABAD: A religious function at Patoda Taluka of Beed district saw political rivals and cousins Dhananjay Munde and Pankaja Munde sharing a stage on Friday.

This was the first time the two came on stage after the assembly elections, in which Pankaja lost to Dhananjay in Parli.

The programme was organised to mark the 43th death anniversary of Saint Vamanbhau Maharaj at Gahininath Gad of Chincholi in Patoda taluka.

Usually Pankaja would take the stage during the annual event, while Dhananjay offers prayers in the morning and leaves. This time, Dhanjanay — the state social justice minister — took the stage alongside Pankaja and her MP sister Pritam. The two also addressed the devotees, but didn’t exchange a word.

Pankaja and Dhananjay had developed a rift after she was given a ticket to contest from Parli in the 2009 assembly election. The 2019 contest between the two cousins had turned acrimonious.

Aurangabad: Pundaliknagar police have booked a man under the Maharashtra Prevention of Defacement of Property Act, 1995, for allegedly defacing public property by pasting around 100 handbills on the divider besides the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court on Thursday.

A complaint in this regard was lodged by the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC).

The suspect identified as Mayur Kasliwal is accused of pasting around 100 handbills on the divider near the traffic signal along the Jalna Road leading towards Sainath Temple in the Cidco N-3 area.

The handbills were printed on an A4 size sheet and advertised a service provided by Kasliwal. The AMC control room received a complaint about the handbills from a resident. Following the complaint, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey directed Zone 6 ward officer Meera Chavan to take action against the person defacing the public property.

Chavan inspected the spot, called Kasliwal and asked him whether he acquired permission to paste the handbills on the divider, to which he received a negative response. Subsequently, Chavan lodged a police complaint against Kasliwal.

Pundaliknagar police station in-charge assistant inspector Ghanshyam Sonawne told TOI, “We have issued a notice to the concerned person under section 41 of the CrPC. He will have to obtain bail from the court and co-operate with the investigation.”

The development comes in the wake of the ongoing Swachh Survekshan 2020. Municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey has set a target for the city to get featured in top 100 cleanest cities of the country.

NEW DELHI: With Mukesh Singh’s plea for a mercy petition getting dismissed by the President, Tihar authorities have started making fresh preparations for hanging the four Nirbhaya convicts on February 1.Their diet will be fixed again to maintain a standard weight parameter required for executing the death penalty, said jail sources.Sources added that special attention was being paid to maintaining the health of the four convicts ever since Vinay Sharma fell unconscious inside his cell on Wednesday. Sharma has been behaving restlessly and aggressively, and also refuses to eat the food served to him in his cell. All the four convicts would now be kept on suicide watch through the day, said sources.Jail officers, however, rubbished the rumour about a suicide attempt by Sharma, that was doing the rounds on social media.The jail staffers and security guards have been asked to carefully monitor the activities of the four men, especially when they are in the bathroom and during night hours. A new set of ropes from Buxar might also be procured days before the hanging. The ones that were to be used on January 22 have already been softened with ripe bananas and soap, and they could decompose till the next date.Jail sources said that the prisoners would now be allowed to meet their family members and lawyers twice a week. On Friday, Pawan Gupta was allowed to meet his father.While the curative petitions of two of the convicts are pending with a court, Gupta has filed a petition in the Supreme Court to review the high court order, which earlier dismissed his plea to declare him a juvenile. Gupta, Sharma and Akshay Thakur can still lodge a mercy petition before the President before February 1. Tihar authorities will again issue a notice to the three prisoners giving them an ultimatum to file the mercy plea.Jail officials added that the cells in which the four men have been moved now are well lit so that their activities can be monitored even at night. Their health would be monitored regularly and they would only be allowed medicines that are prescribed by the jail doctors.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73351181,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1202072,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tihar-rejigs-preparations-after-new-death-warrants/articleshow/73341032.cms
366,['18/01/2020'],4 murder convicts get HC relief,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Aurangabad: Citing that ‘truthfulness is withheld by the prosecution,’ the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has quashed and set aside the conviction slapped by the lower court in the murder case of a woman who died of burn injuries.

The deceased woman’s husband and three members of his family were convicted.

The divisional bench of the HC comprising Justice TV Nalawade and Justice MG Sewlikar observed that the “Discussion shows that the evidence which could have said important things about the truthfulness is withheld by the prosecution by not examining the witnesses who were available. The benefit of this circumstance needs to be given to the accused.”

“As the rule in respect of the dying declaration is based on the principle of necessity, if there is a possibility of an eye witness, it is the duty of the prosecution to see that witnesses like neighbours are examined. In the present matter, the dying declaration itself shows that the neighbours had rushed to the spot and had witnessed at least some portion of the incident and that they had extinguished the fire. When dying declaration is available and when the version of eye witness is available, ordinarily more weight needs to be given to the evidence of eye witness as he is available for cross examination and Court can ascertain the truth from his version,” it was ruled.

Following the conviction, additional sessions judge of Shrirampur, Ahmednagar, slapped the convicts with life imprisonment on the charges of murder and domestic violence.

Pallavi Gaikwad was married to Vijay, a resident of Shindewadi, Padhegaon of Shrirampur taluka in Ahmednagar sometime in 2011. The woman suffered serious burn injuries on October 1, 2012, at her in-laws’ house. She succumbed to the injuries on October 8, 2012.

Lawyers NV Gaware and NR Avhad contested that the records at the hospital where the woman was admitted soon after the incident stated that she suffered burn injuries due to the bursting of stove while the deceased woman gave two dying declarations blaming her husband and three in-laws. Both the statements had some contradictions.

The HC, citing one of the dying declarations, questioned the prosecution as to why the statements of neighbours, who reportedly helped Pallavi’s husband to rush her to hospital, were not taken on record.

The HC observed that when the two dying declarations are compared with each other, it can be said that in the dying declaration recorded before the executive magistrate, the victim did not disclose about the money demand from her in-laws and that she did not give any particulars of the ill treatment or reason for the ill treatment.

“The absence of such evidence is a serious lacuna in the present case and that lacuna cannot be ignored as the accused people can be convicted for the offence of murder if the dying declaration is taken as the base for conviction. Thus, the scrutiny of the entire evidence is necessary and the corroboration of surrounding circumstances is also necessary in the present matter for proving the incident disclosed in the dying declaration” observed the HC.

Aurangabad: The Aurangabad bench of Bombay high court has granted bail to an accused driver who was intercepted by police while transporting 530kg of marijuana in an SUV.

HC justice RG Avachat citing that “there is no independent evidence to indicate the applicant to have had knowledge that the packets contained marijuana”, granted conditional bail to the accused who had been languishing behind bars for the last 18 months.

As per police, Tushar Suresh Pimple, after being intercepted by Islapur police in Nanded on July 21, 2018, along with one Shaikh Riyaz, informed police that he was carrying marijuana.

Soon a panchanama was carried out and police booked them on charges of rash and negligent driving, apart from relevant sections of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act.

Representing Pimple, lawyer Joydeep Chatterji contested that co-accused offered the applicant a good sum of money for driving the car in which the drug was found. The alleged oral statement of the applicant to the police, informing the packets in the car contained marijuana is inadmissible. The applicant is behind bars for a little over one-and-a-half year and it would take a considerable time for the trial to get initiated.

After hearing the contentions from both the sides, justice Avachat observed: “It is not the case of the prosecution that the contraband article belonged to the applicant. He was engaged as a driver. True, the applicant informed the police officials that the packets in the car contained ganja. Whether this statement amounts to confession or is inadmissible admission needs to be appreciated during trial. It will take time for the trial to commence and there is no independent evidence to indicate that the applicant had knowledge that the packets contained marijuana.”

Union women and child development minister Smriti Irani

NEW DELHI: Union women and child development minister Smriti Irani blamed the Aam Aadmi Party government on Friday for the delay in the hanging of the four men convicted in the Nirbhaya case . She accused Delhi government of slowing the process after the Supreme Court had rejected the convicts’ review petition in July 2018. In response, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged BJP not to politicise the case but to work together in ensuring that the sentencing in such incidents was carried out quickly.

Kejriwal tweeted, “I feel sad politics being done on such issue. Shudn’t v be working together to ensure guilty r hanged soonest? Shudn’t v join hands to ensure a system so that such beasts get hanged within 6 months? Pl don’t do politics on this. Let’s together create a safe city for our women (sic).”

The CM later asserted that his government had completed all its responsibilities with regard to the case “within a few hours”. He told reporters, “Delhi government has no role in delaying the hanging.”

In a video message released on Twitter, Kejriwal added, “The postponement of hanging of convicts has disappointed everyone. We all want them to be hanged as soon as possible. It is sad that such a sensitive issue has become the subject of politics.”

Vinay Sharma, Akshay Kumar, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Singh were sentenced to death for raping a 23-year-old woman in a moving bus in Delhi in December 2012. The brutalised victim, who was later given the name Nirbhaya, had died in a Singapore hospital while undergoing treatment.

Irani claimed that when the entire country was united in seeking expeditious justice for Nirbhaya, Kejriwal had delayed the process of justice. She said the Supreme Court had rejected the review petitions of the convicts in July 2018, but the jail administration and Delhi government had suppressed the case. She asked the AAP government why the convicts hadn’t yet been hanged in the year and a half since their review petition was rejected.

The Union minister also noted that Delhi government had granted Rs 10,000 and a sewing kit on the release of the juvenile accused, who she described as the cruellest among the rapists. She welcomed Friday’s rejection of Singh’s mercy petition by President Ram Nath Kovind.

Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala at the Kannur leg of the Rashtra Raksha March led by MP K Sudhakaran

KANNUR: The Congress on Friday came down heavily on governor Arif Mohammad Khan while defending the state assembly for passing a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ).

“The governor, who speaks like a BJP state leader, is a disgrace,” Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said while addressing the Kannur leg of the Rashtra Raksha March led by K Sudhakaran, MP.

“The resolution (against CAA) was passed according to the rules and procedures,” he said, adding that the assembly had the right to do so since the legislators were elected by the people. Chennithala, however, did not spare the chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, either. The opposition leader said Vijayan remained silent when the governor spoke against the resolution.

“It was me who opposed the governor. Pinarayi Vijayan, who is not ready to respond against the governor protecting the BJP and RSS’s interests, is cheating the people,” he alleged. He alleged that the agenda behind CAA was to create a communal divide in the country, “thereby damaging its secular fabric.”

Already several cases have been filed against the CAA, as it was against Article 5 to 11 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court, after examining these clauses, would throw the CAA into the dustbin, he said.

Following the CAA, huge protests have emerged in the nation as Narendra Modi and Amit Shah have converted India into a battlefield, he said.

Earlier, Kannur Bishop Alex Vadakkumthala flagged off the march from Mundayad Indoor Stadium around 4 pm.

A huge metallic map of India has been erected in the middle of the road on Kalindi Kunj Road. Street furniture... Read More

NEW DELHI: The Kalindi Kunj stretch, which has been under lockdown for the past one month owing to anti-CAA protests, is now strewn with vandalised street furniture.

Protesters occupying both carriageways of the road have uprooted the grilles and cobbled stones of the central median, spray painted bus stops and pasted posters on the foot overbridge. Some of the bus stops now resemble dirty restrooms.

The grilles from the central median are being used for blocking the road and creating a perimeter around street art, including a huge metallic map of India erected in the middle of the road.

While locals blame miscreants for the vandalism, no legal action has been taken by the civic bodies in charge of maintaining the street furniture. RWA of Sarita Vihar and Jasola said it would take days for the civic bodies to re-install the street furniture to make the stretch usable once it opens to the public.

“This is not the way to protest. Damaging public property will eventually result in further problems when traffic starts moving on the stretch. We have appealed to police and civic bodies to take note of this,” said SK Awana, a resident of Sarita Vihar, who had moved a public interest litigation in court demanding removal of the protesters.

When TOI visited the stretch on Friday, it found that apart from the spot where the protests were taking place, the remaining portion of the stretch was occupied by residents of nearby colonies. There were temporary shops set up by the locals, while the empty stretch was being used by stunt bikers. Embers from bonfires were strewn along the road and under the foot overbridge. Even the walls of the Delhi Metro depot in Sarita Vihar were spray painted. Residents were unaware of who had damaged the public property.

Ashok Bidhuri, a resident of Sarita Vihar, said there are at least 10 colonies next to Kalindi Kunj road and commuting for them has become a nightmare. “In order to make the road usable again, the civic bodies will have to spend days conducting repairs. It has been a nightmarish experience for people using the canal road, especially children who have to go to school and tuitions,” he added.

“We have appealed to the protesters to end the agitation since it is not only affecting us, but the entire south Delhi. There are other venues where they can protest,” Bidhuri said.

Aurangabad: A suspected burglar, who the city police have been looking for, has deposited Rs 14 lakh in his wife’s bank account

The city police have made multiple teams to zero down the suspect, whose last location was Pune.

The suspect, who is in his 30s, has 42 offences registered against him for committing thefts, house break-ins in Aurangabad, Nashik, Pune, Ahmednagar, Nanded, Solapur and others.

To bring keep on his activities, earlier he was arrested under the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act and other relevant acts. Authorities maintained that the preventive measures initiated against him from time to time have failed to deter him from committing property offences. But currently, his is on the run.

The suspect along with other burglars and thieves carry out property offences in an organised manner.

When contacted, deputy commissioner of police (Zone-II) Rahul Khade said, “We have sent a letter to the bank authorities asking them to freeze the bank account of the suspect’s wife.” An officer privy to the probe informed that it was while working on some of the major house burglaries in the city, that the name of this suspect and his two accomplices cropped up.

During the probe, more details including the suspect recently gifting imported perfumes and make-up articles to his wife came up. “One of the women, rounded up for questioning has revealed that the suspect has at least four wives, with more inclination towards one of them,” said an officer who recently questioned one of the women.

While scanning records of the woman, towards whom the accused has more inclination, the police found that in the first week of this month, he deposited about Rs 14 lakh in her bank account through RTGS.

On questioning her about the source of the money, she revealed that the suspect has deposited the money in her bank account. Police said that as the suspect has no legitimate source of income, the said amount is most likely to have come from the recent major property offences he is suspected of c ommitting in the city.

Pune: From this year onwards, the 25% quota admission under the Right to Education (RTE) Act will witness a number of changes from the number of rounds to an early conclusion of the entire process.

There will be just one lottery round instead of four conducted earlier and the process would be over by May-end so that students are able to join the schools on the first day of the academic year in June. The online application process would begin in mid-February.

Dinkar Temkar, joint director of education and in-charge of the RTE in Maharashtra, said that the new changes will be incorporated from this year based on the suggestions by parents and educationists. ""We will have just one round of allotment. For schools having more applications than intake, we will announce a waiting list. If seats remain vacant, the names from the waiting list will be given opportunity,"" he said.

Temkar said that once the application link is opened, aspirants can fill the forms for the next three to four weeks. After scrutiny of documents and verification, the lottery will be announced by March and admission confirmed by May-end.

The exact schedule will be announced by the education department soon. Every year, at least three lotteries take place, which delay the process, leading to some students joining schools in September.

""We have already informed parents and publicised on the RTE admissions portal regarding the documents required for admissions. The parents have to keep these documents ready so that no time is wasted after the application link is opened,"" said Temkar.

In Maharashtra, nearly 1.15 lakh seats under the 25% quota scheme of RTE in private English medium schools are reserved for students from the economically weaker sections of the society.

KOLKATA: A meme that reads ‘This could be you – Par tu maan gyi’ with actor Deepika Padukone’s ‘Chhapaak’ look has led to several netizens reporting the matter to Kolkata Police . The poster means that anyone could be an acid attack victim if she does not agree to her pursuer’s proposal. The toxic masculinity and criminality that almost goes on to justify acid attacks has also led the cyber cell of the detective department to urge social media platforms to block accounts of anyone sharing it.A probe is on to trace the origin of the meme. Several Twitter and Facebook users have called for an online campaign against the meme. Incidentally, Kolkata happens to be one of the three cities — along with Delhi and Chennai — where acid attacks are frequent, the 2018 NCRB data had revealed. By Friday evening, several politicians and celebrities took to social media and asked cops to take action. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor wrote: “Disgraceful that there are people who think like this, let alone post it on social media.”Subhanil Basu Roy, a Twitter user, was the first of the three who tagged the meme to Kolkata Police. “@KPDetectiveDept sir, such a disgraceful and dangerous meme has been made and spread on facebook and internet. Please look in to this and take all necessary action against such meme developers. Sharing the screenshot,” he wrote, tagging joint CP (crime) Murlidhar Sharma.

377,['18/01/2020'],PIL: Table panel report on Odisha HC bench in House,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Representative image

CUTTACK: A PIL filed in Orissa high court has sought direction to the state government to place the Justice C R Pal Commission report on setting up of high court benches, before the assembly without delay.

The PIL assumes significance as the report has been gathering dust for nearly five years and eight months as the government is yet to table it in the assembly. According to Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, a report must be placed in the assembly along with government’s action-taken report, within six months of the commission submitting it.

High court lawyer Shivsankar Mohanty filed the PIL petition on Tuesday. According to the petition, the government had set up a judicial commission, headed by Justice (retired) C R Pal on March 11, 2008, to study the feasibility of setting up high court benches other than the principal bench in Cuttack . The panel took more than six years to submit the report. In all these years the government spent Rs 1.52 crore on the commission. It was submitted on May 31, 2014, said the petition.

In his petition, Mohanty said the inordinate delay is significant given that there has been growing clamour for high court benches in different parts of the state, resulting in agitations by lawyers.

Mohanty said he had on August 30, 2019, submitted a representation to the state law department’s principal secretary to take immediate steps to place the commission report before the legislature. But the law department passed on the representation to the state home department on October 1, 2019 “to take necessary action as the matter relates to their (home) department”.

In a related development, the high court had over a month ago admitted a PIL challenging the legal validity of the panel formed by the state government for consideration of permanent high court bench at places other than the principal seat in Cuttack while keeping the commission report under the carpet.

The state home department had first constituted the committee on March 8, 2019, for consideration of various aspects for establishment of permanent bench of Orissa high court in western and southern regions of the state.

The five-member committee was constituted with additional chief secretary in home department as chairman. On August 28, 2019, another member was added to the panel.

Inside the Sai Baba temple in Shirdi (File photo)

NASHIK: Upset with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s announcement to allot Rs 100 crore for development of Pathri in Parbhani, which is Sai Baba’s birthplace, the locals in Shirdi have announced to stage an indefinite bandh in the temple town from Sunday.

The chief minister announced allotment of the funds during his review meeting of Parbhani district in Aurangabad on January 9.

“The locals are unhappy with Thackeray for describing Pathri as the birthplace of Sai Baba. We came to know about Thackeray’s statement from the media. There is no document available about Sai Baba’s birthplace. Sai Baba himself never shared any information about his birthplace or religion during his stay in Shirdi,” Kailasbapu Kote, former trustee of Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust, said.

Nitin Kote, a local resident who is spearheading the stir, said the peaceful agitation would continue till the CM clears his stand on the issue. “It could be possible that Thackeray was briefed wrongly on the issue,” he said.

According to Kote, the decision by the locals to organise the bandh is to send out a stern message to all VIPs to refrain from making any comments about the birthplace of the saint.

Shirdi temple and all its units like the Sai Prasadalaya, Sai Hospital, Sai Bhaktaniwas and the local medical shops have been kept outside the purview of the bandh. Maharashtra State Regional Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses and hotels will also be allowed to function as usual.

However, public transport vehicles like autos and taxis operated by locals would remain off road. This could pose problems for devotees visiting the temple town by air or by train.

Shirdi airport is around 15-km from the temple town and railway station is about 2-km away. Moreover, the innumerable eateries and the vendors selling religious items like flowers outside the temple premises would remain closed during the bandh.

“We do not want to cause any inconvenience to the devotees. Our stir would be peaceful. The sentiments of the locals have been hurt since Sai Baba himself never disclosed his birthplace. Our stir is apolitical,” Kote said.

Over 50 sarpanchs around the temple town had a meeting on Friday afternoon and assured to back the stir.

The second incident happened at the branch on TB Road around 9am. Six women staffers were forced to back away as rotten eggs were hurled in their direction.

Meanwhile, the staff of Baker Junction branch returned with the police after filing a complaint. However, the lock on the shutters could not be opened as the key holes were sealed with gum. The lock was then broken. As the staff and police tried to lift the shutters, bottles and stones kept in between the shutters fell on them. They had a narrow escape.

Meanwhile, CITU district president T R Raghunath said that his union was not responsible for the incident and sought a probe. TNN

Representative image

KOCHI: Bus shelters and similar constructions obstructing road users, including pedestrians , are legally impermissible, the Kerala high court ruled. Footpaths are not for parking vehicles or for use by vendors, it added.

Justice Anil K Narendran issued the order after considering a petition regarding a bus shelter constructed by the DYFI at Uduma Junction, on the Kanhangad-Kasaragod KSTP Road, that protrudes onto the road. The court has now asked the state government to inform, within two weeks, why the bus shelter has not been demolished, especially since two new bus shelters have been built by KSTP nearby.

In the order, the court said, “The pleadings and materials on record would show that the bus shelter in question at Uduma Junction poses serious safety concerns to bus passengers and also to pedestrians, including those with disabilities and reduced mobility. In view of the provisions referred to hereinbefore, and also the law laid down in the decisions referred to supra, constructions in or upon the public streets including ‘footpaths’ (which is the portion of right of way of road used for the movement of pedestrians) causing obstruction to the users of the street including pedestrians is legally impermissible. Once public roads are constructed as per the required standards and guidelines, it has to be maintained as such without encroachment of any nature, in any form, either temporary or permanent, on the right of way or on the pedestrian facilities provided as per such standards and guidelines. Footpaths and other pedestrian facilities on public roads are not intended for parking of vehicles or for the traders or shop owners to keep their articles.”

Asking the government to take action, the court said, “Any obstruction on footpaths and other pedestrian facilities on public roads will force pedestrians to walk in unsafe circumstances, which will adversely affect the mobility and safety of all pedestrians including those with disabilities and reduced mobility. Therefore, the first respondent state, the local authorities, the enforcement wing of the police and motor vehicle Department are required to ensure strict enforcement of the relevant statutory provisions and also the standards and guidelines in order to prevent encroachment of any nature, in any form, either temporary or permanent, on the right of way or on the pedestrian facilities on public roads.”

Kozhikode: Auto rickshaw drivers in the city are planning widespread protest against the decision to permit electric auto rickshaws to carry out service across Kerala without any district or city permit.

The trade unions of the auto rickshaw drivers are planning a 24-hour-strike from Sunday night demanding to restrict the electric autos with permit.

They also oppose the move to increase the number of auto rickshaws carrying out service in the city limit. At present 4 ,337 auto rickshaws have Calicut city permit and the auto drivers’ trade unions demand the authorities not to exceed the number of vehicles in the city limit. The government had decided to allow 2,000 electric autos and 1,000 CNG autos to start service in the city. It was also decided that fresh permit would be issued to green autos only.

With demonetization and other issues, auto rickshaw drivers are already struggling to earn a living, said V T Noushad, auto rickshaw driver and trade union leader. Any move to increase the number of city autos would only worsen the situation and auto rickshaw drivers are all set to start a protest to stop the move, he said. At present, over 50 electric auto rickshaws are carrying out service in Kozhikode city. These vehicles do not require any permit but only registration. The drivers of the auto rickshaws with city permit are now allowing the drivers of e-autos to park at the auto stands in the city. Besides, minor verbal clashes were also reported at some places between the trade union members and e-auto drivers.

On January 7, the collector had convened a meeting of trade union leaders to settle the protest against electric autos. During the meeting, the collector directed the trade union leaders to allow the existing e-autos to use the auto stands and carry out service. However, the trade union leaders, walked out from the meeting.

383,['18/01/2020'],Defunct Circular Rail track dismantled,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Kolkata: An elevated Circular Railway track between Kolkata airport and Dum Dum, which has been lying unused for nearly four years, is finally being dismantled to pave way for widening of Jessore Road and construction of a proposed flyover between Kaikhali on VIP Road and Airport gate 2 on Jessore Road.

Work for the dismantling of the viaduct had begun three weeks back and on Friday, TOI found a crane blocking a portion of Jessore Road towards Nagerbazar, pulling down viaducts one by one, at the airport gate 1 crossing. Once all the viaducts are pulled down, the authorities will raze the pillars.

“Since the track has already been abandoned and with an Metro line running right under the area, the structure had become a safety hazard. Hence, it is being pulled down to create space for road traffic,” said Metro Railway CPRO Indrani Banerjee. Another official added: “The structure has been eating up a major part of the thoroughfare for years and is an obstruction for future projects, like the proposed flyover connecting VIP Road with Jessore Road.”

The elevated structure was part of Circular Railway’s extension from Dum Dum Cantonment to Biman Bandar station, passing through Jessop, Jessore Road and VIP Road. The service was inaugurated by the then railway minister, Lalu Prasad Yadav, in July, 2006. However, a variety of reasons — from poor patronage and odd train timings to the elevated station and its distance from the terminal building — resulted in shutting down the service four years ago, with the Biman Bandar station closing down in September 2016.

However, long before the services had stopped, the Biman Bandar station had become a ghost station with just two trains in the day and a handful of passengers availing the services. In 2009, Metro Rail had proposed to convert the ill-conceived suburban rail service into a Metro Railway connection. But the idea was scrapped and now, even as Metro train will run on elevated tracks till Jessore Road, it will go underground to enter the Airport station, where work is already under way to convert it into a junction where lines from New Garia, Barasat and Noapara will converge. Along with the station, there will be an underground yard with basic maintenance facilities and space for three to four trains.

Officials overseeing the dismantling work said that as of now, they had finished pulling down viaducts at the gate 1 bus stand but traffic disruption is likely in the coming weeks to facilitate the work on VIP Road and Jessore Road. “We have already sought permission from the cops for a traffic block. A huge crane is being used to pull down the viaduct that will block at least 27m of the thoroughfare. The cops have allowed us a night’s permission some time next week to work on VIP Road but there has been no official communication yet,” said an official overseeing the dismantling work.

<p>JNU professors during protest organized by JNU Teachers’ Association outside the School of International St... Read More

NEW DELHI: In its general body meeting (GBM) on Friday, JNU Teachers ’ Association ( JNUTA ) reiterated that to restore normalcy on the campus, the vice-chancellor should be sacked. It also decided not to cooperate with the Jawaharlal Nehru University administration on resuming classes, saying the authorities should first try to end the impasse with students.

JNUTA will seek a judicial inquiry into the January 5 violence on the campus as neither the “sham inquiry” of the VC-appointed committee nor Delhi Police’s investigation would bring to light the complete truth, the resolution claimed.

“No teaching for the winter semester can commence before the academic activities of the monsoon semester are completed in a manner consistent with the statutory provisions and the maintenance of academic standards,” GBM stated. The teachers will engage with students but will not “accept the diktats of an administration that cannot even perform its job of ensuring a conducive environment for regular academic activities”, it pointed out.

The teachers, who assembled in front of School of International Studies and raised slogans, alleged that as the administration didn’t not want a fair investigation, JNUTA demanded the sacking of the VC as a “necessary, though not sufficient, condition for teachers to feel secure. GBM... cautions MHRD that it will be held squarely responsible should the distinct possibility of any further untoward incidents becomes a reality because of the delay in relieving the VC”.

The resolution rejected the registrar’s January 13 advisory alleging that it had “admonished teachers and threatened them”. After the “chilling experience of January”, there’s no doubt the VC and the administration “do indeed pose a serious threat” to the teachers, it stated.

Demanding that the private security agency at JNU be held accountable for its failure on January 5 and be replaced, JNUTA sought “an urgent review of security arrangements, which must include the participation of teachers, students, staff and residents”. It also said the current security arrangements were causing inconveniences to every body.

Agra: Most of the hi-tech machines to lift garbage which were purchased by Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) 10 months ago are now lying defunct condition due to lack of proper maintenance. Ten of these machines were purchased by AMC at a cost of Rs 1 crore. They were to be deployed for high-standard cleanliness in the vicinity of the Taj Mahal and on MG road. The use of these machines would also have helped curb pollution caused by dust during cleaning work.

According to sources, AMC administration did not train the sanitation workers how to operate these machines. Today, at least six of the 10 machines are not functioning as the workers entrusted with them had little idea on how to operate or maintain the litter-pickers. As a result, the workers have gone back to manual cleaning.

The sources said these machines operated well for the first two months, keeping the areas spick and span. However, due to the lack of monitoring by senior officials, the mechanized cleaning plan soon fizzled out.

Mayor Naveen Jain said, “We have received complaints of mechanized cleaning work not taking place. A probe will be conducted. All the non-functional litter-picker machines will be repaired. The workers will be trained for proper operation and maintenance of the litter-picker machines.”

During the launch of the machines, civic body officials had said that the battery-mounted machine is equipped with a waste-collection tank of 240 litre. It has the capacity to make 9 square meter area litter free at a go.

Panaji: Commissioner of the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) Sanjit Rodrigues refuted claims that the fire at the CCP ’s wet waste facility at Patto on Monday started from the dump , inside the shed.

The excavator in the pathway outside the wall of the shed caught fire first, he said, adding that it got fully burnt. The fire then proceeded to the dump inside the shed, he told corporators, who asked him whether the fire started from within the dump. “If the fire started inside, the JCB wouldn’t have been burnt,” he said.

He blamed the security guard from the government’s human resource corporation for not being present at the time of the fire and alerting authorities in time. He added that the gate was locked and the fire fighters had to cut open the gate before they could douse the fire that engulfed the dump.

If the guard was present on duty, he would have seen the smoke from the fire that started in the wee hours of Monday.

He asked the corporators to pass a resolution to request the government to hire private security from a professional security agency so that someone could be held accountable.

The major fire at the city’s garbage facility that handles 30 tonne of commercial waste a day took fire fighters 12 hours and 87,000 litres of water to put out. The loss to machinery and the shed was estimated at Rs 40 lakh while fire personnel helped save Rs 60 lakh.

Methane in the legacy dump at the site help the fire spread.

Meerut: After a month-long controversy around the new ‘entry fee’, introduced by Meerut Cantonment Board to raise funds for maintenance, the decision to collect toll at three points in the district was cancelled in a crucial Meerut Cantonment Board meeting on Wednesday.

The December 8 order that was cancelled by the board allowed a private contractor to collect an ‘entry fee’ from commercial vehicles. However, after protests, the board withdrew its order on December 12 and cancelled its contract with the contractor, at which point, the latter approached Allahabad high court and got a stay on the board’s directive on December 20.

Then from January 8, the contractor suddenly began collecting ‘entry fee’ without informing the cantonment authority, citing the HC stay order, at the three spots — Mawana road, Roorkee road and Jali Kothi — where the Meerut Cantonment Board had earlier set up barriers to collect entry fee to the restricted area. These were in addition to nine existing barriers. The fee ranged between Rs 25 and Rs 150, depending on the size of the vehicle.

Meerut Cantt CEO Prasad Chavan said, “It has been decided at the meeting that no entry fee will be charged from vehicles at these entry points. If the contractor continues to charge the fee, he will be stopped with the help of the district administration.”

Mamta Kansey, additional CEO, Meerut Cantt, said, “We did not give permission to the contractor to collect the fee, but the procedure was started without informing us.”

392,['18/01/2020'],Automated driving tests to become reality in Meerut by March?,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Representative image

MEERUT: On the lines of neighbouring Delhi, Meerut is also all set to get “smart tracks”, also called automated tracks, this year on which license seekers’ driving skills will be put on test. The new tracks to test the driving skills will be in the shape of 8 and cameras will record and feed every move to computers, which will then take a call if the driver is worthy of getting a license to drive on road, or not. The system is expected to weed out touts and curb corruption, the government believes so.

However, after 80% completion, the project seems to be stuck due to the alleged delay in release of the last installment of sanctioned budged by the state government.

According to the plan, the entire infrastructure to house the tracks and other systems was expected to be handed over to the authorities by March this year. However, in spite of the pending installment of Rs 54 lakh, authorities claim that they will be able to complete the work in time. The project was launched in 2015 with a target budget of Rs 4.46 crore.

Initially, plans were on to construct it in the RTO premises itself. However, later, a land in Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Meerut was finalized.

“According to the details that we have in place, 80% of the driving track has been completed and the remaining will be completed once the pending Rs 54 lakh is released by the state government. I have already sent a demand letter to the higher ups and waiting for the release of the money,” said Vijay Kumar, Meerut regional transport officer.

As of now, the driving skills of license seekers are tested first through a road safety norms test on computers and then by checking their driving skills on a limited patch of land in the RTO office and around it. Questions are often raised on the transparency of these tests and allegations are made about bribes being taken to get a green signal in these tests.

Once the computerized driving track, in the shape of the number 8, is in the place, human intervention will come down.

SK Singh, executive engineer of UP Rajya Nirmaan Sehkaari Sangh, said, “The construction work started in August 2018. The proposal was given to us in 2018 but it got delayed because initially we were asked to replicate the driving track in Kanpur. Later, we were told to take a nod from The Central Institute of Road Transport, Pune, which suggested certain amendments and then the work picked up pace in August 2018.”

“We have already sent a request for the pending Rs 54 lakh installment, and it is supposed to arrive in the next two weeks. After which we will be able to hand over the track as well as the building constructed for the theoretical lessons before the track by March 2020. Only automation work will remain, which has to be completed by the RTO authorities,” said Singh.

Agra: Delhi University professor Apoorvanand Jha on Friday slammed vice chancellors of Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ), JNU and Jamia Millia Islamia for what he said their failure to protect the students from outside assault and suggested they should tender their resignations.

“The VCs of all three universities including AMU should accept that they could not protect their students and should quit from their posts,” said professor Jha while addressing teachers in AMU on Friday. Jha alleged that it was a complete failure of the VCs across all universities where violence took place. “AMU VC Tariq Mansoor, who allowed police inside the campus on December 15, should also accept his failure,” he said.

“How can you make an eye contact with students after this incident? You are custodian of the university and students are your responsibility,” he said.

Jha asked, “I wonder how the VC is so relaxed and calm after such barbaric incident, in which one of his students lost hand.”

Referring to recent Amendment to Citizenship Law, Jha said, “We did not raise our voice at the time of abrogation of Article 370 in the Kashmir Valley and that is why we are facing this”.

“The country is at a very dangerous crossroads and only youths can make others understand about it,” he said.

Professor Jha also spoke about the importance of the role of public universities, which he said “have taken the role of the guardians of the Constitution.” Senior journalist Qurban Ali, who was also present there, spoke at length about the inclusive nature of the country and about the struggle for Independence. Ali appealed to the government to rollback laws like CAA, which, for the first time, have created divisions.

Akanksha Ola

NEW DELHI: The first list of 54 candidates announced by Congress on Saturday has about 10 young leaders making their debut into the electoral politics in the Delhi assembly polls.While some have been active in Youth Congress , a few have been working closely with their illustrious fathers, who have won several elections and held important organisational positions in the party and are all slowly making a way for the second generation to take forward the family mantle.Among prominent second-generation leaders are Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra’s daughter, Shivani (Kalkaji), former speaker Yoganand Shastri’s daughter, Priyanka (RK Puram), and former Model Town MLA Kunwar Karan Singh’s daughter, Akanksha Ola (Model Town). Former Mustafabad MLA Hasan Ahmed’s son, Ali Mehndi, and Nangloi Jat MLA Birender Singh’s son, Mandeep, are also in the fray from the seats their fathers represented in Delhi assembly.The party has also relied on several Youth Congress leaders, including Radhika Khera, former DUSU president Neetu Verma (Malviya Nagar), Siddharth Kundu (Narela), Gaurav Dhanak (Karol Bagh) and Sandeep Tanwar (Delhi Cantonment).Akanksha Ola, who is currently secretary, All India Mahila Congress, said, the party has taken a wise decision by promoting youth and women. “To bring a change in the society, it is important to empower women,” said Ola (41), who has been politically active with her father for almost 20 years now.Priyanka Singh, vice-president, Delhi Mahila Congress, has been politically active since 2008. Ironically, she has been nominated for her first election on a day her father quit the party. “My father always told me to find my own feet in politics and get ticket with my hard work not because I am her daughter,” Singh said.Shivani, however, is relatively new to politics. Bar-at-Law from London, she recently joined her father in the political work. “I am really excited. My aim is to carry forward Congress’ tradition of progress and continue the chain of development started by Sheila Dikshit and broken by the AAP government,” Shivani said.Radhika Khera has been active in politics for a long time and currently is national secretary and social media head of Indian Youth Congress. She also handled Delhi Congress’ social media in the 2015 assembly polls. She has been fielded from Janakpuri.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73367228,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-123430,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/making-space-for-gen-next-10-young-leaders-to-take-poll-plunge/articleshow/73367588.cms

Agra: A group of students protesting against CAA and NRC at Bab-e-Syed gate of Aligarh Muslim University ( AMU ) boycotted the proctor’s visit to the dharna site on Friday. Some agitated ex-students also misbehaved with the proctor but they were stopped by the student leaders present there.

Two former students’ union office-bearers, Nadeem Ansari and Hamza Sufyan, against whom the district police have already initiated the process of invoking the UP Control of Goondas Act, 1970, allegedly misbehaved with the proctor and asked him to go back. They questioned his whereabouts when students were being allegedly beaten up by the police on December 15.

Varsity spokesperson Shafey Kidwai later said that this kind of act is not acceptable. “Since they are not students of AMU, we will report the incident to the police,” said Kidwai. He said Sufyan had been rusticated by the university administration for five years for creating ruckus at the vice-chancellor’s office and for allegedly misbehaving with the varsity employees in July 2019. Ansari is also not the student of AMU at present, he said.

Students’ leader Faizul Hassan told TOI that he tried to stop Ansari and Sufyan, who created ruckus at the protest site. He said, “We will not tolerate this nuisance and will stand against them if they repeat this in future. We are here to protest against CAA peacefully not for creating ruckus.”

He added that their demand for the resignation by VC Tariq Mansoor and Registrar Abdul Hamid stands, as “they were responsible for police action on the campus”. “Also, the protest against contentious CAA/NRC/NPR will continue till the government withdraws the law,” he added.

Following the incident, Proctor Afifullah Khan re-issued a notification, saying that as per the directions of the Allahabad high court, the Duck Pond in the university has been earmarked as the site for students to congregate freely in peaceful manner to protest.

396,['18/01/2020'],"RSS role in Ram temple ended after SC verdict, says Bhagwat","This story is from January 18, 2020

Agra: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Thursday said that the Sangh’s role in creating public opinion and awareness about the importance of construction of the Ram temple has ended after the Supreme Court’s judgement in the matter. The Sangh supremo also said that shrines of Kashi and Mathura were not its agenda.

Answering queries from RSS volunteers during a question-answer session on the first day of his four-day visit to Moradabad, he said that it is now up to the government and the trust to start the temple’s construction. He further said that Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s role, however, will continue till the construction of the temple is started.

According to sources, Bhagwat, who interacted with province (prant) and area (chhetra) office-bearers of Braj, Meerut and Uttrakhand regions, said that Sangh’s interest was limited only to the Ram temple and they did not have the reclamation of disputed religious sites at Mathura and Kashi on its agenda. Around 90 volunteers were present in the session.

Replying to the queries of volunteers over the ongoing protests and nationwide unrest over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Bhagwat reiterated the Sangh’s support to Modi government on the issue, saying that the organisation would not step back on the issue as it is beneficial for people. He also exhorted the volunteers to sensitize people on the Citizenship Act.

Sources told TOI that Sangh volunteers will participate in a rally which is being organised by the BJP in Agra on January 23 to spread awareness about CAA. They said that around 1.5 lakh people will be gathered at Kothi Meena Bazar for the rally to spread the message that CAA was beneficial for everyone.

Talking to TOI, a senior RSS functionary said that Bhagwat emphasised on expansion of the organisation to the basti and mandal level to reach out to every section of the society. He said that Bhagwat wanted to add more good people in the organsation.

397,['18/01/2020'],Traders on strike burn effigy of AMC over parking fee row,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Agra: Traders of Sanjay Place market here who have been on an indefinite strike for the last three days burnt an effigy of Agra Municipal Corporation ( AMC ) administration on Friday. Traders are protesting against the civic body for charging parking fee at 44 places in the market. They claimed that it violates norms as they had already paid a fee for parking at the time of purchasing the property.

The traders have claimed that the parking fee is illegal. They have been using the public address system to urge vehicle owners not to pay for parking.

On his part, the parking contractors have said they have been authorized by the AMC administration to charge parking fee.

The dispute over parking fee between traders of Sanjay Place and Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) is sub judice. The traders want AMC to cancel the parking contracts till the court delivers its final orders in the matter.

Hiren Agarwal, secretary of the Sanjay Place market association, said, “We have already paid for the parking space. It is clearly written on the registry of the properties available with the property owners. The AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging the parking fee. We are not going to tolerate this. The parking contractors will not be allowed to operate in Sanjay Place.”

Sanjay Place market was developed by the Agra Development Authority (ADA). In 2005, the market was handed over to the municipal corporation.

Traders claim that the municipal corporation was required to collect property tax, conduct maintenance work and look after street lighting and sewer system. There was no mention of collecting parking fee in the document handed over to them.

Association's treasurer Vinay Mittal said, “We have received support of over a dozen organizations in our protest against the parking mafia. In violation of the norms, the AMC administration has allowed people associated with BJP to charge the parking fee. AMC officials also get a share of the parking fee illegally collected from the market. This is the reason no one from the ruling party or any AMC official has come to discuss the issue. In past, we have raised the entire matter with Mayor Naveen Jain, but they didn’t provide any solution.”

Municipal commissioner Arun Prakash said, “Charging fee for parking on public place is right of the civic body. The fee collected will be used for development works and improving maintenance of sanitation and hygiene. The matter of parking in Sanjay Place is sub judice and we will go by the court orders. The claims made by the market association are misleading.”

399,['18/01/2020'],Pay-parking in Panaji may be retendered,"This story is from January 18, 2020

CCP has awarded the contract on nine road stretches to Sohan Juwarker

PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji ( CCP ) may retender the pay-parking contract after the highest bidder, who quoted Rs 1.62 crore for three years, asked the corporation for a month’s time to pay the 60% bank guarantee for three years.

Alternatively, the bidder asked the corporation whether instead of paying 60% bank guarantee for the three years upfront, which amounts to Rs 97 lakh, it could pay the 60% bank guarantee for the first year only.

CCP mayor Uday Madkaikar said if one month’s time is granted, the code of conduct for the zilla panchayat elections would further delay the project till April. He said that when he sought legal opinion on whether the bank guarantee could be accepted only for one year, he was told that the tender document couldn’t be changed.

“We will write to the bidder saying both these options are not possible and see what he says. If he doesn’t agree we will have to retender it,” he told TOI.

CCP has awarded the contract on nine road stretches in the state capital to Sohan Juwarker for Rs 1.6 crore.

CCP commissioner Sanjit Rodrigues said the bank guarantee was fixed high at 60% because the CCP burnt its hands with the last pay-parking contract.

“We wanted a professional and sound party who has the money and whose cheques will not bounce. This was explained to the council and the bidder was aware of this,” he said.

“The bidder knew very clearly how much security to keep. Now that the bid has been accepted we cannot change the terms. We cannot talk to the second highest bidder either according to the central vigilance commission,” Rodrigues told corporators.

The agreement between the contractor and CCP cannot be signed until the 60% bank guarantee and 10% security amount are deposited.

401,['18/01/2020'],Hyderabad: Rohith Vemula’s mother to launch anti-CAA yatra,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Radhika Vemula at Rohith Vemula’s memorial in University of Hyderabad, on Friday

HYDERABAD: On the fourth death anniversary of Rohith Vemula , his mother Radhika Vemula appealed to the Hyderabadis to take to the streets to protest the ‘unconstitutional policies’ of the central government. “I couldn’t save my son, but I want to save my nation,” she said on Friday.

On January 17, 2016, Rohith Vemula, a Dalit scholar, had committed suicide allegedly after facing caste-discrimination in the University of Hyderabad. The 26-year-old PhD student was found hanging in his hostel room.

Recalling what Rohith mentioned in his last letter, she said people are reduced to votes. “I am sad and enraged about what is happening with the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia. Even after four years of Rohith’s institutional murder, the situation in the country is same and students are not safe. They are being distinguished based on their caste and religion,” she added.

“I, along with Abeda Salim Tadvi and Fatima Nafees, would launch ‘Mothers for the Nation Yatra’ – a nationwide anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) tour, to mobilise support for united India and defend basic principles of Ambedkar’s Constitution,” Radhika Vemula said.

Fatima Nafees is mother of Najeeb Ahmed, a 27-year-old student of biotechnology at JNU, who went missing in October 2016, allegedly after a scuffle with ABVP members.

Abeda Salim Tadvi is mother of Payal Tadvi, a medical student from National Medical College and BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai, who killed herself in May 2019, allegedly due to caste-discrimination.

Radhika also visited Rohith Vemula’s memorial in UoH and garlanded the statue. She said financial difficulties have kept her away from participating in any protest. She further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah should to prove their identity first by showing documents of their forefathers, before questioning others.

Speaking at the event ‘We The People of India’, Swaraj Abhiyan chief Yogendra Yadav said the fight against CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) have become a movement across the nation. Terming the movement as ‘Bharat Jodo Andolan’ like ‘Bharat Chhodo Andolan’ (Quit India Movement), he said the Centre will continue to divide and rule, but we will continue to unite and fight.

“We need to reclaim our Constitution. The freedom movement was to form a nation where people of all religions get equal rights,” Yadav said, adding that democracy, diversity and development have been put at stake by the government.

Stressing on the need to keep the protests non-violent, Yadav said, “Violence will lynch the movement and the only way we can achieve our aim is by remaining aggressively non-violent.”

London architect Joana Dabaj of Syrian-Lebanese descent has rebuilt spaces near refugee settlements

MUMB AI: Despite her deliberately modest clothing, well-groomed Londoner Joana Dabaj—an architect of Lebanese-Syrian descent—often jutted out as she worked amidst Syrian refugee settlements of Lebanon in 2016. Intrigued by a Lebanese-speaking woman with “foreign features” leading a team of multi-cultural volunteers who were rebuilding a school nearby, several refugees would approach her with questions ranging from “Can I borrow that tool?” to “Will you marry me?”

So, one fine day, when Dabaj saw a Syrian man pull up his van next to her, she assumed her foreignness had given yet another passerby the invitation to “waste my time” with small talk. But he surprised her. “Jumana,” he said, using the local corruption of her name. “I have three daughters... Whenever I drive them to school, I pass this site and ask them to look at you and be like you.”

Today, as Dabaj recounts this memory to TOI, her grey eyes widen like those of the cats she likes to rescue everywhere she goes. “That was one of my favourite moments,” says Dabaj, speaking both as co-founder of Catalytic Action, a UK-based non-profit design studio that works to empower vulnerable communities in Middle East, and as a woman architect who was in Mumbai last week for a conference titled ‘ Women In Design 2020 ’.

Held at Nehru Centre, the conference saw Dabaj taking the audience through the nuances of how her non-profit had rebuilt spaces, including schools and playgrounds, near refugee settlements by enlisting Lebanese and Syrian volunteers in the construction process, using local material like sheep wool to insulate the structures and even encouraging inputs from children before designing.

For instance, while working along with other NGOs on Jarahieh School—a dark, windowless, tented structure infested with rats and stuffy from the noise of a nearby wood burner till 2015—Dabaj and her artist friend asked schoolkids to tell them what they wanted the school to look like through activities such as performances and drawings. “They came up with everything from where they wanted the bathroom to be to where the doorkeeper must sleep,” says Dabaj, who too soon featured in their sketches as a figure that napped, clicked pictures and “bossed people around”.

Bossing people around on this project also meant overseeing the arrival of giant shipments, helping empty the school’s septic tank and building a sturdy enough rapport with local municipality to ensure they would link the bathroom to the sewage line—a privilege refugees were exempt from.

Driven by the belief that “working on infrastructure for vulnerable communities does not mean compromising on the quality of construction”, Dabaj and her Italian business partner Riccardo Luca Conti also enlisted the help of local women in insulating the walls of the school with locally available sheep wool. “Good architecture means having a good local knowhow,” says Dabaj, who also used secondhand green iron sheets bought from a local farmer as rain screens for the project. “Many locals came up to tell us that iron sheets was a smart idea,” says Dabaj, who found herself resolving locals’ technical queries about engineering tools in Lebanese.

For weeks, they slaved away at the school that soon housed brightly lit classrooms and even doubled up as a safe enclosed space for women to hold yoga classes, among other things.

Today, her non-profit has not only built customised playground equipment like swings and rollers using local material but is also undertaking research on how to make cities more child-friendly. “We have to think of how cities and towns are changing in the face of displacement due to climate change and how to ensure dignified living conditions for not only the poor living on the margins but also the urban poor,” says Dabaj, stressing the need for NGOs and trusts to consider empowering communities through urban design by enlisting experts. “Architecture,” she says, echoing late Italian architect GiancarloDe Carlo’s sentiment, “is too important to be left to architects alone.”

PATNA: Unidentified armed criminals struck again on Friday and looted over Rs 20 lakh in three incidents in Samastipur, Patna and Vaishali districts. Angry over frequent incidents of cash loot from petrol pumps, the petroleum dealers’ association gave an ultimatum of 72 hours to Vaishali police to arrest the culprits, failing which they will launch an agitation.

Reports reaching the state police headquarters said four criminals entered the office of a private finance company near Saidpur Mela Gate under the Chak Mehasi police station in Samastipur district around 10am and looted cash amounting to Rs 17 lakh after holding the employees captive at gunpoint. The robbers had come as customers.

The company’s credit manager, Md Sadaquat Ansari, told the police that he was sitting with an employee, Subhash Kumar, when the robbers carried out the operation. The office gate was shut as the accounts were being checked. The robbers entered the office in the guise of customers wanting to deposit money. As soon as the gate was opened, they held the employees captive. “I had no option but to hand over the keys of the locker. They collected Rs 17,35,560 and escaped on their motorbikes, which were parked outside. I raised an alarm but they had escaped with two bags full of cash. They also took away my mobile phone. By then the local people had arrived.” DSP Pritish Kumar, who rushed to the spot, said the CCTVs were not working as they had developed some fault.

In another incident, unidentified armed motorbike-borne criminals looted Rs 2.37 lakh from an employee of a cold storage when he was about to enter a bank near Anisabad Mor under the Gardanibagh police station area here.

In Vaishali, unidentified criminals looted Rs70,000 from an employee of a cooking gas agency near ROB under Hajipur sadar police station. Two criminals, who had covered their faces with cloths, reached the spot and snatched the bag containing money when the employee was engaged in collecting cash from vendors. Later, Hajipur additional SP Raghav Dayal visited the spot and inquired about the daylight cash loot from the employee of the agency, owned by a senior BJP leader of Muzaffarpur.

Panaji: Receiving flak from corporators for not signing agreements with illegal occupants in the Panaji municipal market, commissioner of the Corporation of the City of Panaji Sanjit Rodrigues blamed corporators for not calling a single meeting of the market committee.

If the market’s association doesn’t agree on signing agreements, the mayor should go to court to get them evicted, he said, adding that “all the budget which is coming from citizens taxes is going into private pockets”.

He blamed corporators for entertaining 30 objections from the market association. “Our staff is confused whether to entertain this or not. Some of them want to sign agreements, but we don’t have an agreement and we don’t have a rate,” he stated.

When all arrangements were made, one day before signing the agreement, the market association said they didn’t want to sign a leave and licence agreement, but a leave agreement. “The leave and licence agreement was decided on with their consultation, so where’s the question to change it. This will mean another two years. We should stick to one agreement, which is done in consultation with them,” he told the corporators at the meeting.

Corporator Rahul Lotlikar said the association was coming up with unreasonable demands and added that the corporation shouldn’t bend backwards. Corporator Rupesh Harlarnkar said the market is a mess and a concrete decision is required to be taken in the matter. Corporators agreed that all registration charges should be borne by the occupants of the market.

Following an uproar from corporators, mayor Uday Madkaikar agreed to call for meeting in the first week of next month to finalise the agreements to be signed with the illegal tenants at the market.

With no agreements signed, the corporation has not received a single rupee towards rent from the illegal occupants in its municipal market. It, however, collects sopo daily from the small vegetable, fruit and flower vendors in the market.

CHANDIGARH: The UT administration has termed as a threat Punjab’s 2013 proposal to declare only 100-metre of state’s area around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as an eco-sensitive zone (ESZ). Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had recently backed the state government’s proposal.

UT chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai, in a letter to the director general of forests and special secretary, ministry of environment, forest and climate change, has opposed the Punjab government’s plan.

The UT administration has already notified 2 to 2.75km radius around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as an ESZ. The Union environment ministry had also issued a final notification on ESZ around the sanctuary for Chandigarh, but Punjab and Haryana have so far not declared these zones in their jurisdictions.

UT is pushing for Punjab and Haryana to leave a matching area from the lake boundary as restricted development zone. UT, in a letter written on January 14, stated, “The ESZ for the area falling in Chandigarh around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary has already been notified by the ministry on January 18, 2017, wherein ESZ has been kept 2 to 2.75 km and regulating/prohibiting various activities therein. However, the proposal of Punjab is not in line with the proposal of UT Chandigarh… Further, it is to reiterate that similar proposal of the Punjab government, which was sent to the government of India in 2015, was not accepted by the Centre. In 2018, the government of India once again turned down the proposal of Punjab government proposing only 100m width as ESZ from Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary. In case only 100m is left as ESZ, it will have serious adverse impact on Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary as well as Sukhna Lake (sic).”

The UT has requested the ministry not to accept Punjab’s proposal in the interest of wildlife conservation in the sanctuary as well as for Sukhna Lake, which is being declared as a wetland, draft notification for which has already been issued by the administration.

Earlier on December 27 last, the Punjab CM wrote to the Union minister of environment, forest and climate change Prakash Javadekar, “In the light of recommendations made by the Punjab government, the ministry has already notified ESZ of 100m width around all the wildlife sanctuaries of Punjab. However, the proposal of Punjab government in respect of declaring 100m ESZ around Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary has not been agreed upon by the ministry on the basis that Chandigarh had proposed ESZ of 2 to 2.75km, and therefore the ministry advised Punjab to explore the possibility of declaring 1km ESZ instead of the proposed ESZ of 100m. Thereafter, the Punjab government reconsidered its decision of declaring 100m ESZ and it was found that the decision taken by the Punjab government on August 8, 2013, was in line with the recommendation of the central-empowered committee of the Supreme Court.”

How 1km proposal will affect Punjab

If the Union ministry agrees to Punjab’s proposal of 100m ESZ, it will be a relief for residents of Kansal and Nayagaon villages in the state. For, the 1km suggestion given by the ministry, which is being backed by the UT administration as well, will affect the people residing in these areas. A senior Punjab government official said almost the entire area of Kansal and many parts of Nayagaon would come under 1km radius and there would be restrictions on construction activity in the buffer zone. These villages are thickly populated and some areas of lal dora also come within the 1km buffer zone.

408,['18/01/2020'],CT Ravi’s ‘beef’ with Kerala ad backfires,"This story is from January 18, 2020

CT Ravi

BENGALURU: The government slammed Kerala ’s tourism department for putting out a tweet on Sankranti Day, promoting ‘beef ularthiyathu’, a specialty in that state, but the move backfired spectacularly with Karnataka ’s tourism minister being heavily trolled.

After Kerala put out its advertisement, state tourism minister CT Ravi , seizing the opportunity, took a dig at the Left government in Kerala, saying, “Welcome to Karnataka”. He followed that up with another tweet listing delicious “vegetarian” dishes of coastal Karnataka — a coastline which runs to Kerala.

“Welcome to Karnataka to bring out the Vegetarian in you. Enjoy the flavors of Tulu Nadu – Pathrode, Kotte Kadubu, Halasina Hannina Gatti, Avalakki Upkari, Badanekayi Mosaru Gojju and a whole lot of authentic food to hit Your tastebuds,” Ravi’s tweet read.

Ravi’s tweet sparked a debate between those for and against eating beef, including legislators like Sowmya Reddy (Congress) and Shobha Karandlaje (BJP). Some pointed out that Karnataka is 80% non-vegetarian and an appropriate response to beef curry would have been “pandi curry” (wild pig curry) — a Kodagu specialty.

Realising his tweets were getting more negative than positive traction, Ravi quickly amended his stand and on Friday tweeted: “Nati Koli Saaru Mudde. Aw! Delightful Delicacy of Old Mysuru region. Farm bred Chicken traditionally cooked to perfection and served with the soft Ragi Mudde. You will ask for more !!!”

409,['18/01/2020'],Depositors of Mapusa bank approach cops,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Panaji: Spelling further trouble for Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank (MUCB), depositors have filed a complaint at Panaji police station and with the Economic Offences Cell seeking a through investigation into the financial mismanagement of the bank.

Depositors have also written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the Reserve Bank of India with a request to appoint administrators to manage the bank.

“The depositors of the bank are mostly senior citizens and we have requested the finance minister to intercede and not entertain any application from Mapusa Urban Cooperative Bank for cancellation of the banking licence or for deregistering from the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies until the grievances concerning the deposits of the customers are settled in full,” a depositor Joseph Carneiro said.

On July 24, 2015, RBI had imposed financial restrictions on MUCB, preventing the multi-state cooperative bank from lending, after the latter’s cash reserve ratio turned negative. The RBI sanctions were extended till February 18. If the bank does not find any solution, it is likely to face liquidation.

RBI has allowed each depositor of the cooperative bank to withdraw up to Rs 50,000 from their account, but has said that if there are any unpaid loans, the money being withdrawn must be used to repay the loans.

On January 14, several depositors met to chalk out how their funds, which are locked with the bank due to the RBI’s sanctions, could be protected and removed. With no clear steps being taken to revive the bank, the depositors decided to file a complaint. The depositors also met RBI officials in Goa and demanded that action should be taken against the bank’s management.

“Section 36AA of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, provides that RBI may supersede the board of directors of the banking company,” another depositor Prabhakar Salgaocar said.

The depositors have accused all the board of directors and senior management of mismanagement, fraud, manipulation and favouritism while sanctioning loans.

“Several of these above managerial personalities are blood relations of the founder member of the bank Ramakant Khalap,” Carneiro said.

MUCB needs around Rs 50 crore as share capital infusion in order to improve its Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) and be free of RBI’s sanctions.

410,['18/01/2020'],Kolkata: Face-recognition technology helps cops solve mystery of lost bangle,"CCTV cameras outside a departmental store in the mall.

TimesView CCTVs now cover almost every corner of the city and have helped cops solve crime on several occasions. They are also prone to misuse by individuals, especially inside private property. The Mani Square incident falls somewhere in between; CCTVs at a public space have helped solve what was very close to a crime being committed without criminal charges having to be pressed finally. The city’s CCTV cover should be increased judiciously, taking into account all the concerns and fears that come with such technology.

KOLKATA: A tale of moral quandary could have ended in being registered as a criminal case had it not been for a face-recognition software.The mystery of a lost diamond-studded gold bangle worth Rs 2.5 lakh, which fell off the hand of a 32-year-old Bowbazar homemaker at a popular mall last Sunday and then became the “object of desire” of two other visitors, was solved with the new software helping connect disjointed CCTV images and zero in on the two individuals. CCTV images and the software showed that the first visitor—a senior railway employee who was with her mother—did pick up the bangle but threw it away. The second visitor, a private bank employee, later picked up the bangle, apparently tried to find a guard to deposit it to him but decided against it and walked out with it. Phoolbagan police station cops checked 12 CCTV cameras at the mall, six of them inside the main mall, two of them inside a departmental store, two at an apparel store and two others faced towards the road.The entire technology-driven investigation lasted 48 hours. Kolkata Police said the sleuths used two recently acquired tools— one, a GIS-based mapping software that showed the exact locations of all CCTV cameras, including the private ones, and two, a software that helped match faces. “We went through 63 frames and found the bangle dropped off near the departmental store. The railway employee was seen bending down close to the store and picking up something. She is then seen being warned by her mother. She threw the bangle to the left corner, close to the escalator. We obtained her number from the departmental store, where she had gone, and recorded her statement,” an officer said.Police said they also chanced upon a CCTV frame, showing a man bending near the departmental store. “We began matching his clothes with that of people on the ground floor but traced him to the floor above. He was seen entering the apparel store, from where we got his number. We contacted the bank employee and got the bangle back,” said an officer.“CCTVs can work wonders. Kolkata Police have begun working on the ambitious project to integrate as many CCTV cameras as possible — both government and private — across the city. The idea is to ensure that footage is analysed in depth and every CCTV is mapped,” said an officer from the Watch section at Lalbazar. While the project has been successful in Posta, Park Street, Shakespeare Sarani and Bhowanipore, cops are looking to increase the cover in Behala, Jadavpur, Survey Park, Haridevpur and Regent Park.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73346548,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-159834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/face-recognition-tech-helps-cops-solve-mystery-of-lost-bangle/articleshow/73340161.cms

Udupi: All the Ashta Mutt seers participate in the paryaya procession which happens once in two years. Each Astha Mutt seer will have the right to choose their palanquin and its decoration. On the occasion of Admar seer Eeshapriya Teertha’s paryaya procession on Saturday, Vishwaprasanna Teertha of Pejawar mutt will have his palanquin decorated in the traditional manner (Tulunadu style) with coconut fronds , bamboo sticks and banana stems.

Usually decorated with a silk cloth

The seer wanted to give a touch of traditional artistry. Usually, the palanquin where the swamiji sits during the procession is decorated with a silk cloth. Sadhu Panera, 64, and his colleagues Narayana Paranara, Girish Parana, Prajwal Parana and Dinesh Paranawas from Alevoor, Manchikere, were given the responsibility to prepare the traditional palanquin for the Pejawar Mutt seer.

They are experts in making the ‘Siri Singara’ and other accessories used by the artistes of Daiva dance. However, decorating a palanquin is a new experience for them.

Siri toppis an attraction

Vishwaprasannn Teertha said, “These festivities allow artists to develop their art and enhance culture and tradition. An attraction for the paryaya procession will be the ‘siri toppi’ hat made with coconut leaves by a Jharkhand youth. The swamiji was impressed with a young man who made the hat with coconut leaves, while he was in Bengaluru.

“He bought 25 such hats from him, which will be used during the procession on Saturday.”

PANAJI: The stricken chemical tanker Nu-Shi Nalini , which was grounded near Raj Bhavan, has been sold through an auction monitored by the high court of Bombay to Global Tankers FZE for Rs 13.5 crore, officials said.

The ship continues to remain anchored at Mormugao Port Trust till Global Tankers FZE pays the entire amount for the ship, the deputy sheriff of the Bombay high court said. MPT is also in the process to calculating the expenditure incurred till date, which will be submitted to the court for recovery from the sale amount.

Insurance and Surveyors and Loss Assessors Private Ltd, appointed by the court, had valued the chemical tanker at Rs 13.3 crore, which included cost of towage of the vessel . The firm also felt that the ship has to be scrapped.

Global Tankers has paid Rs 2 crore and has to pay the balance Rs 11.5 crore by January 24.

“It is made clear that if the balance amount is not remitted by January 24, and no extension will be given to pay the balance amount, Rs 2 crore will stand forfeited and this court will also recover any amount that may be deficit, if the vessel has to be sold again, from Global Tankers FZE. Apart from that, contempt proceedings will be initiated against Global Tankers FZE and its directors,” Justice K R Shriram said in an order pertaining to the commercial admiralty suit between MPT, Samson Maritime Ltd and the owners of Nu Shi Nalini.

The chemical tanker ran aground on the rocks near Dona Paula with about 2,000 tonne naphtha , 50 tonne heavy oil and 19 tonne diesel due to cyclonic winds and rough seas, in late October. After a long delay, MPT picked Dutch firm Marine Masters B V to salvage the vessel and pump out the naphtha.

The chemical was being shifted out of India by another chemical tanker MT Global Peak to the Gulf at no cost to Goa or MPT.

The high court of judicature at Bombay, admiralty and vice-admiralty jurisdiction and its commercial division had ordered the auction of Nu-Shi Nalini by January 3, to pay Samson Maritime Ltd for expenses incurred to tow the vessel from Kerala to Goa, for the operation to remove naphtha and the salvage operations.

We usually get a five-month study leave to prepare for the final exams and this was the period, I chalked out my study plan carefully. I made sure that I completed by tuition before the period so that I could fully concentrate on studying. The curriculum is vast and extremely complicated, which needs several revision,” Bajoria told TOI.His mother was the inspiration and motivation behind his success. “Whatever I have achieved is because of her,” said Bajoria, whose father died in 2016.Elaborating on his preparations, he said he had made a time-table and would put a tick on the date, he would finish a section he had targeted to complete. On days he would not be able to study the entire section, he would put a cross against the date. “I would devote around 12 hours a day to studying. Even if I failed, I knew that I have had put in considerable effort. Every day was a new beginning,” said Bajoria, a former student of Hariyana Vidya Mandir. He finished his BCom from St Xavier’s College (Autonomous) Kolkata in 2018. “I was a school-topper and also secured the highest rank in college. I was confident of cracking the CA exams and securing high marks. But the rank is a surprise. I want to work in the finance sector, preferably in investment banking or private equity.

Asaduddin Owaisi

HYDERABAD: AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday took pot-shots at Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Bipin Rawat for ‘de-radicalisation’ comment and asked him to study Juvenile Act properly. During a conclave in Delhi on Thursday, the CDS said young children who being radicalised need to be identified and placed in de-radicalisation camps

Addressing a gathering in Korutla, Owaisi said, “The CDS says we will de-radicalise the children who are being radicalised, but I want to tell the CDS General saab, please read the Juvenile Act. IPC is not applicable on children, but he says that children will be taken to a separate place to be de-radicalised.”

Referring to a recent video of Meerut SP telling a group of anti-CAA protesters to leave the country and go to Pakistan, Owaisi said, “General saab you speak about de-radicalisation, but Meerut SP, along with police force, goes to areas which have Muslim population and asks people to go to Pakistan. He also gives them jail threats. Who will de-radicalise such SPs?”

Asad also mentioned about Hafiz Junaid and Tabrez Ansari, both were victims in lynching cases. Owaisi asked, “Who will de-radicalise people/groups who are attacking Muslims and Dalits? Who will de-radicalise people who killed Akhlaq and Pehlu Khan.”

Without naming Bhopal MP Pragya Thakur, Owaisi said BJP has given an MP ticket to a terror accused.

On BJP general secretary Ram Madhav’s statement that Hitler and Mussolini were products of democracy, but democracies mature over time, Owaisi tweeted, “Savarkar & Gowalkar were big bhakts of Nazism/fascism in Europe. Today, this ‘bhakti’ is proved by the fact that a terror accused is a ruling party MP. To protest peacefully is a democratic right. To call for badla & goli against protestors is peak Nazism.”

421,['18/01/2020'],E-Way: ‘Delayed’ report on mitigation steps miffs wildlife experts,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Nagpur: Tempers flared during a meet on Friday morning between forest department, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation ( MSRDC ) and the High Powered Committee (HPC) set up to look into mitigation measures being taken to protect wildlife on the 800km-odd stretch of the under-construction Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Mahamarg .

The flare-up was triggered after HPC members alleged that they received a report on mitigation measures just ‘a few days ago’ even though government had access to it since at least November. This delay, HPC members claimed, prevented them from taking an informed decision and giving an opinion on it.

The report was prepared by Wildlife Institute of India (WII). Kishore Rithe, member of HPC, said “The expert members were given a soft copy of the report just a few days back and it was impossible for us to put forth our views. It is an exhaustive report which took over a year to be completed, so obviously it can’t be read in just in a few days.”

HPC members have now proposed that they will give their opinion on the matter after not only going through the report but also conducting site visits. Rithe said, “It is important for us to get a ground-level feel after reading the report and consulting other stakeholders.”

Not commenting specifically on some expert members being miffed, state PCCF (wildlife) Nitin Kakodkar said that HPC expert members were not mandated to give their opinion on the same day itself. “Expert members can go through the report and put their say in the next meeting,” said Kakodkar.

It has been decided that HPC members will first hold consultations with other stakeholders on January 22, followed by site visit in the first week of February. Rithe said, “On February 15, we will meet again to finalize our view based on the report, consultations and site visit.”

MSRDC, the government agency executing the project, says they are open to suggestions from all experts. Radheshyam Mopalwar, chairman of MSRDC, said, “We have already gone beyond the call for conserving eco-sensitive zones and will implement suggestions made in the report. Apart from that we will ensure that any improvement suggested by HPC members is also implemented. Our aim is to construct the most greenest and compliant highway in the country.”

The way ahead

* Expert members to meet with other stakeholders on Jan 22

* Site visits on February 4 and 5

* Second meet on February 15

424,['18/01/2020'],FRI holds 2-day training for forest officials,"This story is from January 18, 2020

DEHRADUN: To better forest quality, enhance quantity of forest produce, and ensure sustainable forest management, Dehradun-based Forest Research Institute ( FRI ) organised a two-day training programme for IFS officers of all the states to acquaint them with the process of forest certification.

The training programme, which began on January 16, concluded on Friday. It was organised by the silviculture and forest management division of FRI.

The move aims at utilising forests of the nation to provide financial benefits to respective states and replantation of new plant species that would tap carbon dioxide more efficiently than older trees.

The training programme, titled “Forest Certification in Indian Context”, was inaugurated by Dr SC Gairola, director general of Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE). ""Forest Certification refers to two separate processes — Forest Management Unit Certification (FMU) and Chain of Custody Certification (COC). Forest management certification is a process which verifies that an area of forest /plantations from where the wood, fibre and other non-timber forest products are extracted is managed to a defined standard. COC certification is a process of tracking forest products from the certified forest to the point of sale to ensure that product originated from a certified forest. Forest certification is a rapidly developing subject under sustainable forest management, and most of the forest officials do not have adequate knowledge and experience about it, and are thus not able to apply it in their area,"" he said.

Lectures and interactive discussions were conducted by experts from Bhopal’s Indian Institute of Management, New Delhi’s Indian Export Promotional Council on Handicraft, Noida’s Green Initiatives Certification & Inspection Agency, and state forest departments of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. A half-day field visit to Timber Depot of State Forest Depot at Saharanpur was also arranged for the participants.

Dr MD Omprakash, Indian Institute of Management, Bhopal explained the process of forest certification based on Criteria and Indicators. He also stated, ""Timber importing countries, such as India, should ensure that they import raw material derived from sustainably managed forests; only then their finished products would be saleable in the international market.""

Experts said that there is a 'need to focus on certification of non-wood forest products (NWFP)' as India is a major exporter of NWFP. Dr. S.D. Sharma, Deputy Director General (Research), ICFRE highlighted on the need to address forest certification in the new forest policy of India which is in draft stage.

He said, ""Many developed countries and few developing countries have well established system of forest certification and they export legally extracted timbers which have economic, environmental and social values.""

Bombay high court

MUMBAI: Reminding the state government that the world was watching the “ugly show’’ on the twin Wadia hospitals in Parel, Bombay high court on Friday said no international agency will come forward to share its public health burden.

“Who will partner you here on? Nobody will come forward for philanthropic activities in this state,’’ said a bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Riyaz Chagla. It heard a plea to release grants by the state and BMC to Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital and Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children. Both were rapped over non-release of grants on Thursday.

Advocates Girish Godbole, for the government, and Suresh Pakale, for BMC, said they released Rs 24 crore and Rs 14 crore each. “When you want to release overnight, you do it,’’ said Justice Dharmadhikari. With regard to the remaining amount, Pakale said BMC had to verify the Wadia Trust’s “exorbitant” claims. This was when the judges called for an end to the “royal battle”. “The ugly show in court is communicated to the world. If locals are treated like this, why should strategic partners walk in?’’ asked Justice Dharmadhikari.

Pakale said a competent authority investigated a complaint by Shrikant Hatkar on irregularities and its report confirmed dual salaries were paid. “CEO Dr Minnie Bodhanwalla took salaries from both hospitals,’’ he said. The judges asked if BMC did not know of irregularities. “How many years you allowed it? Why did you not withdraw from the partnership?’’ asked Justice Dharmadhikari. Senior advocate Rafiq Dada, for the trust, said all accounts were audited and signed by BMC members. He also said Hatkar’s complaint was withdrawn. When Pakale said an independent inquiry may verify it, Justice Dharmadhikari said, “…it will also be against your officers.”

Godbole said following a March 2019 meeting the chief trustee had with the then chief minister, it was agreed to hold talks on modification of the trust deed. The judges suggested that the trust’s board meeting be advanced to resolve issues and will be attended by the additional municipal commissioner (health) and a secretary. A formal order will be passed on Tuesday.

Ferry route in Goa. (Photo: Goa river navigation department website/@rnd.goa.gov.in)

PANAJI: The river navigation department’s ( RND ) plans to commercialise the Panaji-Betim ferry route may never see light of the day as the department has not received a thumps-up from the government to impose a fee on commuters travelling on foot and on two-wheelers on this route.

“The file had gone to the government for approval for commercialisation of the Panaji-Betim route after former chief minister Manohar Parrikar had initiated the proposal. The government, however, has asked us not to implement the same,” an RND official said.

The RND wanted to impose a fee of Rs 5 for pedestrian passengers and Rs 10 for two-wheeler vehicles on this route. The fare for the four-wheeler vehicles was to be doubled from the existing fee on all ferry routes.

“We would’ve collected a revenue of at least Rs 1,00,000 per month from the fees if the proposal was accepted,” the official said. On an average day, there are about 11,000 commuters and more than 5000 two-wheelers travelling on the Panaji-Betim ferry route.

The department however has received a green signal for increasing the charges of special trips and hourly charges of hiring ferry boats.

The vessels are usually hired for special trips by commuters to avail the ferry services beyond regular operating hours. The hour-basis hire is for film shootings, weddings or to execute PWD contract works.

The accused, who was carrying a big knife, was roaming in the area. He stopped Pardhi and put his knife on his chest and asked him to hand over his money. Pardhi got off the bike and was trying to reason with him when a passer-by on a bike spotted the incident. The passer-by stopped his bike and rushed to help Pardhi. The duo tried to control Jambhulkar but he got violent and tried to attack them.

During the scuffle, both Pardhi and the passer-by sustained minor injuries, but they managed to nab Jambhulkar.

The passer-by then called police control room and the incident was reported to Sakkardara police station. The cops rushed to the spot and arrested Jambhulkar.

Even pol residents in the Walled City will pay Rs 307 extra

AHMEDABAD: Those living in bungalows and flats in posh areas should expect a steep rise in their property tax bill this municipal election year. After almost six years, municipal commissioner Vijay Nehra in his Rs 8,907 cr budget proposed a 93% to 64% increase in property tax for owners of bungalows with a carpet area more than 100 sq m depending on the neighbourhood, and a 48% increase for owners of flats with a carpet area greater than 750 sq ft. Even pol residents in the Walled City will pay Rs 307 extra.

Nehra’s budget proposal has to be ratified by the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) standing committee and general body before it comes into effect.

Elaborating on the increase in tax, Nehra said the base rate was raised for residential clusters from Rs 16 to Rs 22 and values of factors for properties in posh location and leased properties were also increased from 1.62 to 1.92.

If you are the owner of an independent bungalow, the ownership factor in the tax formula has been increased from 1.5 to 1.8. In case of commercial properties, the base rate has been increased from 28 to 34.

In all, an additional tax burden of Rs 244 crore will be levied on Amdavadis, of which Rs 218 cr will be additional property tax on 16 lakh properties and Rs 26 cr will be derived increased vehicle tax.

“We have withdrawn the 1% relief in vehicle tax for autorickshaws and in case of private vehicles in the luxury segment, which cost more than Rs 15 lakh, we have raised the tax rate to 3% from 2.5%,” says Nehra.

The budget plans to invest Rs 968 cr in 20 flyovers, Rs 152 cr on 15 rail bridges, Rs 600 cr for road modernisation, Rs 500 crore for new multi-level parking complexes in the city and two biodiversity parks worth Rs 200 cr.

Nehra said a special recreation zone like Law Garden will be made in every ward, and one major arterial road in each ward will be modelled on the new CG Road design. He added that Ahmedabad pays the lowest tax among major cities at Rs 744 per capita while the AMC in turn spends Rs 10,727.14 on every citizen. Surat collects an average of Rs 2,302.76 from every citizen while its civic body spends Rs 12,442 on every citizen.

Nehra claimed that the major thrust will be on creating quality sports and social infrastructure. “We will begin work on the Rs 200 cr world-class sports complex and by the end of this budget year we are planning a gymnasium, swimming pool and mini sports complex in every ward.”

After announcing budget provisions for the 600 new electric buses, Nehra said that these buses will have overhead electric charging.

Hyderabad: After nearly 20-day intensive search by eight teams of Cyberabad police, a 35-year-old missing Apple India employee was traced in Pune on Tuesday. Police brought her to the city and handed her over to her family members. K Rohita, an employee of Apple India Pvt Ltd, left her flat at Mantri Celestia apartment, Gachibowli, around 3pm on December 26. While leaving, Rohita left her phone, passport and debit/credit cards at the flat. She did not inform neither her colleagues nor family.

After failing to locate her, the family lodged a complaint with Gachibowli police on December 29 and a missing case was registered. Apart from analysing CCTV camera footage at Gachibowli, the special teams, comprising law and order and Special Operations Team (SOT) sleuths, analysed CCTV camera footage at bus stands, railway stations, airport and Metro stations to locate the missing woman.

“We searched in Secunderabad and at Chandrayangutta after pursuing some leads. Shared her photo with police of neighbouring states. Later, we noticed that a call was received from an unknown number on the landline phone at Rohita’s parent’s house. We found out that the call came from Karnataka and the SIM card from which the call originated was issued in Rohita’s name in Karnataka. Later, the number was located in Bengaluru and subsequently in Pune,” Cyberabad police said.

A four member police team, led by Gachibowli SI Surender Reddy, went to Pune in search of Rohita and searched some hostels. They could not locate her. The police team then went to a job consultancy service office in Vishram Bagh area where Rohita made some calls. “The consultancy staff identified her. On Wednesday when she came to the office to enquire about a job, we identified her. With the assistance of her relatives in Pune and cops of Vishram Bagh police station, we convinced Rohita to return to Hyderabad. In the early hours of Thursday, Rohita was handed over to her family at Gachibowli station,” Srinivas said.

In a video statement, Rohita said that she left Hyderabad on her own and reached Bengaluru in a bus. “From IIIT Junction, I got into a bus and reached Aramgarh. I boarded a bus to Bengaluru and stayed in a PG accommodation for a few days while searching for jobs. From there, I went to Hubli. On January 13, I reached Pune. While I was searching for jobs through a consultancy, a police team reached here and informed me about the missing case. I left Hyderabad on my own and no one kidnapped me,” Rohita said.

Rohita’s brother Parikshit said Surender Reddy’s team worked very hard to locate her and thanked them.

NAGPUR: A 20 year-old girl from Ramtek, identified as Divya Sangode, drowned after she fell into a well following an alleged attack by a herd of wild boars at her farm on Thursday.

The police are investigating the matter to ascertain the actual cause of death. If proven that the girl jumped in the well to avoid being attacked by wild boars, her family will be entitled for compensation from the forest department.

Santosh Thakur, police inspector in-charge of the investigation, said that they are awaiting the post mortem report. “We have registered a case and her body was sent for post mortem. It is only after the report comes that we can reach any conclusion,” said Thakur.

In the meantime, police are speaking with the eyewitnesses and will also get in touch with forest officials. Thakur said, “It is a very unique case but we do get similar instances reported. Injuries and sometimes death are caused by animals, following which the forest department too gets involved.”

It is learnt, the Sangode family was working at their farm when a herd of wild boars appeared there. The family took evasive actions to avoid the wild boars. During the melee, Divya seems to have jumped in an open well on the farm. A final report by the police is awaited.

Deputy forest conservator Prabhunath Shukla could not be reached for a comment on the incident.

Hyderabad: Enforcement directorate probe revealed that managing director and other functionaries of Leonia Resorts created 33 shell companies in name of employees and diverted funds in loan fraud case . ED arrested accused MD GS Chakravarthy Raju and senior employee AV Prasad under Prevention of Money Laundering Act.

The total outstanding loan amount defaulted is Rs 1,768 crore. ED said that the accused siphoned off hundreds of crores of loan amount from Leo Meridian Infrastructure Projects & Hotels Limited (LMIPHL) to shell companies.

In December 2019, ED had attached assets worth Rs 250 crore of the accused after a probe based on a FIR filed by the CBI. The CBI had alleged that the accused took loan of Rs 700 crore from a consortium of banks-led Bank of Baroda and defaulted on the same. The accused, in an illegal layout, sold plots to 315 persons and mortgaged the same to banks to get loan for resort project. Funds up to Rs 250 crore were diverted using contractors. ED has so far identified and attached 3,43,17,948 shares of promoters, 76,62,434 benami shares, 11 immovable properties of Raju and his family and 38 immovable properties in names of benamis.

ED, in its arrest report, said the accused floated 40 contractor firms in names of LMIPHL employees. Part of diverted funds was channelled back into LMIPHL as investments using Kolkata based jama-kharch companies. “Accused created large number of bogus invoices and bogus provision of material and services and diverted to contractors. In fund trail it was found that large portions of these diverted loan funds were cyclically rotated back into LMIPHL to create bogus exaggerated capital works in progress and in turn bogus fixed assets. This was done to cheat the banks into giving more loans and to match the asset side of the balance sheets with the liability side,” ED said.

ED also added that by using bogus capital equity and bonus shares taken on fake balance sheets, Raju and his family came to own 95% of the company without investing any real personal money.

LMIPHL never maintained cash ledger, invoices for construction activities, fixed asset registers and did not provide the same for probe. “Over the years many lands were transferred to benami names and suspect tenancy rights were created by accused persons using local influence,” ED said.

The forest department will provide a platform for naturalists, experts, forest officers and bird photographers to meet and share their insights. This will open new vistas for ecotourism in Goa’s hinterland,” the chief minister said during the inauguration of the third edition of the festival at Valpoi .

Sawant said that Goa’s Western Ghats has an exceptionally rich biodiversity and the area is emerging as an eco- and hinterland tourism destination. “Coupled with the rich 450-species strong bird diversity, it is a perfect destination for birders and bird tourism,” Sawant said.

A total of 52 delegates from India and abroad, including students are participating in the festival, which is being held in the Sattari taluka from January 17 to 19.

AHMEDABAD: If the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) begins work on all 35 flyovers and railway under-bridges planned for the coming financial year, prepare to face traffic jams for at least the next couple of years.

In its budget for 2020-21, the AMC proposed 20 flyovers and 15 railways under-bridges and the state and Union governments have approved these projects.

The governments have sanctioned Rs 968 crore for these bridges and railway under-bridges. A senior officer said that being an election year, work on all these projects will likely begin simultaneously and will consequently lead to traffic congestion everywhere.

The state government had recently sanctioned seven new flyovers, worth Rs 335 crore. These flyovers are part of the budget and were sanctioned under the Swarnim Jayanti Chief Minister Urban Development Scheme (SJCMUDS).

However, the government has decided to release just 10% of the total cost, i.e. Rs 33.50 crore. The remaining funds will be released in phases. These seven flyovers are part of the 20 proposed in the budget.

Ponda: A day after Goa State Milk Producers’ Union better known as Goa Dairy hiked the rate of cattle feed by Rs 4 per kg, milk producing farmers staged a sit-in agitation on the dairy’s campus. They demanded that either the hike be rolled back or the rate at which the dairy procured milk from them be increased.

Heated arguments were witnessed between the dairy staff and agitating farmers and police had to be called in to control the situation.

The union raised the rate of cattle feed by Rs 4 per kg from Thursday claiming that it was essential to offset losses at its cattle feed plant at Usgao

The farmers demanded that they be given a two-third hike in milk procurement rate, which translates to an increase Rs 3 per litre.

According to the milk union, the plant is running in losses as rates of some the ingredients used to produce cattle feed have gone up after they were brought under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Our feed is much cheaper than that sold by others, the union said.

The union’s plant provides cattle feed to village-level milk collection societies which supply it to its farmers in the state.

440,['18/01/2020'],"‘If there is gadbad in NPR, our cabinet will take a call’","This story is from January 18, 2020

Hyderabad: TRS working president KT Rama Rao tells Robin David and Koride Mahesh that the Telangana government has kept its options open on NPR and NRC, and why he believes BJP is no challenge for his party in the state

You have not taken a clear stand on NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens) despite parties friendly to you, like AIMIM, requesting to reject the two. Why?

A: On CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) at least our stands is clear. Chief minister and party president KCR Ji told our party MPs to say in both houses of Parliament that we are a secular party, which does not believe in any kind of discrimination or differentiation based on religion. The one demand we raised was to include the word ‘Muslim’ in the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. They did not do it, so we voted against it. There is no change in that stand.

With respect to NPR and NRC, we as a party take decisions at an opportune time. We will cross the bridge when we get to it. Also, there is no communique on NRC from anyone. NPR, they say, is a usual thing that happens with the Census. If you are looking at NPR and NRC through the prism of CAA, then the home minister has contradicted himself. He says that the Prime Minister is right and he was wrong (on linking CAA with NRC).

So, are you going ahead with NPR in Telangana?

A: The fact is, so far, we have received nothing in writing (from the Centre) on this.

Some political parties have alleged that NPR is backdoor entry for NRC in the country. Your take.

A: Like I said, we have received no official communication on NRC. NPR, they say, is part of census, which happens every 10 years, but if we find that their (Centre’s) intentions are not clean, and if there is some ‘gadbad’, then we will definitely take a call in our cabinet. But at present there is no official communique. There is no point talking in thin air.

Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi has requested your government to reject NPR.

A: At the end of the day, Owaisi saab has to run an independent political party. He doesn’t answer to us, nor we to him. We have our own ideas and priorities. He can, of course, demand (that NPR be rejected) as Hyderabad MP and as president of a political party with a standing in Telangana. But the onus is on the government to take an appropriate decision at an appropriate time.

How is your relationship with the Centre now that you have voted against CAA? You have said recently that you have not been included in a number of projects like the defence industrial manufacturing corridor.

A: Let me disassociate a few things. We have supported the central government on GST when they called it ‘one-nation one-tax’. We also supported demonetisation as the Prime Minister spoke to the chief minister, and said we would go towards ‘poorna kranti’. We also supported them on the election of the President and Vice-President. But on CAB, we said it was against national interest. Our support has always been issue-based. We are, after all, an independent party and not subordinate to either Prime Minister Modi or (Congress chief) Sonia Gandhi. No one is our boss except the people of Telangana and we will follow their wishes.

But you have not been made part of a number of central projects.

A: When our chief minister comes up with a project or an agenda, he does not differentiate between TRS constituencies and other party constituencies. We believe Telangana is our state, let it be any infrastructure project like Mission Kakatiya or Mission Bhagiratha. Unfortunately, Government of India has not followed a similar principle. When it came to defence industrial corridor, there had to be a logic, a rationale behind it. Hyderabad and Bangalore have had defence establishments for decades because of geopolitical and strategic reasons. As a result, a large defence ecosystem has been created.

In 2017, I had told the then defence minister (Nirmala Sitharaman) that you must look at Hyderabad and Bangalore for a defence corridor to strengthen the ecosystem. Unfortunately, it went to Bundelkhand and between Chennai and Coimbatore. That was befuddling. Also, you can give defence land to the state government in Lucknow, but you don’t give it to us despite asking for it for four years.

Besides, why is there only one DMIC (Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor) in the country? You have only a handful of cities of the size of Hyderabad. I can’t understand why we don’t leverage these vibrant metropolises. Why can’t we have a southern industrial corridor between Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai? My demand is justified. If it is not justified, I should be told. We have been asking for a bullet train, but it goes to DMIC again. Why can’t Delhi be linked to Kanyakumari via Hyderabad? At least when (AB) Vajpayee was the Prime Minister, there was the Golden Quadrilateral. This is not criticism. This is a genuine grouse.

How many seats will TRS will in the civic elections?

A: Our party will secure lion’s share of seats in the 120 municipalities and municipal corporations. The party has swept all elections like ZP, gram panchayat and Huzurnagar bye-elections.

But there is a lot of dissidence in your party.

A: There was a huge demand for tickets as the elections are being fought on party symbol. About 8,000 had filed nominations claiming TRS official nominee. Ninety per cent of them have withdrawn from the fray and only 10% are still in the fray as rebels. There would be no impact on our winning chances.

BJP is looking to make inroads into Telangana. They want to be the main opposition now.

A: TRS is not considering BJP as a threat in the state. If BJP has Amit Shah, TRS has KCR. I have been observing BJP in Telangana since my school days, and it has not improved its strength since then. What it was then, it is now. There is a hungama on BJP’s strength in the state as the party is in power at the Centre.

But you can’t deny the fact that BJP secured four Lok Sabha seats in the 2019.

A: I admit TRS could not get 16 Lok Sabha seats as we had planned. We got only nine seats. May be people thought the elections were being fought on national issues and between two national parties — Congress and BJP — and TRS was marginalised. But it bounced back and swept zilla parishad elections, which were held 10 to 15 days after Lok Sabha polls. TRS even swept Karimnagar, Adilabad and Nizamabad where BJP MPs had won.

In hindsight, do you think the idea of a federal front ahead of Lok Sabha elections was premature?

A: I would not say so. TRS had aimed for 16 Lok Sabha seats and got only nine seats. But still the party got more seats than all other opposition parties together (four BJP, three Congress and one MIM). BJP is losing states and definitely regional parties will now definitely have a role to play nationally. When it comes to TRS, our party has 15 MPs (nine Lok Sabha and six in Rajya Sabha). Two more MPs would be added in Rajya Sabha next month as elections are due. As the BJP does not have required number and majority in Rajya Sabha, TRS has a big role to play in Delhi. Seventeen MPs is not a small number.

Does the economic slowdown in the country impact Telangana’s welfare schemes? Rythu Bandhu funds have been delayed, loan waiver has not been announced…

A: The TRS government is committed for implementing all welfare schemes. The state has been spending about Rs 40,000 crore on welfare schemes. It is the duty of a democratic government to take care of the vulnerable given that we are still a developing country. Farm loan waiver might be implemented in four instalments like in the previous term. Cash flows, especially from the Centre, may affect some of these schemes, but the chief minister is committed to them. He will find a way. At present, there is no proposal to put caps on Rythu Bandhu scheme. Yes, if there are any systemic inefficiencies, we will rectify them.

Nashik: City police have seized 10 high-end cars and Sports Utility Vehicle (SUVs) from 10 agents of a financial company whose directors have cheated a large number of people by promising hefty returns on their investments.

Commissioner of police Vishwas Nangare-Patil said the 10 cars were seized from the agents concerned last week during the investigation of the case. These vehicles are worth Rs 3.33 crore.

“A case of cheating was registered with Mumbai Naka police station in May last year. The complainant in the case had stated that the director of a company along with few others had set up an office in Nashik and floated different financial schemes. Under the scheme, the directors took Rs 53.43 lakh from the complainant between the year 2015 and 2019 and later turned away from giving the assured interest on the investment and the principal amount,” the top cop said.

“After a complaint was lodged it was found that the directors concerned cheated the investors to the tune of at least Rs 3.83 crore,” he added.

The police found that the concerned directors had taken deposits from investors and later the agents, who brought the investors, were given full financial assistance to buy high-end cars.

After the offence was registered police prepared seven different teams to trace the agents and other directors involved in the cheating case. The teams were sent to Mumbai, Pune, Ahmednagar, Nashik, Solapur and Jalgaon.

“The directors involved in the case got anticipatory bail ever since an offence has been registered against them. However, police have frozen 27 bank accounts of the concerned directors. However, police have been able to recover only Rs 10 lakh from the bank accounts,” a police officer said.

Police have appealed to the investors to contact them with the necessary documents to register offences against the directors.

The plant aims to supply piped water to new township at Kadamba Plateau in Bainguinim-Old Goa and enhance wate... Read More

PONDA: After much delay, the newly constructed 27-MLD water treatment plant at Curti-Opa was commissioned on Friday. The plant aims to supply piped water to new township at Kadamba Plateau in Bainguinim-Old Goa and enhance water supply to Panaji.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant , after commissioning the plant said that Goa is the first state in India where 78% houses get tapped water. “Most of the remaining houses come under wildlife forest where pipelines cannot be laid. But the government would pump the bore well water and supply it those areas after filtering it,” he said adding that he expects the work to complete by March end.

Sawant also assured that the contractual workers attached to PWD would be absorbed under a society by April this year. Stating that the contract workers are performing better and that they should get their minimum wages directly, the chief minister said that the workers get their salary after deductions by the labour contractor and he wants to abolish the contractor system.

PWD Minister Deepak Pauskar said that his department would soon implement spot billing to ensure that the consumers get their water bills every month. “The government also mulls to bring in smart meters for five years and the issue is being studied,” he said.

The existing plants at Opa treat 125-130MLD of water to meet the drinking needs of the Ponda and Tiswadi talukas. While 62-65MLD is supplied to Tiswadi taluka, the requirement for the state capital and areas in its vicinity continues to increase. PWD officials peg the current shortfall of treated water to Panaji and surrounding areas at15MLD. The new plant at Opa is expected to make up for this shortfall.

Work on the plant began in 2013 and was expected to be completed by 2015.

444,['18/01/2020'],Power consumption of Tamil Nadu during this Pongal lowest in recent years,"Representative image

CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu’s power consumption this Pongal was the lowest in recent years. Power consumption on Wednesday, when the state celebrated ‘Kaanum Pongal’, was 219 million units, against 274 million units registered during last year’s Pongal. It is lower than the power consumption last Diwali, when it was 244.96 million units.Sources in Tangedco attributed the lower consumption to general economic slowdown, which had to a large extent affected industrial power consumption. While industrial units are shut during all festivals every year, the slowdown was a major reason behind the lower power consumption this year during Pongal, sources said.Meanwhile, Tangedco has also been able to juggle its power production by keeping many of its thermal units on standby and meeting the power demand with power sourced from central units and private power companies since the tariff was low.“Power is available in the electricity market at a lower tariff due to lower demand in northern states on account of the prevailing colder climate in the region,” a senior Tangedco official told TOI.This has worked to Tangedco’s benefit on other fronts too. By not using its thermal units, the discom is also saving coal, which will come in handy in months when the temperature increases and power demand goes up. “We have been conserving coal as power is available in the market at a cheaper cost. Our units will be generating more power mostly from middle of February, as by then the demand in the market will increase leading to increase in tariff,” said the official.Tangedco’s thermal units have generated 17,484.62 million units between April and December, 2019. Whereas, 20,510.61 million units were generated during the same period in 2018. The discom has a total 4320MW of thermal unit capacity. As per the data released by Central Electricity Authority, the plant load factor of the Tangedco units is 57.04% compared to previous year’s 67.09%.According to the official, the discom will have to depend only on its own thermal units till April, besides tapping power from other regular sources. “Wind power will be available only from mid-April. Till then, we need coal to generate power in our units,” said the official.Tangedco was also fortunate to have generated more hydro power last year, thanks to the favourable monsoons. “With the dams full and water being released, hydro power generation had begun even during southwest monsoon. Hydro power is available now too and we are using it as it is pollution-free and the cost of hydro power is one of the lowest among all power sources,” he said.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73345622,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-453331,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/power-consumption-of-state-during-this-pongal-lowest-in-recent-years/articleshow/73340268.cms

Ranchi: JVM-P chief Babulal Marandi on Thursday kept the guessing game on his possible move to BJP going. Marandi returned to the state capital on Thursday after an overseas trip. Speaking to journalists at the party’s headquarters, the former chief minister did not come clean when asked whether speculations about him are true.

“Not only the BJP but several political parties have offered me to join them in the past. There is nothing new in it,” Marandi said. “If at all such a thing happens, you will all be informed about it in advance,” he added.

Speculations have been rife for more than a fortnight that Marandi has been contemplating a move to the saffron party after getting an offer from the latter. Although BJP has not made any statement officially, rumour mills are agog that the party, which is on the hunt for a tribal face after its defeat in the recently concluded state assembly polls, has offered Marandi the post of the leader of opposition.

Marandi gave unconditional support of JVM-P’s three MLAs (including himself) to the JMM-led coalition government under chief minister Hemant Soren, even before the latter staked claimed to form the government. The 62-year-old had opted out of the coalition ahead of the assembly polls citing delay in seat-sharing talks. Before the results were declared, Marandi had ruled out any possibility of a post-poll alliance with BJP.

“There were speculations about me before also. But I do not give much importance to them and do my job with devotion,” Marandi said when prodded further. Without naming BJP, he said, “I see no harm if someone tries to get something.”

While Marandi remained non-committal, his two MLAs — Pradeep Yadav and Bandhu Tirkey — have announced publicly that they won’t go to BJP in case of a merger . On Thursday, Tirkey even asked Marandi to come clean on the issue. JVM-P sources told TOI that several of its district units are in favour of a merger.

A self-confessed cricket fan, Varun says he is now looking forward to '83, which features Ranveer Singh as Kapil.Though Varun maintains that he may not have been convincing in his look, he is sure that no other actor can nail Kapil Dev’s famous bowling action like he does. “I have had the same bowling action since childhood. In fact, in a friendly match in Mumbai, S Sreesanth pointed it out and said that my action is exactly like that of Kapil paaji,” says Varun who is currently acting in the television show Mere Dad ki Dulhan. “For Azhar, the makers called me a couple of days prior to the shoot so I didn’t have any time to prepare. But, no matter how good or bad I looked on screen, I knew one thing for sure that even at 4 in the morning if anyone told me to bowl like Kapil Dev, I would get that right"" he adds.Ask him about Ranveer’s look in Kabir Khan ’s '83 and Varun smiles, “He’s done a fabulous job with the look! I'm yet to see how he gets the mannerisms onscreen, but one thing I can bet for- he can’t get Kapil paaji’s bowling action as perfectly as I can!”Varun who plays cricket in reali life too, shares that he is in touch with most members of the 1983 World Cup winning team. “I am personally in touch with most of the team. Jimmy paaji ( Mohinder Amarnath ), Ballu paaji (Balwinder Singh Sandhu) and Sandeep paaji (Sandeep Patil) are good friends and I’ve even played with Kapil paaji.”The telly actor, a huge Kapil Dev fan, says that there can never be another like the cricketer. “For the longest time, everyone has tried to get into Kapil paaji’s shoes, but no one knows what size shoes he wears! Kapil paaji can win any game he plays. A sports club in Delhi had put up a billiards table. Kapil paaji ne waha 100 ke break maarne shuru kar diye. Toh baaki logon ne khelna band kar diya soch ke ki ye aadmi table pakdega toh chodega nahi. I played a tennis ball cricket tournament with him in Goa. He was 54 then and at that age he ran and caught a flat catch! Kandha toh gaya, but what was commendable that he was so agile at that age.

Mumbai: HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh called for maintaining values of the Indian Constitution, stating that ""while times and circumstances change, strong values and principles do not"". The veteran banker quoted eminent jurist, the late Nani Palkhivala, who had said that the Constitution should not be subject to ""hasty and ill-conceived"" change.

Parekh was delivering the vote of thanks at the 17th Nani Palkhivala memorial lecture which was delivered by N Chandrasekaran, chairman, Tata Sons who spoke of ""suspicion and micro-management"" as the impediments faced by businesses in India.

Parekh pointed out that this was Palkhivala's birth centenary and his memories endured because of his values and beliefs. Quoting Palkhivala, Parekh said: ""Our Constitution is primarily shaped and moulded for the common man...The great makers of our Constitution clearly intended that the integrity of the Constitution should be preserved against any hasty or ill-considered changes.""

Palkhivala, who passed away in 2002, was a staunch defender of the constitution and had argued in several cases of constitutional importance.

Pointing out that the quotes were 50 years old, Parekh said, ""The inferences are for you to interpret, but to my mind, it still seems starkly relevant in these present times.""

Parekh highlighted another quote from Palkhivala: ""With the growing powers of government all over the world, it is eminently desirable for any democracy to have fundamental rights which cannot be curtailed or abrogated."" He said that while we should hold on to the learning that Palkhivala left behind, it is important not to be consumed by ""pessimism and doom-mongering"". ""I am an optimist. I am confident about the future of India and that our youth will see India's best days,"" said Parekh.

HYDERABAD: Respondents to the National Population Register, 2020 questionnaire will have to tell the government if their parents were born in India or in a foreign country, if the trial run conducted last year is any indication. If the parents were born in India, one will have to indicate the state and district. If they were not born outside India, the country will have to be mentioned.

This is one of two new questions that the questionnaire for the trial run, conducted in select states between October and December, had. The second question was about giving Aadhaar number, PAN number, driving license, mobile number and voter ID. Both these questions were missing in the 2010 final format NPR .

The pre-test is a mandatory exercise conducted to find out if there are any difficulties in obtaining answers. It also gives an indication on how people are responding to the questions. Sources in the government said that there can be small modifications in the final format of the questionnaire when NPR is finally rolled out.

Sources said that asking for details of country of origin of parents could become a contentious issue given the ongoing protests in different parts of the country over the CAA. Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and other opposition leaders have been alleging that NPR is backdoor entry for a country-wide National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC).

Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma

GUWAHATI: Denying that "" religious persecution "" was a criterion for offering Indian nationality to Hindu and other select communities under the amended citizenship law, Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday claimed that watertight rules were being framed to detect ""fraudulent conversion"" and ensure strict compliance with the December 31, 2014, cut-off.

""There are three criteria for applying for citizenship. First, one has to be either a Hindu, Jain, Parsi, Christian, Sikh or Buddhist. Second, the applicant's country of origin has to be either Bangladesh , Afghanistan or Pakistan . Third, the applicant should have proof of residence in India before December 31, 2014. Religious persecution is not a criterion,"" Sarma told TOI.

He pointed out that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has no provision for granting Indian nationality to a person on grounds of religious persecution because there was no way of proving an applicant faced such an ordeal before fleeing any of the three countries of origin.

""How can an applicant prove he or she is a victim of religious persecution or fled the country of origin and entered India owing to fear of religious persecuti-on? To get such proof, a person has to go back to Bangladesh or the other two countries and get a police certificate. Why should Banglade-sh, for instance, admit there is religious persecution?""

CHENNAI: A man from Ambattur who bought a new i-Phone 5S from Mintkart (formerly known as e-bay) in 2017 but instead found a fake cellphone in the package he got has been awarded Rs 25,000 by a local consumer grievances redressal forum.

M Sundararajan had booked the 5S through PayPal India, an authorised e-bay dealer from Sholinganallur, and choose to pay by cash. When he opened the package, he found a fake i-Phone . He immediately informed e-bay and sent an e-mail requesting replacement.

The firm denied Sundararajan's claim and sent him the seller's contact details. But there was no response from the seller. As his complaints went unattended, M Sundararajan approached the consumer forum.

As legal notices too went unanswered, the consumer forum recently told the parties concerned to replace the phone and pay the fine.

In another case reported last week, the forum penalised the Tambaram Sub-Registrar for entering wrong details in the encumbrance certificate (EC) issued to a resident from Velachery.

The complainant, A Muruganandam, purchased a flat at Marutham Gem Apartment at Madambakkam in May 2017 from M V Subramanian. The aale deed was executed and documents were registered.

Muruganandam applied for EC in March 2018 but found the Tambaram Sub-Registrar office got the names of buyer and seller wrong in the certificate. The sub-registrar agreed to rectify it soon. When he checked online after a month, the seller's name had been corrected but not the buyer's name. Another complaint was filed. This time both the names were again wrong in the EC.

So Muruganandam approached the forum, which directed the sub-registrar to pay 15,000 as fine for deficiency in service and compensation. The forum also directed the sub-registrar to issue the correct EC.

451,['18/01/2020'],Hazy picture on CRZ norms violations,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Are builders in Visakhapatnam flouting Coastal Regulation Zone norms and constructing buildings along the coastline of the Port City?

In the last few years, several activists from the city had filed RTI queries seeking the status of constructions in the city violating CRZ norms. However, the civic body has not replied to a single RTI.

“Along the 136-km-long coastline of Visakhapatnam district we have identified around 37 constructions violating norms. Most of them are within the city limits. There are more constructions which are under the scanner. But the civic body is not paying any heed to our RTI queries,” said Arijili Dasu, an activist protesting against illegal constructions on Beach Road.

Activists said, the constructions include both private and government properties — hotels, residential and commercial complexes and even a temple by an international organisation.

“The stretch from Rushikonda towards Bheemli on Beach Road is most vulnerable. A few properties violating CRZ are under construction on this stretch. The government and the local civic body should stop these projects,” said Sohan Hatangadi, an environmentalist from Visakhapatnam.

The Supreme Court on September 27, 2019 directed the Kerala government to demolish flats built on the coastal zone of Kochi's Maradu in 138 days and to pay Rs 25 lakh interim compensation to each flat owner within four weeks. Following this, a section of activists in Visakhapatnam are also planning to move court.

“If GVMC does not take steps against these constructions we have to think about moving court. The size of Visakhapatnam beach is shrinking by the day and this will eventually have a significant impact on the environment,” added Dasu.

When TOI contacted builders in the port city, they said they had all necessary clearances from authorities concerned. “We don’t want to comment on the issue. We are not doing anything illegal and we have required clearances from authorities for whatever it is that we are doing,” said a builder from Visakhapatnam.

GVMC officials claim they are not giving any ‘fresh’ permission for construction on Beach Road. “We have roped in a private agency from Chennai and they would soon submit a status report on what we can do along the coastline,” a GVMC official added.

Visakhapatnam: In what comes as good news for the safety situation of Visakhapatnam, the city police claim that they have not received a single burglary complaint in the city so far this year. The Sankranti season is otherwise infamous for thefts in locked homes and burglaries spike around this time.

Only last year, nearly 10 burglaries were reported in Vizag during the Sankranti vacation. The vacation often turns into an open season for thieves who strike upon locked homes while owners are away and decamp with valuables.

DS Sravan Kumar, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) of Central Crime Station (CCS) said, “We intensified night patrol during the festival and also appealed to residents to take all necessary precautionary measures before setting out of their home in order to prevent property offences.”

“Our efforts have yielded good results this year as not a single case of burglary was reported in the city,” ACP Kumar said.

According to the police, more than 70 per cent of those who had gone out of the city to celebrate Sankranti have returned to the city by Friday. The remaining 30 per cent is anticipated to return either within the weekend or by Monday, police sources informed.

“We are planning to take more measures to prevent thefts in the coming days,” said a police official.

Visakhapatnam: The practice of men travelling in women ’s coaches in trains seems to be going on unabated despite efforts by railway authorities including the RPF (Railway Protection Force).

The RPF has registered numerous cases against this which goes on to show the extent of the problem. The problem gets significantly exacerbated during festivals as well as the summers, in general, whenever there is a rush. Night trains are particularly subject to this issue.

According to Jitendra Srivastava, the senior security commissioner of RPF Waltair division, a total of 7,151 male passengers have been prosecuted for travelling in coaches reserved for women in 2019 and fine worth Rs6.9 lakh has been realised.

“The major complaint we receive is to do with husbands travelling with their wives in women-only coaches. The coaches are meant exclusively for women and people with disabilities,” Srivastava added.

He also said that passengers can dial railway helpline number 182 if they face any problem while travelling in coaches reserved for women.

Meanwhile, a railway official informed that of the 18 trains originating from Visakhapatnam, only 7 have railway coaches reserved for women. These include Godavari Express, LTT Visakhapatnam-Mumbai Express, Samata Express and Chennai Express. The railway provides a general class coach with these trains for women passengers.

RPF sources said that youngsters often try to enter the women-only coaches during night travel.

“Not just male passengers, unauthorised hawkers are also found in these coaches,” said a woman passenger who regularly travels in these coaches.

Male passengers travelling in women’s compartments can be punished with up to six months of imprisonment and/or a fine according to the Railway Act.

“We all know why Jana Sena was floated. It was done to serve the political interests of the TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu. The tie-up shouldn’t be viewed as a new development. It dates back to when the BJP and TDP were allies in 2014. However, this tie-up is also an indication of the end of the pretence of Jana Sena as a political party with independent motives,” Amarnath pointed out.

Visakhapatnam: The Anakapalle jaggery market in Visakhapatnam district which is the second-biggest jaggery market in the country is now faced with another challenge. While jaggery-makers in this region prefer to make bigger lumps weighing 10-12kgs, wholesalers now prefer smaller lumps weighing less than 5kgs.

As a result, jaggery wholesalers from Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand are importing jaggery from other states. While the Anakapalle jaggery is renowned for its quality, over the last few years, wholesalers have begun procuring jaggery from Odisha and Maharashtra. Consequently, the demand for Anakapalle jaggery is witnessing a slump.

KV Sarath Kumar, whose family has been in the jaggery business for three generations, now told TOI that traditional jaggery buyers from Odisha and West Bengal are choosing to procure it from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh because of the lower cost and smaller size of lumps.

“Since retail customers like to buy jaggery in smaller quantities, wholesalers are also switching to smaller lumps as they do not have to break them before selling,” Sarath Kumar added.

M Satynarayana, another jaggery trader in Anakapalle agrees with Sarath. He said, “We have decided to educate jaggery-makers in Anakapalle to produce smaller lumps in order to compete and have also decided on providing them financial support to convince them to switch to making smaller lumps.”

Meanwhile, K Suryanarayana, a jaggery-maker said, “We need the latest machinery and more manpower to produce smaller jiggery lumps. If there is no further investment and increase in manpower, most jiggery-makers will continue to produce the bigger lumps.”

Traders further say that the amount of jaggery reaching the market has been decreasing over the last few years. While the market received 18,000 tonnes of jaggery in 2016-17, the quantity dropped to 12,000 tonnes in 2017-18 and subsequently to 10,000 tonnes in 2018-19, they say.

“We are expecting that around 8,000 tonnes of jaggery will come into the market this time,” a trader said.

“If we fail to compete, the Anakapalle jaggery market will lose its glory,” another trader said.

Where will these end up?

Visakhapatnam: While civic bodies in the city are focussed on effective management of waste by source segregation, the management of floral waste remains largely ignored.

A huge amount of floral waste is generated in the city. The sources of this waste consist primarily of temples, rythu bazaars and flower shops. Floral waste which can be turned into manure often ends up in landfills mixed with other waste.

Environmentalists say that floral waste is thrown directly into water bodies. As a result, harmful pesticides and insecticides used to grow these flowers make way into water bodies disturbing the fragile ecosystem.

Speaking to TOI, a GVMC official said, “Floral waste is generated in every ward, depending upon the location of temples. Usually more than 1,000kgs of floral waste is generated per month. During festivals, it goes up to more than 2,000kgs.”

Taking stock of the problem, a city-based startup called Green Waves Environmental Solutions has decided to take up an initiative to recycle floral waste. Anil Chowdary, the managing director of the NGO said, “We have started collecting floral waste from near areas where religious celebrations are done. Upon collecting them, we use the flowers to make incense sticks, flower manure and soap.”

Anil further said that religious institutions have been supporting their initiative considering it takes away their landfill burden. “We mostly receive marigolds, roses, hibiscuses and chrysanthemums,” Anil informed while adding that they also receive a lot of tulsi and betel leaves.

KSLG Sastry, CMOH of GVMC said, “As of now, the floral waste generated in the city is processed along with wet waste. However, from this year on, we will be concentrating on proper collection, segregation and transportation of different kinds of waste.”

“We are planning to set up a special unit to recycle floral waste in wards where flower waste generation is high. The waste will be converted into manure,” he added.

NEW DELHI: Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari urged states to implement the amended Motor Vehicles Act while giving a cold shoulder to a demand from Rajasthan to reduce penalties. He said only those who violate rules face the risk of paying hefty fines and the improved law favours law-abiding commuters.

He was responding to a demand from Rajasthan government to reduce traffic fines and penalties under the amended law, which came up at the 39th meeting of Transport Development Council here on Thursday. ""When it was brought to his notice that a two-wheeler driver was slapped with huge fines, the minister said he was aware about the case.

He asked whether such persons who commit multiple offences should be allowed to go scot free?"" said an official, who was present in the meeting.

Sources said Assam was the only state of those present to commit to implement the central law in totality. Gadkari also warned officials responsible for faulty engineering and road designs of strict action as road accidents have huge impact on country's economy.

Belagavi: The inmates of Hindalga Central Prison may soon join the fight against plastic. Plans are afoot to set up a tailoring unit of 50 men to make cora cotton carry bags which are becoming increasingly popular after the ban on polythene.

The Hindalga prison in Belagavi, opened in 1923, is one of the oldest prisons in the Karnataka. The jail is well-equipped to produce bags from scratch: prisoners will, in fact, weave the cloth required for the bags from cotton thread.

The Central Prison at Hindalga are charting out plan of action to sew eco-friendly bags using cora clothes. These carry-bags to be prepared by prison inmates as a transformational-cum-skill development activity.

Prison authorities are in talks with a private textile company, B B Patil Textiles of Ichalkaranji in Kolhapur district of Maharashtra, for supply of thread and marketing of the bags. Officials of the company have already visited Hindalga and spoken with the authorities.

“We have discussed about the supply of thread. Besides, the company should purchase the bags and market them on their own,” chief superintendent of police (prisons) Krishna Kumar said. “The prices will be discussed. The company will also have to pay the wages of the prisoners which is Rs 150 per person per day.”

Besides being a transformational and skill development activity for the prisoners, it will sensitise them to ecological concerns, he said. A project report will be prepared and sent to the higher-ups in the department for approval.

Around 50 male prisoners will weave the cloth and stitch bags. There is a training unit where tailoring and weaving is taught after which inmates proceed to the working unit. The prison has 27 weaving machines and 37 advanced tailoring machines through which vocational training is imparted.

Ballari: The teaching and non-teaching staff of Vijayanagar Sri Krishnadevaraya University (VSKU) were in for a rude shock on Friday as they were issued a “decent dress code”: women must stick to saris while men must not turn up in jeans and t-shirt.

While staff members opposed the directive and wondered what had triggered it, registrar Bhadravati K Tulasimala, who issued the circular, said there was nothing wrong with prescribing work wear.

“As the university is a temple of higher education, we are being watched and followed by many students. As staff, we have to be very cautious about our dress code . We have noticed that the trend of wearing jeans and t-shirt and churidar is picking up among staff, so we have to curtail it now to uphold the dignity of higher education,” the registrar said.

The circular, issued on January 13, directed teaching and non-teaching staff, permanent and on contract, to wear only “formal dress” while coming to work at the university. While men have been asked not to wear jeans and t-shirts, women staff have been told that sari is “first priority” and they may wear churidar only if it is “very necessary”.

Several faculty members said the so-called code was unwarranted and insulting. “We dress very decently to work and have never crossed the line though there was no code. The government has been stressing that its employees wear formals to work but no official circular has been sent. We don’t know why all of a sudden, such a circular has been issued,” said a staff member.

The registrar too cited the unstated government emphasis on formal wear and said, “my intention was to make our university a model one in Karnataka by upholding some values… We have to set an example for our students by practising a simple and decent dress code.”

She added that the circular was issued after consultations and the staff must fall in line. “I have issued this circular after holding a meeting with all varsity officials concerned and under the guidance of our vice-chancellor. Though we have not mentioned any specific date for following the decent dress code, issuing a circular means it should be implemented with immediate effect. I expect all 200 staff, including non-teaching members, to follow it and wear only formals,” Tulasimala said.

Stranded trekkers board an IAF helicopter at Niraq in Ladakh.

NEW DELHI: Advance planning and quick reaction by the Leh district administration saved over 100 lives after two groups of trekkers and their crew were marooned in sub-zero temperatures when sudden gush of snowmelt submerged parts of the ‘Chadar’ trek route on the frozen Zanskar river in the newly-created Union Territory of Ladakh .

At around 6.30 pm last Saturday, communication lines at the district headquarters crackled to life. The message was terse: About 71 trekkers and their support personnel were trapped between Camps 2 and 3 at Tibb and Neyraks villages, respectively, some 70 km from Leh, as the frozen river patch became inundated. Whereabouts of 40-odd trekkers were uncertain.

“This year we had posted three SDRF (State Disaster Relief Force) personnel and team guides, who are expert mountaineers or trekkers, at each of the three camps for emergency response. This came in handy and we immediately activated these personnel to start locating the trekkers and alerted the IAF ( Indian Air Force ) for imminent evacuation in the morning,” Leh deputy commissioner Sachin Kumar Vaishya told TOI on Friday.

These rescue teams carried out the search operation through the next day and guided the trekkers to safer ground as water level kept rising, making the frozen patches risky to cross. Vaishya also praised the support staff for their knowledge of the topography and help. Bad weather, however, stalled evacuation by air on Sunday and began only after the weather cleared.

The incident forced the administration to suspend the trek for two days to avoid putting “more groups at risk” if the snow kept melting at such faster pace. Concerned locals at Leh told TOI over phone the incident underpins the negative impact of unchecked tourism on Ladakh’s fragile ecology and should be taken as a warning sign.

The annual trek is globally known for the out-of-this-world view it affords the trekkers. It is also notorious for the perilous journey on the frozen river bed, with temperature dipping 30 degrees below freezing.

CHANDIGARH: Punjab on Friday became the second state after Kerala to pass an assembly resolution seeking repeal of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act, with chief minister Amarinder Singh calling the new law “inherently discriminatory” and redolent of the “ethnic and religious cleansing in Hitler’s Germany”.

The resolution, supported by AAP and opposed by Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), also demands changes in the documentation required for inclusion of names in the National Population Register.

Amarinder said like Kerala, the Congress government in Punjab would soon move the Supreme Court against the amended citizenship law.

In the assembly, the CM set the tone for the debate on the resolution by asking those opposing it to read Adolf Hitler ’s ‘Mein Kampf ’ to “understand the dangers of CAA”. He offered to get the book translated and distributed among them.

“What happened in Germany under Hitler in 1930 is happening in India now. Germans did not speak then, and they regretted it. But we have to speak now so we don’t regret later,” he said. “Clearly, no lessons have been learnt from history. What is happening in India is not good for the country, which is why people are protesting spontaneously — without any instigation.”

SAD argued instead of repealing the Act, it should be amended to include Muslims among the eligible applicants for citizenship. “I want to ask if you are against Sikhs and Hindus. If not, you should have only asked for Muslims to be added to the eligibility list. Let’s not play politics. Hardly 800-900 people in Punjab will be affected. SAD opposes the resolution,” legislature party leader S S Dhillon said.

The resolution was moved by parliamentary affairs minister Brahm Mohindra and put to vote by Speaker Rana KP Singh at 3.18pm.

Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal was the first to back the resolution, saying opposing CAA was in line with Punjab’s “secular history”. “CAA is divisive in nature. Why should Tamils from Lanka, Rohingiyas of Myanmar and Ahmediyas from Pakistan be left out?” he said. Leader of the Opposition H S Cheema declared AAP’s support to the resolution.

The anti-terrorism court (ATC) was hearing a case against the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) workers who held violent protests and clashed with police over the arrest of party chief Khadim Hussain Rizvi in 2018, Dawn news reported.

Those convicted include TLP chief Khadim Hussain Rizvi’s brother Ameer Hussain Rizvi and nephew Mohammad Ali, the report said. The court on Thursday also ordered the convicts to collectively submit Rs 12,925,000 and directed authorities to seize their moveable and immoveable assets.

In November 2018, over 2,000 people, including the chief of a radical party, were booked under terrorism and other charges of rioting, attempting murder and hurling threats in different parts of Punjab province during the three-day protests following Bibi’s acquittal.

Nagpur: A day after Nagpur University (NU) vice-chancellor SP Kane admitted to lapse on its administration’s part over spreading awareness on refund scheme for revaluation, various students’ organizations demanded that NU should make up for its blunder by informing those students who cleared papers.

An RTI information secured by activist Abhay Kolarkar disclosed that over 2.14 lakh students applied for revaluation in six examinations conducted from 2016 to 2019.

“Refund of revaluation money to the students was our long-pending demand, but NU authorities were reluctant to accept it for all these years. Why should a student suffer for NU evaluator’s fault? The authorities must refund the money of students who cleared the exams after revaluation,” NSUI’s Ajit Singh said.

He said the NU miserably failed to spread awareness about various schemes for the students. “You go to any campus. They didn’t paste any notice about such schemes. How do you expect the students to know about them? And then you say that no student approached them,” he added.

Some students told TOI that when they approached for refund till last year, the exam section officials used to tell them that such a scheme was never implemented and only a proposal was submitted.

“Last year only, we had submitted a representation in this regard to the VC. When nothing progressed, we staged a peaceful protest. But, we were manhandled by the guards and false complaints were lodged against us. I was falsely implicated for speaking the truth,” ABVP activist Vaibhav Bawankar said.

ABVP’s city unit head Amit Patle accused the VC of misleading students by stating that none of them approached for refund. “I can give proofs that I went to former Board of Examination and Evaluation (BOEE) director Neeraj Khaty with many students for refunding the revaluation amount. They only offer excuses that NU will be starting online system which never became a reality. Once they told us that refund would be granted from the exam section, but that too didn’t materialize,” he said.

BOEE director Prafulla Sable told TOI that he would be sitting with the VC to finalize modalities for refunding the amount. “We will be doing it after the convocation. So far, no such rules were framed,” the said.

Patle said none of the NU officers from the exam section knew about existence of such a scheme. “Even students from other districts like Gondia, Wardha and Bhandara were confused on this aspect,” he said.

Enforcement Directorate

MUMBAI: Enforcement Directorate (ED) searched premises of former chief engineer of BMC's development plan (DP) department, Devendra Natvarlal Desai , after registering a case under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) on Friday. Desai retired from BMC about a decade back.

ED officials said they found that Desai had invested in a property in Dubai, from which he was earning an annual rent of Rs 13 lakh. He had transferred Rs 40 lakh to his US-based married daughter.

ED searched his premises after obtaining information through sources that the engineer had amassed money during his tenure in BMC. He allegedly diverted it abroad, violating rules. During the search, ED officials said they collected documents showing the foreign assets and the money transfer.

The engineer, ED said, purchased the property in Bonaire Marsa building, Park Island, Dubai, in 2012, by paying Rs 70 lakh. He purchased the property in his name, along with wife and son. ED questioned him about the purchase details of property, source of money and mode of payment. The engineer was unable to provide details and officials suspect that the property had been purchased through illegal money, officials said.

ED found several documents during the search, which shows that the property is on rent and the engineer's family is earning UAE dirham 65,000 (approximately Rs 13 lakh) yearly from it. They also found documents showing money transfer to his daughter in US.

The chief engineer (DP) is considered crucial as construction files of Mumbai's builders go to him for clearance. Most architects sometimes meet the chief engineer with designs and project files.

Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) standing committee headed by Pradip Pohane on Tuesday issued show cause notices to assistant commissioners of all ten zones for low recovery of property tax. This was the outcome of municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar’s decision to levy cut of 25% in the budget presented by Pohane.

Pohane told TOI the cut in the budget is due to low recovery of property tax. “I have also directed the administration not to levy cut on funds and works sanctioned by the state government. NMC has no right to stop works sanctioned by the government. The civic chief did not levy cut on works proposed under fixed priority, backward class, and persons with disabilities. If we consider all such excluded heads, cut will become minimal,” he said.

Pohane had presented a budget of Rs3,197.60 crore in which he approved works of Rs3,197.34 crore. Bangar had imposed cut on works costing Rs772 crore.

Pohane directed the property tax department and assistant commissioners of all 10 zones to ensure recovery of property tax at par with target set in budget. In nine months of current fiscal, property tax revenue is around Rs170 crore where as target set in budget was Rs443.70 crore.

The standing committee gave powers to civic chief to take further decision on completion of works remaining under Cement Concrete Road Project phase-I. NMC’s projects department sought approval to offer work to second or third lowest bidders Mahalsa Constructions and JP Enterprises, respectively, or go for re-tender in case the two companies refused to work at the rate quoted by first lowest bidder Abhi Engineering. Following inordinate delay in issuing work order, Abhi Engineering has refused to execute the work.

The delay will result in severe inconvenience to citizens as nine roads pending for concretization for last nine years are now full of potholes and bad surface layer.

Other Decisions

* No hike in property tax for next fiscal 2020-21 after steep rise two years ago

* NMC to fund Rs25 lakh for International Film Festival

* Extension to 13 fire personnel for four more months on contractual basis

* Work orders of Rs44.03 lakh for development of Samvedna Park at Shivaji Nagar garden

* Appointment of Shree Siddhi Vinayak Pratishthan for operation and maintenance of fitness centre developed at Panchdeep Layout, Bhamti

NAGPUR: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ( RSS ) has lodged a complaint with Kotwali police against unidentified persons for circulating a misleading PDF against the organization and its chief Mohan Bhagwat on social media.

The post, titled Naya Samvidhan (new constitution), has Bhagwat’s picture and word on an imaginary constitution of the country dominated by the upper caste.

Some of the content shared by the RSS at a press conference includes lines stating that the new constitution is based on Hindu religion and even citizenship and jobs will be based on caste. The upper caste will be first class citizens with the lowest status given to the lower caste, it says.

Shridhar Gadge, RSS’ Mahanagar Sah Sanchalak (deputy chief of the city unit), said the post intends to malign the image of the organization. “It appears that the content has been posted to deliberately target the masses and mislead them. We have requested the police to trace the origin of the post and even block it,” he said. The RSS has termed the attempt as a means to gain unfair political mileage.

The post comes at a time when statements against the RSS have been made during the anti-NRC and CAA rallies in the city. During protest meetings, speakers alleged that the RSS and the BJP were intending to make the country a Hindu nation dominated by the upper caste.

Nagpur: The Union ministry of road transport and highways has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with six premier engineering institutions including Nagpur’s Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology (VNIT) to provide training to engineers in new road safety, engineering, development and maintenance technology.

Funded by World Bank and Asian Development Bank, the Central government will provide Rs14,000 crore to provide training to 72,000 engineers across the country for three years.

“As per the MoU, VNIT will assist in evaluation and introduction of new technology for road safety and operational efficiencies. We will train 6,000 engineers from various government organisations like public works department, municipal corporations from central Indian states including Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana and part of Gujarat,” confirmed VNIT’s civil engineering HoD V Landge.

Union minister for road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari, defence minister Rajnath Singh and minister of state for road transport and highways VK Singh were present when VNIT signed the MoU with MoRTH on January 13 in New Delhi, he said.

It has been observed that apart from human negligence, faulty road and infrastructure designs too contribute in road accidents. So the training programme has been designed to improve road designing and construction.

“The 15-day course has been designed by the World Bank and the contents include road safety awareness, road geometrics including shoulders, surface of the roads and then giving training on how to carry out road safety audit (RSA),” Landge said.

RSA is an important aspect after construction of any road. It actually certifies whether the road is good for traffic or not. The audit also includes night time safety. The World Bank also focuses on safety of elderly motorists while designing a road, said Landge. “According to World Bank, age behind the wheels is fast increasing. Seniors now have to carry out their chores on their own. Due to their advanced stage, they are involved in accidents. So specific modules have been given,” Landge said.

VNIT has been given target to train 6,000 engineers in three years. “We have to take three batches of 15 days each,” he said. The VNIT professor said the institute was also planning to open road safety training centre in the city.

Course Modules

* Road safety, engineering, development and maintenance

* How to carry out road safety audit

* Night traffic study

* Safety of elderly motorists

478,['18/01/2020'],Sea of cool styles too at Happy Streets,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Nagpur: Besides the enthusiasm, the style quotient is also high during chilly winter mornings at Happy Streets , a Times of India and Maharashtra Times initiative. From 6-9am on Sundays, the yoga section, maybe, turns a few heads less than the latest winter wear on the stretch from Laxmi Bhuvan Square to Law College Square.

With all the novel activities around, dressing up for winters does not mean the cozy and comfortable outfits can sacrifice practicality. Nagpurians have shown that they know well how winter fashion can blend style and function.

Shreya Kewalramani, a student, said, “I am a regular visitor at Happy Streets and I love to put on some over-sized sweaters and a printed floral scarf with boots to complete my look.” On how she manages to pull it off early in the morning, she said, “I love dressing up and I leave no occasion to present the best of me.”

Some citizens rock trendy sports wear with neon colour boots and sports shoes, while some do not shy away from wearing eye-catching short dresses and night wear turned into causal outfits. “I don't mind wearing nice shorts and knee-length dresses in the morning, but sometimes I step out wearing bright colour turtleneck sweaters to Happy Streets,” said Ashrayee Wasnik, a student.

“Happy Streets gives an opportunity and motivation to wake up in the morning, dress up and start the day on a happy and positive note,” added Wasnik

The sustained cold weather has given people an excuse to stock up on winter wardrobe staples, which year after year, and never go out of style. “I see a lot of people wearing stylish clothes at Happy Streets, which means our city is becoming very fashion conscious,” said Mehak Lakhwani, a student.

“I love to wear knitted sweaters and throwing on some funky accessories on my head, like pins and bands. I also don’t leave house without putting on my favourite eye lens, especially if I am visiting Happy Streets,” she added.

Right from fashionable pullovers to leather jackets to short summer dresses and long sleeve turtle necks, citizens are rocking every style. A few people stand out from the crowd with their layered outfits and matching accessories. “I love experimenting with my style, and it’s so much fun to come up with a new outfit idea each Sunday for Happy Streets,” said Aparajita Mahajan, a student.

Girls are also very particular with make-up, and a peppy lip shade and kohl in the eyes are a must even early in the morning, “Makeup completes any look, and adds more confidence,” added Mahajan.

Even senior citizens can be seen putting on blanket scarfs, with chunky knit cardigan sweaters or bundled up under a favourite puffer, keeping them warm from head to toe. Young boys can be seen smartly dressed in high-boots, heavy jackets and sunglasses.

Bhargavi Wanjari’s style statement was bow-shaped hairband and crop top. “I always like to dress up in an unique manner. I see very few people here who had a hairstyle like me, it’s very unique and makes me stand out in the crowd on the streets,” said Wanjari.

479,['18/01/2020'],Kolkata News - Times of India,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Kolkata: Like any measure of sporting greatness, only some things are quantifiable, the others just a collective ‘idea’ in the minds of fans and connoisseurs. How many international goals did Maradona score? How old was he when the infamous ‘Hand of God’ happened? These are questions that are easily answerable. But what’s not so easy to qualify, let alone quantify, is that undefinable quality of his shimmering, almost other-worldly, run with the ball towards the opponents’ goal. Harder to define is that collective magic he wove on everyone the moment he stepped out on the field.

Similarly, Mohun Bagan ’s existence as a football club is easily quantifiable. It was founded in 1889, thus making it 130-going-on-131 years old. Also, for a die-hard fan, it wouldn’t be difficult to find out how many club victories it has had over the years, how many times it beat East Bengal on the Maidan or even which year its ‘barefoot team’ created history by winning the IFA Shield after beating the East Yorkshire regiment 2-1. What is difficult to define about this Maidan institution is the electric atmosphere on the ground when its faces its arch-rivals. Or, for that matter, why this Mohun Bagan-East Bengal rivalry is such a huge thing, almost a measure of one’s Bengali-ness.

It is, thus, only natural that any decision regarding the club or the football team would evoke a lot of interest and reaction.

It’s been that way since Thursday’s announcement that RPSG Group, which owns and runs Indian Super League ( ISL ) side ATK FC and Mohun Bagan Football Club (India) Private Limited — that controls the Mohun Bagan football team — will come together to form a new team. The new entity, which will come into existence from June 1 this year, is set to be called ATK Mohun Bagan, with RPSG Group holding 80% shares and Mohun Bagan Football Club (India) Private Limited having the remaining 20%.

The merged team will play in the ISL from next season but Mohun Bagan have the I-League to negotiate this season and will hope to end their I-League sojourn as champions.

Bagan, the table-toppers, will play their first match after this development on Sunday, when they face arch-rivals East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium, even as the green-and-maroon faithful weigh in on the new move.

“I have a tattoo of the Mohun Bagan logo on my hand... that will never change,” says ardent supporter Tamal Bose. “Also, this association is not with the club. I think the logo and jersey colour will not be altered. When I was young, both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal had their respective sponsors’ names before the team’s name. Even when the merged team comes into existence, the essence of the Kolkata derby will always remain as the fight between the green-and-maroons and the red-and-golds.”

Sounav Dhawa holds a similar view. “This is a good initiative. I have no issues with ATK being prefixed to Mohun Bagan because whoever invests will surely promote their brand. I will be very happy to see better players turn out for the team,” he said, adding, “The derby will always remain a derby. The Bagan entity is most important.”

Saikat Bose, who stays in Mumbai and is part of the Mumbai-Pune Mariners fans’ group, has a bit of an itch about the ATK Mohun Bagan nomenclature.

“ATK prefixed to Mohun Bagan is something I don’t like much,” he says. “We have to see how the whole thing actually pans out now. It’s better if the logo and jersey colour remains the same. The Kolkata derby will remain the same from the next season as well. The statistics will not show it as the first match-up between the two teams. It will carry the same heritage and passion. For Sunday’s match, we have arranged for a screening in Mumbai. So far, everyone is attending.”

There, however, are a few who have been extremely perturbed by the name of the new team. “Till June 1, the team is Mohun Bagan. So, I have no problem attending any of the matches and I will go to watch Sunday’s derby. I feel, owing to the history, the Kolkata derby will not lose its value from the next season as well. But I might not turn up at the ground. I have no issue with the shareholding pattern but can’t accept ATK Mohun Bagan as the name. Why not something like Kolkata Mohun Bagan? If the name stays, I’ll probably not attend the team’s matches from next season,” says 36-year-old Debashis Bhattacharyya, who has been a Maidan regular since 1997.

Dipayan Bhattacharya, on the other hand, wants to look at the developments with pragmatism. “An investor was needed for us in order to make a big-budget team. Even when we had a sponsor’s name before the team’s name, we went to watch the matches and we also won many trophies. Also, as far as the Kolkata derby is concerned, the passion will never die down,” the 40-year old feels.

480,['18/01/2020'],Noida: New police commissionerate headquarters may be shifted to traffic park,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Representative image

NOIDA: The headquarters of the new police commissionerate will most likely be shifted to the traffic park in Sector 108 and inaugurated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath .

Sources said the police department had requested the Authority for space and an in-principle approval has been given by the CEO. “The formal approval is likely to be given early next week while the office will be shifted by the end of this month,” said an official of Noida Authority .

The traffic park in Sector 108 was developed by the Noida Authority and inaugurated by the CM last year. It is already slated to house the regional transport office and the traffic police office.

Meanwhile, new police stations are likely to come up in Gautam Budh Nagar district in the next few days. The police headquarters moved a proposal to state government to set up new police stations in Noida. Owing to the growing population of the city, the local police wanted to create four new police stations. The four new police stations proposed are Okhla Barrage, Sector 106, Sector 115 and Sector 63. A total of 22 police stations, including the women’s police station, are functioning in the district currently. About 1,200 additional police personnel will join the force in Noida soon.

481,['18/01/2020'],"Aadhaar, voter ID are no proof of citizenship: Dilip Ghosh","This story is from January 18, 2020

File photo of Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh

HOWRAH: Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh, taking a cue from Union home minister Amit Shah, has said that Aadhaar card and voter ID are no proof of citizenship .

“Having an Aadhaar card and voter card doesn’t entitle one to be a citizen,” Ghosh told a party gathering in Howrah on Friday, days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged people to get their names correctly enrolled in the voters’ list. “Get your names correctly enrolled in the voters’ list and leave the rest to us,” the CM had said.

Ghosh stirred a controversy while taking on Banerjee, who claimed the other day that migrants may asked to produce birth certificates of their parents. “Let those who are not sure about their parents bother about it. They are trying to confuse people. We need not worry,” he said.

The comment drew an immediate response from TMC. “I have never seen a politician like Dilip Ghosh in my political career who can stoop to such a low,” TMC’s Baranagar MLA Tapas Ray said. BJP has no right to decide who is a citizen and who isn’t, Ray added.

The Bengal BJP president urged people not to listen to what the CM is saying. “Those coming from Bangladesh have to apply for citizenship. The PM will give you three to four months to apply for citizenship under CAA . The application should include the refugee’s name, his father’s name, place (in Bangladesh) from where he came and the date of entry to India. There are some who came in 1975, some in 1980 and some after that. All those who came to India from Bangladesh before December 31, 2014 are eligible to apply. The self-certified application is enough. Please mention the date and place in your application correctly,” Ghosh said.

R&AW, during its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 has stated it will verify the “religious persecution” clause mentioned in the application.

Bengal BJP leaders, while backing Ghosh’s view that Aadhaar card and voter card can’t be taken as citizenship proof, didn’t rule out such an inquiry. “Non-Muslims comi-ng from the three countries — Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan — have to make a self-certified application. Now, if somebody makes a complaint against him, the onus lies on the applicant under the Foreigner’s Act, and not on the complainant, to prove that what he mentioned in his application is true. He may be asked to produce documents in support of his claim even if he has an Aadhaar card and voter card,” a Bengal BJP leader said.

Ghosh urged people not to worry about the birth certificates of parents. “These are all bunkum. Nobody is going to ask for these. Your applicat-ion is enough. We need not wo-rry,” Ghosh said, after leading a rally from Howrah’s Dumurjala to Howrah Maidan.

482,['18/01/2020'],Where the streets have one name,"This story is from January 18, 2020

Kolkata: In Agantuk, Satyajit Ray’s last movie, central character Manomohan says something that is perhaps a hint that he, despite spending more than three decades outside the country, is at heart a Bengali still. When Manomohan’s family, sceptical about his identity — and learning that he has lived in Brazil — ask him about football and Pelé, he answers that for him, football means Mohun Bagan and East Bengal .

To slightly twist a popular saying, you can take the Bengali football fan out of Bengal, but you cannot take the Mohun Bagan-East Bengal rivalry out of a true-blue Bengali football fan. And this Maidan romanticism is what Ray expresses so succinctly through Manomohan. Which is why this marriage — between ATK and Mohun Bagan — has vertically cleaved the latter club’s vast body of fans, whose number could easily rival, if not sometimes eclipse, the entire population of some European countries.

In the heartland of Bagan fandom — Mohun Bagan Lane, Mohun Bagan Row, Kirti Mitra Lane in Fariapukur, opinion is fairly divided, but the majority feels that the marriage was perhaps inevitable in the current scenario. Ranjoy Das — whose father, Mani Das, was the football secretary of Mohun Bagan for 22 years till 2005 — believes the union would be really good for Bagan. Das runs his family shop just 10 metres from the house of Bhupen Bose (Basu Batika), one of the founders of the green-and-maroons in 1889. “We have no other option but to play ISL ,” he says. “Only then will we get proper exposure and recognition. See, the I-League is already getting second-division treatment. I feel that soon, entry to the AFC Cup and other international competitions would be through the ISL. Supporters should not be worried about this (the club merger) now.”

Shree Narayan Tandon, who has a family business in Burrabazar, is another ardent supporter of the Mariners. Standing just 100 metres from Mohun Bagan Lane, he confesses he doesn’t know what the outcome of this would be. “I am a third-generation supporter of the club,” he proudly declares, narrating how he even turned away out-of-state customers from his shop because he had to go to the Maidan to watch a match. “This year, I drove down to Kalyani to see my team playing. My elder sister stays in London, but she has made it a point to renew her club membership every year,” he adds.

His only concern is what the new owners will do about members, or how they will use the Mohun Bagan brand.

There are some extreme views as well, like the one expressed by Sayak Das, a die-hard fan who stays near Mohun Bagan Row. “My personal view is that Mohun Bagan has sold out,” he says. “If one club takes over another, the existence of the latter is obviously at stake.” Another supporter, Dhruba Ghosal, who has been a fan for over 50 years, is also critical. “It was perhaps needed, but considering the heritage of our club, our name should come before ATK’s. It should be Mohun Bagan-ATK and not the other way round. Another thing is that our jersey and logo should prevail at any cost. Otherwise, we shall oppose this,” he says.

But for every naysayer, there are at least two fans who see the merger in a positive light. Utpal Bag, who runs a shop just 100 metres from Mohun Bagan Row, welcomes the move. He has been watching his favourite club play since 1976, becoming a member in 1982. “This was required,” he says. “Otherwise, how would the club run? How long will an individual finance the club? If you do not have big sponsors, you stand no chance in ISL, and the I-League will soon become second division.” Souvvik Ghosh, another ardent supporter, also has strong views about the deal. “My only concern is the derby. Otherwise, this is the best thing that could have happened to our team,” he says.

Midnapore: Lok Sabha Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury has played down the Bengal government’s decision to not send officials to Delhi for the NPR meet. “The meeting was called by the census commissioner. He didn’t invite any chief minister. State officials were called to discuss how to conduct the census and decide on parameters for conducting NPR,” he said.

Chowdhury pointed out that people had every right to oppose NPR parameters and tell officials they wouldn’t give the documents asked for. “But that is on the ground. That is more important than not sending state officials to Delhi. It doesn’t tie in with the CM calling on the PM at Raj Bhavan,” he said.

The Congress leader said the CM and PM are both trying to confuse people. “PM Modi had to invite Pakistan PM Imran Khan to the Sanghai Cooperation Organisation conclave. He cannot afford to antagonise China or Russia. He has, therefore, invited the Pakistan PM. But for us, he keeps making anti-Pakistan remarks,” he said.

Calcutta high court

KOLKATA: The inconvenience of the woman and the child should be “the prime consideration” when courts decide on pleas to transfer divorce petitions and child custody cases, the Calcutta High Court has said in a recent judgment.

The HC, in an eight-page order last week, transferred both the divorce proceedings and the child custody case from a Jalpaiguri court to one in Durgapur after a woman pleaded that she was unable to travel 600 kilometres from Durgapur to attend court proceedings in Jalpaiguri; she was financially dependent on her parents and her 13-year-old son studied in a local Durgapur school, she explained.

Justice Bibek Chaudhuri cited five Supreme Court orders that suggested “the inconvenience of the wife should be treated as the prime consideration” while deciding transfer petitions in matrimonial suits and referred to a 2018 Calcutta HC judgment while deciding on the transfer of the child custody case.

The high court, in the 2018 order, said the “legislative intent” behind child custody laws was not to force a child to attend a court hearing several hundred kilometres from where s/he stayed. Both the divorce and custody cases will now be heard by the Durgapur additional district judge.

The woman’s plea says she was married in February 2004 and had a child in June 2006. During marriage, she claimed, she was subjected to mental and physical abuse and was forced to leave her marital home and return to Durgapur after a physical attack on her in December 2017.

She learnt in 2018 that her husband had filed divorce proceedings.

She then filed a plea, seeking custody of her minor son. Neither the woman’s husband nor his advocate chose to respond to her petition in high court.
