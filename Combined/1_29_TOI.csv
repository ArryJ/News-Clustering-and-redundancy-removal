0,['29/01/2020'],It’s time to lend an ear to your chapped lips,"Whether or not we like to talk about it, chapped lips can make one feel conscious and uncomfortable all day long, especially during the winter season. Even when you slather those fruity lip balms or the good old petroleum jelly, nothing seems to work if the dryness is extreme. Lips also lack oil glands, making them easily susceptible to flakiness. It has long been established that our skin constantly tries to communicate with us, flagging underlying health risks and deficiencies. Similar is the case with lips. Maybe it’s time to lend an ear to your lips, then? Here’s what experts have to say…“Also referred to as cheilitis, chapped lips are often characterised by cracking, fissuring and peeling. Keeping yourself hydrated, complemented by home remedies, may help if it’s not an extreme case yet. But if the dryness aggravates, it might point to other health issues,” says Dr Sudha Menon, internal medicine physician. According Kavita Devgan, nutritionist and holistic health consultant, it could indicate several underlying problems such as dehydration, constipation, anaemia, diabetes, reaction to certain medications, vitamin and mineral deficiencies in the body as well as stress and anxiety.Urging people to try and maintain a healthy lifestyle, Dr Sudha says, “Take care of your lips by having a balanced diet regularly and keeping yourself hydrated. It’s also important to keep an overall check on your health, so that there are no deficiencies in your body.”Adding to that, Kavita says, “Any problem in the body usually shows up on the skin first. So, don’t ignore dry lips, thinking it to be just a seasonal issue. If it’s not because of dehydration, get your sugar and haemoglobin levels tested as well. Instead of resorting to cosmetic options, visit a doctor if the problem remains.”Natural lip balms made from plant butter, oils, beeswax can help to keep your lips smooth and supple. Sugar scrubs can work well to remove dead skin. Also, desi ghee, shea butter, mango butter, cocoa butter can work wonders during dry weather. Neetha Bhoopalam, natural cosmetologist and food consultant, shares a few natural lip masks. She suggests that these should be used three times a week to see good results...Unrefined honey can be applied 2-3 times a day. Let it soak for 15-20 minutes and then wash it off.Wash a few rose petals and soak them in milk. One hour later, grind the petals into a smooth paste. Let it stay on your lips for 15 minutes before washing it off with water.Mash one banana, add a teaspoon of honey to it. Apply the paste on your lips for 20 minutes and then wash it off.SmokingToo much exposure to hot or cold weatherConsumption of too much caffeineGenetic issuesExcessive use of lipstickDehydrationVitamin and mineral deficiency",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73697401,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-433048/73697401.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/health-fitness/health-news/its-time-to-lend-an-ear-to-your-chapped-lips/articleshow/73697401.cms

When students take the role of a teacher on stage

Putting the spotlight on women warriors of our past

Performing arts lovers in Bengaluru are in for a treat as Bharatanatyam dancer, teacher and actor, Matangi Prasan , and her students are poised to showcase a unique set of three demonstrations over the weekend. These will be an amalgamation of dance and concepts of science, history and other academic subjects.Speaking about the show — which took about six months to conceptualise, choreograph and execute — Matangi says, “The idea came from the topics that I used to assign to my students during their summer vacation. Apart from teaching them dance, I used to give them other small tasks, such as writing short stories, drawing portraits of their favourite characters and so on. Eventually, I decided to use dance to explain simple scientific concepts to children as an effort to make it easier for them to understand the importance of these concepts.”The dance production also includes live music, as artiste YG Srilatha collaborates with the dancer to come up with original compositions for the recital. “We needed a live music setup for the audience to have an immersive experience. The overall rehearsals took nearly four months, and as we were working with children, it was slightly more difficult than usual to put things together, but it was worth the effort,” says Matangi.In total, there will be six musicians. The dance performance is divided into three parts, which will be performed by students of different age groups. Here’s what they will comprise…Theset will be performed by students aged between 5 and 8 years. “It will be interesting for the audience to see how these kids will portray human values and virtues through dance narratives,” she says.“Students in the age group of 9 to 14 years will put up acts based on the scientific concepts they learn at school. Here, they will enact as teachers, explaining these concepts. The choreography is based on their opinions as well,” Matangi explains.Focusing on the portrayal of female warriors in the history of Karnataka, students aged 15 and 16 will portray the roles of goddesses and women warriors. “This act will concentrate on the women who adorn the pages of our history books. We have taken inspiration from legends like Onake Obavva, Rani Abbakka Chowta and Kittur Rani Chennamma,” she sums up.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73695652,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-119212,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/this-bharatanatyam-performance-draws-inspiration-from-school-textbooks/articleshow/73695765.cms

It was one of those greeting cards that played music when opened. It was delivered to the girl I liked. But the card fell out during class and the music caught the attention of the teacher, who happened to be my relative. Needless to say, I got reprimanded by my family (chuckles). On that note, I must add that my friend who was behind the plan is now a lecturer at an engineering college in Mysuru Milana: (laughs) My god, poor thing. Please don't give out his name also.Regifted something that was gifted to me:Amrutha: I have; I used to get a lot of heart-shaped pillows, so I used to re-pack and gift them to my friends who loved cheesy items. Krishna: Milana and I have this tradition where we gift each other phones. If I have gifted her a model, I ask her to gift me the upgraded version of the same phone.Milana: That’s preplanned and not regifting.Krishna: Once the production started, we have refrained from gifts. (Chuckles)Milana: Coming to the question, I value all my gifts though, because people have specifically picked it out for me. So, I never regift anything.Been in Love with my teacher:Krishna: I have. I had a teacher who had a bob cut — similar to the hair style that Milana sports in the film. My ultimate goal in life, then, was to marry a fair-complexioned girl (chuckles). That teacher was very pretty, so I was quite in awe of her.Fallen in love at first sight:Milana: Never. If I don’t like someone, it doesn't matter how good looking they are. So, I have never fallen in love at first sight.Krishna: In fact, I have often fallen in love at first sight, till I had my first girlfriend in college. I would wait to see if anyone I was charmed by, was falling for me too..Amrutha: I have fallen in love at first sight too.. I was in ninth grade and there was a tabla teacher that we’d seen at a competition. I was in an all-girls school, and had not seen too many good-looking boys, so I was immediately in love. He had tapped my shoulder and said ‘Well, done’. If I remember correctly, I did not take a bath for a few days to preserve that memory (laughs).Krishna: Yes, she’s not bathed since then (Laughs)",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73696465,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-188195/73696465.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/gametimewithbt-ft-milana-nagaraj-krishna-and-amrutha-iyengar/articleshow/73696465.cms

Directed by Bear Grylls, the adventure reality TV series had featured Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.According to an official from the Karnataka Forest Department , the team has been granted permission to shoot near the Kalkere and Moolehole forest range, which is located close to the Kerala border. “We have ensured that the filming process does not cause any harm to the flora and fauna of the forest, particularly the tigers. The shooting has begun, and it will continue for a few days.”The last time Rajinikanth shot in Karnataka was for his movie Lingaa. It was filmed on the Mysore Palace premises and at the Linganamakki Dam, in Shivamogga . According to sources, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, who is expected to reach Mysuru today, will shoot for the show at the forest for a day or two.Environmentalists and wildlife activists are raising their voice against the decision to allow the team of Man vs. Wild to shoot at the national park and tiger reserve. Joseph Hoover, of the United Conservation Movement , says, “Around this time last year, more than 10,000 acres of forest land was destroyed due to fire. Forest officials, thus, need to be more concerned about ensuring that such an unfortunate incident does occur again, rather than being busy with providing security for people who are shooting a show in the forest. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change should have given it a proper thought before granting permission for the shoot during this season.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73696678,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-30217/73696678.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/rajinikanth-shoots-in-bandipur-tiger-reserve-amid-concerns-raised-by-environmentalists/articleshow/73696678.cms
7,['29/01/2020'],"I quit school to do dance-based films, but am yet to do one: Adah Sharma","For actress Adah Sharma, attending the cultural festival of Jain (deemed-to-be) University, was special, as she got to experience the mayhem of a college fest — something she hadn’t until now. Adah says, “I’ve never been to college as a student, so it was really good to be in college. I began doing movies right after I completed Class 10. I wasn’t a bad student; in fact, I was really good at both studies and sports and used to top my class too.” Why did she quit academics in favour of films, then? “When I was in Class 10, veteran actress Asha Parekh had come as the chief guest for the school annual day. Her manager, who was present at the event, saw my Kathak performance and told me that I’d definitely get to be in a film about or with a lot of dance. This was when I told myself that I want to be an actress and do dance-related films. The irony is that I haven’t really danced in a movie yet. Somehow, all the movies I’ve chosen until now have shown me as the sweet girl, so there’s hardly any dancing, except for Charlie Chaplin 2, in which I had worked with Prabhudeva. Even in my Kannada film Ranavikrama, I got to dance a little, but I’m yet to do an out-and-out dance-based film,” she explains.What she has got to do, though, is a variety of roles across platforms and languages. “I’ve decided that I’ll do stuff that appeals to audiences, irrespective of where they are from. After my debut in the digital space, when I went touring across the country to promote my film Commando 3, I was often asked updates about the show. What the digital age has ushered in is a level playing field for everyone, with no regional or language divide.

This serial seemed just right, as it comes from a prestigious banner and has an interesting storyline that I could not refuse.”The move, says Chandu, means that he will spend a fortnight each month in Hyderabad. But that doesn’t mean goodbye to Kannada TV. “Kannada will remain my mainstay and I am, in fact, in talks for a serial here too. Trineni allows me to test waters in a different market. I play the lead in a story that centres on a heroine who has premonitions that help my character avert danger. This thriller element in it is what piqued my interest.

10,['29/01/2020'],Team Love Mocktail talks about the film and the masti on set,"When a film team comprises youngsters, you expect them to be fun and forthcoming in their conversations. And that's just what we were privy to when the team of this week’s Love Mocktail , including lead actor, director and producer Krishna, actor-producer Milana Nagaraj and actor Amrutha Iyengar dropped by for a quick chat with us. Amid talk about the film, the trio’s banter revolved around Krishna and Amrutha's humour, with Milana, constantly chipping in as moderator and the voice of reason. Excerpts from our chat:Yes, I have taken on the role of producer, makeup artiste amd dabbled a bit in art direction too.I am producer, actor, director and stunt and song choreographer on this film. But Love Mocktail is not only about the two of us; there are a few adorable leading ladies who’ve worked in the film.(Points teasingly at Amrutha) More adorable than her, I mean... She is from Mysuru. We were looking for the loveliest lady in Mysuru, and she fit the part. When we started shooting, few other boys from Mysuru who were playing character roles in the film complimented her as a ‘sakkath figure’, which proved to us that we had chosen the right person for the role.(chuckles) It was a lot of fun working with this team. My role is quite peppy and bold — unlike what I’ve taken on before.I had actually asked Amrutha to slim down for the role, but she put on weight.My god! (Covers her face)In fact, considering that the narrative follows my life from teenage to the mid 30s, I had to look younger in some portions and lost 10 kilos.Seeing Krishna motivated me to lose weight.(With a poker face) When we approached Amrutha for the role, we asked her if she would reduce her remuneration, but she refused vehemently.Absolutely false! (Laughs)On a more serious note, when you are acting with people, you are always wary of possible tantrums, but Amrutha was a joy to work with.When we’d first met, I’d warned Amrutha that I am quite strict and a taskmaster as director and asked her not to get upset in case I reprimanded her, and she was like ‘No, no, you are so sweet.’ How wrong she was.As a hero, he was extremely jovial. The minute he went behind the camera, he’d be like, ‘Do you not know how to do this scene?’ and reprimand us in front of everyone. When we had a shot together, he’d then set the scene, and come and say ‘This is the background of this scene, we need to hold hands and look like we’re in love.’ In my head I was thinking, ‘You’ve just yelled at me, and now you expect me to be all lovey-dovey?’ That was my experience on the first day. Having said that, I must say that Milana did a great job and helped me through the process. She deftly handled makeup, hairstyling and even helped me out with my scenes. So, if I look good onscreen, credit goes to her, and our cinematographer, Sri Crazymindzz The shooting was a lot of fun too. Not many on the set knew the entire script, so they’d watch the comedy scenes and laugh, which was an amazing experience for us, as we realised that part of our job was done.And while there was a lot of fun on set, Krishna had a lot of rules too. No selfies on set; we were not allowed to use our phones..Exactly, he let us breathe, that’s all.Yes, and eat during our breaks. (Laughs)In fact, I used to be so preoccupied with direction, that I would forget that I have lines too.That was only time I could walk up to him and mock him saying, ‘Come on, everyone knows their lines. What about you?’It is a coming-of-age film, which follows the journey of the protagonist from the age of 14 to 35, and the women he encounters. In that sense, Love Mocktail is not a film, but an experience. Special shout out to Milana, who trusted my vision and helped fund it with the remuneration from the other films she did.I took on each of those films because they were good projects. But I did save up to work on this project. Initially, though, I was not sure what Krishna was up to on set. Our cameraman and I would wonder what he was shooting, as he would shoot a frame, then ask me to change costume and shoot another. It was only on the editing table that we realised his logic; he was trying to save time and shoot as much as possible in those settings, when light and other factors were favourable. Even though Krishna doesn’t write down scenes, he has the process entirely thought out in his mind. So all our confusions got cleared and we were elated.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73696160,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-164056/73696160.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/as-a-hero-krishna-was-jovial-but-as-director-he-was-quite-the-taskmaster-team-love-mocktail/articleshow/73696160.cms

While Mani won the Best Debutant Director Award, Saththam took home the Best Film From Sridevi JIFF Indian Panorama Award. Interestingly, it’s the only Tamil film to have won an award at the festival.“JIFF is one of the most prestigious film festivals, and to have won two awards for my first feature film is a big boost for me. The film had its Indian premier on January 20, at the festival, and we received the awards on the next day. This year, the festival had 2,161 submissions, out of which 219 films were screened. Of the 42 feature films that were chosen, only 12 are Indian movies. Filmmakers from the US, Canada, China, France, Poland, Norway and Sweden, among other countries, had showcased their work here. Saththam was the only Tamil feature film to be screened, apart from two other Tamil short films,” says Mani, whose previous featurette Magizhvan went to 32 film festivals and won 19 international awards.A psychological thriller, Saththam traces the story of a man who hears unusual sounds, which others can’t. “Can a sound haunt a person? Are these sounds trying to tell him something? That’s what we’ve explored in this film. It stars Kamaal Lenin, Rohit Muralidharan, Santosh, TVV Ramanujam, Rajan Iyer, late Kovai Senthil, Nakshatra Rao and Preetha,” says Mani, who is also a lecturer at Bharathirajaa and GP Krishna’s film institutes.

23,['29/01/2020'],Court orders sale of yacht linked to Vijay Mallya,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Vijay Mallya

LONDON: A London high court has ordered that Vijay Mallay’s 46-metre luxury yacht Force India and everything inside it be sold and the proceeds be distributed amongst its creditors.

His son Sidhartha Mallya, who is the 'ultimate owner' of the yacht, has been ordered to pay Qatar National Bank more than €6 million (Rs 47 crore) in full repayment of a real estate mortgage. QNB is enforcing the mortgage after Mallya defaulted on repayments on a separate loan to purchase a private estate in the French Riviera. The yacht had been given as security for part of the loan. The vessel is currently arrested in Southampton .

The admiralty court, during a trial on January 15, heard that whilst the legal owner of the super yacht is Force India Ltd , a company incorporated in Malta , the shares in the company are held by Continental Administration Services Ltd, a company of professional trustees, on trust for Sidhartha.

The Mangusta 165 yacht, built in 2007, is currently being marketed for Rs 109 crore by Boat International. Its website states “the yacht sleeps 10, has sumptuous seating, a spacious fly bridge and al fresco dining”.

Justice Teare on Monday ruled in favour of QNB, ordering full repayment of the €5 million (Rs 39 crore) mortgage given to the yacht, plus interest, plus all costs of collection and enforcement.

QNB granted the €5 million mortgage on the yacht on February 15, 2017 as additional security on a seven-year €27 million loan given by Ansbacher in August 2008 to a company in Luxembourg called Gizmo — ultimately owned by Vijay Mallya — to acquire the shares of a French company whose only asset is the large estate on the historical Isle St. Marguerite, a 10-minute boat ride from Cannes, known as Le Grand Jardin.

“Vijay Mallya is the ultimate beneficial owner of Gizmo Invest S.A. which has the benefit of the loan facility. The principal director of Force India is Andrea Vallabh, who is one of the directors of the corporate trustee of the Mallya family trusts. The yacht is owned by Sidhartha and Force India Ltd and used partly for private enjoyment save on those occasions when it is employed in fulfilling commercial charters to earn income to defray its running costs,” Chris Smith QC, representing Force India, told the court.

Set in grounds of over 1.3 hectares, Le Grand Jardin has 17 bedrooms, a swimming pool, gym, sauna and steam room, private cinema, night club, large wine cellar, private helipad, staff quarters and rooftop terrace with panoramic views of the Mediterranean.

26,['29/01/2020'],Transport departments to alert vehicle-owners about third-party insurance,"This story is from January 29, 2020

NEW DELHI: Vehicle owners will now receive messages from the transport department if their vehicle doesn’t have third party insurance or the policy has expired.

Insurance regulator, IRDAI, will run a pilot project with some of the states including Karnataka , Bihar, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Delhi, which will also alert the first owner to find whether the successive owners have updated their details.

“Telangana transport department has already started sending messages to the vehicle owners. While the Insurance Information Bureau has details of all insured vehicles, the Central government’s Vahan database has details of all registered vehicles. The transport departments can easily find out which vehicles have no insurance by simply comparing the data from these two sources,” said Yagnapriya Bharath, CGM of IRDAI while addressing a workshop on role of general insurance in road safety.

She said messages are sent to the mobile numbers linked to the vehicle registration number. “In case you have sold your vehicle, but still receive messages you can try to track down the new owner. Otherwise, the challans for offences committed by the new owner will keep landing at your address. This has proved to be beneficial to many in Telangana where the project has started,” an official said.

Union road transport minister Nitin Gadkari told general insurance industry leaders that the government is taking several initiatives to increase third-party insurance coverage. He said in 2018, the Supreme Court had also made two-wheeler insurance compulsory for five years and four wheeler insurance for three years for new vehicles.

Highlighting how vehicles without insurance have been a major cause of concern, IRDAI member TL Alamelu said currently at least 40% of the vehicles on road don’t have the mandatory third-party insurance cover. “Nearly 80% of two-wheelers don’t have the insurance cover,” she pointed out.

Officials from General Insurance Council also cited how the insurance coverage of vehicles is more prevalent in urban areas (nearly 89%) due to presence of traffic police and other enforcement agencies.

Under the third-party insurance provision, the responsibility of compensating an accident victim shifts from vehicle owner to the insurance company.

Ever got so obsessed with how you look that it started affecting your peace of mind and productivity? These are a few signs of Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), a mental disorder in which a person obsesses about minor flaws that sometimes are not even visible to others. In some cases, the obsession is so severe that it starts affecting a person’s lifestyle and results in decreased social, academic and professional functioning.While there is a perception that the disorder mainly affects women, the fact remains that nearly as many males as females have BDD. Other illnesses that commonly co-occur along BDD include Social Anxiety Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and substance-related disorders. ""I have a condition called Bell's Palsy. My issue stems from there and social media just made it worse. I would have to practice a smile before every picture and yet it wouldn't be perfect.

I quit smoking, but as a result, I started gaining weight. Slowly, the weight gain crept up on me. I was under-confident and thought that my appearance wasn't appealing. I started blaming my beard, then my haircut, then my clothing. Things got so bad that I wore the same outfit for almost 60 weekends as some people complimented my look– Aditya Oberoi (name changed), an ad agency employee from GurgaonI was scrutinised and taunted to the point of humiliation as I was an overweight teen. I started losing weight in college. Even when someone wasn't passing a remark, in my mind, I knew I was undesired and heavy. I went on a diet but soon my health started deteriorating because all I did was diet without weight training. I went from 85kg to 40kg in a year and a half. When I started gaining weight after being put on meds, I used to stand in front of the mirror staring at my arms for hours. I used to tuck in the loose skin just so that I could see a glimpse of that ""correct"" body type. These struggles have crept into my relationships, my friendships and my professional life. Social media alone can't be blamed for this, it's the society as well– Sonali, a Masters student from Ambedkar UniversityDr Manish Sarkar, Senior Consultant Psychiatrist, EHSAAS, says, ""The most common age for the onset of BDD is between 15 and 30 years. More than 90% cases of BDD coexist with depression, anxiety and other psychological ailments. Majority of the people who have BDD avoid social and occupational exposure. Many of them are housebound as they worry about being ridiculed for the alleged deformities. It's important in suchcircumstances to take professional help. The condition can be treated with a combination of medicines and psychological counselling sessions.""Ritika Arora, a psychoanalytic psychotherapist at The Psychotherapist Collective, says, ""I feel that individuals may have a shaky sense of their self, a deep need for an ideal image, and they find this in various celebrities in social media.

""I was so surprised to see the number of mental health pages that have popped up. And these sometimes help people. Other users' 'picture-perfect lives' are almost always an illusion.

33,['29/01/2020'],Saif Ali Khan: I think comedy is the hardest form of acting,"In less than a month’s time, Saif Ali Khan gives us two dramatically different characters to dig into. He impressed as the lethal Udaybhan in ‘ Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior ’, and now, with the upcoming romcom ‘ Jawaani Jaaneman ’, he’s all set to bring out his swag and sass, once again. In his true-blue, innate style. The actor is in a good zone — from playing a Naga sadhu with dreadlocks, to a deadly warrior to the 40-year-old uber-cool dude who likes his women and wine — he’s experimenting like never before. All this, while he’s sitting back and quietly enjoying the other good things in life. Excerpts from a conversation...I am trying to think what the difference is, I think with the costume and the vibe, you go into a different mental space in a film like ‘Tanhaji...’. Yes, a film like ‘Jawaani...’ is more relatable, closer to my personality. It is also extreme, and honestly, I wouldn’t be able to live like this character. There is no such prep for a film like this one, the mental space and energy is familiar to me. In ‘Jawaani...’, we have this guy who is supposed to have grown up from all the romcoms, but hasn’t. The difference here is that he has a daughter (played Alaya F), which changes the dynamics of the story. For roles like this, you can’t prep much, you need spontaneity. Films is a director’s medium, but some films more than the other. Some films are more theatrical, but in a film like this, the director (Nitin Kakkar) has to tell us what to do, that too, on set. You need to know your lines, and then let the small moments unfold on set that will eventually create magic.For ‘Laal Kaptaan’, I had some minor disagreements with the treatment, as I thought it should have been a superhero kind of movie and there are certain things that could have been more commercial about it. The treatment of the action should have been different, maybe like ‘Tanhaji...’ I guess, some directors feel the importance of that, and some do not. Yes, I would like to see a film like ‘Laal Kaptaan’ and something like ‘Jawaani Janemaan’, too. It’s a great relief to come back to this (‘Jawaani…’) space, it is a good, fun and light zone. It is also age-appropriate. The soul of the romcoms I have done in the past is of a young guy who is confused about whether he should commit or not, marry or not... mostly figuring out some first-world issues. It is not earth-shattering, and after a while, it can seem a bit frivolous, but in this story, with the daughter coming in, it pitches it in another emotional space. That’s what drew me to it.When I talk to other actors, I realise that we are all victims of the bracket that we have been put into. There is a certain framework we can’t operate out of, only that some of our brackets are wider than the others. My choices are driven by what I have been exposed to, the way I see my profession and art, rather than the notion of what can take my stardom forward. For instance, maybe, what I want is to have this conversation with you as an expression of my success, and to be able to have a chat about what this is all about. So, it is about the way I view things as an actor. Of course, films need to work at the box office and people should make money. It is important that your film is budgeted sensibly, and works well, commercially. Beyond that, my idea of entertainment is something that you want to enjoy yourself, it’s not too indulgent and it’s pretty mainstream.I would like to think that ‘this is my audience’, but I don’t know what that is. There are some people I speak to, like yourself, and I feel this is my kind of conversation and I know how to speak to this person. There are some people I don’t know how to speak to. Likewise, with movies, there are all kinds of audience and I don’t exactly know who my audience is. I know that whenever I am offered a movie by a producer or director, if I like it, I will take it on, and maybe, in the process create a new audience (if that happens).There are different levels of belief. You feel disappointed when a film like ‘Laal Kaptaan’ does not work because you have worked really hard on it. So, I was not heartbroken, but yes, I was sad. You are heartbroken when you believe that a film will really run, and eventually, that does not happen. Then, it means that you have got everything, including your judgement, wrong. A film like ‘Laal Kaptaan’ is something you are hoping people will like, as you know that it is in a different zone. If you get it right, then great. If you don’t, then you have to tell yourself that it was a good attempt and move on. I read that when Al Pacino made ‘Scarface’ (1983), and it didn’t run, he wanted to quit the movies. He thought that his judgement went wrong with what he believed was great. So, that would be heartbreaking. I loved ‘Tanhaji...’ and everyone loved it, too, so I am in sync. It is not like I loved a certain performance of mine and people said, ‘Oh, it was awful’.I think comedy is the hardest form of acting. It is about perfect timing, and you can’t do it if you are not gifted. I am not talking about myself; I am talking about someone like Akshay Kumar, who has done so many comedies. We generally need to take comedy parts that actors do, more seriously.It is still “playing”, and it is not really yourself. It is like a version of yourself. There is a difference between realism and reality, and we all want realism, but we don’t want reality. There is a difference.The camera loves Alaya and she is so good in front of it. She is natural, sharp and a good actor. If the film does well, she is the reason for it. The story is about the girl, and Alaya has carried the film through. If she wouldn’t be magical, there would be no story here.It is different because the industry is changing, and back in the 90s, it was not as professional as it is today. In some ways it is good and in some ways, it is not. I see so much of this management, or mismanagement happening today, where people are trying to create this personality for actors by making them do this, go there and say that. It is too choreographed. I think you have to be yourself. The good thing is that, I feel we are a mature industry. There are certain films that young actors can do and there are films that 50-year-old guys can do. We are quite youth-obsessed in our country, but luckily, now there are good roles for everyone. It is fascinating to play the part of a young father.I am very lucky to have her in my life because she also encourages friendships and relationships away from this business. Whether it is cooking, hanging out with friends at home, renting a cottage in whichever country or doing simple things together — it is about valuing the quality time we spend together. We have our similarities and differences, but this is one huge thing we have in common. We work here, we love and respect it, but it is not an obsession. There is another side to life that is as important, like traveling, meeting people, and being with simple friends. A lot of our friends wonder why we like going to Gstaad (Switzerland), as it is full of older people. But we like it because Kareena and I are old souls in a way. We like to chill, and chat over a bottle of wine for hours. Some people probably need to be in a more happening place, we don’t.Yes, and no. Sara was my first child, we were so excited about it, and we did so much together. But your heart really separates into three pieces when you have three children. I know it sounds filmi, but one child can’t replace the other. Like, if I am upset with Sara or Ibrahim, I know that Taimur can’t make it better. Somehow, the more kids you have, the more you keep dividing yourself. Learning-wise, I am more patient now as a person, so I get on to Taimur’s frequency more than I did with Sara and Ibrahim, hopefully. I can have a more serious chat with Sara and have a drink with her, I can talk to Ibrahim about different things, and enjoy the infancy of Taimur. They are all great feelings.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73696820,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-59775/73696820.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/saif-ali-khan-i-think-comedy-is-the-hardest-form-of-acting/articleshow/73696535.cms
34,['29/01/2020'],From pets to poetry & pouts: Celebs are having fun with the #DollyPartonChallenge,"There’s a new viral challenge that gets you to flaunt your personality via a meme. And it all started when singer and actress Dolly Parton posted a tweet with a collage of her photos showing how she would look on various social media platforms — Facebook Tinder , and LinkedIn — with the caption, “Get you a woman who can do it all” In no time, the four-frame picture post went viral. It has already inspired 419,096 posts, 255.5K likes and counting. Actors, singers and brand influencers, among others, are sharing their version of the challenge. And back home, Bollywood is nailing it, too!There have been a bunch of responses to Dolly’s meme, with people giving their own fun spin to the challenge by using pictures of food, cars, bikes and even their pets. Hollywood and Bollywood stars began to upload their versions of it, too. If Will Smith shared four GIFs from scenes of his films for the challenge, Mark Ruffalo also shared pictures from his movies and wrote: “Get a guy who will play them all ?”While Miley Cyrus went for two versions of the challenge, Gal Gadot grabbed likes when she posted the four-square grid in skirt and top, holding a Wonder Woman silver metal armour in one, bright make-up in the other and a ‘whisper’ pose in the next. “So Which Gal Am I?”, she captioned the meme. Sara Ali Khan chose to write a little rhyme that went: “Insta is my A game, Tinder for the flame, For Linkedin one can try to be tame, FB for those throwbacks, no shame. Different personalities, but Sara’s still the same”. Sonakshi Sinha went with the same photo in her version and said: “Kyuki bro, apna toh ek hi chehra hai... aur woh hai #Asli!!! #keepitreal”Alia Bhatt decided to go with her cat in four different scenes, which she captioned as: “I don’t think any human being can beat this.” Ayushmann Khurrana gave the challenge a twist by adding two more pictures to it.Diljit Dosanjh captioned his version with: “Husn Ke Lakhon Rang. Konsa Rang Dekhoge (Many colours of my personality, which one you wish to see).”Karan Johar made a case for his pout in all the pictures, adding, “It’s now a part of my personality! I suck my cheeks, squint my eyes... pretend I am Brad Pitt (in my head) and Voila! You have a 47-year-old man who thinks he is Paris Hilton!”This challenge, which has you sporting different looks on different social media sites, clearly seems to have a message — that we tend to project a different personality according to the social media profile. For those who want to take on the challenge, the gist of how the meme works is basic: Just choose four photos, each one depicting how the way you would like to be portrayed on these social media platforms. Choices vary from one person to another, but most people tend to dress as per the app and show a stiffer side on one platform and a lighter one on another. For instance, you may choose a blazer or another professional outfit on a work-related app, make it a little artsy on the other or even do a Dolly Parton-style by wearing a bunny suit on a dating app. So, what are you opting for?",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73699427,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-32273/73699427.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/english/hollywood/news/from-pets-to-poetry-pouts-celebs-are-having-fun-with-the-dollypartonchallenge/articleshow/73699014.cms

Not that such instances are unheard of in telly land, but in this case, Abhinav has taken the legal route. The actor’s contract with the production house had a clause stating that he would be given a month’s notice if and when the channel decided to axe his character. He joined the show in mid-May 2018, and things went smoothly for the following few months. However, on October 27, 2018, he received a mail from the production house, stating that his contract had been terminated with immediate effect and he would no longer be a part of the show. Apart from the fact that this was a breach, he was allegedly not paid his dues for the month of October and November (which would have been his notice period). After trying every option available to get his dues cleared, he has finally filed a case against the producers, Comall and Sunjoy Wadhwa While Abhinav refused to comment, his lawyer, Suvigya Vidyarthi, said, “Besides many other issues, including misinforming and misleading the channel that Abhinav wasn’t available for the shoot, thereby compelling them to cast another actor as his replacement, the production house has even breached the contract by going against the clause under which Abhinav had to be compulsorily given a termination notice of a month in advance about his exit. He worked during the month of October, 2019, for which he hasn’t been paid. He hasn’t got his dues for the month of November as well, as stipulated in the contract. He even approached the channel and the Cine and TV Artists Association (CINTAA) and a meeting was held between CINTAA and Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC) representing the two parties. However, the solution provided in the meeting wasn’t respected by the production house. Left with no other option, he moved criminal court for registration of an FIR for the offences of cheating, fraud and extortion. The next hearing is in February.”When contacted, producer Comall Wadhwa said, “We have not received any communication till date on any complaint being filed by anyone against us or our company.” However, she didn’t comment on the non-payment issue.",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73697025,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-84851/73697025.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/abhinav-shukla-takes-the-makers-of-silsila-badalte-rishton-ka-to-court-over-non-payment-of-dues/articleshow/73696989.cms

It is unusual for the actress to not visit the city for so long. After all, she once called it home and lived here for about a decade. ""Both my brothers are here so I stay with them mostly,"" the actress tells us when we meet her, before adding, ""And of course, I make it a point to meet my friends too."" But this trip was extra special for Pankhuri. She visited her alma mater – Bluebells School International – for the first time since 2007. ""It has been so long since I was in Delhi but even longer since I was here. I haven't come back here after I left the school more than ten years ago,"" says Pankhuri as a wave of nostalgia hits her, when we stand outside the school gate.As she enters the school campus, Pankhuri transforms from a successful TV (and soon film) actress to Pankhuri, the student. Her old teachers surround her and current students want selfies. Pankhuri herself, just marvels at how the school hasn't changed much since she left over a decade ago. ""So many memories are just flashing in front of my eyes,"" she says while showing us around the campus, ""The canteen's rajma chawal were my favourite. Paanch rupaye mein milte thay and they were the yummiest ever. Aise rajma chawal kabhi nahin khaaye."" We sit down at the edge of the stage in the school's assembly ground to talk and Pankhuri goes deeper into nostalgia mode.Pankhuri Awasthy poses for Delhi Times at her alma mater, Bluebells School International""Where we are sitting used to be the stage for the morning assembly. Every day, a new class would get the turn to read the news here. So many times, I have fainted here because of the sun,"" Pankhuri says with a laugh.Her teachers call her batch 'a talented bunch' while Pankhuri admits some of them – her included – were 'teachers' pets' as well. So what was Pankhuri like as a student? Obedient? Naughty? Studious? ""I was a mix of all because I am an introvert,"" she says, ""My entire batch, including the friends I had here – we were obedient, but we were naughty as well. We were good at studies and at extra-curriculars also. It was a good bunch and we had a good rapport with the teachers. We were teachers' pets.""The Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai -fame actress reveals that it was on the stage of the the school where she first discovered the actor in her. She reminisces, ""All my batchmates will also agree that we all developed all-round personalities here. It's not only about studies. It is also so much about extra curricular and shaping your personality, making you confident to talk and converse. Apart from that, I started my theatre here. The seeds and the idea of becoming an actor actually came when I was here in this school in class VII. The first time I went on stage was in a play on Maharana Pratap, where I played a role. It was for an inter-school competition.""She has come a long way from that play. Having done several successful TV shows, Pankhuri is soon making her film debut in Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan. The actress admits that a film allows actors to make an identity for themselves because TV actors are mostly known more by the name of their characters. Even as we walk around her school, kids are asking for selfies with Vedika (her character's name from Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai). The film will give her a chance to be known more as Pankhuri. ""Television is about repeatedly watching that character every day on screen, so you relate to the character more. In films, it is more about what the actor brings to the fore,"" she says.An old picture of the actress with her classmatesHer debut film, which stars Ayushmann Khurrana and Jitendra Kumar in the lead roles, is a humorous take on the homophobia in small town India. Pankhuri says the film tries to present the stories of the LGBTQIA+ people in an entertaining way, without ridiculing them. She tells us, ""That is the idea. It talks about a homophobic society, which is a very important and serious subject that has not been shown in mainstream cinema that often. It has to be treated in a way that people both like and understand it without offending anybody.""Does her foray into films means a goodbye to television, then? ""Not at all,"" says Pankhuri emphatically. ""As an actor, I am open to exploring every medium that is available to me. Films came as a surprise. This wasn't something that I had planned. It just happened and I am glad that it did because you don't want to limit yourself to one particular medium, which is television. Like I have done theatre and TV, so now getting the opportunity to do a film is an experience that I cherish,"" she adds.Pankhuri knows that a lot of fans want her to reunite with her husband Gautam Rode on screen. The two last worked together in Suryaputra Karna , which ended three years ago. Since their wedding in 2018, however, the couple has not shared screen space. Pankhuri says, ""I really hope we work together sometime because I think it's going to be fun after Suryaputra Karna. I think it's going to be awkward also but let's see."" She mentions awkward and immediately one asks the reason for that. ""When you know a person so well, you can't act.

38,['29/01/2020'],Supreme Court grants bail to 14 convicts serving life terms for Gujarat riots,"Supreme Court Of India

Find work to let the convicts earn livelihood: CJI

NEW DELHI: In an unusual order, the Supreme Court on Tuesday granted bail to 14 persons convicted for their role in killing of 23 people in Ode (in Gujarat’s Anand district ) during the 2002 post-Godhra riots during the pendency of their appeals. The court also ordered them to be shifted outside Gujarat , asked them to do spiritual and social work and directed the legal services authority to find them work to earn a livelihood.The CJI-led bench asked the state legal services authority to supervise their activities and report to the court about compliance of its order and also about their conduct.These persons’ appeals challenging the Gujarat High Court judgment awarding them life sentence have been pending in the SC since 2018 and each has been in jail for around seven years. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for Gujarat, opposed bail on the ground that it was a serious case where 23 people were killed and the trial court as well as Gujarat HC had concurrently held them guilty. Senior advocate P S Patwalia said many appellants ’ convictions were based on sole witness accounts in violation of guidelines laid down by the SC.A bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices B R Gavai and Surya Kant segregated the appellants into two groups — those convicted on the basis of sole eyewitness accounts and others whose convictions were based on testimony of two eyewitnesses. The first group will be shifted from Gujarat jail to Indore and the second kept in Jabalpur, both in Madhya Pradesh. Since their appeals are pending in the SC, they can be granted bail.After releasing them on a bail bond of Rs 25,000 each, the bench asked them to carry out spiritual and social work and not leave the districts of Indore and Jabalpur without prior permission. Finding that almost all of them were first-time offenders and had no criminal antecedents, the court asked the district legal services authority to help them find work to earn a livelihood.CJI Bobde said, “Let us experiment. We direct district legal services authorities to help them out in getting some work to earn a livelihood.” Appearing for the appellants, Patwalia told the court that convictions were recorded by the trial court on the basis of affidavits prepared by NGOs.

But Patwalia read out a statement where the witness had stated that his affidavit was prepared by an NGO.Patwalia said the HC failed to take into consideration the SC judgment guiding courts below to apply the principle of having at least two witnesses before recording conviction in a murder case, and convicted many appellants on the basis of deposition by a sole witness.

Tata Nexon EV

MUMBAI: The Tata group on Tuesday launched its bid for leadership position in India's transition to electric mobility with a 'Made in India' cutting-edge electric avatar of its popular compact SUV Nexon at a killer price of Rs 13.99 lakh for the base model and 312-km range on a single charge.

Developed in-house by pooling talent and expertise available across Tata group companies under chairman N Chandrasekharan’s ‘One Tata’ initiative, Nexon EV raises the bar for rivals Hyundai and Chinese-owned MG Motors by offering as accompaniment an EV (electric vehicle) ecosystem and doorstep service to buyers.

No wonder Tata Motors CEO Guenter Butschek described Nexon EV as “India’s own electric SUV” and a “game-changer with global standard”. “This high-performance, connected vehicle is uniquely suited to address the aspirations of Indian customers, and making EVs mainstream. We are confident this product will reinforce our commitment towards developing sustainable and responsible mobility solutions for India.”

The group has created ‘ Tata UniEVerse ’, a cache of talent and expertise by bringing together Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Tata Autocomp, Tata Motors Finance and retail arm Croma , for developing products, solutions and customer experience for redefining electric mobility.

Tata Power chief,Praveer Sinha said his company will provide charging solution in Nexon EV buyers’ home within 15 days of the purchase. The company will also ramp up the network of charging stations to 650 by March and gradually expand to Tier-II and III cities with different charging architecture to bridge a major gap in adoption of EVs.

Croma head Avijit Mitra said the retail arm will offer an omni-channel, new way of selling cars with kiosks to showcase the capabilities and competitiveness of Nexon EV and accept bookings for test drives. Eventually, these may also become a sales point for the vehicle, as without competing with dealers but as Tata Motors EV head Sailesh Chandra said, would widen the funnel to catch consumers, especially the tech-savvy Genext who comes to Croma to, say, buy a smartphone”.

Group arms such as Tata Motors Finance will support sales through funding, while Tata Chemicals will take care of the indigenisation of battery and localisation of critical components will be led by Tata Solutions .

All these companies have contributed to making Nexon EV distinct from rival offerings. The battery can be charged up to 80% in 60 mins using a fast charger, while it will take 8 hours to do so with a home charger. Per-minute of fast charging will give it a range of 4 km and a 50% charge will last for 150 km.

The Nexon EV will be available in three trim levels across 60 authorized dealerships in 22 cities. Tata Motors is offering a two-tier charging system for the Nexon EV. There will be a standard 3.3 kW home charger, which will be provided with every car. This is to charge the batteries of this eSUV in a matter of 8 hours. When connected to a 50 kW charger, the batteries of the Nexon EV will be juiced up from 20 to 80 per cent in a matter of 60 minutes.

The vehicle will also come with a dedicated Battery Management System (BMS) designed for an extended battery life of up to eight years and will offer consistent performance. The powertrain also gets a dedicated cooling circuit in a bid to provide consistent performance in hot weather conditions.

41,['29/01/2020'],Narendra Modi: Those communalising government steps like CAA exposed: PM Narendra Modi,"This story is from January 29, 2020

PM Modi presents a trophy during the NCC rally at Cariappa Parade Ground in New Delhi (ANI)

NEW DELHI: The real face of some people who are trying to give a communal colour to the government’s decisions to resolve problems that have lingered for decades was being exposed and coming under close scrutiny, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in New Delhi on Tuesday.

“The country is silent but fully understands what is happening... how lies to further vote banks have been concocted for decades. People have understood all this,” Modi said while addressing a National Cadet Corps rally. The PM’s comments came in the context of his references to the decision to abrogate Jammu & Kashmir’s special status and passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

PM Modi hit out strongly against those opposed to CAA and said that certain political parties were so obsessed with vote-bank politics that they couldn’t see even rape and kidnappings of girls belonging to minority communities in Pakistan.

“The youth of this country has decided that prob-lems will not be deferred, they will be confronted and dealt with,” Modi said in remarks seen as an outreach to his youthful audience in the backdrop of opposition parties and a section of commentators claiming that youth were driving the protests against CAA.

Referring to the decisions on J&K, Modi asked how long the ills that accompanied Partition could be allowed to linger and a death toll of victims of terrorism allowed to mount. “Sometimes, when an illness continues for very long, it becomes part of the body. Could we have allowed this situation to continue,” he asked.

He also spoke of the decision to regularise some 1,700-odd colonies in Delhi, saying it provided succour to some 40 lakh people.

Modi said that CAA was intended to correct a “historic blunder” committed at the time of Partition and cited a recent advertisement by Pakistan army in which it had sought applications for sanitation workers with a rider that only non-Muslims could apply for the job.

42,['29/01/2020'],"Tax Evasion: 3.4 lakh evade cap gains tax on equity, MF sales: Government","(Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Over 3.4 lakh investors dealing in listed equity shares and mutual funds are suspected to have evaded or not reported long-term capital gains tax, an analysis by the income tax department showed, prompting authorities to dismiss demands for the abolition of the levy introduced two years ago.Data analysis on the impact of LTCG, showed that during 2018-19, around 91,000 individuals and Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs), or 16%, dealing in listed shares and mutual funds who sold listed shares or mutual funds exceeding Rs 20 lakh did not file returns. The value of sales of these shares and mutual fund units was estimated at Rs 99,000 crore.Another 2.5 lakh individuals and HUFs, or 44% of the population that sold shares or MF units, reported either zero or substantially reduced value in their income tax returns although the transactions added up to over Rs 4 lakh crore. The government is yet to decide the future course of action against these entities.“This perhaps explains why there is a demand for abolition of LTCG and Securities Transaction Tax (STT) so that profits earned by people through shares etc. are not included in their income… If LTCG is abolished, it will open a major loophole for tax avoidance,” said an officer.Government sources said the tax also helps track investors who would have otherwise gone unnoticed in case they do not pay income tax. Many of the transactions in penny stocks or those involving black money can be tracked through this route, officials argued.“It is a standard tax all over the world for decades with almost 95%, including the US, Canada, Australia, China and several European countries levying it,” said an official, while pointing out that the tax ranges between 10% and 35 % on the profits earned from the sale of shares or mutual fund units.The sources said demands for withdrawing a levy that was introduced two years ago were not in line with suggestions for consistency and continuity in the tax policy.Starting April, 2018 sale of shares and equity-oriented mutual funds, held for one year or more, began attracting 10% LTCG (plus cess) if the gain in a year was over Rs 1 lakh.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73721115,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-51602,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/3-4-lakh-evade-cap-gains-tax-on-equity-mf-sales-government/articleshow/73712520.cms

Sabarimala Ayyappa temple

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice S A Bobde on Tuesday said that the nine-judge constitution bench will hear and complete arguments in 10 days on the larger issue of faith versus fundamental rights arising from the controversy over women’s entry into Sabarimala temple, mosques and Parsi agiyaris.

“It cannot be given more than 10 days for completion of arguments.Even if someone wants more time, it cannot be given,” the CJI told solicitor general Tushar Mehta when the latter informed that counsel for various parties, who met on court orders, could not arrive at an agreement over framing common questions of law to be addressed before the nine-judge bench.

CJI Bobde asked the SG to hand over questions framed by lawyers for various parties and said, “We will frame the common questions of law.” For this, a three-judge bench will have to hear lawyers and determine which questions should be retained and what should be deleted.

On January 13, the nine-judge bench of Justices Bobde, R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, M M Shantanagoudar, S Abdul Nazeer, R Subhash Reddy, B R Gavai and Surya Kant had said it would decide the larger issue and would not hear arguments on petitions specifically seeking review of the SC’s September 28, 2018 judgment quashing the ban on entry of women in the 10-50 year age group into Sabarimala Ayyappa temple.

On November 14 last year, a five-judge bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi by three to two majority not only disturbed the September 28, 2018 judgment allowing entry of women of all ages into Sabarimala temple but also asked a seven-judge bench to evolve guidelines for deciding cases involving clash of fundamental rights and faith emerging from women’s entry into temples, mosques and agiyaris.

I have full faith in due process of law: Sharjeel

NEW DELHI/ PATNA: A joint team of Delhi and Bihar police on Tuesday arrested JNU student Sharjeel Imam on charges of sedition from his ancestral house in Bihar’s Jehanabad district . Police said Sharjeel had changed his look and had been shifting his location for the past three days after he had been spotted at an anti-CAA protest in Patna’s Phulwari Sharif locality.The PhD scholar was detained and produced before a Bihar court for a transit remand to be brought back to Delhi. Sharjeel, however, tweeted before the arrest that he had willingly surrendered to the cops at 3pm.Sharjeel, against whom cases have been filed in four states, will be probed for his possible role in stoking violence at Delhi Gate, Jamia Millia and Seelampur with a speech he delivered at Aligarh Muslim University . In the speech, he had reportedly spoken about cutting off the Northeast from the rest of India at the “chicken’s neck” near Siliguri .DCP (crime) Rajesh Deo said five teams from Delhi Police’s Crime Branch were deployed in Patna and Mumbai to track down Sharjeel after an FIR was registered against him for his inflammatory speech.After the video of the speech had surfaced, cops registered a case of promoting enmity between religious groups, showing disaffection towards the government and public mischief.A team from the Crime Branch had reached Bihar on January 25 and conducted multiple raids at the last seen locations of Sharjeel. It was found that Sharjeel kept changing his location between Patna to Jehnabad. A police team was sent to his residence as well, but his parents could not specify his whereabouts.Police sources said Sharjeel’s parents had even tried to contact him but he was unreachable. On Tuesday, cops tracked down Sharjeel’s brother, Muzammil who was questioned during which he revealed that his brother would be visiting the ancestral house at Malik Tola in Kako village.A police team reached the house around 2pm and found Sharjeel at the Malik Tola imambara.In a tweet, Sharjeel said, “I am ready and willing to operate (sic) with the investigation. I have full faith in due process of law. My safety and security are now in the hands of Delhi Police. Let peace prevail.” Cops, however, denied that he had surrendered, saying did not approach a court to surrender.Locals said Sharjeel’s family is associated with the ruling JD(U). One of them said, “Sharjeel’s father, the late Akbar Imam, had lost in the 2005 assembly election when he fought from Jehanabad on a JD(U) ticket. His uncle, Arshad Imam, is a block-level leader of JD(U) at Kako. His brother, Muzammil, is a social worker.”Police said Sharjeel would be brought back to Delhi on Wednesday and interrogated. The scholar’s association with the Popular Front of India (PFI) is also under scanner.Police said he had been travelling to different parts of Bihar since January 24 to organise rallies against the amended citizenship law. Cops have seized his mobile phone and are scanning its contents.In Video: Inflammatory speech at Shaheen Bagh: JNU student Sharjeel Imam arrested",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73713617,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-433727,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/sharjeel-imam-held-in-bihar-set-to-be-brought-back/articleshow/73713614.cms

Representative image

NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet is likely to approve changes in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act on Wednesday, recognising “failure of contraceptive” as a lawful reason for abortion, including for unmarried women, sources said. This will make it easier for single women to safely and legally terminate unwanted pregnancy.

Currently, the law recognises “failure of contraceptive” and “unplanned pregnancy” as legal reasons for abortion only in case of “married” women. The law says while for minors, written consent from parents is required, unmarried women cannot cite contraceptive failure as a reason for abortion.

Sources said the proposed amendment includes extending the gestation period from the current 20 weeks to 24 weeks for “special categories” and this may include single women with unwanted pregnancy, apart from disabled and other vulnerable women.

They said other proposed amendments to the law include allowing abortion any time during pregnancy for foetal abnormality, which cannot be detected during the 20-week gestation period. Currently, the law allows medical abortion only till 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Under the MTP Act, pregnancy can be terminated until 20 weeks after conception if it can harm the mother; if the pregnancy was the result of rape; if the child will be born with serious physical or mental defects; or in case of contraceptive failure.

Sources said the government move to end any ambiguity with regard to unmarried women will help address the social taboo attached to sexual activity of single or unmarried women.

The smell of bhog, the chorus of pushpanjali from almost every household and the deluge of youngsters stepping out in their ethnic best — the festival that honours the goddess of wisdom — is celebrated with a lot of fervour. Besides the traditional norms, what’s also indispensable to Saraswati Puja is the colour yellow that signifies a fresh start and new bloom. We asked our Tollywood brigade about their fondest memories of Saraswati Puja, what plans they have for this year and why yellow is a sartorial mandate on the auspicious day. Here’s what they had to say...Saraswati Puja has always been special. My fondest memories revolve around going to invite other schools and colleges back in the day. Since we would also visit girls’ schools, the excitement knew no bounds! Now, I mostly spend a working Saraswati Puja. However, I do visit my in-laws’ place to attend puja. As for wearing yellow, I’ve always defied pre-set rules! So, the colour isn’t mandatory for me.Like every year, this year too there will be Saraswati Puja at my place. I prepare the bhog all by myself. I make it a point to wear a sari on this day and consciously try to stick to shades of yellow.— ArpitaSaraswati Puja has always been special. I still remember, my mother would buy a new set of yellow kurta pyjama for me and I’d ask, ‘Why do you get yellow clothes every year?’ To this she would always say, ‘Basanti pujo te holud porte hoye.’ And the tradition still continues, except that I prefer sunshine yellow over mustard! And since we have a puja at home, pushpanjali and bhog are a must. I also love seeing everyone wearing yellow today, especially the little girls who wear laal par holud sari.— YashThis year it’s a working Saraswati Puja for me as I’m shooting. Every year, I wear a kurta on the festive day. It’s not mandatory that it has to be in a yellow shade but I have always preferred the basanti hue above any other colour on Saraswati Puja.Although I’m busy promoting my upcoming film, I will certainly take out time to attend the Saraswati Puja hosted by a city production house. I will also attend the puja at my manager’s place. Every year, since my childhood, I wear a yellow attire on Saraswati Puja. I believe, yellow goes best with the festivities. All year round, we can wear clothes of our favourite colours, but on Saraswati Puja, it has to be yellow — at least for me! I will be wearing a yellow sari.This year I plan to head to a friend’s place in the evening for Saraswati Puja. Wearing yellow is a must on this day and the day is never complete unless I sport a sari. So, like every year, I will wear a traditional sari. I also love digging into pujor bhog. No matter who has cooked the bhog, it always tastes heavenly.— Paayel SarkarSaraswati Puja is one of my most favourite days of a year. Not only do I have a puja at home, I also visit my school at Salt Lake. It’s like a reunion of sorts with my schoolmates. After attending the puja at school, I will head out for lunch with my friends and spend hours indulging in delicious spread and adda. Visiting a mela every year near my school is also a must.

PATNA/ BHUBANESWAR: The National Population Register updation process faced hurdles in Bihar and Odisha on Tuesday.

A month after rejecting any National Register of Citizens in Bihar, CM Nitish Kumar on Tuesday asked the Centre to remove the new questions related to the date and place of birth of parents in the NPR updation form as “they would create unnecessary confusion”. In Odisha, the Naveen Patnaik government said it has decided against asking these questions and the relevant column will be deleted from the form for the state.

Talking to reporters, Nitish said“If answering certain questions in the NPR is optional, then what is the need of asking those questions?” JD(U) will convey its opinion to the Centre, he added. On the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he asserted that it is the Centre’s responsibility to implement it. He said the matter is now in SC and people should wait for its decision.

About the NPR, he said: “NPR has been there since 2011. It was reviewed in 2015 and it is being done again in 2020. But new questions added in it are likely to create confusionAdding new things to NPR, which can create confusion, is not required.”

On the optional questions in the NPR form, Nitish further said: “There is a provision in the new NPR questionnaire that if someone doesn’t want to answer a question, he will not be forced to do it. But even then, there will be a blank space in the questionnaire. This is creating confusion as people may think the blank space may create trouble for them in future, if NRC is to be implemented. Thus, we are of the view that the old format for NPR be followed to avoid unnecessary confusion.”

In Odisha, BJD’s Pinaki Mishra, after a meeting of MPs chaired by CM Patnaik, said, “The specified Column 13 (ii) of the NPR form will be deleted from the state NPR sheet.” As per instruction manual for the update of NPR-2020, column 13 (ii) seeks data on the place of birth of the applicants’ father and mother. The Centre has, however, clarified that filling this column is optional. He explained that the regional party — which faced flak from a section of citizens for supporting CAA in Parliament and for going ahead with the NPR update even as several non-BJP states opposed both — was always concerned about column 13 (ii).

52,['29/01/2020'],"Women too should get command posts in Army, says Supreme Court","This story is from January 29, 2020

Representative image

NEW DELHI: Emphasising the need for change of mindset to treat women officers on par with men, the Supreme Court on Tuesday said suitability and competence should be the criteria in deciding command appointments within the Army and there should not be any gender discrimination.

Though a bench of Justices D Y Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi appreciated the Centre for taking a “very positive step” in granting permanent commission to women officers, it asked why women are considered only for staff appointments and not command posts. “Test them on the same footing as men. Do not exclude them (women officers) as a class. Change of mindset is required,” the bench observed when senior advocate Aishwarya Bhatti and lawyer Meenakshi Lekhi, appearing for women officers, contended that not giving command appointments to women amounts to treating them as second class citizens within the Army.

Senior advocate R Balasubramanian and lawyer Neela Gokhale, appearing for the ministry of defence, contended that Army personnel work under very hostile conditions, particularly in forward areas. But their contention was opposed by the women officers and they told the bench that there are many instances of women officers performing their duty successfully in adverse conditions and pointed out that one such officer Archana had created bunker at the front-line during the Kargil War . The bench said that it may not direct the government to give command appointments to women officers but it would ask them to consider them on the basis of suitability and competence. The arguments would resume next week. It said the court would examine the plea of women officers in Air Force and Navy separately.

54,['29/01/2020'],‘Automated driving test centre likely by September-end’,"This story is from January 29, 2020

PATNA: As things are going hi-tech, even driving test centres in the state capital will soon be automatic. Those seeking driving licences will have to undergo test through sensors and high-definition closed-circuit cameras on an especially designed track.

As of now, applicants undergo driving test near Golghar and at Phulwarisharif in Patna where a motor vehicle inspector (MVI) takes the test manually.

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said three acres of Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRCT) land have been earmarked at Phulwarisharif to set up an automated driving test centre , which will be ready by September. The Central Institute of Road Transport (CIRT) will develop this centre.

Agarwal said the decision was taken to do away with malpractices in granting driving licences. He further said once this automated driving test centre is ready, people will not have to wait for their turn as at least 300 applicants can be tested in a day, while manually only around 150-200 people can undergo tests daily.

For both the two-wheelers and four-wheelers, there will be certain set norms which applicants have to fulfil and then only they will be given driving licences. Those who fail the test will have to come again after a week.

The applicants for four-wheelers will have to undergo six stages of test, which include reverse driving, figure of 8, overtaking, traffic junction, parallel parking and uphill drive. All the stages will have a set time period for completion and in a few of them one or two hits will be relaxed. For two-wheelers, an applicant will have to undergo three stages of test, which include straight driving on a ramp, followed by driving on serpentine route and then for applying emergency break.

Agarwal said such automated driving test centres will also come up at Aurangabad and Muzaffarpur in Bihar. While in Aurangabad, the department has set the target to get it ready by June, the one at Muzaffarpur will get ready by the year-end.

55,['29/01/2020'],India Inc needs to brace for rising employee activism,"This story is from January 29, 2020

By James Agrawal

Employee activism is a relatively new phenomenon, observed in big ticket IT companies like Google and Amazon over the last few years. In an age termed to be one of activism, does employee activism need to be looked at seriously? This is not an easy question to answer because of the unpredictability of the nature of activism. But you can’t ignore and push it to become a reactive crisis management topic. HR managers need to start somewhere and evolve a policy along the way that aligns corporate goals with those of the employee.

Employee activism can be looked at as an extension of the unions that fought for their rights — like fair pay and reasonable work hours. It widens the ambit to include employees raising their voice to be heard on issues like environmental pollution, inclusive workplaces and, in some instances, even company business decisions. With the decreasing influence of unions across the world, employees are now organising based on common interests to engage in protests.

What has also changed now from unions to activists is the visibility of the protests. With internet proliferation and social media activism, a large-scale protest only takes a few minutes to be all over the news, worldwide. This can turn into a PR nightmare with the company’s brand value at stake. Corporate email and memo leaks have also embarrassed many companies, especially when confidential data is leaked.

In November 2018, 20,000 Google employees staged a walkout to protest against the management protecting highly placed executives accused of sexual harassment. In April 2019, employees at Google again voiced their opinion against Google working with the government on US military projects. Amazon also got a taste of this activism in September last year, when hundreds of employees walked out of Amazon offices to support a global ‘climate strike’. The employees were part of a group named ‘Amazon employees for climate justice’ who were and are trying to influence Amazon to decrease its carbon footprint worldwide.

These companies took note and tried to address the concerns of the employees. Google decided not to go ahead with the US military project. Amazon initiated a ‘climate pledge’, promising to decrease carbon emissions in its operations globally. There are many more such examples from technology companies in the US — Microsoft, Facebook and WeWork — which have dealt with employee activism. So, is this kind of activism only seen in large tech firms with a highly educated workforce and only in the US?

HR experts say that though the scale of activism is nowhere near what has been witnessed in the US, employee activism is all set to soar in all companies — tech or non-tech, big or small. Companies in India will also have to gear up to address activism with a well-thought out strategy. Almost 50% of India’s workforce today comes from the ‘millennial’ generation, born between 1980 and 2000. The research on ‘millennials’ indicates that they want their jobs to mean more than just jobs. Most of them would like to work for companies that align with the values they uphold in their daily life.

With social media, opinions are everywhere and knowledge just a few clicks away. Trends from across the world are easy to follow even in remote locations and opinions can be mobilised quickly through 140-character tweets. We are already seeing a change with CEO activism, where leaders are stepping out of their comfort zone to take a stand on current issues — political or otherwise. This is a huge shift from a traditional corporate environment that did not believe in protesting of any sort.

HR should be ready with a strategy on activism to understand how it can be encouraged to further company goals. This will add value to companies that are looking to engage with customers by being more socially responsible. Many of them like to be seen as having values that allow them to grow profitably without compromising on ethics. Drawing out an employee activism framework will help companies in enhancing their overall reputation. Here are some guidelines that can help HR in starting out:

* Listen to employees: Establish processes where employees can reach out to communicate issues that concern them. Employees should be able to talk without fear of any backlash. Sometimes issues can be solved by the senior management being clued into what the popular opinion is. Having an open channel for communicating helps in solving issues faster too.

* Framing values with actionable items: Organisational values need to be spelled out clearly with a plan of action. Just talking about values without actually walking the talk will not help. Say, an organisation believes that ethics are important for it to operate, then it should be also ready to be questioned by employees on that front.

* Establishing a response protocol with dos and don’ts: With social media usually at the forefront of employee activism, lack of a proper response strategy will leave you staring at a problem much bigger than it actually is. HR should be proactive in communicating upfront on how the company will deal with issues that concern employees, so that issues can be addressed internally first. It is also important to list things that you consider non-negotiable. For example, companies can state that employees who leak confidential documents online will incur penal action.

* Building flexibility into the policy: While drafting this policy, HR should be flexible enough to change it as and when required. The unpredictable nature of activism will give rise to many a scenario that companies don’t foresee. Keep communications transparent and open, so feedback can be incorporated to improve on the go.

Initiating this exercise and having an open approach will help in developing an organisation-wide culture towards activism. Over time, this can help build goodwill and foster an environment of collaboration among employees. An approachable leadership will make employees feel engaged to contribute to the company.

This is an opportunity to build a company that actually reaches out to employees who want to be part of a good work environment. Even if an actual instance of activism could be further away, starting conversations around the topic will give companies an edge in this age of activism.

Chennai: The global economic situation coupled with recent mishaps like Australian bushfire, breakout of coronavirus in China, many travellers are either delaying their holiday plans, or cancelling them completely, giving indications of a tepid demand this summer.

Despite unfavourable situations making it tough to decide on whether to take a holiday or not, travel planners are putting their best foot forward. From lowering deposit rates at time of booking a holiday, cheaper EMIs, offering bonus holidays on the next trip, extending the number of tour days, travel planners are trying ways to push demand for this summer holiday season.

“On packages for European countries priced at 1 lakh and above, we always collected deposits between the range of Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000 per person at the time of booking, which is now lowered to Rs 30,000-Rs 35,000. For non-European packages it is reduced from Rs 30,000 to Rs 20,000 per person. Moreover, for every booking to the US or European countries, customers will get four free extra days on their next trip valid till September, 2020,” Daniel D’souza, president and country head, leisure, SOTC Travel, said. A Chennai-based curated travel planner, Pickyourtrail has seen more customers cancelling their booking due to the virus outbreak in China. “Our average cancellation rate of 2%-3% has increased to 10% owing to the ‘corona’ outbreak in China and its repercussions. We now estimate cancellations to go up to 15%, depending on how changes in customer sentiment and changing situation in South East Asia,” said Hari Ganapathi, co-founder, Pickyourtrail. The online travel planner also recorded many opting for Sri Lanka and Maldives as alternate destinations for China. Pickyourtrail has also rolled out packages to Japan where a five-night trip is extended to an eight-night trip, besides adding more cities on its itinerary. Rajeev Kale, president and country head (Holiday, MICE, Visa) of Thomas Cook (India) said “We have recently launched ‘Ek Ka Teen’ offer to encourage Indian travellers to book their annual summer vacation as well and avail of two micro-cations at the price of one.”

Mumbai: HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh holds only 0.07% in HDFC, the corporation that he helped build over four decades and which currently has a market capitalisation of Rs 4.2 lakh crore.

Addressing entrepreneurs in his speech at the TiEcon Mumbai 2020 event, Parekh said, “In the truest sense, I am not an entrepreneur, though I always felt like one and managed the company like it belonged to me 100%.”

While HDFC was founded by Parekh’s uncle H T Parekh in 1977 after his retirement, it was Deepak Parekh who is credited with having built the organisation into the mortgage giant that it is today.

“I have been in the company for 42 years now. I joined as an employee and retired as executive chairman in 2009, and since then have been the non-executive chairman. My shareholding in the company is only through employee stock options, which have been given to each employee,” said Parekh. He added that he has not drawn a salary for the last 11 years though he come to work every day.

Speaking on leadership qualities, Parekh asked his audience to ensure that the trait of humility sticks like glue. “Secondly, don’t do anything that you would be embarrassed if it came in the newspaper. Remember, there is no softer pillow to rest your head at night than a clear conscience,” he said.

He urged the entrepreneurs to have a value-based work culture through demonstration from the top to the lowest level.

A woman buys an idol of Goddess Saraswati from a shop on Bailey Road in Patna

PATNA: People, especially students, across the city are ready to celebrate Saraswati Puja with traditional fervour and religious gaiety on Thursday.

As Goddess Saraswati is the deity of wisdom and learning, youngsters celebrate it on Basant Panchami with utmost enthusiasm and zeal. From setting up ‘pandals’, putting idols of Goddess Saraswati and organising cultural activities, youngsters across the city celebrate the festival with devotion and fervour.

Pandal samitis claimed they have made all necessary arrangements. Patna district magistrate Kumar Ravi has already issued directives for immersion of idols only in the artificial ponds made on the river banks.

City-based priest Kanhaiya Upadhyay said Saraswati Puja marks the beginning of spring. “The festival is celebrated on the fifth day of ‘Maagh’ as per the Hindu calendar. It is believed that offering fruits and ‘abir’ to Goddess Saraswati on Basant Panchami brings knowledge and wisdom. Many students place their books in front of the Goddess’ idol and pray to the deity for excelling in studies.”

He added: “People even decorate their houses with yellow flowers and wear bright yellow clothes. They also eat yellow coloured sweets and fruits.”

Shreya, a student of Magadh Mahila College, said they will organize cultural activities like dance, songs and skits on the occasion. “We have also planned to dress up in vibrant shades of yellow,” she said Shreya.

Several Patnaites have also opted for ecofriendly ways of celebrating the festival. Akshat Raj, a Class VII student of a private school in Kadamkuan area, said he and his friends have made an eco-friendly idol with clay. “Idols of Goddess Saraswati available in the market are either made of mud or plaster of paris. Those made of plaster of paris contain several chemicals like sulphur, gypsum and phosphorus, which are toxic and release harmful components when immersed in water,” he said.

The flyover is coming up on the south side approach road of Digha rail-cum-road bridge

PATNA: One flank of the upcoming AIIMS-Digha elevated road will be open for vehicular movement from February-end. The 11.9km-long road, which has a two-lane semi-elevated road from AIIMS-Patna and four-lane on the remaining stretch, is expected to be completed in March.

Elevated road apart, officials said final touches were also being given to 1.25km-long flyover, which is a part of the 12.27km- long two-lane road underneath the elevated road along Digha-Danapur canal road from AIIMS to Digha. The flyover is targeted to become functional for vehicular traffic from February 15.

The flyover is coming up on the south side approach road of Digha rail-cum-road bridge. Being made with an estimated outlay of Rs157.14 crore, the road will serve people coming from Phulwarisharif or AIIMS and going to JP Setu and Digha.

“Motorists from AIIMS or Phulwarisharif have to take quite a few turns while going to JP Setu. The flyover will ease pressure on Gandhi Maidan-Danapur road as it would provide direct connectivity to those going to JP Setu,” said Sanjay Kumar Agarwal, managing director of Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL).

“Heavy vehicles coming from Naubatpur and Phulwarisharif side create jam on the Digha-Khagaul canal road. The new flyover will solve that problem,” he added.

Meanwhile, 98% of the work on the Digha-AIIMS elevated road is complete. The project entailing an expenditure of Rs1,231.06 crore was initially targeted to be completed by March 2018. However, sources said it got delayed owing to financial issued faced by the constructing agency.

Another major reason for the delay was construction of a railway overbridge (RoB) at Khagaul. Officials at BSRDCL said th construction of RoB will commence soon. “We have recently got a no-objection certificate (NOC) from railways for construction of the RoB on the eastern side of existing one at Khagaul,” an official said.

Meanwhile, commuters are happy that the elevated road as well as a flyover will be available for traffic soon. “I face traffic jams nearly everyday while going to Digha. I hope to enjoy a seamless driving in the coming months following commencement of vehicular movement on the AIIMS-Digha elevated road,” said Amit Kumar of Mustafapur.

Nitish Kumar

GAYA: Mathura MP and ‘Dream Girl’ of yesteryears Hema Malini, will perform at the inaugural day of the three-day-long ‘ Bodh Mahotsava ’ beginning today (Wednesday). The event will be inaugurated by chief minister Nitish Kumar in the iconic Kalchakra Maidan to the north west of Mahabodhi Temple, the seat of Buddha’s enlightenment.

Bodh Mahotsav is held every winter to promote tourism. The then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee inaugurated the first Bodh Mahotsav in the year 1998. As per the event format, artists from nine countries including Japan, Laos, Myanmar and Bhutan will perform at the event. According to district magistrate Abhishek Singh, local artists too will get the opportunity to show their talent.

Elaborate security arrangements have been made for the event. About 2000 police personnel of different ranks have been deputed to maintain law and order during the mega event. According to SSP Rajeev Mishra, Bodh Gaya has been divided into seven sectors for effective policing. Kalchakra Maidan too has been divided into four parts. Adequate number of CCTV cameras have been installed.

Kalchakra Maidan, it may be recalled, was targetted by Bangladesh-based terror outfit Jamaitul Mujahedden in January 2018. The outfit had engineered a low intensity IED blast in the Maidan.

Bodh Gaya watchers believe that in view of the Corona virus and ongoing anti-CAA protests in different parts of the country, foreign tourists footfall may remain low. Tourism department is yet to evolve a mechanism to make a head count of foreigners visiting Bodh Gaya.

According to Suresh Singh, president of the Bodh Gaya Nagar Vikas Manch, the protests have not affected visitors from Buddhist countries but very few tourists from Europe and USA have come recently and this was a matter of concern for Bodh Gaya’s tourist-centric economy. “Bodh Gaya economy is yet to recover from the impact of liquor prohibition,” he said.

Conceding that Corona virus as well as security concerns of the tourists will affect the footfall in Bodh Gaya, hospitality sector expert Arun Kumar Ojha said the virus factor was more worrisome. As per rough estimate more than 100 mainland Chinese are present in Bodh Gaya and an effective strategy was required to address the genuine concerns of the visitors.

However, civil surgeon Dr BK Singh said he does not have information about the presence of Chinese nationals in Bodh Gaya. “The employees of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) have been sensitised and a 20-bed isolation ward was in place at the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital (ANMMCH),” said Dr Singh. The CS evaded the issue of the installation of the much-needed thermal scanner at the airport.

Lalit Narayan Mithila University

DARBHANGA: The Lalit Narayan Mithila University (LNMU) has moved the Supreme Court for preponing the date of BEd entrance examination scheduled from April 20-25 to March 29, to ensure that admission test results and the academic session can commence within the stipulated time frame.

The Raj Bhavan has made LNMU the nodal agency for conducting combined entrance test (CET) for admission to BEd course in 15 universities of the state through regular and distance modes as well as Shiksha Shastri (equivalent of BEd course taught in Darbhanga-based Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga Sanskrit University) for the academic session 2020-2022 as per the Supreme Court guidelines.

The university has appointed Prof Ajit Kumar Singh, commerce department, as the state nodal officer (SNO) and constituted a seven-member core committee.

Professor Singh said, “As per the Supreme Court guidelines, the publication of advertisement for entrance test for B Ed course should be on February 1, followed by the exam between April 20 and 24, declaration of results between May 25 and 30 and commencement of the academic session on July1 every year.

“However, since the counselling of selected students through CET in all universities will take more time and the guidelines of the apex court with regard to the last date of admission stipulated as June 28 may not be adhered to, hence the LNMU has moved the SC to prepone the date of examination from April 20-25 to March 29,” he said.

Singh added: “The preponement will help all the 15 universities to publish their results on April 15 and complete the process within the stipulated time frame.

LNMU’s advocate has already filed a petition in this regard with a copy of the tentative schedule of CET prepared by the university.”

The nodal officer also said that all the 15 universities have been asked to nominate one nodal officer for communication with LNMU and furnish the list of BEd colleges under their jurisdiction, out of which 11 have replied.

“Soon after the Supreme Court verdict, LNMU will notify the advertisement for the entrance test on February 1,” Singh said

63,['29/01/2020'],HC summons UGC secretary on Rs 287 crore disbursal to colleges,"This story is from January 29, 2020

PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday ordered University Grants Commission (UGC) secretary to physically appear on February 11 and explain the manner in which Rs287 crore was disbursed to several colleges and educational institutes in state since 2007.

The division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was hearing a PIL filed by Veteran Forum for Transparency in Public Life. The petitioner alleged funds embezzlement and pleaded for an inquiry by some independent agency like CBI as no utilization certificate was submitted against the sum disbursed. The petitioner also sought direction to the authorities concerned to recover the entire amount on the ground of its defalcation.

The entire amount was allocated in phases from 2007 to 2017.

The UGC, however, apprised the high court that it had received utilization certificates against Rs122 crore, but did not submit the details.

Petitioner counsel Dinu Kumar submitted that spot verification was required to ascertain that the funds were actually and properly utilized or not as certificates were submitted after several years.

On December 12, the high court had directed the UGC to file a composite affidavit within three weeks’ time indicating the manner in which Rs287 crore was disbursed to several colleges in state. The HC had ordered that UGC secretary would have to remain present if he failed to comply with the order.

The matter was again taken up for hearing on January 9. The high court again granted two weeks’ time and fixed January 27 as the next date for hearing, reiterating that the secretary would have to physically appear before court in case of failure to comply with the order.

On October 18 last year, the high court observed that the records did not reflect whether the money had been properly utilized or had gone waste.

64,['29/01/2020'],PMC board approves RTPS counters in all circles,"This story is from January 29, 2020

PATNA: The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) board on Tuesday approved altogether 12 proposals amid a spat between mayor Sita Sahu and former deputy mayor Vinay Kumar Pappu over not including in the agenda development schemes like ‘Nali-Gali’ and ‘Har Ghar Nal Ka Jal’ schemes as well as installation of borewells in a few wards.

Pappu tore the agenda copy to shreds and asked the ward councillors to boycott the meeting. He told this newspaper that the empowered standing committee at its meeting held in November 2019 had also approved the inclusion of development schemes in only those wards in which the councillors support the mayor.

“We will not accept such favouritism. The development schemes should be implemented in all wards,” he said, adding that the PMC board meetings had been postponed several times over the past few months.

Mayor Sahu, on the other hand, said the meeting could not be held due to the engagement of municipal commissioner and other officers in other official works.

Refuting the allegations of favouritism in sanctioning development projects, Sahu said: “If he had some issue, he should have raised it in the meeting. Tearing the meeting agenda would do no good. Such behaviour will not be tolerated.”

Amid the chaos, the ward councillors passed all the agendas, including setting up RTPS (Right to Public Services) counters in all five circles of PMC.

Besides, approval was given to a proposal for termination of contract of two private firms, which provided around 2,000 sanitation workers in Bankipore and Patna City circles.

The mayor said the two other empanelled agencies would look after these two circles, unless more agencies are outsourced for cleaning and other sanitation works. “Other proposals approved in the meeting included setting up workshop in all six circles for maintenance and repair of twin garbage tipper vehicles,” she said.

The other proposals included segregation of wet and dry waste at secondary garbage point, Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali, maintenance of electric crematorium, providing basic amenities on the Ganga riverfront and plan for maintenance of interstate bus terminal among others.

PATNA: The Patna high court on Tuesday sought reply from the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) on provisions for creating vending zones on the covered drainage in the middle of Boring Canal Road from Hartali Mor to Rajapur pul.

The bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was hearing a PIL filed by one Raj Kumar Agarwal, who pleaded that the drain would not be cleaned even if required and get chocked if vending zones are created over it. He also submitted that there was no provision under The Street Vendors Act, 2014 to provide such a place for roadside vendors. The space was earlier used as parking space for vehicles.

The court granted four weeks’ time to the corporation to reply after the petitioner asked when was the notification issued and if any map had been approved for creating vending zones there. He further asked the PMC when any such committee was formed for taking the decision.

State’s reply sought on leprosy patients: The Patna high court on Tuesday directed the state government to file a counter affidavit apprising it of the action taken for the well-being of leprosy patients living in hutments at Ram Nagar in Khagaul under The Persons with Disabilities (Equal opportunities, protection of rights and full participation) Act, 1995.

A division bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah was hearing a PIL filed by an NGO, which pleaded for an alternate arrangement for the leprosy patients living in miserable condition in temporary hutments at Ram Nagar Kusht Ashram as they were being asked to vacate the area by circle officer for the construction of an overbridge there.

The high court directed the state government to file its reply before the next hearing on February 4. If the order is not complied with, the director (empowerment of persons with disabilities) of social welfare department would have to physically appear before the bench. Gautam Kumar Kejriwal appeared for the petitioner while Prashant Pratap represented the state.

At least 40 leprosy patients with family members reside in the area beside a drainage for the last several years. They have been asked to vacate the place because an overbridge is to be constructed there

67,['29/01/2020'],"Banks approve reduced fees for UPI, RuPay","This story is from January 29, 2020

Digbijay Mishra & Rachel Chitra | TNN

Bengaluru: Banks have decided that they will not charge a part of the fees on Unified Payments Interface ( UPI ) and RuPay card transactions as long as the merchant discount rate ( MDR ) remains zero following the government announcement, three people aware of the matter said. After a letter from the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) on removing entire fees on these transactions, which would have meant significant revenue loss for its owner National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ), the two parties have reached an understanding for now.

The move was discussed and approved in the NPCI steering committee meeting on Monday, said the sources mentioned earlier. TOI reported in its January 24 edition, saying IBA had asked NPCI to remove multiple charges like interchange fees, payments service provider ( PSP ) fee and switching fees. “Interchange will be zero is what was decided in yesterday’s meeting. NPCI is still reviewing other fees, but it is against making those fees to nil,” one of the people mentioned earlier said.

For context, a bank, which used to get MDR from merchants for facilitating the payments, would pay interchange fees to the issuer bank and then pay a switching fee to the network — NPCI — along with a fee to PSPs like PhonePe or GooglePay. NPCI, according to sources, is unwilling to make additional fees like switching and PSP fees to zero as it will hit its revenue, and growth of UPI, which has clocked over 1 billion transactions per month since October 2019.

This comes at a time when e-payments firms are reeling under pressure due to zero MDR and are looking at the government for a breather. But it might only come “after a few weeks or months”, sources involved in discussions with the government on the matter added. The move will impact the fast-paced growth of digital payments infrastructure in India and the ease of use in promoting digital payments as the key revenue channel of PSPs will be hit. As reported on January 10, annual revenue loss could be to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore due to zero MDR.

Banks could also look at other avenues to shore up revenues as well by passing the cost to consumers. “It is possible that the banks might try to make up for the revenue loss from zero MDR by increasing charges on cash withdrawals. The RBI only mandates that the first three transactions in six metro locations are free. In non-metros it’s first five. The charges on other transactions are left to the individual bank’s discretion,” said an IBA official. Most banks already have stopped ATM expansion and might also allocate less money towards PoS (point-of-sale) expansion. With MDR becoming zero, it was inevitable that the interchange fee also becomes zero, industry experts said after IBA’s letter last week. “This is how it works — nearly 60% of MDR goes towards the acquiring bank (the bank facilitating the transaction) and 40% of MDR towards the issuing bank (the bank issuing the debit card). And of this, the issuer bank pays 15% as the interchange fee. So paying the interchange fee becomes an additional cost or loss for the issuing bank if MDR is zero,” says Balasubramanian V, president, merchant and terminal business of payments service provider FSS. Banks will continue to pay switching fees, he added.

PONDA: Those dependent on the new 27MLD water treatment plant at Opa , which was commissioned recently, may face water scarcity for another year.

With the new plant, water drawn from the Khandepar river has increased. However, the river may not get raw water from the Ganjem water scheme over the Mhadei river if the PWD further delays permission for road cutting from Ganjem to Usgao to lay a pipeline that would pour the water from Ganjem directly into the Khandepar river.

PWD minister Deepak Pauskar said that he has already cleared the file and chief minister Pramod Sawant has also directed PWD authorities to clear it immediately. “WRD would get the permission very soon,” he said.

For the last several years, Ganjem water had been released into a rivulet flowing to Khandepar. However, some of the water was lost due to evaporation in the summer and ground seepage. The WRD had, therefore, planned to pour the water directly into the Khandepar river by underground pipeline to avoid the loss.

“Under the project, the work for laying the pipelines from Usgao to Khandepar has been going on, but the work has been delayed as PWD is yet to give permission for the road cutting,” a source from WRD said.

During summers, the water level of the Khandepar river dips and WRD pours about 35MLD water into the river besides releasing the stocked water from the bandharas along the Khandepar and Kalay rivers, and mining pits in Codli . Around 48MLD water is released from the Selaulim dam as well.

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA: The state government on Tuesday reworked three schemes to benefit the extremely backward castes (EBCs), including payment of Rs10 lakh to the willing entrepreneurs from these sections to start their choice business ventures.

Cabinet secretariat department principal secretary Deepak Prasad said the cabinet approved the proposal to increase the range of annual family income from the existing Rs1.50 lakh to Rs2.50 lakh for the EBC students to make the post-matric scholarship available to them.

Under the third scheme, the hostels for EBC students would now be constructed in six more districts — Lakhisarai, Samastipur, Darbhanga, Khagaria, Siwan and Vaishali, Prasad added.

Giving the details of the scholarship and hostel related schemes, welfare department secretary Prem Singh Meena said at present 2 lakh EBC students belonging to families with Rs1.5 lakh annual family income were getting the post-matric scholarships. With the increase in the income bracket to Rs2.50 lakh, there would be 25% more beneficiaries. While the revised scheme would be implemented from the current financial year itself, the students concerned would file their applications online for processing their claims.

Meena also said under the Jannayak Karpoori Thakur Chhatravas Yojana, hostels for the EBC students have been constructed in 28 districts, of which those in 26 districts had already become functional, and two other hostels were nearing completion. The bed capacity of each hostel is 100. He said the Bihar Bridge Construction Corporation Limited has allocated Rs26.09 crore for the construction of new hostels in the six remaining districts under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund. Against that, the sanction has been given for the utilization of Rs12.75 crore under CSR fund of the bridge corporation.

On the other hand, industries department director P K Singh said Rs10 lakh will be paid to the willing entrepreneurs from the EBC sections as part of the scheme already existing for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. As much as 50% of the sum would be granted as subsidy, while the remaining 50% as loan. While the subsidy is payable in three instalments, the recovery of the loan amount would start one year after the payment of the last instalment of the subsidy amount, Singh added.

PATNA: Patna and few other parts of the state received light showers on Tuesday and weathermen have claimed that showers are likely to occur on Wednesday as well.

The daily weather bulletin issued by the Patna Meteorological Centre on Tuesday evening stated that light rainfall occurred at one or two places in the state during the last 24 hours. It further pointed out that rainfall with thunderstorm was likely to take place at few places in all the 38 districts on Wednesday and one or two places on Thursday.

Weathermen attributed the prevailing rainy spell to a western disturbance and claimed that its impact would be seen in the state till Thursday. Western disturbances are low-pressure areas or extratropical storms originating from the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and Caspian Sea, which cause snow and winter rainfall in northwestern Indian subcontinent.

“Most weather observatories in Bihar recorded either light showers or dry weather with cloud cover on Wednesday. Rainfall may continue to occur on Thursday as well. The clouds will start getting clear from Friday,” said an official at the Patna Meteorological Centre.

As far as temperature is concerned, the Met office has predicted rise in night temperature by two to four notches during the next 48 hours and decrease by two to four notches during the next two to three days.

PATNA: Several political parties, trader unions and members of civil society would join the protest march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) from Gandhi Ashram at Bhitiharwa in East Champaran on the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, said All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary Shakeel Ahmad Khan on Tuesday.

The protest march will be led by former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar and Shakeel under the banner of NPR-NRC-CAA Virodhi Sangharsh Morcha.

Addressing a presser here on Tuesday, Shakeel said the protest march would conclude at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on February 29. “Many eminent Gandhians will also join the march at Bhitiharwa. It is important that our voices should be heard against the law that will bring no good to the country,” he said and added: “The Centre passed this citizenship law to divert attention from important issues like degradation of education system, rise in unemployment and economic slowdown in the country.”

The protest has been named as ‘Save Constitution, Save citizenship Maha-rally, Our country Our Constitution, A Journey From Bapu Dham to Gandhi Maidan’.

Many prominent personalities, including social activist Jignesh Mevani, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh, ex-Congress MP Priya Dutt, Tushar Gandhi, the great-grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and actress Swara Bhaskar, will join the march on February 29.

Shakeel said the Centre spent Rs16 crore on the NRC process in Assam. “If the central government spend that much money only in one state, how much they will have to spend on NRC process across the country. The country will have progress and growth, if the same amount is utilized for development works,” he said.

The Congress leader said the citizenship law would not only oppress the Muslims, underprivileged and Scheduled Castes, but also tarnish the country’s secular character and composite culture. “It is a fight of all the democratic Indians to save the Constitution,” Shakeel said.

Nagpur: From taranas, bandishes and aalaps to sargam, young vocalist Gandhar Deshpande was at his best as he weaved the magic of Gwalior, Jaipur and Agra gharana gayaki with ease on Tuesday.

The audience soaked in Gandhar’s singing on the open lawns of Kaptanwada, Zenda Chowk, Mahal.

Groomed by vocalist parents Ram and Archana Deshpande since the age of five, Gandhar began the performance by invoking Lord Ganesh. He then presented two bandishes in raag Yaman, ‘Jiya manat nahi’, a blend of high and low-pitched aalaps that effectively described the melancholic mood.

The young artiste then sang a bandish ‘Nanadi ke bachanwa seh na jaye’, in the same raga, which was followed by a sargam. He later presented ‘tant aanga’, a matra after samay which only sitarists practise on the musical instrument. But the vocalist impressed with his vocals and won accolades.

He presented a tarana ‘Der na der na tanana’, composed by his father. He enlivened the atmosphere with the presentation of ‘mishra raag’, a blend of two ragas, ‘Rageshri and Bahar’ whose essence he got from his father as it was his topic for PhD. He sang a mellifluous bandish, ‘Ae bahar aayi’ and ‘Sagan ghan’.

Gandhar gave a devotional touch to the programme with ‘Abir gulal udhalit ranga’ and ‘He surano chandra vha’, originally sung by legendary Jitendra Abhisheki.

He concluded the recital with a nirguni bhajan in raag Kalingan, taken from raag Bhairav. It was pleasant to hear ‘Shunya gadh sheher sheher ghar basti kon sota kon jaage’.

He was accompanied by Sandesh Popatkar on tabla, Shyam Oza on harmonium, and Sharvari Naik and Rudra Dubey on tanpura.

In 2017, Gandhar had collaborated with Justin Tracy, an American western musician, for ‘Mumbai Night’ album which was selected as an entry to the prestigious Grammy awards.

“I chose the ragas and taranas composed by my father. Nagpur will always be close to my heart and I will perform here when the chance comes,” he said.

77,['29/01/2020'],Central Bank posts Rs 155cr profit in Q3,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Mumbai: Central Bank of India has reported a net profit of Rs 155 crore for the quarter ended December 2019 compared to a net loss of Rs 718 crore in theyear-ago period.

This is the third successive quarterly profit reported by the public sector bank. The lender’s MD and CEO Pallav Mohapatra said he was hopeful the institution would get out of the lending restrictions placed by the RBI by March 2020. One of the requirements for exiting RBI’s prompt corrective action ( PCA ) framework, which bars the lender from disbursing unsecured loans, is that it should reduce its ratio of bad loans.

In October-December 2019, the bank’s deposits increased to Rs 3.08 lakh crore and its CASA ratio improved to 45.49%. The lender is targeting to raise Rs 200 crore by selling real estate properties in the ongoing quarter. It is also looking to garner another Rs 60 crore from sale of its entire 20% stake in Indo-Zambia Bank.

The bank’s net interest margin (NIM) improved to 2.92% from 2.74 %. Trading profits on investments rose to Rs 284 crore from Rs 139 crore. According to Mohapatra, this was possible because of the bank’s decision to move funds from the money market to bonds.

Mohapatra said the bank was following a two-fold strategy to improve ratio of bad loans — the first was to improve recoveries from non-performing assets (NPAs) and the second was to increase the loan portfolio. As part of its strategy to grow credit portfolio, the bank was actively purchasing loans from non-banking finance companies (NBFCs).

MARGAO: With the district planning committee (DPC) holding its meeting after five years and at the fag-end of the tenure of the 14th Finance Commission, several MLAs who attended the meeting called into question the efficacy of the meeting.

Chief executive officer of the South Goa zilla panchayat, Agnelo Fernandes, said that 47 out of 88 panchayats have submitted their annual development plans to the DPC which have to be complied and submitted to the planning commission. He said he would now request the Goa Institute of Public Administration and Rural Development to provide assistance in constituting the district-level plan.

Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai, speaking to reporters after the meeting, called it a “political farce” and “a ritual needed to be completed”.

“The DPC has to be held at the beginning of the five-year period. The DPC is an eyewash as the government has failed to devolve any powers to the zilla panchayat bodies,” Sardesai said.

The former deputy chief minister said that the failure of the zilla panchayat in getting the government devolved funds and power to the district level panchayat bodies “fortified” his stand that the elections to zilla panchayats shouldn’t be held on party lines.

“The adhayksha of the zilla panchayat is from the ruling party. So if he were not to be a stooge or a member of the ruling party, he would have fought to see that powers are devolved, and that annual plans are submitted by the panchayats to the DPC, and ensured that there is no murder of the 73rd amendment to the Constitution in Goa. Because he is a member of the ruling party, he becomes a silent spectator to the murder of democracy,” he said.

Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Laurenco and Sanguem MLA Prasad Gaonkar also expressed their reservations over the outcome of the meeting. Curchorem MLA and power minister Nilesh Cabral advocated the need for preparing constituency-level development plans by taking into confidence panchayats concerned and municipal bodies.

Indore: Lucknow, Pune, Kishangarh (Ajmer) and Jodhpur are among the list of new destinations that have been proposed by airlines for flight operations to and from Devi Ahilyabai Holkar Airport.

Daily flights at Indore airport is expected to increase to 108 and more as seven airlines have reserved slots under upcoming summer schedule.

Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has released the proposed summer schedule for the year 2020.

The airlines have also reserved slots for additional flights on Delhi, and Mumbai routes under this proposed schedule, which will be effective from March 29 to October 24, 2020, said official sources.

The number of flights to Delhi is expected to increase up to 17 as compared to existing 13 departures a day. Indore-Mumbai route is also expected to have 8 flights every day as compared to six in current schedule. For Ahmedabad, daily flights are likely to be reduced by one. Currently, there are five flights operating on this route and it is likely to go down to four.

Indore airport currently sees daily flight movement of 84 scheduled flights with connectivity to around 12 domestic and one international routes.

Airport director Aryama Sanyal said that it is a proposed schedule for airlines, and it can be changed, if needed, before a final schedule is approved and released by DGCA.

“The daily scheduled flight movement at Indore will go up to 108 if the same is approved by DGCA. Also it will depend on the airlines to start operations on allotted slots,” the director told TOI.

She also said that ‘Fly Big’ – a private firm that earlier dealt in aircraft simulation is also expected to start flight operations on two routes including Indore-Bhopal and Indore-Jabalpur. “If all goes well, the airline would start operations from next month,” she added while talking to TOI.

Bareilly: In a surprise move that left Bareilly police astonished, two of its sub-inspectors put in their papers citing “excessive work pressure which makes even availing weekly offs quite difficult”.

In their letters to deputy inspector general (Bareilly range) Rajesh Pandey, the officers, Jaipal Singh and Naresh Bhatnagar, stated that they “want to take care of their wives who are leading a lonely life” since their children are settled outstation.

After failing to persuade them, the DIG, who has given them 15 days to revisit their decision, has accepted their resignations. The officers are in their late fifties and have more than a year of service left.

On Tuesday, the SIs, along with their wives, visited the DIG office and submitted their resignation letters. In the letter, said police sources, the officers stated that “due to excessive work pressure in a 24x7 job, availing even weekly off is quite difficult, and thus, they have no other option than quitting their services to take care of their spouses, who feel lonely” since their children are settled outstation and the cops remain busy performing their duty.

A native of Salamatpur village under Didauli police station limits in Amroha district, Singh joined police services as a constable in 1980. The father of three sons, Singh lives with his wife here as their three sons — the eldest one is a surgeon; the second son, an engineer, is working for a reputed multinational software firm; and, the youngest one is a senior railway officer — are settled with their families in different cities.

Similarly, Bhatnagar, a native of Gadhiya Rangin village in Shahjahanpur district, has two children. His daughter teaches at an engineering college in Ghaziabad and the son is pursuing engineering.

Explaining how helpless he felt when his wife fell ill and needed to be hospitalised last year, Bhatnagar told TOI, “At that time I need leave, but we cannot avail sick leave for the ailing wife. Now, she needs proper care and that is the reason why I decided to quit my service.”

Singh, on the other hand, feels it’s time for him to live a comfortable life with his wife, who feels lonely. “I have no liabilities. My sons are well settled. They are living with their wives in different cities. My wife lives alone all day at home. In the police service, I cannot spare much time for my wife. Thus, I decided to take retirement early.”

DIG Pandey, however, said, “I have given them 15 days to reconsider their decision after having discussions with their families. But, as they are adamant on their decision, I have accepted their resignations for now.”

IIT Hyderabad

HYDERABAD: Researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad have developed an essential-oil-based drug carrier system to treat fungal infections without running the risk of inducing drug resistance.

The research paper published in the international peer-reviewed journal Materialia, highlighted that the medication can counter fungi that have developed resistance to conventional anti-fungal drugs.

“Given the prevalence of fungal infections such as vaginal infections, diaper rash, athlete’s foot, and nail fungus caused by the Candida family of fungi, drug resistance can be life-threatening,” said Mudrika Khandelwal, who led the research.

She also added that the IIT Hyderabad team turned to natural products to solve this problem.

“Herbal essential oils and their ingredients have excellent antimicrobial action against all types of Candida fungi,” said Shivakalyani Adepu, one of the researchers. “The problem with essential oils and their components is that they are sensitive to temperature, light, and pH, and decompose easily.”

The research team said that a way to overcome this problem is to design a suitable carrier system that can protect the oils and active principles from these factors, and yet, release them in a controlled manner so that anti-fungal action can be fully harnessed.

The new controlled-release design achieved 99.9% fungi-static action within 12 hours, with only half the concentration of ingredients, thus enabling small dosages for treatment.

Nagpur: Geographical details of the world are known to people, but cultural and historical aspects need to be highlighted in books centred on travel, said writer and critic VS Jog at Press Club, Civil Lines, on Tuesday.

He was speaking at the launch of ‘Deshatanachi Shatpavli’, written by Dr Narayan Deshmukh, who retired as a colonel from American Army Reserve.

Senior journalist Shailesh Pande chaired the programme. Publisher of the book Chandrakant Lakhe and Deshmukh’s wife Rohini were present.

Jog said, “Deshmukh has effectively portrayed the aesthetic significance of each country he visited in the book. Information and the language of the book is such that it helps you visualize the place without visiting it.”

“The words used by Deshmukh create a pictorial embellishment of the journey. Starting with the correct definition of countries’ peculiar names to the historical background of those places, the book has a lot to offer,” he said.

Pande said, “This is a book that caters to the needs of people in venturing into the field of travel. Having stayed abroad for over 50 years, Deshmukh has served Marathi language by penning this book. It is a delight to read his writing. His efforts underline the value of going beyond the horizons.”

Senior journalist Vinod Deshmukh said, “The writer has beautifully expressed his travelling episodes in Marathi. He is pride of Maharashtra. I am sure he will complete the goal of visiting 100 countries and write his third book.”

Writer Deshmukh said, “Most of the itinerary details not available on the internet can only be acquired by travelling. This book is a medium to bring hidden facts about the countries before readers.”

Having served as a doctor nearly for 50 years, Deshmukh is a globe-trotter. In his second book, he has chronicled his experience of visiting 93 countries in Asia, America, Africa and Europe. He has set for himself the goal of visiting 100 countries.

Lakhe proposed a vote of thanks.

Image used for representational purpose only

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the completion of major works, including the Chackai flyover, in the Kazhakoottam-Mukkola stretch, National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is now set to start the work on construction of a toll plaza in one or two months. The agency is planning to start toll collection in the stretch in four months.

Though NHAI has initially proposed toll plaza at Akkulam , it has been shifted on the request by state government. A staggered toll plaza will come up at a location between Thiruvallam and Vellar.

The state government had opposed the plan to set up the toll plaza at Akkulam as a number of daily commuters in city will have to pay toll. As the toll plaza was shifted to Thiruvallam side, only users of national highway will have to pay the toll. As per rules, a toll plaza should be constructed beyond a distance of 10km from municipal or local town area limits.

Sources said the toll plaza’s construction will begin after NHAI approves the toll rates for various vehicles. The toll rates will be finalised in accordance with the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules 2008. The NHAI will provide monthly toll pass for daily commuters.

To reduce land acquisition, a staggered toll plaza has been proposed at the site. In ‘staggered’ type, the toll plaza for each side will be in two different locations and will have five lanes for various vehicles.

Overhead rooms will be constructed for administrative purposes. In a feasibility study conducted by National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (Natpac) in 2016, the site between Thiruvallam and Vellar was cited as an ideal location for construction of toll plaza. However, the study had also pointed out that there was a possibility of motorists using the Thiruvallam-Pachalloor-Vazhamuttam route to skip toll payment.

As the Kazhakoottam-Karode project has been implemented in an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode, the NHAI, instead of the contractor, will collect the toll.

Under EPC, the contractor will be paid the construction cost as a lumpsum grant. The NHAI will engage a separate contractor for fee collection. With NHAI shifting to FASTag, more motorists in city will have to switch to the RFID-mode payment.

Choice Marina, an aprtment complex at Thoppumpady

KOCHI: The corporation council held on Tuesday has decided to take action against Choice Marina, an apartment at Thoppumpady , which according to the local body authorities was constructed violating Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. The council decided to act against the building after the local body’s assistant executive engineer submitted a report pinpointing the violations.

As per the report, the structure doesn’t have a building permit, an occupancy certificate and the approvals from agencies like the fire and rescue services. The building permit and occupancy certificate were not renewed since 2017, the report states. The building also figures in the list of structures constructed in violation of CRZ, which the local body submitted to the coastal district committee last month.

A meeting of the council held a few days ago had asked the corporation’s assistant executive engineer to submit a report on the violations by the builder. When the assistant executive engineer presented the report before the council, the mayor asked him whether any court has stayed action against the structure. The engineer informed her that no such stay order prevails.

“So, action should be taken against the unauthorised structure. The superintending engineer should submit a report on what action can be taken against the builder. The town planning department and corporation council should look at the report and then we can finalize what action can be taken against the structure,” mayor Soumini Jain said.

Councillor Benedict Fernandez, who brought the issue of the reported violations by the builder to the notice of the council several times, said the structure should be razed down like the buildings in Maradu.

Councillor T K Asharaf also aired similar views. Fernandez said the corporation should file a caveat in the court as chances are high for the builder to move the court against the local body’s decision.

According to the report submitted by the assistant executive engineer, the building doesn’t have a valid nod from the fire and rescue department since 2018. The approval from Kerala State Pollution Control Board expired on December 31, 2018. The construction was carried out without following the ‘set back’ norms prescribed in Kerala Municipal Building Rules (KMBR). There isn’t adequate ‘set back’ in the rear side of the structure, the report states. The builder had provision to file application for regularization subject to the government order along with required papers and nods. But he didn’t apply for it, the report states.

When TOI contacted the builder, he denied violating CRZ norms and said there were only a few procedural errors in securing prior NOC from the corporation. “It (allegations that the building lacks CRZ clearance) is misleading. There are no CRZ violations. Prior NOC was required. That’s all. A case is pending before the court in this regard. We are expecting a verdict from the court soon. Then, we will get occupancy certificate as well,” said Jose Thomas, managing director, of Choice group.

However, corporation officials maintain that the builder has not secured a stay order and so action can be taken against the structure.

Image taken from KRTL

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC), which was engaged by Kerala Rapid Transit Corporation Limit (KRTL) to study the feasibility of including Technopark into the alignment of proposed light metro , is conducting a survey among Technopark professionals with the support of Group of Technology Companies (GTech).

The ‘stated preference’ survey, which includes a set of questionnaires, have been circulated among various companies a few weeks ago.

The questions probe the existing mode of transport of techies, the number of vehicles they own, cost incurred for travel per month, etc. The survey checks whether the techies are ready to switch to light metro and reasons for their answer.

To check the response of techies to feeder services to connect the metro to the IT park, the survey has included the expectation of commuters to feeder service, amount they are willing to pay and maximum time they are ready to wait for a feeder service.

“So far, only 5,000 employees have responded. As we know, Technopark has over 50,000 employees. It will be a good sample size if we could collect at least 25,000 responses. We are planning to push the survey through HR managers of various companies. The survey has to be submitted by February first week,” said Vishnu V Nair, CEO of GTech.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan , who is also the chairman of KRTL board, had suggested inclusion of Technopark last year based on a memorandum submitted by GTech. GTech had pointed out that it would be unfair to exclude the large number of IT professionals from using light metro.

As per the initial detailed project report submitted by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation(DMRC), the alignment of light metro is from Pallippuram to Karamana, covering a total distance of 21.8km. Under the proposal, a station would be provided at Kazhakoottam, Kazhakoottam Junction and Kariavattom for Technopark employees.

The DMRC had also conducted a feasibility study to include Technopark for its DPR in 2014. The DPR has suggested an additional station with a proper approach road as a better and cheaper option after finding that providing an arm to Technopark would cost additional Rs 120 crore. It suggested proper feeder options from the light metro to Technopark.

However, GTech and other organisations in Technopark said the project would not be feasible with the exclusion of IT community.

MUMBAI: Thirty years is a short span in a growing metropolis, so just as the commercial hub of Bandra-Kurla Complex was becoming a hotspot, MMRDA decided it to make it more lucrative, planning a cosmopolitan transformation with taller buildings linked to one another and more green space.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority is set to prepare a master plan for integrated development of 28 commercial and 10 residential buildings in BKC’s E Block. And in a ripple effect, it will help upgrade of various infrastructure in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, by earning a revenue of Rs 18,000 crore for MMRDA, the development planning authority. Infrastructure projects worth over Rs1 lakh crore—including several Metro networks and the Trans Harbour Link— are underway in MMR.Explaining the transformation plan for BKC’s E Block, which houses offices of several government agencies, metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said, “Most of these buildings are 30 years old and some of them have approached MMRDA to seek approval for redevelopment. We will work on a plan to have revised Urban Design Master Plan and architectural controls for BKC.”The plans will include seminal designs for buildings with features such as recreation gardens at podium level, sky garden, upgraded RG (recreational ground) plot, pedestrian plaza and an iconic pedestrian bridge across the Mithi river. “We want to have a master plan with Hong Kong type concept where people can move from one building to the another without setting a foot on the ground. The architecture will be integrated with Metro station and will have ample green space and buildings will have natural lights,” said Rajeev.The total built-up area consumed is 15.9 hectares and the balance built-up area available is 10.45 hectares as per the existing FSI policy. MMRDA officials feel more built up area can be made available if the global Floor Space Index concept is applied.At present, permissible built up area in BKC is computed only on commercial and residential plots after deducting areas under roads and open spaces. However, under the global FSI concept, FSI is calculated on the basis of the gross plot area, including road and open spaces. And when the global FSI concept is applied, MMRDA expects to gain 41.7 hectares of built up area in E-block and 278.73 area in G Block. This is expected to help MMRDA earn around Rs 18,000 crore as a built up area rate of Rs 3.44 lakh per metre.In a big boost for the plan, consumption of FSI will not be an issue. Till now, BKC structures could be 40 metres tall (10 storeys) because of the proximity to the airport, but thanks to the revised height restrictions by the civil aviation ministry, the buildings can rise go up to 25 storeys (80 metres).The plan will bring benefit across MMR. “The revenue earned will be put to use to improvement of infrastructure in BKC and MMR,” the metropolitan commissioner said.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73719784,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-740225,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/govt-block-in-bkc-to-be-recast-as-25-storey-towers/articleshow/73710156.cms

<p>A view of Golden Kayaloram apartment being demolished using controlled implosion. (PTI photo)<br></p>

KOCHI: When Valsa B (name changed) came across an advertisement of an apartment along the banks of Chilavannoor Lake, she could not resist the temptation to check out the property. However, she says, “My family urged a rethink. The pulling down of the apartment complexes in Maradu is still fresh in our memories.”

But what is definitely a cause of concern is that though months have passed since the Supreme Court ordered the demolition of the flats over violation of environmental norms, Valsa had a tough time checking the veracity of building permits and various mandatory approvals.

She said she searched the internet for information on properties that have violated coastal regulation zone (CRZ) norms and other building rules. “It is difficult to verify the credibility of information available on various websites,” she said.

The state government has submitted an affidavit before the Supreme Court regarding the buildings that have violated CRZ norms. But details of the list remain beyond the reach of ordinary man.

“Where can a homebuyer find information about the legal status of an independent house or an apartment complex? A random check on the internet provides a lot of information. There are reports from reputed media houses as well. However, people do not know which department provides authentic information,” said Abilash KV, an NRI based in Dubai.

Sources at Maradu municipality said as the civic body’s online systems have not become completely operational, the details of the buildings that have violated CRZ norms will not be available online.

“Those who plan to buy properties within the limits of Maradu municipality will have to come to the municipality office and obtain the necessary information. There is no other way we can help them,” said Maradu municipal secretary Mohammed Arif Khan.

He also said public will have to directly contact respective local bodies to gather information details of buildings that have violated norms and rules.

Meanwhile, it was being reported that the information about buildings that have violated CRZ norms and building rules were available on the website of district administration. However, when a query was raised with district collector S Suhas, he said the regional town planner would be able to give more information on it.

Umarani Chiluka and students use smartphones and VR tools at LalagudaPrimary school

SECUNDERABAD: While several schools in the country are wary of cell phones being used by students, Umarani Chiluka , a teacher at Lalaguda Government Primary School is repairing and reusing old smartphones to aid the teaching process.

Chiluka is one of the two teachers teaching 53 students of class 1 to 5 in a single classroom at Lalaguda Government Primary School. Being a resource person with additional responsibilities of teacher training and curriculum framing, Chiluka could not dedicate enough hours to teaching.

With barely one computer in the school and lack of power supply due to state government’s delay in paying electricity bills, the teacher took it on herself to use smartphones to teach students. It was in 2016 that the teacher started this unique initiative where she leveraged modern technology as a teaching method.

“One day I was watching a video,a student in my class, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder was attracted to the smartphone and took interest in the video. That’s when I realised that if he could be attracted to learning through smartphone, the same may be the case with other students of my school,” said Chiluka.

Since she could only accommodate only three to four students on her own phone, she decided to procure more smartphones. “I put up a status seeking old smartphones which were unused with minor issues. Soon, I could procure six units from my acquaintances which I repaired and started using them in the classroom,” said Chiluka.

She installed e-learning apps such as kids spelling learning, maths kids counting, speech to text, ABC kids – tracing and phonics to teach various concepts to students. “I use interactive e-learning apps which are freely available on the play-stores. These apps help students learn in a fun way,” said Chiluka, who recently bagged the National Information and Computer Technology award for Teachers for her effective and innovative integration of ICT in promoting students learning.

At a time when the Telangana government is promoting ICT learning in government schools, Chiluka has raised concerns over lack of basic amenities in schools. “We teach 53 students in a single classroom. Lack of space, poor amenities is a major concern for us. Although I have been able to promote ICT learning through my own methods, much more assistance is required to improve quality of education in government schools,” said Chiluka.

Union home minister Amit Shah (File photo)

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday reminded states to submit their suggestions for “comprehensive amendments” to Criminal Procedure Code and Indian Penal Code to make them in tune with the aspirations of a modern democracy and provide for speedy justice.

The reminder, which came at the meeting of the Central Zonal Council in Nava Raipur in Chhattisgarh, follows nearly two months after Shah informed Rajya Sabha that he had written to all CMs seeking their views and suggestions on amendments required in CrPC and IPC to make them more conducive to the current democratic set-up. The meeting was attended by the CMs of Chhattisgarh, UP, MP and Uttarakhand .

Shah has several times in the past spoken of the need to amend the archaic IPC and CrPC to bring them in line with the requirements of modern times. There is a thinking within the government that certain provisions of CrPC and IPC need a relook, including the judicial appeal process for crimes like rape and narcotics sale.

Only recently, the home ministry moved an application in the apex court for modification of its January 2014 guidelines to make such laws “victim-centric” rather than “convict-centric”. It had argued that a time-limit be fixed for convicts to file a curative petition.

At Tuesday’s meeting, Shah exhorted the member-states to expeditiously resolve issues relating to forest clearance and provide brick-&-mortar banking facility within 5 km radius in each village — particularly in Maoist-infested areas. He called upon states to adhere to the timeline of 2 months for completion of probe of offences under Pocso Act. Shah also called for prompt payment to farmers and assured states in the region that their issues relating to procurement of grains and their disposal would be resolved quickly.

98,['29/01/2020'],Not much scope to hike budget of water resources department,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Nagpur: The state’s budget for the water resources department (WRD) that has been in the midst of controversies since nearly a decade is not likely to go up in the coming budget too.

At the most it may be increased by Rs1000 odd crore as against the average allocation of Rs8500 crore over the last 10 years, said sources accompanying deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar . The deputy chief minister had come down to Nagpur for a district annual budget planning meet.

This is because a number of projects do not have the capacity to absorb the funds, said a source. Poor allocation to WRD has been blamed as one of the major reasons for the slow development of irrigation projects. A number of irrigation projects are under the ACB scanner. The agency had given Pawar a clean chit.

The official admitted that low allocations may lead to a vicious circle of delay followed by revision of estimates.

Though Pawar, while addressing newspersons earlier, said that the government will ensure that the funds are hiked for the sector.

Major allocation for farm loan waiver

A major allocation for the state budget will be towards the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule farm loan waiver scheme , said Pawar. The scheme at present covers farmers having loans up to Rs2 lakh.

The deputy chief minister said a committee is examining the possibility of extending the waiver scheme to farmers having loans above Rs2 lakh too. The issue of granting incentives to farmers who have made prompt repayments is also being examined by the committee, he said.

The panel will be submitting its report before the state cabinet which will take a decision on the matter, said Pawar.

He said the waiver amount will be directly credited into the farmers’ loan account and the district collectors have been involved in the implementation process.

Pawar said a meeting with Madhya Pradesh’s chief minister Kamal Nath for discussing the plan to build a tunnel to bring Pench river’s water from the state to Nagpur will be held in Mumbai soon. The tunnel is expected to do away with the likely water shortage the city may face, he said.

Representative image

TRICHY: A 31-year-old man was arrested for sharing child porn pictures on Facebook near Somarasampettai in Trichy on Sunday. It was the second arrest made after a man was arrested on the same charges in Trichy city last month.

All-women police station (AWPS), Jeeyapuram, arrested Saravanan, 31, of Vasan Valley near Somarasampettai under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and Information Technology (IT) Act on charges of sharing child porn pictures on social media and transmitting sexually explicit acts.

It was a secret operation carried out by Trichy rural police following an input from National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) about Saravanan who has been spreading child pornographic contents on Facebook through his account.

Police have been collecting information about him for the past few days before arresting him. Police registered a case against Saravanan that he shared the content on March 10, 2019. Police sources said that he had been sharing the content for the past one year. He is unmarried.

A senior police officer in the district said that police is monitoring the Facebook contacts of Saravanan. “Since it is a multi-district and multi-state operation, the respective police force will be collecting his contact details, as many of his contacts are from other areas. Police arrested him in Trichy since his name was cropped up in the list,” said an officer on Wednesday.

On December 10, 2019, AWPS, Cantonment in Trichy city, arrested Christopher Alphonse, 42, of Kajapettai near Palakkarai in the city for creating Facebook accounts and sharing child porn contents to his contacts. His two accounts were blocked by Facebook, but he created a new account and continued the offence.

MUMBAI: Nothing is certain, but death and taxes, this is an often-used quote. However, after death, the legal heir continues to be responsible for the tax dues of the deceased. Fortunately, the Mumbai bench of Income-tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), after taking cognisance of the facts of the case, quashed penalty proceedings for concealment of income in the hands of the legal heir.

The late Ramila Mehta did not file her income-tax (I-T) return for the financial year 2012-13 as she had expired in May of this particular year. Her tax case was opened owing to this non-filing and the I-T officer issued a notice.

On receipt of this notice, the legal heir—her nephew—duly filed the I-T return, disclosing interest from fixed deposits of Rs 16.85 lakh.

During the course of assessment of this I-T return, the tax officer imposed a penalty of Rs 3.14 lakh for concealment of income. This penalty was upheld by the appellate commissioner, resulting in the legal heir filing an appeal with the ITAT.

The legal heir submitted that he had migrated to the US, owing to which he had been unable to attend to filing of the I-T return. He also submitted that post receipt of the notice, the I-T return of the deceased taxpayer was duly filed, and the income disclosed had been accepted by the I-T officer. Thus, no penalty under section 271(1) ( c) could be imposed for concealment of income.

The ITAT also observed that the deceased taxpayer was a senior citizen, who had during her lifetime regularly filed her tax returns and disclosed interest income from fixed deposits held by her.

Based on the facts of the case and also judicial precedents set by various high courts, the ITAT held that no penalty for concealment of income could be imposed on the legal heir.

Jaipur: It was harrowing time for commuters for an hour at Tonk Road and M I Road due to Rahul Gandhi’s rally on Tuesday.

Most of the vehicles were diverted to different routes and Tonk Road and MI Road witnessed jam at around 3.30 pm for about an hour though it was cleared later on. Traffic was moving too slow that time and people were seen cribbing about the crowd of vehicles on the street.

Rush of vehicles could be seen at the Gopalpura Bypass Road at 4 pm when people were going back attending the rally. Buses were parked at a ground on Vidhan Sabha road from where people travelled to the venue.

DCP Traffic Rahul Prakash denied any traffic jam in the city and said that the traffic was smooth all over the city. “There was diversion to different places so the traffic weight will naturally increase but there was no such complaint about the heavy traffic jam,” said Rahul. None of the buses were allowed to enter from the normal routes of Narayan Singh Circle to go to Sindhi Camp. They were diverted from Ajmer Road to B2 Bypass to Sindhi Camp. The low floor buses from Narayan Singh Circle were diverted from different routes.

Due to the diversion of traffic, many schools in the city declared holiday on Tuesday. Subodh Public School, SMS School and Maharani Gayatri Devi Schools were amongst many. Subodh Public School authorities said that there school is located on the VIP Marg which made it necessary for them to declare holiday as there was excessive traffic during the time of any political event.

Nagpur: The central and state governments have released funds of Rs48.10 crore for the Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) three projects — bio-CNG, compost and material recovery facility (MRF) — proposed for garbage treatment and reuse. Funds have been approved under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

The state urban development department on Tuesday issued a notification about releasing the funds. “Nagpur’s Solid Waste Management Plan was approved under the Swachh Bharat Mission. The Centre had released funds of Rs28.86 crore as its share to the state. The state’s share is Rs19.24 crore. Thus, a total amount of Rs48.10 crore has been released,” the notification stated.

The NMC had sought Rs267 crore under the Swachh Bharat Mission in 2016-17. The government had approved Rs96.22 crore of which Rs70 crore for waste-to-energy project and remaining funds of Rs26.22 crore for procurement of road sweeping machine and other machineries for improving garbage collection and transportation.

The government had released Rs48.11 crore two years ago.

The NMC had planned to drop waste-to-energy project due to failure of private operators to execute the project. The civic body has proposed to treat and reuse entire garbage by developing bio-CNG, compost and MRF centre at Bhandewadi dumping yard. Accordingly, the NMC requested the government to approve these three projects and also increase financial grant from Rs96.22 crore to Rs155 crore.

The state’s high-powered committee had approved the NMC’s proposal in September 2018. Now, the grant of Rs48.10 crore has been released.

A few days ago, the NMC’s general body approved development of three new projects. Now, the NMC can begin tendering process and execute the projects. The NMC’s plan is to dispose of total garbage generated from the city in a scientific manner.

103,['29/01/2020'],Chennai: 121 more CCTV cameras to survey stretch from Porur to Kathipara,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Commissioner of police A K Viswanathan inaugurates CCTV cameras at Nandambakkam on Tuesday

CHENNAI: The stretch from Porur to Kathipara along Mount-Poonamallee High Road, home to educational institutions, hospitals and IT parks, is among the stretches with high vehicle density. Realising that this stretch is prone to traffic violations and vulnerable to incidents of crime, police on Tuesday installed 121 CCTV cameras and 8 Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras on the route.

The cameras, installed every 50m on junctions such as Kathipara flyover, Butt Road, Nandambakkam, Ramapuram, Mugalivakkam and Porur, have been installed at a cost of Rs 30lakh. A team of police personnel surveyed the areas and installed the ANPR cameras at places where motorists tend to cross at high speeds at odd hours. The Ramapuram traffic signal on Mount-Poonamalle High Road is officially the most congested junction in Chennai with, on average, more than 1.75 lakh vehicles crossing it every day. The stretch below the Porur flyover, with 1.27 lakh vehicles crossing every day, is a close second.

The stretch between Porur and Kathipara so far had less than 100 cameras, making it difficult for police to identify and nab those violating traffic rules, including jumping signal, violating stop line rules, riding triples and driving over the speed limit. Now, ANPR cameras can trace owner details of vehicles that violate rules by reading number plates and help issue e-challans for fines. These cameras will help build a database of vehicles plying on the road and book violators without police personnel out on the road. They will also help trace stolen vehicles. Photos of vehicles flouting the rules will be attached to the e-challans. The cameras will be linked to the transport department database as well to enable automatic serving of e-challans.

Inaugurating the facility at Nandambakkam, police commissioner A K Vishwanathan said CCTV cameras should be now considered a first eye while solving crime cases. Installation of camera had brought in a feeling of safety among commuters, particularly women.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While all the accused involved in the murder of Sangeeth Balan (37) of Ambalathinkala have been caught, an enquiry will be held on the alleged delay from the part of the local police to reach the crime scene.

Following the allegations, the superintendent of police (rural district) B Ashok ordered the Nedumangad deputy superintendent of police Stuart Keeler to look into the matter.

The SP said that since there was no formal complaint in this regard, no official enquiry has been ordered. The Nedumangad police sub-division authorities would look into the matter, he said.

The SP took this step after special branch officials reported that the residents of Kattakkode, where the murder took place, highlighted the delay from the part of the officials at the local police station to reach the spot that gave ample time for the accused to flee from the scene.

On Tuesday, DSP Stuart Keeler spoke to the officials of Kattakkada police station and apprised their version of the events to the Rural SP.

Meanwhile, the eighth person involved in the alleged crime was arrested by Kattakkada police on Tuesday. The accused, identified as Baiju (36) of Kattakode near Kattakada was part of the gang which confronted Sangeeth in front of his residential plot, which eventually resulted in his murder on Friday night. Baiju was produced before the court and subsequently remanded in judicial custody. Vijin who operated the JCB which landed the death blow to Sangeeth was arrested on Saturday. Linu (30), who operated the tipper, and vehicle owners Stanlin John alias Saju (48) and Uthaman alias Manikandan (34) were arrested on Monday.

According to Kattakkada station house officer inspector Bijukumar D, Baiju was nabbed by the police from near his residence as he came back home from his hiding spot to visit an advocate on Tuesday. “Baiju arrived at the plot as a co-driver of a tipper truck and was at the spot when the murder took place. It is also learnt that it was Baiju who moved Sangeeth’s car that was parked ahead of the gate as a blockade,” the inspector said. Bijukumar also said that a request for custody of the accused will be made for further interrogation of the gang. At present, police have arrested all the men who were in the list of identified accused.

KPCC working president and MP Kodikunnil Suresh said that the state home affairs department has failed to ensure safety of its citizens. “The murder of Sangeeth, who was killed by the land mafia with an earth mover, shows how the state has fallen to the grasp of land mafias under the Pinarayi Vijayan government. Never before has Kerala witnessed such a disruption in the law and order situation. Not even a single day passes without reports of murders, robberies and violent atrocities by goons. The state government’s way of protecting accused involved in political murders are further empowering land mafias to carry out further atrocities without fear. The government should ensure that the family of Sangeeth receives financial aid,” he said.

Kerala high court

KOCHI: Kochi corporation doesn’t have the funds or the manpower to implement widening of Thammanam-Pulleppady Road into a four-lane road, state government has informed the Kerala high court. The court has now asked the government to inform further plans.

The submission by the government was in response to a contempt of court petition (COC No. 2050/2019) filed by doctor Priyarenjini S of Kadavanthra through lawyer K P Pradeep. In June last year, the high court had ordered for completing the road widening within a year.

In December last year, the court had directed Ernakulam district collector to file an affidavit on how the land-acquisition compensation is proposed to be paid and why stamp duty remission sought by the corporation regarding requisition of land was not granted by the government. The court had also asked details on developments made on land surrendered freely.

When the contempt case came up for hearing, government’s counsel submitted that since the corporation does not have the funds or manpower to complete the project as directed by the court, it has been directed to pass a resolution to hand over the road to PWD unconditionally.

In the meantime, PWD will undertake a detailed study and prepare a detailed project report (DPR), with the fund for the study to be provided by Kerala Road Fund Board. The extent of land to be acquired, along with the approximate cost of acquisition, is to be submitted by the district collector to PWD authorities. Action is being taken now to submit these details to the PWD authorities, the government counsel submitted while seeking further time to file the affidavit.

After considering the government counsel’s submission, justice Shaji P Chaly granted three weeks to file the affidavit. The affidavit should include details of action to be taken by the PWD, the district administration, as well as the government in order to complete the construction of the four-lane road within one year as ordered by the court earlier, the judge directed.

While ordering for widening of the road within one year in June last year, the high court had criticized the government for PWD’s stance that it will not take up the work.

CHENNAI: Madras School of Economics is ready to set up a public finance policy institute to give suggestions to the Tamil Nadu government on tax revenue. MSE chairman C Rangarajan and director K R Shanmugam called on chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Monday and sought the state government’s financial support to start the institute.

The MSE team drew the attention of the chief minister about similar institutes have been set up in Kerala, Karnataka and other states. While Tamil Nadu alone did not have one, a proposal from MSE is long pending.

“In Kerala, there is Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation which is a public finance policy institute and it is functioning under the Kerala govenrment. Similarly in Karnataka, there is a Fiscal Policy Institute in Bengaluru. We are ready to set up a similar institute in Chennai with the state government support,” Shanmugam told TOI.

The MSE needs at least Rs 2.5 crore each year for five years to set up the institute. “We suggested to the government on the need to have a public finance institute in Chennai about two years ago. The proposal has been pending with the govenrment,” said Shanmugam.

While the MSE team approached chief secretary K Shanmugam a few days to discuss about this, he asked us to meet the chief minister. “We got the appointment on Monday and our chairman presented the details to the chief minister. We have been told to wait as the government will discuss and get back,” said Shanmugam.

Earlier, MSE had set up the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi, under the aegies of its founder Raja Chelliah. “The NIPFP was set up with the proposal to suggest to governments about tax policies. At present the NIPFP is with the Centre and states have their own institutions to suggest to their governments,” said Shanmugam.

Shanmugam has presented several papers to the state govenrment in the past to help the government on bringing down the fiscal deficit.

NAVI MUMBAI: Two weeks after 724 trees were hacked on the site of the proposed golf course integrated project at Navi Mumbai’s Seawoods, environmentalists have now found a ray of hope for a change in the controversial project, thanks to a meeting with environment minister Aaditya Thackeray .Thackeray had held a meeting with top officials of Cidco, the nodal agency for Navi Mumbai, the Urban Development Department (UDD) and the environmentalists on Monday to discuss and deliberate on the golf course project which is currently in litigation between green activists and state agencies (see graphics).Environmentalists, who attended the meeting at Mantrayala, claimed Thackeray has suggested that a bird sanctuary or a mangrove park be made at the site to conserve the wetlands . Cidco has reportedly asked for a week’s time to come up with a revised plan for the golf course plan.Activist Sunil Agarwal, who was a part of this meeting along with his wife Shruti Agarwal, told TOI: “Cidco MD Lokesh Chandra and UDD principal secretary Nitin Kareer were also present at the meeting. After hearing our stand that the surrounding wetlands and mangroves must be saved at the 35.55-hectare integrated golf course project, Thackeray suggested to officials that a bird sanctuary or a mangrove park can be built here. Chandra said they will need a week to come up with a revised plan for the golf course project.”TOI tried to contact the Cidco MD and also the Cidco PRO through phone calls, text messages and emails to know their official stand on the likely changes in the golf course plan. However, there was no reply from Cidco till the time of going to press. Text messages and phone calls to Thackeray too did not elicit any response.The Agarwals, along with another local group Navi Mumbai Environment Preservation Society, have been legally fighting against state agencies for the green cause. City based activists have also questioned the need to have a second golf course in the city, when golf course is already operational at Kharghar.Agarwal said: “We will await the revised plan by Cidco. We will also urge the state government to take back the pending litigation case because the environment minister has stated that he wants to save the mangroves and wetlands here.’’However, environmentalist D Stalin of Vanashakti NGO, said: “I have serious doubts whether Cidco will really change the golf course project in order to save the green wetlands. They may slightly reduce the number of building towers planned here, but the golf course project may not be fully scrapped. But, I am also waiting like others, hoping for the best green scenario.”",navi-mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73727092,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-438093,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/navi-mumbai/greens-meet-aaditya-seek-change-in-golf-course-plan/articleshow/73710248.cms

Representative image

ATTINGAL: Kerala infrastructure investment fund board (KIIFB) has allocated Rs 5.5 crore as a first instalment towards land acquisition for the construction of a bridge across the Vakkom-Kayikkara section of TS Canal .

The proposal to have a bridge, that may boost tourism potential by linking historically important destinations such as Anchuthengu, Vakkom and Kayikkara , was a long-pending demand of the residents.

The project was proposed in July 2019 and received KIIFB approval this month. The bridge will be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs 28 crore.

According to Attingal MLA B Satyan, the bridge will solve the traffic woes of the residents of Vakkom and Kayikkara. The bridge, which connects Vakkom grama panchayat, Anchuthengu and Vettoor grama panchayat will reduce the travel time of the commuters heading towards Thiruvananthapuram direction from Anchuthengu and Vakkom.

“The bridge was conceptualized nearly ten years ago but the scheme met with various hurdles. At present, the residents of Vakkom and Kayikkara are dependent on boat service to reach other places. With the commissioning of the Vakkom Bridge, a commuter can save 3km of travel. The proposed bridge is 232.2 metres long and 11 metres wide. A footpath with 1.5 metre width will also be constructed,” said the MLA, adding that around 202 cents should be acquired for the construction of approach roads at Vakkom and Kayikkara.

“As a first installment, KIIFB had allotted Rs 5.5 crore for land acquisition works. From Vakkom village and Kayikkara Village around 92 cents and 110 cents will be acquired respectively. Compensation equalling market rate will be given to the landowners,” said the MLA, adding that the upcoming bridge will help boost the tourism industry as it will provide connectivity to historically significant spots such as Vakkom Abdul Khader Memorial in Vakkom, birth place of legendary poet Kumaranasan, Anchuthengu Fort and other places.

KOCHI: The Vimukthi cell of Ernakulam excise division joins hands with National Service Scheme units of vocational higher secondary schools (NSS-VHSS) in the district to expand its anti-narcotic campaign. As a beginning, a teenagers’ cyclothon named ‘Sheriyoram’ will be held at various parts of the district on Friday. Around 1,500 student volunteers of NSS units in 26 vocational higher secondary schools in Ernakulam will take part in 26 cyclothons.

Deputy excise commissioner (Ernakulam) A S Ranjith will carry out the district level inauguration by flagging off the cyclothon to be held by the students of GVHSS, North Edappally. All other 25 cyclothons will be held in association with the respective excise circle and range offices under Ernakulam division. At least 50 students from each VHSS will take part in the cyclothon, which will be followed by street plays, flash mobs and skits spreading the objectives of the campaign.

“The influence of narcotics among the youths, especially those aged between 15 and 23, is on the rise in Ernakulam and there is a need to expand the awareness campaign against it. The best way to spread the caution is through involving students in the campaign. Cyclothon highlights the importance of physical fitness in fighting drug abuse. Excise officers and counsellors will conduct interactions with students to help them understand the danger of drug abuse,” said Ranjith.

NSS will continue its association with Vimukthi in the next academic year,” said NSS-VHSE Ernakulam district coordinator Vipul Murali.

“Jaipur’s Albert Hall is known for Kavi Sammalen, Mahamurk Sammalen, here Rahul Gandhi has best entertained the crowd,” said Poonia. Accusing the Congress of misusing the state machinery, Poonia said that traders’ association have been complaining that they are getting threatening calls from the police asking them to send their salesman in the rally.

“Even we have received videos from the students complaining they were sent forcibly by the institutes to attend the rally. They were told that if they don’t attend the rally, they will lose marks in practical exams,” said Poonia.

Taking a dig at the music band performance at the rally, Poonia said that in the rally people were enjoying filmi music and they enjoyed it lot. BJP dissected the entire speech of the BJP and countered him on his every statement. Gandhi told that India has become a rape capital while PM Narendra Modi is silent on the rising crime graph.

Trichy: Congress leader and Trichy MP, S Thirunavukkarasar has said that he will meet chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to discuss and fulfil the long-pending projects in the district.

Speaking to reporters after participating in the first District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) meeting held here on Tuesday, Thirunavukkarasar said that several issues are to be resolved concerning various projects which are dragging on for a long time.

“To complete the railway flyover, 60 cents of land is required, which the state government has. So, I have decided to meet the chief minister to clear all the obstacles to complete the pending projects including the railway flyover, integrated bus terminus and Thuvakudi-Palpannai service road in Trichy,” he said.

He stressed on the importance of reviving the forgotten demand which was proposed by then chief minister M G Ramachandran.

“Since it was the first meeting, we did not discuss in-depth the status of the ongoing projects. Each member spoke about their demands. So, from the next meeting, we will review the ongoing developmental works which are going on across the district,” he said.

Though MLAs from the district were supposed to participate in the meeting, no one was present. He expressed hope that MLAs participate from the next meeting onwards to discuss the development of the entire district.

DISHA will be conducted once every three months to fulfil the objective of ensuring better coordination among all elected representatives of Parliament, state legislatures, civic bodies and officials from various government departments. TNN

TRICHY: A city college girl received the all-India best cadet award from Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the annual Prime Minister’s NCC rally - 2020 held in New Delhi on Tuesday.

Flight cadet R Reshma, from 3 TN Air Squadron NCC – Trichy, a B Sc Chemistry student of Bishop Heber College (BHC), Trichy represented Tamil Nadu directorate in the Republic Day camp this year.

She won the medal after defeating NCC cadets from Punjab and Gujarat who came second and third respectively. Reshma made it to the national level event after winning directorate gold medal in the inter-group camp (IGC) - state level event.

Following this, she was selected for the national-level RDC event representing Tamil Nadu directorate.

Best cadet is given for the all-round performance of NCC cadets, which include written test, group discussion, extempore, interview, rifle firing, drill, and cultural events. Speaking to TOI, Reshma said receiving the baton from the Prime Minister was the most satisfying moment after more than a year-long preparation.

She didn’t show much interest in NCC at the beginning. But successive camps honed her skills and took her to the highest level. A very silent and shy girl from her school days, Reshma says that NCC has moulded her, while giving wings to her aspirations.

Aspiring to become an Indian Air Force pilot, Reshma suggests students to take up NCC in their college no matter what career they choose in future. NCC will shape them to confidently approach towards their respective goals, she said.

The 3 TN Air Squadron NCC – Trichy has got into celebration mode after a cadet from the unit has achieved accolade in the national-level. Commanding officer Wing Commander C Gunasekaran said that Reshma is a multifaceted, multi-talented girl and what makes her unique is her humility.

In last two years, cadets of 3TN Air Squadron from institutions across eight central districts have earned 22 commendations. This is the highest by any unit in the whole country. This speaks volumes about the hard work put in by cadets and staff, he said.

NCC is giving plethora of opportunities for school and colleges students to display their talents in state, national and international levels, he added.

122,['29/01/2020'],Christy Friedgram moves Madras HC for deal with I-T department,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Madras high court

CHENNAI: Even as an anti-corruption forum has demanded a CBI probe into the alleged Rs 1,500-crore scam in public distribution system ( PDS ) involving Christy Friedgram , the company has moved the Madras high court offering to cut a deal with the income tax department to prevent further prosecution and attachments in connection with the case.

The issue pertains to raids conducted by income tax department on July 5, 2018 in various premises of the company. At the end of the searches on July 9, the department alleged that it had unearthed undisclosed income to the tune of Rs 1,350.29 crore by the firm.

Christy group of companies has Tamil Nadu government’s contract to supply eggs, daal and edible oil to the mid-day meal scheme of the state.

Six months after the raids, Christy and its founder TS Kumaraswamy moved the high court to declare the search as illegal, arbitrary and unconstitutional and to prohibit the department from using, divulging or relying upon the material, books of account, documents, electronic records, affidavits and statements seized through the ‘illegal raids’.

On Tuesday, when the seven pleas by Christy came up for hearing before a special bench of Justices V Parthiban and Anita Sumanth, counsel for the firm A L Somayaji moved a fresh application suggesting a deal with the department.

“Due to seizures and freezing of bank accounts the company is unable to operate its business effectively. Payments to suppliers have been withheld, salaries to over 200 employees were delayed, and several other financial distresses have been caused to over 3,000 employees of the petitioner and its suppliers having a direct impact on the mid-day meal scheme of the state government,” Somayaji said. “Therefore, we are volunteering to withdraw all the seven petitions challenging the raids and further proceedings besides depositing Rs 50 crore with the department (Rs 15 crore already seized during raids and Rs 35 crore from Rs 213 crore already deposited with the court as per its order) on two conditions,” the senior counsel said.

“The department must permit us to withdraw the remaining Rs 178 crore deposited with the court and desist from any further attachment of the properties/accounts of the company including initiation of fresh prosecution,” Somayaji added.

Objecting to the conditions to desist from further attachment and initiation of fresh prosecution, the department’s standing counsel AP Srinivas submitted that the estimated tax evasion by the company is about Rs 2,056 crore, adding he need time to get instructions from the department.

Recording the submission, the bench posted the pleas to February 4 for I-T department to submit its response.

124,['29/01/2020'],SDPI objects to implicating it in murder of BJP man,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Trichy: The murder of a 38-year-old dalit BJP functionary in the city by a history sheeter on Monday triggered fresh animosity between leaders of Hindu and Muslim outfits, with the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) saying its name is being “dragged into the issue unnecessarily”.

F Vijaya Raghu, mandal secretary of the BJP in Palakkarai, was hacked to death by a gang led by M Babu alias Mittai Babu, 25, a habitual offender, allegedly due to personal enmity. SDPI leaders said the BJP was wilfully targeting the SDPI to gain political mileage over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“The accused was identified and the motive ascertained as personal. Raghu’s daughter had said in an interview to a television channel that minutes before he was murdered, he had cautioned her that Mittai Babu had been roaming in the area,” SDPI Trichy district president R Hassan told TOI on Tuesday.

Mittai Babu was identified as the prime accused. Police also suspect the role of two others. Sources said Babu had been stalking the minor daughter of Raghu, for which he was reprimanded by Raghu. Babu already has a couple of cases of attempt to murder Vijaya Raghu pending against him in the Gandhi market police station in 2019. Yet, the Gandhi market police registered an FIR on Monday based on a complaint from his brother F Senthilkumar, 38, that Babu killed his elder brother at the behest of the SDPI for being pro-CAA during the protests in the Gandhi market in December 2019. Former Union minister Pon Radhakrishnan, who visited Trichy on Monday also took the same stand.

“It was an attempt by the BJP to gain political mileage by tarnishing the image of the SDPI, which has been staging protests against the CAA across the country. The Federation of Islamic Organisations has made it clear to the commissioner of police, Trichy, denying its role,” said Hassan.

Though police registered a case based on the complaint linking the CAA issues to the murder, police commissioner V Varadharaju said a thorough investigation will bring out the real motive. “The case was filed based on the reason cited in the complaint. We are closely monitoring the investigation, which will reveal everything,” he said.

Representative image

CHENNAI: A specialised cancer treatment that can cost up to Rs 6.5 lakh in private hospitals will be available free for the poor or those covered under the state health insurance scheme. For people opting for paid wards in government hospitals the treatment will cost not more than Rs 2lakh.

On Tuesday, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami inaugurated two linear accelerator machines in Omandur Government General Hospital and Government Royapettah Hospital . The state has invested nearly Rs 20 lakh for each of these machines. Linear accelerator or Linac machines use X-rays (photons) to treat cancerous tumours. Last year, the first Linac machine was inaugurated in Madurai. These machines can perform stereotactic radiosurgery in a single session or over three to five sessions for larger tumours, oncologists said. Precisely focused radiation beams will treat tumours in brain, neck, lungs, liver, spine and other parts of the body, without harming normal cells.

“We have the latest technology generation machine. Similar machines will be installed in at least eight other government hospitals,” said health minister C Vijaya Baskar. While installations of seven such machines have been completed, the state is awaiting mandatory approval from AERB, he said. The eighth centre is in Salem.

In February, a third such machine for Chennai will be opened to public at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, along with PET CT scan and a new tower block. “The premier hospital will have all five facilities under one roof. The CT/MRI machines in the hospital will be used for diagnosis, PET CT for finding different stages of cancer, CT simulators for planning and Linac for treatment,” said Tamil Nadu Medical Service Corporation managing director Dr P Umanath.

The corporation will operate all Linac machines just like how it runs MRI/CT machines. “Our aim is to make optimal utilisation and not limit the machines to duty timings of radiologists and oncologists,” he said. The machines will be periodically serviced and maintained by the corporation.

Cases of common cancer diagnosed at state-run NCD clinics increased by nearly 324% between 2017 and 2018, according to National Health Profile, 2019 data.

AGRA: After the 15th day of the indefinite strike, Agra Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials came forward to meet the Sanjay Place traders to find a solution to the issue of parking fee. However, the meeting which took place at the Dharna point in parking space failed to find a solution.

On Tuesday afternoon, assistant municipal commissioner Anupam Shukla and civic body’s parking fee in-charge RK Singh came to meet the traders on orders of municipal commissioner Arun Prakash . The traders demanded officials to cancel the parking contracts until the court delivers its final orders in the matter.

Shukla assured the traders that their demand would be communicated to the municipal commissioner. He also requested the traders to end their protest but leaders of the market association refused to end the protest till their demand is fulfilled.

In the afternoon, a delegation of senior Congress leaders came to extend their support to the traders.

Secretary of Sanjay Place Market Association Hiren Agarwal said, “AMC has flouted norms as traders of the market have already paid a fee for parking space at the time of purchasing property. In this regard, we have sought details under the RTI Act. It will reveal all the malpractices done by the AMC administration to exploit the traders and common people.”

Association’s treasurer Vinay Mittal, said, “The AMC administration is trying to exploit traders by illegally charging the parking fee. We have already paid for the parking space. To muzzle the voice of traders, a fake FIR has been registered. We will continue our fight against the parking mafia backed by mayor Naveen Jain.”

Vadodara: A controversy broke out on Tuesday when the measurement of the land allocated for a public-private partnership realty project was to be conducted by government and Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials. Inability of an official to attend the measurement led to the row.

The measurement of land for the Agora City Centre project Sanjaynagar in Sama was ordered by the district collector after a series of representations by VMC’s opposition Congress corporator Ami Ravat.

Ravat has claimed that the project had used 44,010 sq m land instead of 39,685 sq m as mentioned in the tender. She and other environment activists have also alleged that a retaining wall for the project was built in the course of Vishwamitri river.

Collector had ordered that the land should be measured in the presence of Vadodara executive magistrate (north), district inspector of land records (DILR), city survey officials and the tow planning department of VMC. However, sources said, the executive magistrate could not attend the measurement due to other pressing official engagements.

Ravat said that the executive magistrate could have sent a representative so that the procedure could have been completed. “The order was given after we submitted evidence and made several representations. We will do so again,” she said.

Muklesh (L), Lata Gupta

AGRA: A prominent Agra jeweller-- also the chairperson of local jewellers’ association-- and his wife were tortured for hours before being murdered at their home by unknown assailants, who decamped with cash and valuables worth lakhs of rupees on early Tuesday morning.

According to their relatives, Muklesh Gupta (62) was found lying with a wire tied to his leg, suggesting that the robbers tortured him to extract information on the valuables kept in the house before strangling him to death at their home in Agra’s Harsahaye Khedki colony.

The incident sent shock waves in the region. Muklesh’s was the oldest and richest jeweller family in city’s Shamshabad area. As the news spread, the entire Shamshabad market was shut down. Local leaders, including MP and MLAs along with ADG of Agra zone Ajay Anand, IG Agra range Satish Ganesh, SSP Babloo Kumar rushed to the crime spot.

The couple-- Muklesh and his wife Lata Gupta (58) -- are survived by three daughters, Priyanka Gupta, 38, Geetika Gupta, 35 and Deepika Gupta 32, and all of them are married.

The couple’s murder came to light at around 8am on Tuesday, when their septuagenarian maid, Somvati, saw them lying dead on the first floor and alerted the neighbours and distant relatives of the couple, who live in Harsahaye colony.

Speaking to TOI, Vivek Gupta, 49, the nephew of the couple who lives just two homes away from victim’s, said, “Muklesh was electrocuted and strangulated to death, as his left leg was tapped with wire and he was given electric shock by assailants, probably to extract information about the cash and jewellery. Lata’s neck was stabbed with a sharp instrument and her body was lying in a pool of blood.”

Vikas Gupta, 52, another nephew of the victim, said, “Like every day, Muklesh shut his jewellery shop at around 5:30pm and returned home. Later, at around 7pm, he went to local Dauji temple for evening prayer. By 8:45pm he returned home after visiting his friend’s mobile store. We suspect that as soon he left for temple, the assailants entered into his home and killed Lata after she refused or resisted to share the cash and jewellery information.”

“Muklesh’s foot was still in shoes when we saw his body. He never entered into the living area wearing shoes, which suggests that he was attacked and dragged inside the room by assailants as soon he entered into the house. The robbers might have tortured him entire night before decamping with several lakh worth jewellery and cash along with licensed pistol,” Gupta said.

According to a police source, “There were four CCTV cameras in the victim’s house. But the assailants took away the digital video recorder (DVR) with them. We believe someone known to the jeweller has executed the heinous crime.” Meanwhile, forensic teams have collected finger prints sample, and other evidences from the spot.

ADG Anand said, “Investigating team has received some crucial lead in the incident and soon the accused involved in the crime would be arrested.”

Autopsy of the two victims found asphyxia as reason for death.

IG Agra Ganesh said, ""Based on the victim's elder daughter Priyanka Gupta's written complaint, an FIR was lodged under IPC section 394 (robbery) and 302 (murder)."" It comes 12 days after the jewelers’ association in nearby Meerut threatened a complete shutdown over rising incidents of crime against them.

134,['29/01/2020'],"Big Temple consecration in Tamil, Sanskrit: State to HC","This story is from January 29, 2020

Madurai: The Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday informed the Madras high court that importance is given to Tamil at the consecration ceremony of the Brihadeeswara Temple (Big Temple) in Thanjavur, and it would be performed both in Tamil and Sanskrit as per agama. The court was hearing a batch of petitions relating to the conduct of the ceremony.

A petition was filed by G Thirumurugan before the high court Madurai bench seeking to conduct the ceremony in Tamil. Following this, several petitions were filed seeking to conduct the ceremony in Tamil and petitions seeking to conduct it as per agama dictum.

In the counter affidavit, the Hindu religious and charitable endowments (HR&CE) department stated that the yagasalai pujas which are to be performed from February 1 to 5 and maha abishekam which is to be performed for the deities on February 5, includes the practice of Thirumurai Parayanam (Panniru Thirumurai, Abhirami Anthathi, Thirupugal) which is done in Tamil.

The same religious and customary practices of the temple which was followed while performing the consecration ceremony in 1980 and 1997 would be followed in the forthcoming ceremony which is to be held on February 5. The petitioners who seek to perform the ceremony only in Tamil have not produced any proof to show that the ceremony was performed only in Tamil alone, the state said.

In its counter, the Thanjavur Aranmanai Devasthanam stated that Tamil Thirumurais has a prominent place in the pujas performed at the temple and regular visitors could not dispute this fact. It also stated that Tamil is also given a prominent place in the consecration ceremony. When the kodimaram was installed, the Thirumurai was sung. Several othuvars attached to attached to Madurai Alavoi Annal Arakattalai and students from Chidambaram Alavoi Annal Arakattalai have been assigned to spiritual work during the ceremony. A separate invitation was printed giving particulars about the list of othuvars. Hence, there is no substance in the hue and cry raised by the petitions. Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran adjourned the case to January 29 (Wednesday). A petition was filed seeking to grant injunction to the ceremony stating that the temple management was organising it without obtaining permission from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). After the counsel appearing for ASI informed that they had granted permission, the judges closed the petition.

Meanwhile, agriculture minister R Doraikkannu met chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami in Chennai on Tuesday and extended an invitation to him to participate in the Thanjavur Big Temple consecration ceremony.

Bhatali open cast mine

Chandrapur: Tourists visiting Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve can now also explore the deep coal mines in Chandrapur district through guided tours. Twelve tourists, all students of Bamboo Research and Training Centre, on Monday went deep inside the Bhatali open cast mine to have first-hand experience of deep coal mining.

This was made possible by ‘Mine Tourism’ launched by district administration, in collaboration with Maharashtra Tourist Development Corporation (MTDC) and Western Coalfields Limited (WCL). Guardian minister of Chandrapur, Vijay Wadettiwar launched the scheme on Republic Day.

TATR has now become an international tourism destination thanks to the good tiger sighting in the reserve. Hundreds of feet deep pits of different coal mines along the road to Tadoba often arise intrigue among tourists. Looking in to the interest tourists show in these mines, district collector Kunal Khemnar in November 2019 had asked MTDC to explore opportunities in mine tourism.

Official sources informed that interested tourists can visit Mahakali underground coal mine and Bhatali open cast coal mine on Monday and Thursday. The charges for the visit are not fixed yet but will be finalized soon.

MTDC will start online booking for Mine Tourism from February 1. Dugarpur underground mine and other mines in the area are likely to be added to the itinerary.

Mine tourism was first launched in Nagpur district in December 2016.

MANGALURU: The Mangaluru Smart City Limited (MSCL) will soon introduce a new barcode system for efficient implementation of solid waste management (SWM) in all the 60 wards of Mangaluru city.

The MSCL has already introduced the system on a pilot basis in Mannagudda ward, where all the 2,000 houses will be given barcodes. All door-to-door waste collection vehicles will have to scan the barcode at the gates of houses, so that the city corporation can track its movement on a real-time basis. The system will be introduced in all the 60 wards soon.

At a meet the press programme organised by Dakshina Kannada District Working Journalists Association, MSCL managing director Mohammed Nazeer said the process of issuing barcodes for homes has already begun. “We have already given barcodes to nearly 600 houses. The barcode scanning system for door-to-door collection has already begun on a pilot basis in one ward. We have plans to introduce the system in all the 60 wards of the city corporation,” he said.

At present, 132 vehicles used for solid waste management are being tracked through GPS. A command and control centre (CCC) is being set up at a cost of Rs 74 crore to make public administration and services more efficient. In addition to traffic management, air quality monitoring, transport management and disaster management, the centre will also monitor the movement of all vehicles used for SWM. The MSCL has plans to make all buses enabled with GPS and link the data with the CCC. The centre will also have features to monitor all public utility vehicles like ambulances and other vehicles, he said.

The MSCL has plans to erect 15 smart poles at major junctions in the city. Smart poles will have solar panels, street lights, traffic signals, public address system for administration, LED display for major announcements, cameras, wi-fi access points and a weather sensor system in it. Citizens may also use the smart poles to communicate with the authorities through an SOS button attached to it, he said.

GANDHINAGAR: Attempting to allay fear and panic among people over the coronavirus scare, the state government on Tuesday said that there is no need for people to fear, but advised citizens to stay informed and alert about the virus.Based on the data shared by the government of India, eight persons who travelled from China to India recently – four from Ahmedabad, two from Vadodara and one each from Anand and Junagadh – have been screened. They will be kept under observation for the next 28 days although none have shown any symptoms of coronavirus.Jayanti Ravi, principal secretary, health & family welfare, while addressing media persons said, “Not a single case of coronavirus has been registered in Gujarat or any part of India, so there is no need to panic. The state government is taking all necessary preventive actions and citizens need to stay alert and take precautions.” She said civil hospital Ahmedabad has been nominated as the base hospital and the CM, deputy CM and the chief secretary have reviewed the situation.Ravi said that all the persons who arrived from China are healthy and show no symptoms of coronavirus. “All have been screened and their health will be tracked for the next 28 days as a precautionary measure.

138,['29/01/2020'],Kolkata: Cops give finishing touches to Tallah Bridge diversion plans,"Around 40-50 cars ply on Tallah Bridge even after its partial shutdown

KOLKATA: The partial closure of Tallah Bridge has not taken the load off the wobbly structure entirely. Even now, around 40-50 vehicles use it per minute. Belgachhia Bridge — with almost double the flow — will now handle a part of the extra load along with the Lock Gate flyover. The challenge will not be an easy one, especially between February 1 and 4 — the trial phase.Lalbazar says its preparation to handle such a huge flow of traffic on alternative roads is in its final stage. The nerve centres, said top cops, will be Chiria More, which will act as a temporary control room on one side, and the Shyambazar five-point crossing from where the vehicles will move on to alternative routes.In all, cops have identified 12 traffic points that will be under constant vigil in the initial week. Five of these points — Chiria More, Shyambazar crossing, the BT Road-Lock Gate flyover meeting point, Belgachhia Metro station and Galiff Street-KVV Avenue crossing — have kept cops worried.“Chiria More will receive a lot of our attention. Depending on the pressure on various roads, diversions will be implemented. Cossipore Road will see police deployment on the same lines that we usually had on BT Road. Sergeants will be moving up and down to clear congestion. No illegal parking will be allowed. Most importantly, we will also have good presence on JM Avenue and KVV Avenue, roads where otherwise we have skeletal presence during office time,” said joint CP (traffic) Santosh Pandey.Police said they were banking on the Shyambazar traffic guard to bail them out. “We have enough resources at this guard. The Ultadanga guard will pitch in as well. Since we will use signage well ahead of the actual diversion points, we will also seek help from Bidhannagar police and Barrackpore police. For this to happen, we will also depend on those men from other traffic guards who have been posted here over the past two months and who know the geography of the area well,” said an IPS officer. With trucks banned in the area till the alternative railway level crossing is ready at the Chitpore yard, more men would be available in the morning, he added.“We will take the challenges as the come. We will tweak plans as and when required. We are depending heavily on the level crossing across the railway yard at Chitpore. The final inspections are over and we expect it to come up soon,” said DCP (traffic) Rupesh Kumar. Cops will also put emphasis on the movement of ambulances for RG Kar Hospital through Paikpara-Tara Shankar Sarani.Police are offering four alignments for buses moving from south to north. There are three options for those moving south. The big decision is to make Lock Gate flyover one-way, the first time that even buses will be allowed to use this route. “We are expecting the state transport department to issue us the final route alignment for each route. We are in touch with the bus owners. We are also communicating with Ola and Uber. We have asked them to use the Ultadanga Main Road-Bailey Bridge and Ghaznavi Bridge instead of progressing towards Belgachhia,” said an officer.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73718854,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-829760,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cops-give-finishing-touches-to-tallah-bridge-diversion-plans/articleshow/73708866.cms
139,['29/01/2020'],Complete poll process for chairperson of Narikudi panchayat by lots: HC,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Madurai: Taking serious note of the incident where ballot sheets were torn during the indirect election conducted for Narikudi panchayat union in Virudhunagar district after the election of chairperson ended in a tie, the Madras high court has directed to complete the process by drawing of lots instead of conducting fresh election on January 30.

In her petition, S Kaleeswari, a resident of A Mukkulam in Virudhunagar district and DMK member, said she was elected as councillor of ward 3 of Narikudi panchayat union. She decided to contest for the post of chairman in the panchayat union as the seat was reserved for women belonging to scheduled caste community.

There are 14 wards in the panchayat and the election ended in a tie as she and the other candidate secured seven votes each. When the returning officer was planning to conduct drawing of lots as per Tamil Nadu Panchayat Election Rules, the members of the ruling party ransacked the office due to which the election was postponed. She noted that the Aruppukottai deputy superintendent of police Venkatesan sustained cut injuries on his hand during the violence. Hence, she moved the high court Madurai bench seeking to complete the election process by drawing of lots.

When the petition was heard on Tuesday, senior counsel Veera Kathiravan, who appeared for the petitioner submitted that the returning officer had mentioned in his complaint that all the ballot sheets were torn by the ruling party when they were planning to conduct drawing of lots. Stating that democracy is in peril, he submitted that if a fresh election is conducted, then it would pave way for horse-trading.

Additional advocate general K Chellapandian submitted that since all the 14 ballot sheets were destroyed, drawing of lots could not be conducted due to which fresh election was notified for the union.

Taking note of the submissions, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran observed that they cannot encourage such unlawful activity. The judges also observed that since the returning officer had mentioned in his complaint that the election ended in a tie, it would amount to declaration and therefore the ballot papers are not required for drawing of lots. Hence, they directed the state election commission to complete the election process for electing the chairperson of Narikudi union by drawing of lots at 11am on January 30.

While hearing the petitions with regard to conducting election for Thiruppuvanam panchayat union in Sivaganga district and Kovilpatti panchayat union in Tuticorin district, the judges directed to videograph the process and to provide adequate police protection on January 30.

The court also dismissed the petition which challenged the notification dated January 21 which was issued to conduct indirect election for Watrap panchayat union in Virudhunagar district on January 30. The petitioner stated that though the election process was completed, the results were not declared following the violence.

According to the SHO (Rajiv Gandhi Nagar) Balraj Singh Mann, Pukhraj Sankhla lived with his family close to his agriculture farm in Chokha area.

“On Monday, his five-year-old twin daughters Divanshi and Dipika, returned from school and went to the water pond in the farm with the family members unaware. After sometime, some children reached the pond and saw both the girls had drowned and informed the family members,” said the official.

Hyderabad: After residents of Kukatpally Housing Board Colony (phase 2) complained about heaps of garage lying unattended in their locality on the TOI Citizen Reporter app, Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) swung into action and cleared the garbage.

“The issue had not been addressed for three months. Despite repeated complaints, the garbage was lying unattended. I had aired the grievance in the civic body’s mobile app too, but in vain. So, I thank TOI for highlighting the issue and GHMC for clearing the trash,” said Shiva Krishna, the citizen reporter who highlighted the issue on the app.

While clearing GHMC officials also found a lot of debris under the garbage. The heap of trash had concealed the debris underneath. So, officials are also inspecting the area to catch the offenders.

“The garbage has been removed. To clear the debris, we have approached Ramky Group, who will transport it to the recycling plant,” said V Mamatha, GHMC zonal commissioner of Kukatpally, adding, “The area will also be inspected to check for construction activity. If we catch hold of the offenders, they will be penalised.”

GHMC officials, along with the citizen reporter, inspected the area to check for other grievances. “The sanitation official of Kukatpally called me. I mentioned to him about the other grievances in my locality as well,” said Shiva Krishna.

GHMC officials gave residents of Allwyn Colony phase 2 their mobile numbers. “We interacted with residents and gave them our mobile numbers, so that they can approach us whenever needed,” said a GHMC official from the sanitation wing.

A senior citizen said that the piled-up garbage was resulting in mosquitoes and cattle menace. He also complained about stray dogs. “The cattle and stray dogs further scatter the garbage leading to a lot of inconvenience. Finally, our woes have come to an end,” said the senior citizen.

While GHMC’s chief veterinary officer Venkateshwar Reddy promised appropriate measures to control stray dogs, GHMC chief entomologist, Rambabu, said they would take steps to curb mosquito menace.

DEHRADUN: High drama was witnessed at Parade Ground on Tuesday when a medical team deployed for conducting tests of the fasting anganwadi protesters was held captive by them for a few hours.

The women protesters were allegedly upset at the medical team for arriving at the site without “adequate preparations for conducting pathology tests."" However, a few moments later, an ambulance equipped with all the medical facilities arrived at the spot.

Notably, this comes a day after the state government issued notices to the protesting workers to get back to work or face action.

Agitating workers meanwhile said that they are now in a do-or-die mode. “We are risking our lives to meet our demands but the health department probably has not understood the seriousness of our protest and instead sent a team of doctors without any proper equipment for pathology tests. We held them captive for their careless attitude towards the health of anganwadi workers , who look after the health of the state,” said Rekha Negi, president, Anganwadi Karyakartri Sevika Karmchari Union.

Meanwhile, the authorities at Government Doon Medical College Hospital (GDMCH), who sent the doctors' team to monitor the health condition of the fasting workers, told TOI, “We are following all the medical protocols. The team had run out of battery of its glucometer, and apart from that, everything was available. The workers are demanding that the medical team visit them at least four times a day which is practically not possible, as we have thousands of serious patients to be attended to per day at the hospital. It is unethical on the part of anganwadi workers to harass our medical staff on duty.” said Dr KK Tamta, medical superintendent, GDMCH.

The workers have been protesting for the past 50 days, demanding Rs 600 daily wage and regular employee status.

However, the state women and child development minister, Rekha Arya, has claimed that their demands have mostly been met.

Madurai: With just a few days left for denizens to give their feedback for the Swachh Survekshan 2019-20, officials from Madurai Corporation are targeting at least one lakh people for the survey as the window, which opened on January 4 ends on January 31.

Teams led by officials from the health and engineering wings of the corporation have been tapping colleges and companies, where they can find a large number of people. On Tuesday, students of Meenakshi government college were motivated to give their feedback. Officials said that public are being sensitized before they give their feedback. So far, more than 70,000 people have given their feedback, and officials have set a target of covering one lakh people. Madurai will have to compete with 49 cities in the country for the Swachh rankings 2019-20. From TN, only Chennai and Coimbatore feature in the list other than Madurai. Officials said that Coimbatore has already crossed the one lakh mark, while Chennai is lagging far behind than Madurai in terms of citizen feedback . City health office in-charge Dr Senthil Kumar told TOI that the number of feedback will only mean awareness level among people on the survey and cleanliness activities taken by the local body. Rank will be determined based on whether the feedback sent is positive or negative. Feedback alone will not determine the rankings. Those who give the feedback will be contacted for confirmation and there will also be physical visit by a team to corroborate it.“We are sensitizing people on the feedback and only motivating them. Feedback can be given only after giving one time password sent to their mobile phone. We are doing it in a fair manner without influencing people,” Kumar said.

Madurai Corporation has not fared well in Swachh rankings so far. In the 2018-19 overall rankings Madurai secured the 201st spot, slipping from the 123rd spot it had got the previous year. Officials said the corporation was one among the first local bodies, which has successfully completed individual household latrine scheme. They said that it will help the rankings in a big way this year. Residents can record their feedback through SS2020 VoteForYourCity app, or Swachhata app, or www.swachhsurvekshan2020.org website, or helpline number 1969.

Nashik: Valuables and jewellery worth Rs 50 lakh were stolen from the house of a city-based businessman in Sarkarwada area of the city on Monday night.

The police have booked a case against an unidentified suspect and are investigating the case. The businessman’s bungalow, near Raosaheb Thorat hall, is at walking distance from police commissioner’s office. The incident took place between 8pm and 9pm when the businessman had gone out with his family for a walk.

According to the police, the complainant had properly locked and secured his house. Hemant Somavanshi, senior police inspector at Sarkarwada police station, said the burglary took place in just 60 minutes.

“The burglars entered the house by opening the door of the bungalow with duplicate keys and took away the safe kept in one of the rooms of the bungalow. The safe had Rs 1 lakh cash and gold and silver jewellery worth Rs 49 lakh,” Somavanshi said.

When the businessman returned home, he saw the main door was open and the safe kept inside the bedroom was missing. Following this, he lodged a complaint with Sarkarwada police.

“There were no guards or closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras on the premises of the bungalow. The criminal involved must have apparently kept a watch on the bungalow before committing the theft,” the officer said.

While no one has been detained so far, police said domestic servants of the complainant would also be interrogated. “We would check for CCTV cameras installed in the area to identify the suspects,” the officer added.

The detection rate of house break-in cases in the city is extremely poor. From January 2019 to November 2019, police had registered 242 cases of house break-ins of which only 55 were detected.

Potholes, garbage rule arterial roads

Arterial roads in Sainikpuri have been ignored for long by the authorities. The roads have turned into a dumping site for residents of adjoining areas. The uncollected garbage has led to an increase in the number of stray dogs as well. Some of these dogs are extremely aggressive and chase commuters on two-wheelers, especially at night. In addition to this, the roads are full of potholes and during rain, most apartment basements are flooded due to improper drainage. I request the authorities to kindly address our concerns.

Dehradun: In the biting winter chill, the absence of even the basic facilities has made the lives of slum dwellers in the city all the more miserable.

A spot visit by TOI to Kabari Basti, a slum locality, revealed that dwellers of the settlement do not get regular piped water supply, toilets are scarce in the area, and the stench emanating from the nearby Rispana river is unbearable.

“There is no drainage facility in the area and DMC’s door-to-door garbage collection facility hasn’t reached here yet. The motorable road culminates at PWD office and doesn’t reach our slum,” Samundri Devi, a Kabari Basti resident, said. She pointed out that to add to their woes, residents are also at risk from snake bites. ""Recently, a child died of snake bite.There are big bushes here where snakes hide and snake bite incidents had become frequent. So, we requested DMC officials to clear the bushes but were snubbed by them. Thereafter, we pooled in money and cleared the area ourselves,” Devi said.

Bhoora Ahmed, ward councillor of Lohiya Nagar (Kabari Basti), when contacted, claimed that the DMC has been indifferent to the issues raised by residents. ""There is not much co-operation from the local MLA as well. But despite all odds, I am trying to work for my area,” Ahmed alleged.

The residents of Lunia Mohalla, another slum settlement near Clock Tower, are also facing similar issues. “The stench from drains here makes it difficult for us to breathe. The roads in our locality are completely damaged and hinder free movement of vehicles and even pedestrians. Many shopkeepers encroach upon public space leading to further congestion,” said Aishwarya Kapoor, a resident.

When queried about these issues, Santok Nagpal, ward councilor of Lunia Mohalla, told TOI, “We are trying to repair drainage facilities here as current structures can’t handle the burden. As for the roads, they will be constructed very soon.”

Meanwhile, Kailash Joshi, health officer, when asked to respond to the concerns of residents, said, “We are working on the issues. Soon, we will ensure regular cleaning of these wards and sort out their other issues as well.”

Done

Nashik: Three members of a tribal family died after they accidentally got buried under mud at their farm in Borgaon Rokadpada of Surgana taluka — around 65 km from Nashik.

The incident took place at 12.30 pm on Tuesday. The deceased have been identified as 25-year-old Dinesh Khandvi, his 17-year-old brother Manohar Khandvi and their uncle Govind Khandvi — all residents of Rokadpada.

Diwansing Vasave, the police inspector of Suragana police station, said, “The men were in the farm digging mud for their house. They had formed a pit, and the trio was digging deeper. Suddenly, the heap of mud they had dug up and collected on the side of the pit collapsed and fell on them — burying them in the process,” Vasave said.

Locals from the village and two other family members present at the spot did their best to get the trapped men out, but it took them around 15 minutes.

Dinesh and Manohar died of suffocation, while Govind, who was seriously injured, was taken to the Nashik civil hospital for treatment. “He (Govind) died while undergoing treatment at the hospital. Apart from the fracture on his leg, he must have suffered internal injuries that led to his death,” said Vasave.

Borgaon Rokadpada is around 15-km from the Suragana police station and by the time the police team reached the spot, Dinesh and Manohar had already died.

“The deceased were digging mud to use it for their existing house. They had also brought a tractor in the farm to transport the mud to their home. The Khandvi family is into farming,” the officer said.

“Five people had gone to the farm. They were all digging for mud on the hilly patch and loading the tractor. While the three victims were buried under the mud, the remaining two were outside the pit. This saved their lives,” he added.

Madurai: Seven drivers working for the corporation and in service with the city corporation for more than 25 years were honoured by corporation commissioner S Visakan for never having been involved in any accident throughout their career. Each one of them were given a 4g gold coin in the recently held the Republic Day celebration. Similarly, 25 drivers who completed 10 years successfully without any incidents were also recognized.

According to sources, there are 48 permanent drivers, 65 drivers on consolidated pay and more than 200 drivers on contract with the Madurai corporation.

S Sivakumar, a garbage truck driver who joined service in early 1990s, said that the recognition has motivated him a lot and brought cheer from his family members, for an otherwise thankless and routine job. He said that it was patience and discipline while at the wheel which helped him in his incident free career spanning close to 30 years.

K Jegadeesan, driver for the corporation commissioner, said the honour has not only motived those who received the recognition, but the entire crew. They vowed that they will be more responsible on the road, he said. Jegadeesan, secretary of Madurai Corporation Drivers Welfare Association, has driven septic tankers, water tankers and garbage trucks, before he was made driver for VIP vehicles. Before taking the wheel of commissioner’s vehicle a year ago, he was the driver for the mayor.

“While driving VIP vehicles, we feel more responsible and vigil on the road. One should know situation of the VIPs while ferrying them in order to take them to the destination at the right time. One has to be thorough on city roads and locations. Since I was born and brought up in the city, it was not a challenge,” he said.

R Raja, R Ganesan, G Manoharan, K Manoharan and K Ravichandran are the other five recipient of 4g gold coin on Republic Day.

Drivers say that apart from discipline and concentration, proper maintenance of vehicles are also key for accident reduction. It is the duty of the drivers to make sure the vehicles are serviced on time and is in condition for the crowded city roads, they said.

Vijay Rupani and other dignitaries at the event

GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat has become a hub for production and export of potatoes over the past two decades, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday while addressing the third edition of the Global Potato Conclave 2020 organized at the Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar, via video-conferencing.

“The area under potato cultivation increased by 20% in the past 11-12 years in India, however, in Gujarat, the same rose by a significant 170%. The production of potatoes went up due to policy initiatives in addition to modern and sufficient facilities for irrigation,” Modi said. “Government’s initiatives such as Sujalam Sufalam and SAUNI Yojana brought irrigation facilities to areas affected by drought.”

The PM said that the Union government has taken all efforts to take the Gujarat experiment of potato production at a pan-India level. He called for a new policy with dedicated research agenda to promote potato as a sub-sector.

“Potato as a crop has utility in a variety of food products. It is time we encourage potato sub-sector with the new policy and a research agenda. At the root of this policy and research agenda should be the fight against hunger and poverty with a goal to secure global food security,” said Modi.

The Prime Minister also underlined the importance of holding the Global Potato Conclave 2020 in Gujarat, since the state is catching up fast in potato production.

Modi also highlighted the several efforts by the Union government to double farmer’s income by 2022. “It is a target you all are capable of achieving. It is through combined efforts of the government as well as the farmers that India ranks among the top three countries in production of food grains and other items,” he said.

He also emphasised on creating modern and widespread network including farm to food processing to distribution, to make agriculture profitable.

“The government is also promoting farm-tech based startups so that farm database could be used for smart and precision agriculture. This will help farmers in ensuring the right use of water, fertilizers and pesticides, reduce input cost and make farmers more competitive in the global market,” said Modi.

The Prime Minister also laid special emphasis on the need to develop seeds that use less water, are more nutritious and have better shelf-life and productivity.

157,['29/01/2020'],Agra varsity teachers protest against “corrupt” VC for misusing funds,"This story is from January 29, 2020

AGRA: Teachers of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar University staged a massive protest against vice-chancellor Arvind Kumar Dixit on Tuesday for allegedly withdrawing Rs 1.5 crore from the account of teacher’s welfare fund (TWF) in violation of norms.

Under the banner of Agra University Teachers Association (AUTA), teachers with placards in their hands marched over 1-km stretch on MG Road and raised slogans against the VC. Later, they handed over a memorandum addressed to governor Ananadiben Patel and chief minister Yogi Adityanath to additional city magistrate Vimal Kumar. The AUTA protest caused a traffic jam on MG Road.

The teachers’ association leaders accused the VC of financial irregularities and demanded that action must be taken against him. Besides, the TWF fund that was withdrawn should be transferred back to the account.

Meanwhile, more than 1,000 teachers of government-aided colleges in Agra and seven other nearby districts remained on strike as a mark of protest against the university administration.

Nishant Chauhan, AUTA general secretary, said, “On January 3, the VC in violation of norms, transferred Rs 1.5 crore from the TWF account to the main account in violation of norms. We want the state government to investigate the entire matter. The fund mandated to be used only for welfare of teachers should be deposited back in the account. Besides, action should be taken against the VC for financial malpractices.”

Earlier on January 20, AUTA had handed over a memorandum to the varsity administration to return the fund withdrawn from TWF within three days. However, the VC did not take any action.

Federation of Uttar Pradesh University Colleges Teachers Association president Virendra Chauhan, who also participated in the protest march, said, “The VC has no right to withdraw the TWF fund. It is a clear case of corruption. In case the funds are not returned, teachers will be filing an FIR against the VC.”

Varsity public relation officer, GS Sharma said, “TWF is generated from the fee provided to teachers for evaluation of answersheets. We had Rs 2.5 crore in the TWF account. Out of this, the contribution of government-aided teachers of Agra is only 10%. Presently, Rs 1 crore is available in the TWF account. The remaining Rs 1.5 crore have been utilized for the construction of a guest house for teachers on Khandari campus. Standard procedure was followed in utilization of the TWF fund and construction work.”

158,['29/01/2020'],80% saplings planted on Borkhedi-Jamb section dead,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Nagpur: The tall claims of the ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) to have eco-friendly and green highways have been exposed on the 30-km patch of NH-44 (NH-7) between Borkhedi-Jamb, where over 80% of the saplings that were planted have died.

The plight of these plantations, done around two years ago by a private agency BVG, is gloomy. The bamboo tree guards installed to protect the saplings are lying shattered and at stretches in between these tree guards are without any saplings, indicating the plants died.

TOI has pictures of these saplings clicked on Monday evening and on the entire stretch, it seems that the saplings have not been watered and mortality has not been replaced with new ones.

“The poor plantations are against the MoRTH’s ‘Green Highways (Plantation & Maintenance) Policy — 2015 to develop eco-friendly highways with the participation of government agencies, NGOs, people, communities, farmers and private sector,” says district honorary wildlife warden Jaydeep Das.

“The MoRTH has been emphasizing on the need for landscaping highways to reduce the adverse effects of air and noise pollution and soil erosion, but looking at the poor greenery on the most congested Borkhedi-Jamb stretch, the promise of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) seems to be a farce. NHAI may be planting trees but is not serious about their survival,” said Das.

As per the information received under the RTI Act, in 2012, the NHAI felled 70,508 trees in the 150km road radius from Nagpur to Deori, Amravati, Betul, and Pandharkawda. However, this figure doesn’t include huge tree felling on roads between Saoner-Narsingpur, Mansar-Seoni and Butibori-Wardha-Yavatmal as work on these stretches had not started then.

NHAI regional manager Naresh Wadetwar admits there were some issues with plantation and the agency involved will be pursued to replace mortality of saplings.

NHAI project director NL Yeotkar said, “There is the issue of mortality between 39-46km from Nagpur. Many of these saplings got burned in the fire. The agency has already started work on replacing the dead saplings on one side of the highway.”

However, while travelling on the said stretch on Monday, no labourers working to replace dead saplings were claimed by NHAI.

Das says, “NHAI is to be blamed for poor plantations. It is always in a tearing hurry when it comes to felling trees for road widening but the same enthusiasm is not shown for compensatory plantations. This is even though the Supreme Court has expressed serious concerns over tree felling for road, rail and other projects.”

Recently, the apex court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Bobde observed that “The value of oxygen generated by a tree during its lifetime should be considered in determining the damage to the environment caused by its felling.”

Environment lawyer Manish Jeswani says, “As per the new MoRTH policy, 1% of the civil work cost has to be set apart for highway plantation and its maintenance. This fund is transferred to NHAI to maintain separate fund account called ‘Green Highways Fund’ only for this purpose.”

Chennai: For the third day in a row, vehicles crossed Paranur toll plaza on Chennai’s outskirts without paying user fee as the facility damaged by angry commuters is yet to be repaired.

Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest this entails a revenue loss of at least Rs 70 lakh. It might take another three days to repair the damage caused when passengers of a state-owned bus ransacked the toll plaza after one of its employees attacked the bus crew during an argument over paying toll.

Motorists are, however, happy that they can zip through without much of a wait. “It is frustrating to wait for 20-30 minutes everyday. Vehicles queue up for more than a kilometre during weekends and festive seasons,” said A Mani, a private bus driver. “We thought it will become better after FASTag was made mandatory. But entering FASTag lanes has become difficult now.”

More than half the vehicles haven’t subscribed to FASTag (digital toll collection system) and pay fee by cash. But only two of six lanes accept cash. So vehicles attempting to enter these two lanes drive across and block those with FASTag, Mani added.

The toll plaza, set up in 2005, has so far collected Rs 609 crore, according to official data. Despite collecting more than what was invested (Rs 540 crore), the rates haven’t been cut, complain motorists.

S Yuvraj of Tamil Nadu Sand Lorry Owners Federation claimed the concessionaire agreement signed with the contractor had expired but toll collection continued.

Eight people have been arrested on Tuesday in connection with the murders of one of the two victims of the communal clash that took place in Theni district on Monday. A clash between people from the Piramalai Kallar and Kambalathu Naicker (both OBC) communities broke out in Kailasapatti village leaving Jeyabal, 55, and Perumal, 70, dead.

The eight arrested in connection with the murder of Jeyabal have been identified as ‘Bullet’ Murugan, Surendren, Nagaraj, Radhakrishnan, Arun Murugan, Sivakumar, Abimanvu and Selvakumar. No arrests have been made in Perumal’s murder yet. Officials said the men have deserted the villages fearing arrest.

A higher official said that no physical injury was found on Perumal’s body. Although they have registered a murder case, the cause of his death will be known only after the postmortem report is made available.

On Tuesday, south zone IG K P Shanmuga Rajeswaran and Dindigul Range DIG K Joshi Nirmal Kumar visited the village. Theni superintendent of police E Sai Charan Tejeswi told TOI that the situation was under control after the incident and around 200 police personnel have been deployed to maintain normalcy.

The clash broke out between the two intermediate castes as an outcome of small issues brewing between them for long. Jeyabal from the kallar community was involved in the selling of ganja, which did not go well with those from the naicker community, who formed a larger chunk in the village.

Chennai: The Madras high court on Tuesday directed the city corporation to take appropriate action against unauthorised construction put up by a private school in George Town and report compliance by March 16.

The first bench of Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad passed the order on a contempt plea moved by social activist Traffic Ramaswamy seeking action against the authorities for failing to obey the court order dated June 4, 2019, and take action against the illegal structure put up by Terapanth Jain Vidyalaya School at Sowcarpet.

When the plea came up for hearing, counsel for housing development department submitted that the department decided on the revision application moved by the school as per the court order and rejected the same.

Therefore, the petitioner cannot claim contempt against the authorities.

To this, counsel for the petitioner submitted that though the revision application moved by the school has been rejected, so far, no action has been taken to remove the unauthorised construction. When the bench sought to know why the corporation has not proceeded further, corporation counsel submitted that de-occupation notice has been issued to the building owner.

Recording the same, the bench observed that the corporation need not show leniency to the school and directed it to proceed in accordance with the law and report compliance. In case, the school challenges the rejection of review application, then the authorities shall take action as per the proceedings of the challenge, the bench said.

Nashik: The city police on Tuesday announced a series of measures to de-congest overcrowded zones in the city, including the Dwarka circle.

A team of the senior police officials led by police commissioner Vishwas Nangare-Patil as well as National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials conducted an inspection of the Dwarka circle.

Police restricted movements of all heavy vehicles, including the pick-up vans, trucks, tractors used for ferrying vegetables to Panchavati via the Dwarka circle with immediate effect. With this, all heavy vehicles proceeding towards the circle from the Nashik Road area would be diverted to Takali Road via the Fame traffic signal, Janardhan Swami bridge, Tapovan, Aurangabad Road and Dindori Road.

“A large number of heavy vehicles pass through Dwarka circle every day. We are optimistic that restricting movement of these vehicles would reduce the traffic chaos at that circle,” said police.

The police have also decided to relocate bus stands near the circle. The bus stands will be shifted at a specific distance from the circle so that there is no overcrowding of passengers at the circle.

“There is movement of vehicles on the various service roads near the circle. We have decided to divert the traffic on these service roads to other internal roads to reduce the traffic burden on that circle,” said police officials.

Police have also decided to set up traffic signals at the Dwarka circle. They said that they would write to Nashik Municipal Corporation to set up these signals as soon as possible.

“We have also taken a decision to deploy a dozen traffic police constables at the busy chowk to manage the traffic,” added police officials.

The Dwarka circle witnesses traffic snarls on a daily basis, especially during peak hours as roads merge at this circle from seven directions.

NHAI has shelved its plans for the construction of a flyover from Sarda Circle to Datta Mandir chowk in Nashik Road via Dwarka Circle to ease the traffic congestion.

By: Usama Hazari

Global warming is knocking at India’s doors. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says India will be one of the first few countries to be completely destroyed by climate change. Our entire water system is under threat, our cities face the fear of turning into gas chambers with zero groundwater, poisonous rivers and coastal regions being drowned. Also, there is the possibility of mass migration because of climate change with half a billion people becoming climate refugees.

Yet, we seem to be dragging our feet on the issue. Despite knowing that India is the world’s fifth most polluted country and the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases across the globe, we aren’t doing enough to save our environment. Around 68% of carbon emissions in India come from the energy sector, but instead of investing in green energy/renewables the government is making things worse by privatising the energy sector, chopping down trees wherever possible and not bringing strong regulations on carbon emissions.

Look at Telangana . While the government here has initiated projects like Haritha Haram, it is, unfortunately, not enough. Mindless mining of coal, lack of investments in research and development (of green energy) and senseless deforestation are proving to be counter-productive and nullifying the efforts made in the name of Haritha Haram.

If you look at Hussainsagar, everyone knows that it is heavily polluted, almost poisonous, and all efforts to clean it has been nothing but an eye-wash. It doesn’t matter how many times you clean the lake – or any lake for that matter — unless you stop pollutants from entering them, nothing will work. The government has to be tough enough and order industries to treat their industrial waste before releasing it into water or air. If nothing is done now, soon, even passing by the Necklace Road will become unbearable and harmful to our health.

If the chief minister really wants Telangana to be habitable for the future generation, he will have to implement a more solid climate action policy, something like a Zero Carbon Emission Bill or a Green New Deal. The people of Telangana need to stop voting for parties that don’t provide us with a green manifesto.

Just because the situation seems hopeless now, we cannot stop fighting. So, let’s come together and build a formidable army of green warriors so that we – and our generations to come – can breathe easy.

MADURAI: Around two kg of gold jewellery and Rs 2 lakh in cash were reportedly burgled from the house and jewellery store of a businessman at Marthandam in Kanyakumari district in the early hours of Tuesday. However, Marthandam police registered an FIR stating that 120 sovereign gold jewellery was burgled.

The burglaries took place in the house and the jewellery store of Pon Vijay of Madathuvilai. The incidents took place when Vijay and his family members were sleeping on the ground floor of the house. Burglars sneaked into the house through a door on the first floor and stole around 50 sovereigns of gold jewellery and Rs 2 lakh in cash. They also took the keys of the jewellery store located at a prominent location in Marthandam.

The burglars entered the jewellery store around 4am. CCTV footage from the store shows a man, who had covered his face with a monkey cap, taking away jewellery.

“The owner is taking stock of the valuables. We will know the exact quantity of the stolen jewellery only when he lodges a complaint,” said deputy superintendent of police of Thuckalay sub-division M Ramachandran.

Kanyakumari district superintendent of police N Shreenath visited the spot and conducted inquiries. Fingerprint experts and a police sniffer dog were also pressed into service.

Talking to reporters, SP Shreenath suspected the hand of someone closely associated with the family of committing the heist on Tuesday as they clearly knew the availability of the key and the shop. “They had taken the key from the house and opened the shop,” he said and added that they have got some clues and working on it.

It may be recalled that around 100 sovereigns of gold jewellery were stolen from a jewellery shop in Marthandam by a man wearing helmet in December. Since the case is yet to be cracked, jewellers have expressed concern.

On the continuance of such crimes in the region, Shreenath said that it is not enough to have CCTV cameras installed. He advised owners to connect the cameras to their mobile phones and an alert mechanism so that they could monitor it round-the-clock whenever there is disturbance or movement of strangers.

JAIPUR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused PM Modi of destroying India’s image and scaring away investors, and urged the youth to not let their voice be suppressed.Addressing the ‘Yuva Aakrosh’ rally in Jaipur, Rahul, however, refrained from speaking directly against CAA , but lashed out at the Modi government for failing to generate jobs for the youth. Coming down heavily on the Modi government’s promise of creating 2 crore jobs every year, he claimed that 1-crore people had lost their jobs the past year alone. “Where are the 12 crore jobs of six years,” he asked.“Modi gives long speeches on CAA, NRC and NPR but prefers to remain silent on unemployment,” he said. “The growth rate during UPA’s tenure stood at 9%, which has now fallen to below 5%, according to the new parameters for calculating GDP (gross domestic product). If we calculate it as per the earlier parameters, it will be around 2.5%,” he added.Urging the youth not to let their voices be suppressed, the former Congress chief encouraged them to ask questions on employment and the country’s future. Rahul said India was known as a country of peace and harmony, often cited as a contrast to Pakistan .

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi at 'Yuva Akrosh Rally' in Jaipur

JAIPUR: Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused PM Modi of destroying India’s image and scaring away investors, and urged the youth to not let their voice be suppressed.

Addressing the ‘Yuva Aakrosh’ rally in Jaipur, Rahul, however, refrained from speaking directly against CAA , but lashed out at the Modi government for failing to generate jobs for the youth. Coming down heavily on the Modi government’s promise of creating 2 crore jobs every year, he claimed that 1-crore people had lost their jobs the past year alone. “Where are the 12 crore jobs of six years,” he asked.

“Modi gives long speeches on CAA, NRC and NPR but prefers to remain silent on unemployment,” he said. “The growth rate during UPA’s tenure stood at 9%, which has now fallen to below 5%, according to the new parameters for calculating GDP (gross domestic product). If we calculate it as per the earlier parameters, it will be around 2.5%,” he added.

Urging the youth not to let their voices be suppressed, the former Congress chief encouraged them to ask questions on employment and the country’s future. Rahul said India was known as a country of peace and harmony, often cited as a contrast to Pakistan . But the image is now tarnished and businessmen are wary of investing, he claimed.

“PM Modi has destroyed India’s reputation in the world. Today, India is known as the rape capital, but Modi does not talk about this,” he said.. When the youth raise questions over unemployment and ask Modi why he “destroyed” India’s image, they “are answered with bullets and are suppressed”, Rahul remarked.

The growth rate during UPA’s tenure stood at 9%, which has now fallen to below 5%, according to the new parameters for calculating GDP.

Madurai: The Salem railway division of the Southern Railway (SR) has rolled out seven electric locomotives with colourful exterior advertisements. The first locomotive was flagged off by SR general manager John Thomas at Dindigul Junction on Tuesday. These locomotives have been introduced as part of the railways’ effort to increase non-fare revenue.

Railway officials said the first two locomotives that have now rolled out have been taken by SKM Feeds. The remaining five have been taken up by other corporates and can soon be seen on the tracks.

Officials said that prior to Salem division, Nagpur railway division in Maharashtra had introduced this form of non-fare revenue general generation.

Aligarh Muslim University

AGRA: Demanding resignation of vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor and registrar Abdul Hamid , over 1o,000 students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have decided to boycott examination from Wednesday, putting the varsity administration in a tight spot.

3,095 students of AMU’s Women's College are also part of the protesting students, who have announced a “lockdown” from Wednesday.

Students of almost all the streams, including commerce, management, science, art, social science, life science and law are part of the protest, confirmed AMU administration.

Talking to TOI, one of the women students, Sadaf Shakeel, who is leading the protest at Women’s College, said, “Students feel insecure on the campus after the recent incidents, which took place on December 15 and January 26.”

The students were allegedly beaten up on December 15 by security forces, which entered the campus after getting access nod from the registrar and the VC. Four students were also detained on January 26 after the proctor’s team handed over them to policemen for shouting slogans against the VC.

“We stand with our brothers, who were beaten by the security forces. We are students and we have the right to raise our voices. But, the administration is trying to suppress our voice by creating fear of the police,” said another protesting student, Farah Rufi.

The protesting students also alleged that the administration was trying their best to suppress the “peaceful mode of protest by blackmailing them regarding their attendance and evaluation of exam papers”.

Senior secondary school girls of AMU also joined them. One of the protesting girl students of Class XII said that though the lockdown will impact academic activities, the administration has left them with no choice.

When contacted, spokesperson of the university, Shafey Kidwai, said that the administration is trying to convince the agitating students by engaging some senior members of the faculty and students. “There is no change in the examination dates and we will try that students appear for Wednesday’s exams,” he said.

NASHIK: The cultural directorate of the state government has organised 59th edition of Maharashtra state Sanskrit drama competition .

Besides Nashik , participants from Beed and Dhule will also perform their plays in the last round of the competition.

Rajesh Jadhav, co-ordinator of the event, on behalf of the state government, said, “In Maharashtra, Sanskrit is an optional subject in schools. Being a scoring subject, many students opt for it. There are many people in Nashik who study Vedas and are acquainted with the language. I am sure Sanskrit lovers will enjoy the plays.”

A total of four plays spanning 1.5 hours each will be performed in a day.

Renuka Yeolekar, the director of the first play Lokabhiramah Shriramah, said, “All actors have been practising for the competition since August. Everyone has to recite the whole script and master the pronunciation with exact halant and visarg as that would be a criterion for judgement.”

Lokabhiramah Shriramah is a musical drama that portrays the story of Ramayana from Sita’s marriage till the day when her husband sends her to the forest when she is pregnant, Renuka told TOI.

Aniket Inamdar, an undergraduate student who is playing the lead role of Ram in the play, said, “It is fun and easy to perform a Sanskrit drama as the words are different from the day-to-day language. We have to focus more on the action so that those who do not understand Sanskrit can also understand the play.”

Monarch Savaliya (second right) returned from China on Monday

PALANPUR/VADODARA/RAJKOT: Three youngsters from Gujarat studying at Nanchang in east China’s Jiangxi province are stranded there as they were allegedly not allowed to board a flight by a private airline suspecting that they could be infected with coronavirus.

The youngsters, one of them who is from Palanpur, made a video seeking support of Indian government and the ministry of external affairs.

The youngsters have claimed that they were not allowed to board a flight from Nanchang’s airport by manager of Spring Airlines on the ground that their body temperature was high.

“We were scheduled to board a flight to Bangkok from where we had a connecting flight to New Delhi and later to Ahmedabad,” said Amit Moradia. They claimed they were made to undergo thorough check-up at the airport as they had to pass through an infrared machine that detects body temperature.

“Our body temperature was slightly higher than 37 degrees, approximately 37.3 degrees. We were stopped at the airport and had to undergo check-up for which we had given them written permission,” he said, adding even the tests confirmed that they were not infected due to the virus.

“Body temperature of all Indians is considered normal at 37.5 degrees. Our body temperature was well within the range and even the tests had proved that,” he said, adding that the problem started when they went to collect their boarding passes.

Navneet Barot, whose father is a police constable in Palanpur, said, “The airline manager did not allow us to board the flight even as our test were negative.” The trio had to cancel their tickets of their connecting flight to Delhi and Ahmedabad.

“We are in touch with the Indian embassy but the situation at Nanchang worsening. On Monday, there were 7-8 coronavirus positive which have increased to 18 within 24 hours. At the same time, while our families in India are worried, we don’t have enough food and water stock,” he said.

Meanwhile, around 23 students including four from Junagadh and 11 from Rajkot are expected to return home soon while some have returned safely.

Monarch Savaliya of Junagadh who returned on Monday, said, ""The situation in China is grim. We were ordered to return to India, but there was no way we could arrange our flight so fast. Junagadh's BJP leader Kirit Patel helped facilitate our return within just three hours after speaking with chief minister Vijay Rupani.""

Four more students from Junagadh - Deep Vaishnani, Brijesh Davra, Ruchi Viroja and Shivam Maradiya, who are studying in Shanghai and Wuhan, are expected to return on Wednesday, official sources said.

Meanwhile, parents of a student from Botad, Samir, who studies in a university in Wuhan, are spending anxious moments as he is still stranded there. His mother is a teacher in Tatam village.

Muzaffarnagar: Seat of world-renowned Islamic seminary, Saharanpur’s Deoband town remained strangely serene all these days while other neighbouring districts and towns of western UP witnessed sit-ins and protests against CAA and the national register of citizens (NRC). Darul Uloom had advised its students in December last year to stay away from protests which it said may “tarnish the image of the seminary.”

But, on Monday evening, hundreds of local women holding tricolors and placards marched to city’s Eidgah ground and sat on an “indefinite” protest. They stayed there the entire night, and their ranks swelled by Tuesday evening.

One of them, Amna Roshi, a young woman, said, “We have come on the streets against this law. We all are on our own; no one is behind us… no political party, no politician. And we will not go back to our homes till the government fulfills out demand.”

Another woman protester, Fozia Usmani, said, “We are aware about our rights that the Constitution has given to us. We will fight in a democratic way against this black law.”

The local administration was caught off the guard and heavy police force was deployed in the area.

Superintendent of police (rural) Vidya Sagar Mishra said, “We are trying to pacify them. Senior superintendent of police of Saharanpur also met them, but they are not ready to give up.”

Kozhikode: Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, (IIM-K) has witnessed 100% placement for its largest-ever batch of 413 students within five days, amid concerns of slowdown in the economy.

The final placements also saw a 12% increase in the mean and 12.4% increase in the median salary from last year. The mean salary increased from Rs 20.6 lakh per annum (LPA) to Rs 23.08 LPA while the median increased from Rs 18.5 LPA to Rs 20.8 LPA as compared to last year, IIM-K authorities said on Tuesday.

The top 50% of the students bagged an average CTC of Rs 26.69 LPA, a 12.5% increase from the last year. Five students of the batch of 418 students chose to opt out of the process.

The placement offers were rolled out by 131 recruiters, a 22.4% increase when compared to last year.

A total of 29% of the offers were rolled out by the consulting sector while 21% of the offers came from financial industry and 18% offers from the sales and marketing sector.

IIM-K director prof Debashis Chatterjee said the alacrity of placements is reflective of the consolidation that quality B-schools like IIM-K have achieved over the years.

“Technology is re-shaping education and I foresee the edu-tech sector becoming the prime recruiter and a formidable force in attracting talent. The talent that an institute like IIM-K offers is more enduring than job profiles. Our students are recognized by our recruiters for their distinctive traits like talent profile, multi-cultural literacy, entrepreneurial mindset and richer diversity quotient,” he added.

Prof Shovan Chowdhury, chairperson, placements at IIM-K, said the institute has seen a 200% surge in offers from startups along with more than 150% increase in the roles from e-commerce firms securing 12.5% of the total offers from these sectors. “IIM-K has witnessed another successful completion of final placements for its largest batch despite the negative sentiment of the job market. Contrary to the industry sentiments, 14% of the offers have come from the banking sector. Overall, we have seen a 22.4% increase in the participation of the companies this year,” he added.

UDHAGAMANDALAM: Two days after two men drowned in a waterbody near Kalhatti Falls in the Nilgiris, the National Disaster and Relief Force and a team of fire and rescue services personnel fished out their bodies on Tuesday.

The district administration roped in NDRF after fire and rescue services personnel could not retrieve the bodies as they were stuck among rocks and the waterbody was deep.

On Sunday, Ganesh, 25, and Samuel, 23, residents of Elk Hill area in Ooty, along with five other friends, went to Kalhatti Falls, which is 10km away from Ooty. “They were standing near the foot of the fall and taking pictures and videos. Suddenly, Ganesh and Samuel slipped and fell into the waterbody. As their friends didn’t know swimming, they didn’t attempt to save Ganesh and Samuel,” a revenue official said.

Fire service personnel and locals tried to recover the bodies for the past two days, but in vain.

Subsequently, the district administration sought the help of National Disaster and Relief Force. Besides, a team of fire and rescue services personnel from Kanyakumari district was also roped in.

The team of 21 NDRF personnel and 12 rescue services personnel recovered the bodies on Tuesday. The bodies were later sent to the Ooty government headquarters hospital for postmortem.

Police registered a case and further investigation is on.

Bijnor: To ensure safety of villagers in the backdrop of leopard attacks which claimed six lives in Bijnor district, the forest department has formed a leopard taskforce.

Giving details, divisional forest officer M Semmaran said, “We have formed leopard taskforce in the district. The taskforce is equipped with a four-wheeler, special cage, drone, nets and tranquilizer gun. Team will reach any spot after getting a tip-off about leopard sightings.”

From February to May, leopardess are known to give birth to cubs and turn aggressive to protect their litter. “Breeding season is set to start from February and will continue till May-end. The last time, we had rescued around a dozen cubs after harvesting sugarcane crop. All cubs were sent to the zoo. This time, a number of cubs will rise. We are preparing for the breeding season.” Semmaran said.

In this backdrop, a leopard taskforce will remain on its toes for the safety of villagers. According to officials, Bijnor district is known as the sugar bowl of UP. Big cats have made the cane fields home and are thriving. It is estimated that more than 100 leopards live amid the cane fields. Now, they have spread in lowland areas. Over the past few months since sugarcane harvesting begun, leopard sightings have increased manifold.

Since November, around 200 sightings have been reported to the forest department. Six people have been killed and numerous people have been injured.

The presence of leopards in the fields has resulted in man-animal confrontation. A big cat was killed by villagers at Bhogpur village on January 6 soon after it mauled a student to death.

Since then, villagers have turned aggressive and their tendency to cordon off big cats in fields is common. Recently, villagers had surrounded a cane field here at Fatehpur Sabhachand village, cornering a leopard there. Forest and police acted swiftly and controlled the situation. To deal with such types of incidents, forest department has formed leopard task force.

186,['29/01/2020'],"Bus fares go up by 30%, thanks to toll collection","This story is from January 29, 2020

Hubballi: The bus fare hike has been one of the long-pending demands of the loss-making NWKRTC. Though the authorities had several times placed a proposal to increase the fare following fuel price hike, the government had not approved the same fearing backlash from the public.

However, the toll collection between Hubballi and Kundgol or Laxmeshwar has prompted the authorities to increase the fare by over 30%.

North West Karnataka Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) has “quietly” hiked the fare of express and ordinary services after toll collection was started at Sherewad on State Highway-73.

Shivanand Gurusiddappa Ullegaddi, a farmer in Sherewad, alleged that the state government has started collecting toll at 19 booths, including the one at his village, from January 21. “But nowhere has the bus fare increased, except for buses plying between Hubballi and Kundagol. Though the toll for buses is Rs 95 for one way and Rs 140 two way, NWKRTC is collecting Rs 4-5 extra from each passenger,” he alleged.

Harish Koneri, a BJP worker in Kundgol, said NWKRTC is collecting Rs 5 from Kundgol-bound passengers who travel 21km, and Rs 4 for Laxmeshwar-bound passengers who travel 45km. “So the hike is unscientific. Kundgol people travel to Hubballi for their daily needs. Many farmers and labourers travel to Hubballi to work at factories, shops, construction sites. The hike is a burden on us,” he explained.

A conductor on board the Hubballi-Kundagol bus said that it’s become difficult for the crew to convince passengers over the hike. “Many travellers quarrel with us. But none of them approaches our higher-up. At the other end, our officials have not publicised about the fare hike in media or on noticeboards in bus stands,” he rued.

Mallappa Hullatti, a farmer from Noolvi, said NWKRTC had hiked the fare by Re 1 citing the toll plaza at Gabbur Cross 2-3 years ago. “Though buses are not going through the toll plaza and entering the Hubballi at Gabbur Cross, collection is still on,” he alleged.

Ashok Patil, divisional traffic officer, NWKRTC (Hubballi division), said the fare was hiked as per the government circular. “We have a government instruction to hike the price by Rs 4-5 for each toll plaza. Normally, contractors don’t collect the toll from ordinary buses. The toll contractor is not collecting toll from ordinary buses on Dharwad-Alnavar route. Such concession is not available at Sherewad toll gate. If that happens, we will stick to the earlir fare.”

WHAT YOU PAY

After toll collection started on January 21, the fare between Hubballi-Kundgol has been hiked from Rs 15 to 20 for shuttle buses, and from Rs 25 to 30 for express buses. For Hubballi-Laxmeshwar express buses, the fare has been hiked from Rs 51 to Rs 55. For other moffsil buses bound to Budenkatti and other places, the fare has gone up from Rs 22 to 27.

MEERUT: Ashish Kumar, 28, a Uttar Pradesh police constable of 2011 batch posted with police lines in Shamli district, was found dead on the outskirts of his native village in Meerut ’s Mawana area on Tuesday morning. He had suffered bullet injury in the head.

While senior police officers are considering it to be a case of suicide, they have not yet ruled out foul play as the pistol used in incident was not recovered from the spot. “There is no struggle marks on the body and no circumstantial evidence suggest any commotion due to resistance. Also, the wound on the right temple suggests that the victim was shot from point blank range,” Avinash Pandey, superintendent of police (rural area) said.

According to Shamli police, Kumar was on sanctioned leave for three days from January 26 and is currently deployed in the security of state cabinet minister Suresh Rana . The local Meerut police which is investigating the case has claimed that the deceased was going through a marital dispute and was party to divorce case for which he had to attend a hearing on Tuesday.

Kumar got married to a girl in Daurala area in Meerut. The marriage soon ran into trouble following which the girl had registered a case of domestic violence against her husband and in-laws.

Sources said that both sides had agreed to settle the case for Rs 22 lakh and some part of it was already paid to the girl’s side. “There was a hearing in the domestic violence case and a final settlement was supposed to take place,” Pandey said.

MEERUT: The raid carried out by a Delhi Police special cell team on the illegal weapons manufacturing unit at a location under Lisari Gate police station in Meerut’s Humayun Nagar on January 20, has put the spotlight on the city as the new hub of illicit firearms trade in the north, replacing Munger in Bihar. In that raid, which was carried out by keeping Meerut police in the dark, 50 pistols were seized and a local, Noor Hasaan, arrested.

It was not the first time Delhi Police had busted an illegal arms manufacturing unit in the heart of Meerut. In a similar crackdown in October 2018, Delhi Police’s special cell had arrested five men for allegedly running an illegal arms factory, again in Lisari Gate, and seized 84 pistols.

Again in November 2019, Delhi Police busted another illegal unit in Meerut, based in a residential house, recovering two unfinished country-made pistols and 50 barrels meant to be used to manufacture pistols.

Law enforcement agencies believe this development is adversely affecting law and order in western UP and neighbouring states. According to senior police officials, this is due to availability of arms with “factory finished” quality in western UP, which earlier had to be procured from neighbouring Bihar and Madhya Pradesh via conduits.

“We have been consistently working on gangs from the region sourcing firearms from Munger in Bihar, Khargone and Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal and Jharkhand . But this trend is now changing. Earlier, carriers, mostly from UP, used to go these places, procure weapons and supply them across north India. But now, they collect equipment and parts in UP, and get the firearms manufactured by craftsmen from other regions, which are then supplied to neighbouring states,” said Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (special cell, Delhi).

From clunky country-made pistols, criminals of western UP have recently upgraded to sophisticated factory-made weapons that compete with their counterparts in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, etc. “Police in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh have tightened the noose on manufacturing of illicit firearms, forcing the artisans to relocate especially to western UP, where the demand is high,” said a STF sleuth in UP.

A country-made pistol, which costs Rs 1,000-1,500 to manufacture, is sold at Rs 3,000-5,000, while locally-sourced ones with “factory finish” cost between Rs 3,000-5,000 to manufacture, and is sold for Rs 15,000-20,000.

Though western UP is considered a hub of arms trade and manufacturing, law enforcement agencies become active only ahead of elections or critical law and order situations in the state. Reacting to the haul by Delhi Police in the past, SP (city) Akhilesh Narayan Singh said, “We busted several illegal arms rackets in the past, and continue to do so. We act based on our inputs, and so do our counterparts in Delhi.”

190,['29/01/2020'],Dy CM joins in releasing 301 turtles into Ganga,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Meerut/Hastinapur: A day after CM Yogi Adityanath flagged off Ganga Yatra in Bijnor, deputy CM Dinesh Sharma participated in a function to release 301 turtles at Makhdoompur ghat into the river at Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary. With this, the number of turtles released in Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary has crossed 3,000 ever since conservation began jointly by WWF India and UP Government in 2012.

“Turtles are an inseparable part of ‘Clean Ganga’ campaign and contribute a lot in keeping the sacred river clean,” said Sharma, who arrived on Tuesday morning at the ghat, offered prayers at the river bank and then released the turtles. He was flanked by UP cane minister Suresh Rana, Meerut MP Rajender Agarwal and others.

According to field project coordinator of WWF India Sanjeev Yadav, “ ‘The River for Life Programme’ of WWF was initially a five-year programme that began in 2012. Later, it was extended. We had educated the river bed farmers of Makhoompur area of Hastinapur about how important the endangered turtles are in preservation of river Ganga. We approached around 10 villages located on the river banks that encompass a stretch of 50 km. These villagers provided us with 53 nests which had a total of 578 eggs in 2014. This also gives them a sense of ownership. Over a period of time, this community-driven programme has resulted in the release of over 3,000 turtles. A majority of the turtles released belong to three species -- Three striped turtle Batagur Dhongoka, Brown Roofed Turtle ‘pangshura smithii’ and ‘pangshura tecta’ (Indian roofed turtle).”

Special fenced hatcheries are developed for rescued eggs and later, the hatchlings are transferred to a pond at Hastinapur Forest Training Centre, where they are protected and taken care of before their release into the Ganga four or five months after birth.

Divisional forest officer, Meerut, Aditi Sharma added, “It’s not just turtles but dolphins and gharials are also part of this programme. In fact in 2009, we (UP forest division) in association with WWF-India began innovative initiative of involving Ganga ‘mitras’ (village volunteers) in the conservation process. The community-based programme has resulted in the release of over a thousand gharials (finds mention in the IUCN Red List of Threatened species). Similarly, we have now three dozen dolphins up from 30 in 2015.”

Chennai: DMK has set a target of getting not less than 1 crore signatures against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register for Citizens (NRC). In a letter to functionaries, DMK president M K Stalin said that while the target will be 1 crore signatures, party workers should not stop with it. DMK and its alliance parties had decided to get signatures against CAA, NPR and NRC between February 2 and 8. Stalin said once the parties get an appointment with the President, a team will present the signatures to him. “With regard to DMK cadres, whether is a public meeting or a rally or a meeting to get funds for the party, it will definitely be more than the target. Similarly, for getting the signatures, let the target be more than several crores as the CAA would divide the country in the name of religion,” said Stalin.

As per a DMK release, Stalin will begin the campaign in his constituency Kolathur, TNCC chief K S Alagiri will start it at Avadi, MDMK chief Vaiko at Madras Harbour, CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan in Villupuram, former CPI state secretary D Pandian at Royapuram and others in various places.

194,['29/01/2020'],Civic body plans to buy 3 mechanised road sweepers,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Nashik: Municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has directed the solid waste department to buy three mechanised road sweepers and a provision of Rs 15 crore will be made for it in the budget for financial year 2020-21.

It would be for the first time that the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) would be undertaking mechanised sweeping of roads. These machines would enable the civic body to deal with lack of sanitation workers involved in sweeping the city roads manually.

The instruction from Game came during the meeting of head of department (HODs) held on Tuesday. The total length of the roads under the jurisdiction of the NMC is around 2,500-km. The city needs a total of 2,500 sanitation workers to maintain cleanliness and keep the roads clean. However, there are only 1,800 sanitation employees working with the municipal corporation.

As no recruitment has taken place in the past few years due to lack of permission by the state government on the ground of high administrative expenses of the NMC, the solid waste management department is facing scarcity of sanitation employees. There is still requirement of 700 sanitation employees for maintaining cleanliness in the city.

Earlier, the NMC had planned to outsource 700 sanitation employees through contractors and had also started tender process. But a section of corporators had alleged the NMC administration of financial irregularities in the tender process.

While the general body of the NMC had given approval to outsource 700 sanitation workers for a period of one year at a cost of Rs 20 crore, the standing committee of the NMC had given approval to give work order to the contractor for a period of three years at a total cost of Rs 77 crore.

This had sparked allegations of corruption by some corporators from Congress and Shiv Sena in NMC. The municipal commissioner had also directed the additional commissioner to verify the tender process.

As outsourcing of sanitation employees is getting delayed, the NMC has decided to opt for mechanical sweeping instead of outsourcing staff.

Vijayawada: The capital decentralisation imbroglio has now shifted to the national capital. While the state government has sent the legislative council abolition resolution for Parliament’s nod, opposition TDP too is gearing up to take the fight against the trifurcation of the capital to the Parliament .

The ruling YSRC has termed the resolution to dissolve council as a “historic decision”. The party’s official spokesperson, Sattenapalle MLA Ambati Rambabu, said on Tuesday that many states in the country do not have councils. “The state government would not have taken such a decision had Naidu not influenced the council by sitting in the gallery. If anyone is to be blamed for this, it is Naidu,” he said.

Meanwhile, Naidu held a meeting with his party MPs to finalise the strategy to be followed to take up the capital issue at the national level. TDP MPs in both the Houses of the Parliament have been told to raise the capital trifurcation issue and scrapping of legislative council during the upcoming budget session.

Guntur MP Galla Jayadev said they will raise the issues in the Parliament. “We will also raise the issue of police oppression on peaceful protesters. We are going to lodge complaints with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), National Commission for Women and other appropriate forums,” he said.

Rajya Sabha member Kanakamedala Revindra said the resolution passed by the assembly to scrap the legislative council will not stand judicial scrutiny and they will take it at appropriate legal forums.

Meerut: Ashish Kumar, 28, a Uttar Pradesh police constable of 2011 batch posted with police lines in Shamli district, was found dead on the outskirts of his native village in Meerut’s Mawana area on Tuesday morning. He had suffered bullet injury in the head.

While senior police officers are considering it to be a case of suicide, they have not yet ruled out foul play as the pistol used in incident was not recovered from the spot. “There is no struggle marks on the body and no circumstantial evidence suggest any commotion due to resistance. Also, the wound on the right temple suggests that the victim was shot from point blank range,” Avinash Pandey, superintendent of police (rural area) said.

According to Shamli police, Kumar was on sanctioned leave for three days from January 26 and is currently deployed in the security of state cabinet minister Suresh Rana. The local Meerut police which is investigating the case has claimed that the deceased was going through a marital dispute and was party to divorce case for which he had to attend a hearing on Tuesday.

Kumar got married to a girl in Daurala area in Meerut. The marriage soon ran into trouble following which the girl had registered a case of domestic violence against her husband and in-laws.

Sources said that both sides had agreed to settle the case for Rs 22 lakh and some part of it was already paid to the girl’s side. “There was a hearing in the domestic violence case and a final settlement was supposed to take place,” Pandey said.

Coimbatore: To develop and promote women entrepreneurs in rural parts, the state government plans to implement the Tamil Nadu Rural Transformation Project (TNRTP), a World Bank-funded project to build sustainability and prosperity among rural communities through enterprise promotion.

The project will be carried out in two phases. “In total, the project will be implemented in 3,994 village panchayats from 120 blocks across the state over a period of six years. In the first phase, 1,393 village panchayats from 38 blocks across the state are selected,” said A Philips Ilayaraja, district executive officer of the project.

“In Coimbatore district, the project will be implemented in 54 village panchayats from four blocks – Karamadai, Annur, Sarkar Samankulam and Periyanaickenpalayam. Of them, 17 village panchayats in Karamadai block will come under the first phase,” he said, adding that the preliminary work to implement the project in Karamadai block has begun.

Apart from building rural enterprises, the project will create employment opportunities and assist in financial matters. “Our first preference is for women entrepreneurs, who should be part of a self-help group (SHG),” he said.

“Through the project, close to 30% of the fund to run an enterprise will be given by the state government. For remaining fund, we would help them get bank loans,” he added.

The project officials have submitted a report to the state government after assessing the available resources and identifying scopes for starting business in the district. “The next step is to identify business scopes in block and village level with the help of participatory groups.

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Smart City Development Corporation (NMSCDCL) has decided to undertake borewell trials at 17 ancient kund sites in an effort to revive them.

In each of the kunds, the authorities will first sink a borewell to ascertain the water depth. If the water is not available in the kund it won’t be revived.

Moreover, the smart city company has decided to de-concretise the riverbed stretch between Dutondya Maruti and the Gadge Maharaj bridge.

The decision on the same was taken during a board meeting of the smart city on Monday. “We have decided not to de-concretise Ram Kund and Gandhi Talav in the river Godavari, but the stretch between Dutondya Maruti and Gadge Maharaj bridge would be de-concretised,” said the chairman of NMSCDCL Sitaram Kunte.

There were also proposals to revive 17 ancient kunds with natural springs in the Godavari. “Initially, we decided to study the project. Moreover, we will undertake borewell trials to ascertain that there are still natural springs at the sites of ancient 17 kunds,” said Kunte.

The survey for mapping of the kunds with natural springs have already been completed by the smart city officials.

In December last year, the smart city officials had decided to start the reviving work of the kunds from Gandhi talav, but they had to stop it following opposition by a section of corproators.

In 2015, an environmentalist Devang Jani had filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court seeking removal of concrete in the Godavari. He has been pursuing with the NMC for removal the concrete development.

The High Court in its judgment had said that it is the right to devotees to get pure water and it is the responsibility of NMC to make it available. In reply, the court had asked the petitioner to give a presentation before the municipal commissioner, who will take a decision on the same.

Thereafter, the then municipal commissioner Abhishek Krishna had deployed security guards to protect the river from pollution and had also set up a Godavari conservation cell. But, no decision was taken on removal of concrete.

Now, the municipal commissioner Radhakrishna Game has taken initiative in this connection.

The Private Schools Correspondents Confederation (PSCC), an association of private schools affiliated to the state board has written to the secretary, Ministry of School Education, requesting to scrap the exams.

“Considering that the children come from different learning spectrums, we adapt our delivery and assessment as best suited to them. So, it is essential that primary schooling from grades I to VIII have the utmost flexibility and autonomy,” the association said in a statement. It further added that after the announcement of board exams, many parents had approached member schools asking for rigorous academic schedules and pulled out children from all their extra-curricular activities.

“Already, the introduction of board examination for Class XI has created undue pressure on children. Many of them have dropped of class XI and this year, in turn, has seen an increase in enrolment in polytechnic colleges. Having two more board exams will be rather disastrous,” said the PSCC statement.

Several government school teachers also echoed similar concerns and said that the only reason to not oppose the exams was fear of losing their jobs. “I understand that it is a quality test. But, this will only put unnecessary pressure on students and teachers because results are ultimate. Desperation for good result will not help improve the quality of education and only increase dropouts. Students will be denied a basic right,” said a headmaster of a government school.

Senthilnathan M, president, PSCC, said that the association is reaching out to try and create a collective of teachers and parents to appeal to the government to scrap the exams. “The only thing is that everyone has to come together for this. If required, we are planning to take it to court as well,” he added.

Nashik: City MP Hemant Godse has urged chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to request the Centre to speed up projects like Nashik Metro, Nashik-Pune railway track and strengthening of air connectivity under regional connectivity scheme (RCS).

According to a statement issued by Godse, he took up the issue of pending projects in Nashik during a meeting of all MPs from the state convened by the CM in Mumbai on Monday.

Godse said that he informed Thackeray about the pending projects that have halted development in the district, which need to be pushed by the Union government. “The CM assured me that he would look into the issues.”

“The Nashik metro project has been approved by the state government and has been sent to the Centre for approval, but it is still pending and the state government needs to pursue it. The project is important to strengthen the public transport in the city,” said Godse.

The MP said that he also brought to the notice of the CM the DPR of Nashik-Pune railway line project that is lying with the state government for approval.

The ministry of civil aviation has already awarded different routes to various private airlines under RCS, but these airlines are yet to start operations from some airports in Maharashhtra, including Nashik.

Godse said that he urged the CM to pursue the issue with the central government and urge it to ensure commencement of all flights under RCS from Nashik and other airports in the state.

The MP said that Nashik and Nagpur have been selected by the Centre for the Ramayan Circuit project, which is yet to take off. There is a need to pursue the issue with the Centre to get the proposal approved.

“The Union ministry of agriculture has in principle given its approval for agricultural terminal projects for Nagpur, Nashik and Thane. The project, which is in the interest of farmers, is yet to kick-start in Nashik,” he said.

Taking on Abbayya at a press meet here on Monday, Halaharavi said despite the fact that there will be no harm to people of any religion because of CAA, he said the former is unnecessarily dragging Dalits into the matter and staging protest to condemn CAA, which is condemnable. “There is nothing wrong in CAA. Just for political gains, protests by Dalits were organised. Innocent Dalits have been misled,” he alleged.

Tirupati: In view of the rising atrocities against children, the Tirupati police department has decided to spread awareness about Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in rural areas by conducting gram sabhas.

The decision was taken at a review meet on Mahila Mitra in the Tirupati Urban police district on Tuesday. Speaking at the meet, additional AP (admin) Anil Babu hailed the Disha Act as path-breaking and maintained that such cases should be dealt with on a priority basis.

On the change in perspective required in the department while dealing with such sensitive cases, Women’s Initiatives (WINS) secretary R Meera appealed to the cops to break the stereotype and initiate action against the culprit, instead of trivialising criminal action and victimising the victim.

In many cases, the victim’s attire and social behaviour are scrutinised, instead of questioning the offender. “Uncontrollable anger or sexuality is attributed to men and police tend to think that women enjoy being subjugated. This is where we need a course correction”, she pointed out.

Taking note, Babu instructed the Mahila Mitras to reach out to survivors to settle the issue rather than dragging it on. Apart from assuring tighter vigilance on women-related issues, he directed the officials concerned to fast-track such cases to bring the culprits to book within 21 days.

Nashik: Nashik city will be included in the second phase of the Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC), P Anbagalan, CEO of Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), said.

The agency has already identified lands in Sinnar and Ghoti areas of the district for the same. Moreover, MIDC has also proposed developing of electric and engineering zones in the district under DMIC.

An information to this effect was issued by MIDC CEO P Anbagalan during a meeting with industries held in the city recently.

“Earlier, Nashik was not included in the first phase of the DMIC project because of the water reservation issue. But, the district is to be included in the second phase of the project that is expected to begin shortly,” P Anbagalan said.

“Some parts of districts such as Ghoti and Sinnar are to be included in the second phase of DMIC. The electric and engineering industries require very less quantum of water. Considering the water issue, we are planning to develop electric and engineering zone under the DMIC project,” said Anbagalan.

Nashik was not included in the first phase of the DMIC due to false reports by the water resources department of the state government about non-availability of water even though Nashik had large number of dams. Aurangabad, which gets water from Nashik, was included in the first phase of DMIC. Therefore, the industry bodies now want Nashik to be included at least in the second phase of DMIC.

MIDC has already selected over 2,000 hectares in Sinnar near Nashik for industries and it is in the process of land acquisition for the same. It is also looking for more land in Sinnar for the DMIC project.

“Industrial areas that would get developed under DMIC project will require adequate water. We will require at least 24 million litres daily (MLD) water for industries under the DMIC project. Hence, we need to do planning for availability of water. We are already in talks with the water resources department for availability of water for DMIC project,” sources from MIDC said.

The DMIC project seeks to create a strong economic base with a globally competitive environment and state-of-the-art infrastructure to activate local commerce, enhance investments and attain sustainable development.

The project aspires to double employment potential, triple industrial output and quadruple exports from the region in the next couple of years.

While police have rescued the girl, it is not known whether she was handed over to her father or grandfather, with whom she was staying.

According to a police officer attached to Palladam police station, the woman, identified as Anitha, of Omalur in Salem district, was caught in Erode. “After kidnapping the child, she went to Velankanni shrine in Nagapattinam district. On Tuesday, she came to Erode bus terminus with the child. Police there subsequently took her into custody and alerted us.”

Preliminary inquiry revealed that the woman was deserted by her husband. “She used to roam around many places. The girl’s grandfather found her in Palani on last Thursday when he went to the Dhandayuthapani Swamy temple and took her home for availing sexual services,” the officer said.

According to her, the officer said, the girl’s grandfather told her that he and his son were struggling to raise the girl child since her mother left her. “So, she decided to raise the child and took her away when he fell asleep on January 25,” the officer said.

Bhubaneswar: The state government on Tuesday ordered culling of birds in the poultry farm of the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) in Siripur and within one km radius of the infected area.

The moves comes a day after Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) confirmed the H5N1 — the avian influenza virus — in the samples of dead birds from the poultry farm at College of Veterinary Science and Animal Husbandry under the OUAT on Monday.

Ratnakar Rout, director of the animal husbandry department, said altogether 922 birds, 4,631 eggs, 2,357 kg of poultry feed and other materials were disposed of by deep burial method. “We culled 922 birds inside the OUAT poultry farm using deep burial method. We had engaged seven rapid response teams (RRT),” he added.

The teams used lime and bleaching powder to disinfect and check further contamination, Rout said, adding that culling would continue on Wednesday.

The area within one-km radius of the OUAT poultry farm has been declared as the infected zone and area between one to 10 km zone declared as surveillance zone.

This apart, the RRT inspected private poultry within 1 km of the farm and culled 11 broiler chicks, 45 layer chicks, 859 layer adults and seven ducks. “Each owner has been given a compensation of Rs 20 per broiler chick, Rs 70 per broiler adult, Rs 20 per layer chicks and Rs 35 per duck,” Rout added.

The state has not provided any compensation for the birds at the OUAT farm because it is a government set-up.

Officials said the RRTs would inspect up to 10 km radius of the OUAT farm for possible H5N1 cases in birds from Wednesday

Prior to sending the samples, 1,500 birds died of the infection. “We have asked the OUAT to seal the poultry farm for now. We have appealed to the people not to panic,” a government official said.

Meanwhile, Nandankanan Zoo has temporarily closed the bird aviary of the zoo to prevent visitors from getting exposed to birds. “This is just a precautionary measure,” a zoo official said.

Visakhapatnam: If Visakhapatnam were to indeed become the executive capital , it will come as a boon for the boat tourism industry, say sources linked to the sector .

Currently, the city has only three boats and two scooter boats. Those in the business hope for the number to go up, to around 10, if the city is officially declared the executive capital of Andhra Pradesh.

Discussing the significance of the sector, TG Prasada Reddy, the Visakhapatnam divisional manager of Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (ATDC) said that boat tourism is one of the major revenue generators for the corporation.

Boating operations were suspended across the state since September 15, 2019, when a tourist boat— Royal Vasistha capsized in River Godavari. The operations resumed recently after new safety rules were introduced.

Prasad Reddy informed TOI that APTDCL incurred a loss of Rs 70 lakh in the five months in which boating operations remained suspended.

Under the new rules, every boat has to undergo a fitness test as well as a swamp test. Additionally, the new rules also call for training of all crew members and especially drivers at the National Institute of Water Sports (NIWS).

“Drivers of APTDC boats have received training at NIWS. The government has resumed boating operations of only those boats operated by the tourism corporation. It is yet to give permissions to private boat operators,” Prasad Reddy added.

Tourists too were reportedly miffed at the boating operations as boating at sea is one of the significant aspects of tourism itinerary.

“We earn an average of Rs 40,000 per day in the off season and Rs 1 lakh in the peak season. The next peak season begins in April,” the divisional manager informed.

Vadodara: The Raopura police have booked two persons including a doctor for duping a woman who is suffering from partial paralysis. Prashant Tailor, a resident of Kothi Crossroads, told the police that the accused duo took Rs 2 lakh from him for treating his sister Meeta.

According to the police, one of the accused identified as Raju had approached Meeta in October last year. Raju told her that he knows a doctor who can cure her of her paralysis. He claimed that he had paralysis and Dr Rehman Malik, who stays in Thane in Maharashtra, had cured him.

Meeta returned home and told Prashant about it. Prashant then called Raju who made the same claims to him before giving him mobile number of Malik. Prashant called up Malik who said that he will pay visit to his home to see Meeta. On October 28, 2019, Malik visited Meeta at her home and took out some blood drops. The accused then claimed that he can cure her. Malik demanded Rs 2.37 lakh for the treatment but later settled for Rs 2 lakh. Prashant gave him Rs 37,000 in cash and a cheque of Rs 1.15 lakh. Malik told him that he will send receipt and his visiting card later. But Malik never turned up for treatment and didn’t even call back. Prashant told the police that he kept calling Malik but the latter did not answer his calls and later blocked him.

Bhubaneswar: Continuing its crackdown on drug traffickers, the special task force (STF) of state crime branch on Tuesday arrested two persons and seized brown sugar worth nearly Rs 30 lakh.

The accused were identified as Sheikh Haider, 21, and Tanmay Bhuyan, 20, both residents of Balasore district. A sub-inspector (SI) was injured after he was allegedly assaulted by the accused during the arrest.

Crime branch’s additional director general Soumendra Priyadarshi termed the drug haul significant and said the STF had received specific inputs about the narcotics trade and raided a place near NH-16 in Balasore.

“Our personnel arrested the two persons, seized nearly 301 grams of brown sugar, Rs 2.22 lakh, three mobile phones, bank debit cards and other incriminating articles. Efforts are on to bust their illicit business network,” Priyadarshi said.

STF’s deputy inspector general Jay Narayan Pankaj said 19 drug peddlers had been arrested from different parts of the state in the past 20 days.

“Our force has been turning the heat on narcotics traders. Brown sugar weighing nearly 818 grams with market value of Rs 81 lakh was seized in different raids in the past 20 days. Nineteen people have been arrested so far from different places like Puri, Bhubaneswar, Balasore, Khurda, Angul, Pipili, Dhenkanal and Bhadrak,” Pankaj said.

An STF source said Balasore had earned the notoriety of being the safe haven of drug peddlers as most arrests were made in the district. An official said smugglers from neighbouring West Bengal normally supplied brown sugar to their associates in Balasore.

“We are in touch with West Bengal Police to trace the origins of the narcotics,” another STF officer said.

Taking its cue from STF, commissionerate police also recently launched a crackdown on drug traders. It arrested 105 drug peddlers between September 2019 and January 2020 (so far) and seized 1,302 grams of brown sugar worth nearly Rs 1.5 crore, said a police officer.

229,['29/01/2020'],Sunitha moves HC against SIT probe into Viveka murder,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Vivekananda

Vijayawada: In a fresh twist in the mysterious murder of ex-MP YS Vivekananda Reddy, his daughter Dr Sunitha Narreddy on Tuesday petitioned the AP high court questioning the SIT probe as well as raising doubts on the conduct of several persons, including her cousin and CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy. While she pressed for a CBI probe as sought by Jagan himself earlier, the AP government said that it was not required now as the SIT probe was at an advanced stage.

“The present CM YS Jaganmohan Reddy, who is none other than my cousin, had sought investigation by an independent agency like the CBI through his writ petition as well as through public demands and a representation to the governor... clearly expressing his lack of confidence in the state police. It has been eight months since he became CM but he has not made any request for a CBI probe. Moreover, there is absolutely no valid reason or justification for constitution/reconstitution of the second SIT,” she said.

Sunitha also raised doubts over the dilution of the SIT, which was originally headed by an additional director-general (ADG) of police but is now supervised by the district superintendent of police. She sought to know the reasons for changing the members of SIT and Abhishek Mohanty, who headed the SIT, going on long leave.

Finding fault with the SIT for not including all the persons registered for erasing evidence from the crime scene, Sunitha said YS Avinash Reddy, MP, YS Prakash Reddy, YS Manohar Reddy, YS Pratap Reddy, Dr YS Abhishek Reddy, D Shivashankar Reddy, Uday Kumar Reddy, Dr Nayak, Prakash Reddy, Dr Madhusudhan Reddy, Narreddy Jagadeeswar Reddy, Yerra Gangi Reddy, YS Joseph Reddy, Ramakrishna Reddy, YS Madhusudhan Reddy, Shankaraiah, Ramakrishna Reddy and Srinivas Reddy were all present at the time of cleaning the bloodstains and wrapping the wounds with bandages. She also named Inayatullah, Ranganna, Lakshmamma, EC Surendra Reddy, Prakash and MV Krishna Reddy.

Sunitha also alleged that the suicide of K Srinivas Reddy, brother-in-law of Parameswar Reddy, on September 2, 2019, was in fact a murder as the post-mortem report stated that blood was found in hepatorenal pouch. Sunitha, who is a doctor, said that the blood in the pouch could be of some internal or external injury. This gave enough room to suspect that he was murdered by forcibly administering poison and the murder was staged as suicide, she claimed.

Referring to Rangaiah, the watchman present on the fateful night, she expressed doubts as to how he did not hear any noise as evidently her father had tried hard to resist the killers.

She said that Uday Kumar Reddy and Madhusudhan Reddy were first taken into custody on the instructions of then SIT chief Abhishek Mohanty but were were let off after several calls were made before they reached Kadapa. After that incident, Mohanty went on long leave and his exit from the investigation speaks volumes, she said.

Pressing her case for a CBI inquiry, she told the high court that the SIT was nowhere close to cracking the case despite 10 months and sequence of events suggested that leaders from both ruling and opposition parties were not willing to reveal the names of real culprits.

When the HC questioned the government pleader why the case can’t be handed over to CBI as both sides were asking for the same, he said that SIT investigation was at an advanced stage and hence a CBI inquiry was not necessary. The HC posted the matter to February 6 after government’s counsel sought additional time as the advocate general was not available and two more counters were yet to be filed in the case.

CLEARED SKHER

Nashik: The Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) is set to roll out the city bus service despite reservations regarding the financial burden it might put on the civic body.

The city mayor had meeting with the group leaders of all parties in NMC to discuss the issue and inform them about the present status of the city bus service project. The mayor clearly told them that despite the reservations, the NMC is going ahead with the project.

“We have decided to go ahead with our plan to roll out the city bus service project by April end this year. District guardian minister Chhagan Bhujbal has also told us that he is not against the bus service project,” said mayor Satish Kulkarni.

Kulkarni added that the project was at an advanced stage and it would not be possible to roll it back now. “The agreements have been signed with contractors and NMC will have to compensate 80% of the total project cost if we cancel the project,” he said.

The opposition parties — Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress — have demanded a white paper on the city bus service project. The leader of the opposition in NMC, Ajay Boraste of Shiv Sena, opposed the city bus service project.

“Not a single public transport project in the world is in profit. The city bus service project will incur heavy losses. We want the civic body to release white paper on the revenue NMC will earn and losses it will incur, if at all, through this project,” Boraste said.

NCP group leader Gajanan Shelar alleged that the group leaders were not informed about the agenda of the meeting on Tuesday. The mayor also did not take any suggestions from the group leaders and was adamant on rolling out the city bus service, he said. Congress group leader Shahu Khaire also reiterated the same.

“We were informed that NMC will incur Rs 54 crore loss per annum due to city bus service project. In fact, NMC may incur losses over Rs 120 crore per annum due to the project. The mayor and the BJP will be responsible for the losses,” said Shelar.

NMC plans to operate 150 electric, 200 CNG and 50 diesel buses for city transport. The contractors will purchase, operate and maintain the buses for a period of 10 years and the NMC will pay them on kilometre basis.

During a meeting at Mumbai, Bhujbal had cautioned that the project could put huge financial burden on NMC. He had also told the mayor to conduct a meeting with all the party group leaders to discuss the future of the bus service project.

231,['29/01/2020'],Disturbed Areas Act: Gujarat high court notice over deal cancellation,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday issued notice to the state government over a petition complaining that the state authorities cancelled the registration of a property under the Disturbed Areas Act, though the property does not fall in the area notified under the law.

The Gujarat Prohibition of Transfer of Immovable Property and Provision of Tenants from Evication from Premises in Disturbed Areas Act (The Disturbed Areas Act) prohibits the sale and purchase of any property falling in an area notified under this law, without permission from the district collectorate.

The case in question pertains to the Danilimda area of Ahmedabad, and the petitioner is Nazir Ahmed Diwan, a tailor, living in Vatva. He had bought a 12-square-metre shop in Danilimda in January 2011 from two brothers, Badruddin Munshi and Rashiduddin Munshi. He got the sale deed registered on March 28, 2011.

Later, a resident of Shah-e-Alam, Mohammed Siddik Shaikh complained before the deputy collector (East) that the registration of the property bought by Diwan was illegal because he had not obtained the mandatory permission from the authority under Section 5(1) of the Disturbed Areas Act before the purchase. The deputy collector straightaway cancelled the registration and held the transfer of property null and void. Diwan has been using the shop since 2011.

On cancellation of the registration of property in his name, Diwan filed an appeal before the secretary against the deputy collector’s decision. He claimed that the property does not fall under the area notified under the Disturbed Areas Act. The secretary rejected his appeal on December 6, 2017.

Diwan moved the HC last month and argued that the notification issued earmarking the disturbed area was not properly appreciated by the authorities. He asserted that the property does not fall in the area. Diwan also told the HC that he had later filed a criminal case against the officials, who registered the transfer of the property after telling him that the property does not fall in a disturbed area. He urged the HC to quash the secretary’s order and regularize the registration of the sale deed.

The high court will hear this case further on February 18.

Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami

CHENNAI: Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami has slapped two criminal defamation complaints on opposition leader and DMK president M K Stalin for his alleged defamatory statements against him.

Moving the complaints on behalf of the CM before the principal sessions court here, city public prosecutor (CPP) Gowri Ashokan wanted the judge to initiate proceedings for criminal defamation against Stalin.

According to the complaints, Stalin had questioned the decision of the Union government in declaring Tamil Nadu the leading state in the good governance index. Stalin said the fact that the BJP government at the Centre wants to prop up the AIADMK government with such ranking shows their close relations and raises suspicion that their relationship is beyond just being alliance partners, the CPP said. The opposition leader questioned the rationale of the decision when there were issues like the Pollachi rape cases, killing of protesters during the Sterlite protests and the state ranking second in the rape of minors. The statement was published in DMK’s ‘Murasoli’ on January 28, she added. In the second complaint, the CPP alleged that in another statement Stalin condemned the government for arresting six people who indulged in Kolam protest against Citizenship Amendment Act in Chennai. The alleged defamatory statement was published in ‘Murasoli’ on December 30.

Since the statements were highly defamatory and not made in good faith, the same constitutes criminal defamation under Sections 499 and 500 of IPC, the prosecutor said.

After that incident, Mohanty went on long leave and his exit from the investigation speaks volumes, she said.Pressing her case for a CBI inquiry, she told the high court that the SIT was nowhere close to cracking the case despite 10 months and sequence of events suggested that leaders from both ruling and opposition parties were not willing to reveal the names of real culprits.When the HC questioned the government pleader why the case can’t be handed over to CBI as both sides were asking for the same, he said that SIT investigation was at an advanced stage and hence a CBI inquiry was not necessary. The HC posted the matter to February 6 after government’s counsel sought additional time as the advocate general was not available and two more counters were yet to be filed in the case.",vijayawada,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73716989,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-115346,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/viveks-daughtermoves-hc-againfor-cbi-probe/articleshow/73709102.cms

AHMEDABAD: The AMC has slapped a fine of Rs 2 lakh on the Ahmedabad Education Society (AES) which manages the J Block on the Gujarat University (GU) campus. The fine was issued for mosquito breeding in the area.

An AMC team raided the area on Tuesday and found mosquito breeding in the block which houses students of LM Pharmacy. Some of the students had approached the GU authorities in this connection but the problem persisted.

Kamlesh Patel, a member of the AMC team, said that the solid waste department and the malaria department had issued separate notices to the AES and asked them to resolve the issue and clean the campus within seven days. “We will again inspect the block on Thursday after which the final call will be taken,” he said.

Officials said that the authorities have been warned that if the problem continued, they will seal the hostel block. Students refusing to be quoted said that drainage water has been overflowing, and they had made several requests. “When we failed to get any response from the authorities, the issue was raised before the media,” said a student.

AES authorities, when contacted, said this is a small incident.

238,['29/01/2020'],MPs with poor Parliament performance asked to pull up socks,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Days ahead of the Budget session of Parliament, an assessment carried out by the BJD shows that the performance of its women MPs have not been satisfactory when it comes to proceedings in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Some of the BJD MPs have barely participated in proceedings like question hour and important debates or moved private member’s bill, found the party’s performance tracking system for the last Budget session (June-August, 2019).

On Tuesday BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik asked the MPs to improve their performance in the forthcoming Budget session of Parliament. Sources said as many as six Lok Sabha MPs and one Rajya Sabha MP has been asked to improve their performance.

Naveen, who had earlier asked MPs to submit performance report every two months, separately met those whose performance was not up to the mark. “The MPs have also been instructed to work in close coordination with the chief minister’s office,” a party insider said.

Aska MP Pramila Bisoyi, who started her political journey from a very humble background, has 100 per cent attendance in the House. But none of her questions were listed as starred question. The performance tracker said she had spoken only twice during the Budget session while 10 of her questions were listed unstarred.

Similarly, not a single question of Jagatsinghpur MP Rajashree Mallick, a doctor-turned-politician, was listed as starred or unstarred categories while Mallik has participated in only four debates. Mallick has 63 per cent attendance.

Starred questions are the ones for which an oral answer is expected. Unstarred questions are the ones where the reply is in written form.

Despite 75.5 per cent attendance, Keonjhar’s Chandrani Murmu, one of the youngest MPs in the country, did not participate in the question hour of the Budget session. She took part in only five debates. Jajpur MP Sarmistha Sethi and Bhadrak MP Manjulata Mandal were also asked to improve their performance in Parliament.

When contacted, Sethi said there was a general instruction from the chief minister to all the new MPs to improve their performance by actively participating in proceedings. Besides the women leaders, the name of former Union minister and Berhampur MP Chandrasekhar Sahu has been identified for poor attendance.

“As far as my attendance is concerned, I had gone to the US after taking permission from the party president as my daughter was unwell. The chief minister has asked the MPs to actively participate in debates and to raise questions regarding the state’s interest,” Sahu said. Among the Rajya Sabha members, Narendra Swain’s performance has been found unsatisfactory.

Among the MPs with better performance are BJD leader in Lok Sabha Pinaki Mishra, Bhartruhari Mahtab, Achyuta Samanta and Rajya Sabha members Sasmit Patra and Amar Patnaik.

Mishra said the performance of MPs is being directly monitored by the chief minister. “All the members have been given a performance chart. Specific instruction has been given by the chief minister that the MPs and MLAs of the party should work in close coordination for better delivery of services to the people,” Mishra said.

Bareilly: Moradabad police have filed an FIR against seven women who were staging protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) near Moradabad-Aligarh highway here. The women were sitting on protest holding placards and demanding government to take back its decision of implementing CAA.

The women agitators were raising slogans against government, demanding rollback of CAA, NRC. A police team reached the spot to talk to the women agitators, but most of them had left the area.”

SP city added, “Despite section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) enforced, women had gathered and staged the ‘dharna’ without taking permission from the district administration which is violation of the law.”

Moradabad’s additional superintendent of police (ASP), Deepak Bhuker said, “As soon as a police team reached the spot, the protest was discontinued and women had left. The women who were participating in the agitation are probably the residents of Karula and adjacent areas.

241,['29/01/2020'],Gujarat: ‘Government hospitals now compete with private ones on quality’,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Representative image

AHMEDABAD: There is a wrong perception that medicines being provided free of cost to patients in government-run hospitals lack quality, said health commissioner Jai Prakash Shivahare. He was speaking at a regional seminar on “Availability, accessibility and affordability of medicines for all”, which was held in Ahmedabad on Tuesday.

Stating that government hospitals are now competing with private hospitals to provide quality healthcare, Shivahare said that Gujarat has the third largest number of drugs on the essential drug list (EDL). The government, through Gujarat Medical Services Corporation Ltd ( GMSCL ) procures medicines from pharmaceutical companies through a bidding process and provides these free of cost to patients of lower socio-economic sections under schemes of the central and state governments.

“Quality of drugs remains a challenge. I think it is more of a perception that drugs available through EDL list lack in quality. We want to change that perception. We are also very keen that all the good companies should also participate in the bidding process. We have some of the best pharmaceutical companies in Gujarat,” Shivahare said.

Stating that the government intended to provide a level playing field to new and established companies, Shivahare stated that there is a need to change the perception that quality drugs cannot be provided to the public health system. “We want to organize a meeting with various stake holders. Why some good companies are not participating in the bidding process that is being run by GMSCL. If they are having any difficulty, we would like to address those issues also. We want the best brands also to compete for supplying to the public health system,” he said.

Principal secretary, health, Jayanti Ravi sought inputs from pharma companies on the issue, saying that their feedback will help the government in making policy changes if required. “We wanted to interact with all of you and see how we can make our process of pricing, the process of bidding, all of this more transparent and allow for good quality. And at the same time, if the volume is huge, we can certainly have a very competitive price as well. We can definitely reconcile quantity and price as well without compromising on quality,” she said.

PMRU opened in Gujarat: The Gujarat unit of Price Monitoring and Resource Unit (PMRU) was inaugurated on Tuesday by National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) chairman Shubra Singh in Ahmedabad. Gujarat has become the tenth state in the country to set up a PMRU. The unit will track violations of prices of essential drugs and medical devices under the Drugs Price Control Order (DPCO).

Lucknow: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has now used the occasion of the government conferring the Padma Shri on singer Adnan Sami to question the rationale behind the new citizenship law.

Two days after the prestigious award for Sami was announced, Mayawati said on Tuesday: “When Bharatiya Janata Party can give citizenship and Padma Shri to Pakistani origin singer Adnan Sami, then why cannot it give shelter to Muslims who are being victimised in Pakistan, like it is doing with Hindus, Sikhs, Christians under the CAA. It would be better for the Centre to reconsider this law.”

The BSP chief, who has been a vocal opponent of the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC, has further appealed to the UP government to take back cases filed against protesters during widespread agitations in the state last month. “The UP government should take back all the fake cases filed against protesters, especially women, who have stood against the CAA and NRC. The government should also provide suitable help to the families of those who died during the protests,” she said.

AHMEDABAD: The Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS) chairman, Atul Bhavsar, has proposed a common schedule for the AMTS and the Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS). The aim is to reduce congestion on roads and ensure that ensure that buses of both services are available to commuters at an optimal frequency.

AMTS buses were recently prohibited from using the BRTS corridor, leading to congestion in the mixed traffic lanes. Bhavsar, while presenting his budget for 2020-2021, suggested that a common schedule for both BRT and AMTS be drawn up.

Bhavsar said, “There should be two fares, one for AMTS which has non-air-conditioned buses and the other for the AC buses operated by the BRTS. The BRTS plans add a lot more buses to its fleet, and these will be forced to use the mixed traffic lane. These will eat into passenger traffic of both AMTS and BRTS. To ensure that passengers get proper service, the AMC, the parent organisation of both these services, has to integrate them and ensure that they have a common timetable instead of running parallel to each other.”

Bhavsar said this will ensure better and timely services. Those who want to use AC buses will use them, others will will use non-AC buses.

A senior AMC officer said this was the AMC’s original plan when BRTS was launched. “It was decided that the AMTS would be a feeder service to the BRTS and not run parallel to it. It was also planned to have common tickets for both. But this not implemented and even one decade later, the AMC has not been able to issue common tickets.”

The officer said that the 10 years later, the situation is that both services managed by the AMC are not only making operation losses, but are competing with each other.

Bhavsar said that AMTS is facing operating losses of Rs 99 crore in buses run by private contractors, besides the 130-odd buses AMTS operates itself.

246,['29/01/2020'],"State govt transfers IAS officer, triggers speculation","This story is from January 29, 2020

Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government on Monday transferred Information Technology secretary Santhosh Babu and posted him as chairman and managing director of Tamil Nadu Handicrafts Development Corporation, a post of which he was holding additional charge since September. Rural Development and Panchayat Raj secretary Hans Raj Varma will now hold additional charge of Information Technology.

Santhosh Babu’s transfer comes in the wake of reports that he had sought voluntary retirement last week and later withdrew it. The transfer assumes significance given the controversial high-cost tender floated by his department in December to provide broadband connectivity to all 12,524 villages. The state government secured the approval of the Centre for the estimated Rs 1,815.31 crore project. Amid reports of ‘pressure’ to favour some bidders, the officer sent a letter to chief secretary K Shanmugam via email last week seeking voluntary retirement and sent another mail two days later, seeking its withdrawal, said a senior official, on condition of anonymity. Santhosh Babu went on leave last week.

Close associates said the senior officer gave shape to Tamil Nadu FibreNet Corporation (Tanfinet), a special purpose vehicle, floated for implementing the Centre’s ambitious BharatNet project to link all 2.5 lakh village panchayats in the country with broadband connectivity. Tanfinet was picked as the agency that will implement the project covering all villages in Tamil Nadu. “He not only worked from the beginning to help implement the project in Tamil Nadu, he also visited New Delhi to attend meetings to get it going,” sources said. The state will soon launch TamilNet to connect all urban local bodies, but without Santhosh Babu to oversee the final roll out. “It is unfortunate that a go-getter like Santhosh was shifted out and additional charge given to rural development secretary, whose hands are already full,” said an official, not willing to be named.

The state government transferred Tanfinet MD M S Shanmugam and posted him as commissioner of museums. D Ravichandran, home, prohibition and excise department deputy secretary, is the new Tanfinet managing director. Hans Raj Varma holds additional charge of special programme implementation department that takes care of welfare schemes. He held additional charge of Sidco (Small Industries Development Corporation) and registration department in 2017 and 2019.

Ahmedabad: A 41-year-old member of an OBC community, Vinodkumar Mandaliya, was booked by Meghaninagar police on Tuesday on charges of abetment of suicide and under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, after his wife, Priti Vaghela, who came from an SC community, hanged herself at their house in Meghaninagar on Sunday.

According to the complaint filed by the deceased’s brother, Dilip Vaghela, Mandaliya had been physically and verbally abusing Priti for the past two years, ever since their wedding. The accused had been using casteist slurs to abuse and torment Priti, which ultimately drove her to commit suicide.

After her first husband, Vijay Kumar, died due to illness, Priti lived with her brother, a sanitation worker, and other family members. She then fell in love with Mandaliya after they met at a sewing class near Bapunagar. Mandaliya’ daughter from his previous marriage also lived with the couple.

“Mandaliya’s daughter was going around with a boy and when Mandaliya came to know about this, he accused my sister of not properly caring for his daughter and began harassing and abusing her,” the complainant stated.

He said that in October 2019, his sister left Mandaliya and came to their house because Mandaliya was using casteist slurs against her and beat her up very often.

The family members, however, convinced Priti to return to her marital home, hoping that things would improve. On January 26, the complainant said that he was informed by Mandaliya that Priti had committing suicide by hanging herself at their house.

Meghaninagar police registered a complaint and began an investigation in the case.

Coimbatore: Housing units in Manchester Sitara that used to handover segregated waste to the city corporation are convincing residents to pay Rs 85 a month for service providers to do it.

The civic body is discriminating between individual houses and group houses, and is promoting new service providers, thereby burdening residents unnecessarily, members of the resident welfare association said.

Two months ago, the corporation had announced that it would not collect garbage even if segregated from apartments and gated communities that generate more than 100kg waste a day. It took the decision after the solid waste management rules of 2016 banned collecting garbage from bulk generators.

“The letters communicating the decision sent by the corporation had contact information of four service providers, who can collect segregated garbage,” said K Senthil Kumar, secretary of the federation of group housing. “Left with no option, we brought in a service provider, who charges Rs 85 per month. While the amount might seem small, it is a service that the corporation used to provide for free. What if the service providers increase the fee as we are totally dependent on them?”

The federation of group housing is now planning to take up the issue legally. “The service providers collect the garbage, but we don’t know if they are recycling it or just dumping it somewhere. We plan to complain to the ministers and move court if required,” said Kumar.

Consumer activists also blamed the corporation. “It is a civic body’s basic duty to collect and dispose garbage. Like drinking water, they are trying to privatise this also. Next, they will ask residents to manage streetlights, roads and drainage,” said C Jayaraman of Citizen’s Voice Club.

Agreed Singanallur-based Rathina Devi, secretary of an apartment’s welfare association. “Where do the older apartments have space for composting? We have no space for even a garden. If we compost near a park, the residents near the park will fight with us,” she told TOI.

K Kathirmathiyon of Coimbatore Consumer Cause said the corporation is discriminating between individual houses and apartments. “What is the difference? Just that individual houses are in a horizontal line on a street, but apartments are in a vertical line. If the corporation does not have the infrastructure to handle garbage from so many houses, why give permission to construct them,” he said. “Also, if the corporation is recommending service providers, it should also pay the service charge and not burden residents.”

The service providers recommended by the corporation are mainly logistics providers. “We collect segregated garbage from people, further segregate it and then transport it to recyclers and composters,” said Suresh Bandari of Unwaste.

A Sundaraj, founder of H Adhira Recycleaning, admitted that the firm only collects segregated waste, further segregate it into 22 categories and transport it to users. “We send food waste to pig farms, non-recyclable waste to a cement factory and sell recyclable waste like paper, rubber and coconut shells,” he said. Sundaraj charges apartments around Rs 3 to Rs 3.5 per kilogram.

Meanwhile, corporation authorities said they are just following the solid waste management rule. “According to the rule, bulk waste generators should be able to dispose their waste within their compound,” a senior official said. “Why should Vellalore residents bear the burden of living with the waste generated by lakhs of residents across the city? When we offered to set up micro composting centres in parks, residents in the surrounding areas complained and stopped the project,” he said. “Only if someone has to handle their own waste, will they reduce waste generation. That’s the idea behind the rule.”

HYDERABAD: An 80-year-old woman was killed, her body dragged for some distance and dumped near her daughter’s house by robbers in Rangareddy’s Kandukur mandal late on Monday night. Police said the unidentified assailants took away Rs 1.2 lakh worth jewellery.

On Tuesday morning, Kandukur police received a complaint from Sargari Venkat Reddy (65) that his mother Sargari Balamani was found murdered in their village Nedunur. Venkat told cops that his brother-in-law M Anji Reddy, who lives close to Balamani’s house, had informed him about his mother’s death. Nedunur is about 50 km from Hyderabad.

Cops said they were looking at CCTV footage in the area to identify the gang behind the crime.

“The assailants throttled Balamani and dropped her body near her daughter’s house. There were marks on the road indicating that the victim’s body was dragged forcefully from an open area. We suspect that Balamani might have stepped out to attend nature’s call when the assailants targeted her,” Kandukur inspector E Jangaiah said.

After killing her they took her bangles and earrings, leaving scratch marks on her hands and bleeding injury on her right ear. In all, six tola ornaments, including two gold chains and earrings, and 10 tola silver bangles were stolen. “The value of the ornaments is Rs 1.2 lakh,” the inspector said.

Balamani was last seen sitting near the house of G Mallamma close to Syndicate Bank in the village on Monday evening. A murder for gain case was registered. Balamani’s family owns seven acres in the village and her son Venkat resides in Raji Reddy Nagar Colony in Champapet, Hyderabad, cops said.

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court on Tuesday issued notice to the Centre, the Reserve Bank of India and the united forum of bank unions over a PIL filed by traders opposing the proposed strikes by public sector bank employees later this week.

According to petitioner’s advocate Rashmin Jani, the high court has sought reply from the authorities on Thursday and posted further hearing the same day.

Gujarat Traders Federation along with other traders’ federations approached the HC and filed a PIL a few days after employees of public sector banks announced a two-day strike for January 31 and February 1. The traders have claimed that such repetitive strike calls by bank employees and officers cause severe problems for trade and industry bodies in carrying out financial transactions.

The traders’ bodies highlighted that the bank employees have also given a call for a three-day strike in March, and have threatened indefinite strike from April 1 onwards, if their demands over wage-revision and recruitments are not accepted.

In their PIL the traders’ federation submitted, “Such illegal strikes would cause huge financial losses to the nation and strictest actions are proposed to be taken against the employees who support strikes.” It was also submitted that people would suffer due to these bank strikes as it is estimated that bank transactions amounting to Rs 21,000 crore would be stalled across the country and Rs 12,000 crore would not be taking place in Gujarat alone.

COIMBATORE: MLA Amman K Arjunan on Tuesday handed over 50 new stretchers to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH). Earlier, the Coimbatore South MLA had ordered 100 stretchers for the hospital at a cost of Rs 15 lakh, which was spend from his MLA fund.

“While 50 stretchers arrived today (Tuesday), the remaining 50 will arrive within the next one month,” said Dr B Ashokan, hospital dean.

Once the hospital receives the next batch of 50, it will have a total of 250 stretchers. The new stretchers come with better breaks and provisions to hold large oxygen cylinder, ensuring patients’ comfort while being shifted.

“The new ones to arrive will have large wheelbases to facilitate smooth movement on rough or hard surfaces,” the officer said.

With just 150 stretchers, the hospital, which has more than 1,000 inpatients at any point of time, used to struggle earlier to transfer patients from one building to another for scans, dialysis treatments, tests and surgeries, among others. “The new addition will make work smoother,” the hospital dean said.

254,['29/01/2020'],Supreme Court asks Gujarat government to frame policy for use of commercial parking space,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Supreme Court

SURAT: Many vehicle owners , grappling with parking issues , heaved a sigh of relief because Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the state government to frame a policy whereby parking in malls, hospitals and schools can be used in night by residents of concerned residential area on payment. Thus, if a private car owner, who lives near VR Mall on Surat-Dumas Road, wants to park his car in the mall during night time, he can do so now by paying some charges to the owners. Justice Deepak Gupta and Justice Aniruddha Bose on January 27 gave this order in a special leave petition filed by Rahul Raj Mall Co-operative Service Society (RRMCSS) of Surat. The matter will now come up on March 2, the bench said, adding that its interim order will continue.

The petitioner had challenged Gujarat high court order of July 2019 which had held that the present laws in Gujarat do not allow private malls, multiplexes and commercial complexes to levy parking charges. The high court’s division bench struck down a single judge’s order which had said that the malls and shopping centres should offer free parking to visitors for the first hour. The single judge had also asked malls and multiplexes to charge nominally from visitors for the day after the first hour of parking- Rs10 for two-wheelers and Rs30 for four-wheelers.

Kumar Trivedi, advocate for RRMCSS, said, “The issue of vehicle parking during night time is complex in major cities of the country. In some cities, including Surat, vehicles are parked on society roads obstructing the path of ambulances and fire vehicles. This is right step because it will keep vital roads open for movement of emergency vehicles.”

RRMCSS annually pays up Rs4.75 crore, a portion of pay and park charges to Surat Municipal Corporation . It had submitted that Rs30 for four-wheelers for night after a free hour and Rs10 for two-wheelers as charges be allowed. Trivedi said, “If the state government comes up with a parking policy together with charges, we will welcome it.”

LUCKNOW: The high court has directed Lucknow municipal commissioner to ensure removal of dairies from municipal limits within a month.

A bench of Justice PK Jaiswal and Justice KS Pawar passed the order on the petition moved by local lawyer Rahul Srivastava.

In compliance of an earlier direction, municipal commissioner Indramani Tripathi appeared before the court and informed it that there were 1,038 dairies running in the city.

Many FIRs had also been lodged. However, 180 dairies had made their way back in the municipal limit.

With the court expressing concern on the remaining dairies in the city, Tripathi assured it they would be gone soon. However, he sought more time, owing to the Defence Expo, saying that police would be available only thereafter.

Granting time to the commissioner, the bench directed him to take necessary steps.

BAREILLY: A 26-year-old married woman, who was allegedly sexually harassed by four neighbours a month ago, was found hanging from a tree in Faridpur area of Bareilly district .

The incident took place on Monday night. On December 24, the woman had lodged a complaint at Faridpur police station against the four accused, but the family claimed that the police didn’t take any action.

On Tuesday, the victim’s husband filed a complaint, but the police are yet to file an FIR in this matter.

The victim's husband sells snacks on a cart and the couple used to live in a rented house in Faridpur.

The four accused, who live in the same locality, often used to harass the woman and her husband, who was also thrashed by them in December.

“We were repeatedly harassed by the four people. Since we came from outside (Shahjahanpur), none of the locals came to support us. Even when the police came for questioning, the villagers favoured the accused, which gave them more liberty. The police didn't bother to file FIR even once,” the victim’s husband said.

“The accused again misbehaved with my wife while she was going to market to buy vegetables on Monday. They chased her, misbehaved with her in the market and also pulled her ‘dupatta’ and later they killed her at an abandoned place and hanged her body. My wife was murdered due to the negligence of the police,” the victim’s husband added.

SHO, Faridpur police station, Dhananjay Singh told TOI, “We are registering an FIR against the four people for murder. The autopsy report will confirm the reason behind the woman's death. A police team had dealt with the earlier complaints of the victim’s family and filed complaints based on their findings. We will ensure that all the accused are arrested soon.”

Ahmedabad police did not get any instructions on implementing the helmet rule and punish the two-wheeler rider... Read More

By: Meghna Singh and Nandini Didwania

AHMEDABAD: The state government had on Monday stated on oath before the Gujarat high court that no relaxation has been given from wearing helmet, the ground reality is altogether different.

The city police did not get any instructions on implementing the helmet rule and punish the two-wheeler riders caught riding without the head gear.

The city traffic police personnel are still advising the people to wear helmet. On the other hand, some of the people are still not ready to accept the norm of wearing helmet giving various excuses.

“Though we are not imposing fines on people for not wearing helmets , they should wear it. It is our duty to make sure everyone on the road is safe,” said a traffic cop.

DCP, traffic (west), Ajit Rajian, said that he could not comment over the issue as the case is subjudice before the high court. “But we want people to wear the helmet because it is for their safety only,” stressed Rajian.

DCP, traffic (admin), Tejas Patel, too reiterated that the case was pending with the high court so he would not comment over the issue. On the government’s statement in the court, Patel said, “We would take instructions from the government on implementation of the helmet rule.”

The state government had on Monday stated in its affidavit in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) that it had not issued any notification relaxing the rule regarding safety headgear for two-wheeler riders.

The PIL contended that the government’s announcement to relax the helmet rule was a violation of Section 129 of the recently amended motor vehicle act.

Not only did the government assert that it had not relaxed the compulsory helmets rule, its advocate pointed out that in 2015, it amended the state rules and made helmets mandatory for pillion riders as well. The state government made this clarification after the much-touted announcement by the state cabinet on December 5, that the mandatory helmets rule was “temporarily” relaxed in municipal areas.

TimesView People invest their life’s savings to buy the dream home. Therefore, it’s grave injustice if they are made to wait for years to get the possession of the house. Civic bodies like Lucknow Development Authorities need to be more sensitive towards this issue and must ensure timely allotment of the houses constructed by them to the buyers. This would also help them win the faith of buyers for future projects as credibility holds the key.

All allottees will get their housing units by the end of February.”According to LDA officials, the matter got stuck between planning and finance departments which led to delay.

HYDERABAD: Even as India grapples with the growing influence of China in the subcontinent, a Hyderabad-based start-up is helping replace ‘made in China’ electric-rickshaws ( e-ricks ) with its own sturdy ‘swadeshi’ brand. Gayam Motor Works is slowly making inroads into the Himalayan nation and replacing Chinese three-wheelers in Butwal, Bhairahawa, Biratnagar and Birgunj.

Not just Nepal, the start-up claims to be the first Indian EV player to drive into the UK. Gayam Motor Works CEO Raja Gayam told TOI that in last six months 20 EVs were exported to the UK where they are being used in and around Manchester.

The home-grown start-up has bagged an order to replace 700 Chinese e-ricks with its Urban ET-Passenger SmartAuto. Gayam had sent its e-ricks for trial run to Nepal around eight months ago, following which it bagged the order and has already exported 60 units. Two of its models are being used at the famed Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu to ferry pilgrims.

Patancheru plant to ramp up production

The main issue with Chinese e-ricks is that if roads are bad, they cannot travel at more than 25kmph. Their suspension is bad. But our vehicles can be driven at 50-55 kmph even on bad roads and are comfortable for use,” Raja said, adding their vehicles, once charged, can run for up to 110 km.

Currently, Gayam Motors has an overall order book of 5,000 units, of which 1,500 are from Nepal, Japan, Lebanon and the UK. It has also applied for certification in Europe that it expects to get in about a month, following which it will be shipping its vehicles for trial in Spain, Germany and France.

In order to meet the demand for EVs, the company is also set to ramp up the manufacturing capacity at its Patancheru plant from around 80 units per month to 250 over the next four months. In India, 700 of its e-vehicles are plying on the roads of Hyderabad and Bengaluru, where they are used mainly by e-commerce companies for lastmile deliveries. Some of e-commerce biggies using Gayam’s vehicles include BigBasket, Amazon, Gofers and Flipkart.

Keri: Following the death of four tigers at the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in Sattari, the state’s forest officials have heightened vigilance to protect the three other tigers that are known to be present in the sanctuary’s forests.

“Our staff, along with trekkers, are patrolling the area and monitoring the movements of tigers in the forests of the sanctuary daily,” deputy conservator of forests (wildlife division) Vikas Desai told TOI.

During combing operations, forests officials said they spotted one tiger. Deputy conservator of forests (North Goa territory division) Kuldeep Sharma visited Derode and collected evidence of tiger presence.

“There are three tigers roaming in the forests of the Mhadei region of Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Last year, camera traps captured two tigers inside the private forests in Maharashtra bordering Goa and Karnataka. Recently, people have sighted these tigers late at night. The forest department has to plan a strategy to protect these three tigers,” wildlifer Vitthal Shelke, who frequently visits the Mhadei forests, said.

“Our officials are monitoring tiger movement in the Tillari valley. I visited Golauli in Sattari and we are eager to help the Goa forest department in the protection of the tigers,” deputy conservator of forests, Sawantwadi, Samadhan Chavan, told TOI. Recently, tigers killed a cow in Derode and a buffalo in Surla. The Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary shares its borders with the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka.

The National Wildlife Survey of 2015-16 had found seven tigers in the Bhimgad Sanctuary. As per pugmark evidence and photographs captured by sensor cameras, tiger numbers had gone up to 12 in 2017.

Recent evidence collected by forest officials of the Bhimgad sanctuary in December 2019 revealed the presence of 16 tigers. The Goa forest department has installed 40 camera traps to monitor tigers in the Mhadei forest region.

Surat: Spread of coronavirus in China are making Surat diamantaires worried. They aren’t as frightened for the infection itself than they are from the prospect of exports of polished diamond getting hit by the outbreak.

The anti-government protests in Hong Kong and the US-China trade war has already impacted the polished diamond exports from India to Hong Kong. With annual export of gems and jewellery pegged at over $12 billion, which includes over $10 billion worth of polished diamonds, Hong Kong is the world’s second largest export market for India after the US.

Majority of the exports of polished diamonds to China is done via Hong Kong and now coronavirus may dent consumer demand, said Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC), resulting in the dip in exports.

Vice-chairman of GJEPC, Colin Shah told TOI, “China is the world’s second largest diamond jewellery market after US. The outbreak will impact consumer demand, resulting in decline in export of polished diamonds.”

Shah further said that India was expecting to do good business after the Hong Kong market started to recover from a break in the violent anti-government protests there. “However, with the virus threat looming large, we fear that demand for diamonds may diminish,” he said.

According to the GJEPC, the export of polished diamonds to Hong Kong declined 8.45% at $7.41 billion from $8.09 billion between April-December-2019.

Industry sources said Chinese consumers are purchasing diamonds between 30 cents to 2 carats, whereas the U.S consumers are buying jewellery of the diamonds in small sizes below 30 cents.

Managing director of Dharmanandan Diamonds Private Limited, Hitesh Patel said, “Market looked bright in Hong Kong and China after the US-China trade war and long-standing anti-government protests slowed down. However, now we have a virus to combat. We have asked our employees in Hong Kong not to visit China till things settle down.”

267,['29/01/2020'],India may invite Australia for Malabar naval exercise with US &amp; Japan,"This story is from January 29, 2020

NEW DELHI: India is considering inviting Australia to take part in its trilateral Malabar naval exercise with the US and Japan this year, which if it happens will mark the first time the “Quad” countries will come together for the high-voltage combat manoeuvers on the high seas after a gap of 13 years.

There is “a move by India to include Australia” in the 24th Malabar exercise, which will be held in the Bay of Bengal in July-August after the monsoons, but “the final decision is yet be taken”, said sources on Tuesday.

Australian diplomatic sources, on being contacted by TOI, said, “We have a very strong bilateral defence relationship with India. We would be glad to consider all opportunities to engage with the Indian military”. An Australian warship, Anzac-class frigate HMAS Toowoomba, incidentally, is also currently in Mumbai on a four-day visit.

The move to include Australia in Malabar, if it actually translates into reality, will come after India also agreed last year to upgrade the “Quad” dialogue to the foreign minister-level from the earlier joint secretary-level meetings. On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last September, the four ministers had discussed shared interests in building a free, open and stable Indo-Pacific, with an eye firmly on an aggressive and expansionist China.

India, of course, will have to keep the “China factor” in mind. China had strongly objected to the India-US Malabar exercise in the Bay of Bengal in 2007 when it was expanded to include Japan, Australia and Singapore as well, firm in its belief that a multilateral naval construct was emerging to “counter and contain” it in the region.

This had led India to restrict Malabar to a bilateral one with the US for several years -- Japan was included only when the exercise was held in the north-western Pacific in 2009 and 2014 -- before finally agreeing to make Japan a regular participant from 2015 onwards.

India has traditionally been against any militarization of the Quad to avoid needlessly antagonizing a prickly China. Similarly, New Delhi has also made it clear the US should not “conflate” the Indo-Pacific with the Quad, stressing the centrality of Asean in the former.

If Australia is indeed called for the Malabar, it will be a breakaway from the self-imposed restraint. India, of course, is bilaterally expanding its military ties with Australia. India, for instance, had for the first time in mid-2018 dispatched four Sukhoi-30MKI fighters, a C-17 Globemaster-III and C-130J “Super Hercules” aircraft, along with 145 personnel, to take part in the multilateral “Pitch Black” exercise in Australia.

In April last year, India and Australia also conducted their biggest-ever naval exercise called “AusIndEx” to “build inter-operability” off the Visakhapatnam coast, which was followed by the “2-plus-2 dialogue among the defence and foreign secretaries of the two countries in December.

268,['29/01/2020'],"Facing monkey menace, villagers get ‘under the skin’ rather than ‘bear’ it","This story is from January 29, 2020

Bareilly: They had no choice. Their village was overrun by over 2,000 monkeys and their repeated pleas with the forest department ignored. All they could have come up with was this rather silly-sounding idea – dressing up two local residents as bears to scare the simians. First, the measure was unconventional and inadequate for a village with a population of 5,000. Secondly, it made them the laughing stock in the neighbouring areas. But for some reason, the plan worked.

The incident occurred in Sikandarpur village of Jalalabad block in Shahjahanpur district.

Village head Ram Lalit Verma, who conceived the idea, told TOI, “We have made a roaster and every man in the village has to wear the bear costume by turn and roam around to keep the monkeys away. A relative who lives in Jhansi told me about the idea. We watched a demonstration before collecting money and buy three bear costumes from a makeup artist for Rs 1,700 each.”

Following the drill, the number of monkey attacks have drastically come down, claim the villagers.

Earlier, 150 cases of monkey bites were reported from the village. The simians were especially targeting children.

When villagers approached the forest department, officials expressed their inability to capture monkeys because of lack of funds.

Shahjahanpur sub-divisional forest officer MN Singh said, “The monkey population is increasing rapidly in the district. We are unable to do much because of lack of funds. Catching a monkey would cost nearly Rs 600 and last time we got funds was in 2018 when we had called a rescue team from Mathura. At present, we can only grant permission to people to catch monkeys on their own or through some NGO and we will help them release the monkeys in forest areas.”

On the villagers’ bear trick, the SDO said, “We will visit Sikandarpur village and check if this bear trick is really working. If so, we would suggest similar action in other villages.”

269,['29/01/2020'],‘70% workers outsiders as locals don’t want to work’,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Panaji: The majority of those working in industries in Goa are from outside the state as locals don’t want to do that kind of work, teacher and social worker Sulakshana Sawant said on Tuesday.

“Seventy per cent of the employees of industries here are not from Goa because we (Goans) don’t want to work in factories,” Sawant said, adding that employers who want their businesses to flourish, but aren’t getting the workforce from Goa, are left with no option but to employ workers from elsewhere. Sulakshana, who is chief minister Pramod Sawant’s wife, was speaking as the chief guest at the launch of the women’s North Goa forum of the Goa Livelihoods Forum.

She urged women to change their mentality, and not consider any job below their dignity. Despite multiple schemes encouraging farming, people in Goa keep their lands fallow, said Kamakshi Pai, general manager of the regional office of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). “One major problem is getting labour. We depend on labour from other states. We ourselves are not interested in working in the fields, and over a period of time, we have lost our agricultural prowess. We have land but have lost our skills,” Pai said.

Nabard hosts several agri-skills programmes and has been promoting horticulture, urban farming, vertical gardens, hydroponics and terrace gardening, she said.

“Nabard is interested in women and in the youth of today. We do a lot of skill and capacity-building programmes for women. The selection of schemes is very important and one must take up an activity that suits you,” Pai said.

Unemployment frustrates the youth and leads them to high-risk behaviour, project director of the Goa AIDS Control Society Dr Siona Gomes, said, referring to the mining ban. “They’re mentally upset and that leads them to substance abuse. They get into high-risk behaviour and their vulnerability of contracting HIV is heightened,” she stated, adding that the society works to impart skills to HIV-positive people, as well as to eliminate stigma and discrimination in society.

The society is working on bringing down the number of new cases of HIV down to 200 this year, she added.

Abhilasha and Rohit Garodia

SURAT: This may appear to be skin to the ‘cow jumped over the moon’ rhyme, but Surtis, particularly the invitees to this Februray 3 wedding will have to jostle for space with three unique guests while blessing the bride and groom at the saath-pheras. Beware, they may munch on a few flower petals too!

Taking exclusivity to newer heights, a Surti couple in Vesu will exchange vows in front of their chief guests — two cows and a calf!

In case you are not moo-ved, here are the details. Rohit Garodia, 29, who is pursuing PhD in business administration will marry Abhilasha, 28, a chartered accountant in the typical Hindus vedic tradition including presence of the cows. What’s more, the baraatis will be led to the wedding venue at Maliba Party plot in Vesu by the two-and-a-half cows — all dented and painted in natural colours and decorated with flower and red cloth, befitting baraatis.

While the bovine will put their best foot forward first at the venue, they will be followed closely by the bride and the groom. Wait. There’s more: Cows to have a separate arrangement near the wedding mandap to enable them ‘moo’ their blessings in front of the people.

“We staunchly believe in our Hindu culture where cow is revered as a mother. In ancient Hindu culture, cow is called ‘kamdhenu’, a provider of all nourishments in life. So when we consider her as gaumata, what better can it be than a mother being the chief guest in a son’s wedding?” the groom, Rohit Garodia said while talking to TOI.

He said it was a joint family decision to invite the cow guests and also keeping true to vedic tradition, design the marriage invites in Sanskrit.

The wedding will also be an example on green conscious as the invitations have been made digitally and sent through WhatsApp and email to save paper, the groom said, adding food will be served in steel utensils only. We have ordered more than 5,000 kulhars, in which guests will be served water and other refreshments, he said.

Groom’s father, Rampal Garodia, a textile businessman said, “Both the families are from the same profession and have been friends for a long time. It was our wish to marry our children in accordance to the vedic culture. The presence of cow will make the entire ceremony pious.”

BENGALURU: The ambitious Rs 500-crore Project Roshni that sought to rope in Tech Avant-Garde (TAG) to deploy technology in classrooms and enhance the quality of education in BBMP schools is likely to be scrapped on Wednesday.

The civic agency and its partner are blaming each other for the endeavour failing to see the light of the day one and a half years after its launch. “Roshni is far from fulfilling its objectives due to the indolence of civic authorities,” said Ali Sait, CEO of TAG.

However, a senior BBMP official said Sait is the one citing various excuses and creating hurdles for the project. “Initially, it was the state of school buildings, then it was the painting, later it was the electricity and then elections. The list of excuses he provided is endless. Sait doesn’t seem too interested in starting the project,” added the official.

Vrushabendra Murthy, special commissioner, said: “Sait’s favourite excuse is that BBMP has not kept its word on providing the infrastructure. But if they are ready to spend Rs 500 crore, they can also use the money to upgrade infrastructure.”

Sait, however, said BBMP officials appeared to be suffering from amnesia. “They don’t remember anything we have done. I myself have taught teachers and children in a Malleswaram BBMP school on using the software . In an Austin Town school, we provided smart boards but they’re all broken now,” he said.

Sait said he’s placed orders for smart tablets in Taiwan and they will reach India soon. He added the Palike should have spoken to him directly instead of complaining to others.

BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar said several NGOs come to the agency citing CSR initiatives of multinational companies and take up projects but none actually executes them.

“Once these NGOs get a letter from the Palike, they use it to raise money from MNCs, but nothing happens on the ground,” Kumar said, adding this is what’s happened in the case of TAG and Project Roshni. “We’ve given them a day’s time to discuss and revert. Else, the project will be scrapped on Wednesday,” he asserted.

Where’s the software?

TAG had promised us everything, including artificial intelligence to augmented reality and machine learning, but the ground reality is different...They claim to have spent Rs 18 crore on the project in 2019-2020, but where is the software? Our students are not using it

— Vrushabendra Murthy , special commissioner, BBMP

May have to compromise on tech

All the gadgets are being put together in Taiwan and we need to bring them here, which costs money. If BBMP wants us to use the project money on building infrastructure, we will have to compromise on technology

— Ali Sait, CEO, Tech Avant-Garde

No computers, laptops

We’ve been taught how to use the teaching software but don’t have laptops and computers to use it

HYDERABAD: Rubbishing charges made by Congress that he is still a Rajya Sabha MP from Andhra Pradesh , MP and TRS secretary general K Keshava Rao said he exercised his voting right in Tukkugda municipal chairperson’s election since he was allotted to Telangana in 2014.

Rao claimed a notification was also issued in this regard. He said he was originally allocated to AP, while another MP KVP Ramachandra Rao was allotted to Telangana. “We both gave letters to Centre seeking a swap, which was okayed by the government,” he said.

“It was endorsed by Union minister Prakash Javadekar and a gazette notification was issued,” Keshava Rao told mediamen after meeting TSEC chief V Nagi Reddy on Tuesday. He said he was even registered as an ex-officio member in GHMC earlier.

“KVP gave a letter of his consent seeking transfer to AP. So, he cannot be allowed to vote in Nereducherla. KVP does not even have a normal vote. How would two MPs be allowed to vote as ex-officio members,” he said. On the Rajya Sabha bulletin, which still shows him as an MP from AP, Keshava Rao said he has no idea on the origin of the mistake and only the Rajya Sabha secretariat should be able to clarify on this.

When asked to comment on abolition of the legislative council in AP, he said it was not proper to say that continuing a legislative council was a waste of money. “There is a need for council also,” he added.

BENGALURU: The high court has granted bail to a 37-year-old Bangladeshi woman from the Christian community on the strength of Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019.

The court cited Section 2 of the amended Citizenship Act 1955, according to which minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014 should not be treated as illegal immigrants, while granting her bail.

Allowing the petition filed by Archana Purnima Pramanik, an illegal immigrant from Bangladesh, who claims to be staying in India since 2003, justice John Michael Cunha on Monday directed her to furnish a bail bond for Rs 2 lakh to the satisfaction of the investigating officer and cooperate with the probe.

The judge observed the allegations made against her must be proved in a full-dressed trial. Archana was booked for obtaining documents such as PAN and Aadhaar cards and also fraudulently obtaining an Indian passport on March 28 last year. Based on a complaint filed by the assistant passport officer, Archana was arrested on November 7, 2019 and her bail petition was dismissed by a sessions court on December 4, 2019.

Born on March 23, 1983 at Tanore, Rajshahi district of Bangladesh, Archana came to India in 2003 to pursue a career in nursing. After obtaining a diploma in general nursing and midwifery at Ranchi in 2006, she worked in many reputed hospitals.

In 2010, she got married to Rajashekaran Krishnamurthy and the marriage was registered at Ranchi. After the wedding, she moved to Bengaluru and obtained PAN, Aadhaar and voter ID cards.

On April 1, 2019, Archana applied for a visa to Bangladesh for herself and her son. During her journey on May 20, 2019, they were detained at Kolkata airport and released later. However, the regional passport office issued a notice revoking Archana’s passport and she was arrested by RT Nagar police on November 7, 2019.

HYDERABAD: A resident of Siddipet was fined by the authorities to pay Rs 15,000 for chopping a tree in the town. Another resident, who cut down a tree branch in front of his house, was also not spared by Siddipet municipality officials and told to pay Rs 2,000 penalty.

So far, the municipality has collected Rs 2.14 lakh from fines from violators for felling trees or chopping tree branches. S Balachari of Bharathnagar axed a neem tree on the roadside and was told to pay a hefty fine of Rs 15,000. Another resident of the town, Raghupathi Varma, had to pay Rs 2,000 for cutting the tree branch.

With instances of people being penalised for chopping trees increasing, municipal authorities are now granting permission to cut trees in rare cases after ascertaining the situation. Horticulture officer Samalla Ilaiah told TOI that permission was accorded in five instances where construction of houses was taking place. “Those who remove a tree will have to plant more trees after the house is constructed in addition to paying the requisite permission fee,” Ilaiah said.

A resident Donthula Sowjanya, who lives close to the house of finance minister and Siddipet MLA T Harish Rao , sought permission from the officials to axe a tree on their plot before taking up construction of a house. Permission was granted after collecting Rs 5,000 fine. “The fee amount will also depend on the age of the tree,” Ilalaih said.

With Harish Rao asking officials to safeguard trees, which were planted in the last few years as part of Haritha Haram, and other trees, municipal officials along with police are taking a serious view of any resident trying to destroy trees or branches.

Hyderabad: BJP president Dr K Laxman on Tuesday claimed CM KCR and municipal minister KTR had “made a mockery of democracy” by securing the posts in urban local bodies in an undemocratic manner. The BJP chief alleged that TRS had indulged in various tactics to win the elections such as violation of elections norms, distribution of money and misusing official machinery. “The BJP not only fought elections against TRS, Congress and MIM but also strongly faced irregularities by opposition parties, particularly TRS in the municipal polls,” he said.

Hyderabad: Amid high drama and a walkout by Congress councillors, TRS on Tuesday won the hotly-contested chairperson and vice-person elections for Neredcherla municipality. The municipality had gotten a hung verdict with both TRS and Congress bagging seven wards each in the 15-ward municipality while CPM managed to win one seat.

In total, the Congress managed to get 10 votes for the top post — seven wards, two ex-officio votes and the CPM’s vote. Until Monday night, TRS too had 10 votes — seven wards and three ex-officio votes. However, they added a fourth ex-officio vote on Tuesday with the support of party MLC Subhash Reddy. The Congress said the TRS’ move was in violation of election rules.

With officials refusing to remove Subhash’s despite objections from Congress, party workers staged a walkout even as officials began the election process. The election was held in absence of Congress workers and TRS secured posts for both chairperson and vice-chairperson.

Telangana Congress president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the party was examining legal options as they claimed the TRS’ move was in violation of orders by municipal administration department and state election commission. “There are certain matters with the high court which I cannot disclose... I will raise the issue in Parliament and also bring the issue to the notice of Chief Justice of India,” Uttam told reporters in Hyderabad. Earlier, the TPCC president along with MP KVP Ramachandra Rao had been taken into custody by police after they had staged a dharna in front of the Neredcherla municipal office following the walkout.

“After two members were sworn in and a third swearing in was going on, the TRS MLA started throwing a tantrum and election officer postponed the polling. Then KTR got into action and exerted pressure on the state election commission to add TRS MLC Subhash Reddy’s name to voters list this morning. This symbolises the manner in which municipal elections were held,” Uttam said. “Despite Congress having a majority in Neredcherla, TRS and state election commission brazenly misused government power and manipulated the election,” he added.

TRS functionaries, on their part, said Congress was free to go to court. “The Congress brought KVP from Andhra Pradesh into the voter list after the councillors’ oath... Uttam is frustrated and is not able to digest the defeat,” TRS ex-officio voter B Venkateshwarlu said.

280,['29/01/2020'],BBMP garbage trucks to get a wash after trips to landfills,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Garbage trucks are a common sight on city roads

BENGALURU: It’s not uncommon for Bengalureans to endure the stench emanating from a garbage truck in the neighbourhood or at traffic signals. But this nauseating experience could soon be a thing of the past. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is all set to make it mandatory for compactors (garbage trucks) to get a wash after offloading trash at dumpyards.

To start with, a compactor cleaning unit will be set up at Mittaganahalli landfill, Bengaluru east. Water sourced from the leachate treatment plant at the landfill will be used to clean the compactors. “The idea is to ensure these trucks don’t stink, at least when they are parked or are on their way to lift garbage,” BBMP commissioner BH Anil Kumar told TOI.

Bengaluru generates around 5,000 tons of garbage per day and the same is transported to landfills in around 500 compactors. Currently, the trucks return from the landfills without being cleaned. The cleaning unit will be set up in such a way that once the compactor unloads the trash, it will be sent out only after a wash.

Businessman Sajjan Raj Mehta, who often travels by a two-wheeler, said the move will bring much respite to motorists. “The compactors aren’t maintained in a hygienic manner. If I get stuck behind a compactor, my immediate reaction is to overtake it as fast as I can in order to avoid the foul smell. Almost every rider in Bengaluru does the same thing the moment they notice a garbage truck.”

Traffic police too welcomed the move. “There have been instances where bikers have met with accidents in the haste to get away from garbage compactors,” a traffic constable said.

Vasant Raju, who commutes to work on a bike, felt the initiative was long overdue. “There have been instances when I had to speed just to escape the foul smell from compactors. I think it’s a great start,” he added.

After the Mittaganahalli landfill, the cleaning project will be rolled out at Hullahalli and Marenahalli landfills. “We will gradually expand the initiative. Following the landfills, we will come up with similar units at the seven other waste processing centers in the city,” said BBMP special commissioner Randeep D.

The BBMP chief said the Palike intends to implement the same system for builders “We will tell them to ensure their concrete and mud trucks are washed on the project site in order to reduce dust on roads.”

281,['29/01/2020'],BBMP developing single-window clearance system for highrises,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Photo used for representational purpose only

BENGALURU: Securing prior approvals for construction of highrises in the city could soon become a breeze. With BBMP developing a software, which will put in place a single-window clearance mechanism, builders will be spared the trouble of visiting multiple civic agencies for approvals.

“The Building Plan Approval System (BPAS) software is in its final stages and we will launch it soon,” said BH Anil Kumar, BBMP commissioner. The software is expected to be operational in a month.

“The software will allow an applicant to fill a form online, which will then be sent to all other civic agencies for approval. The application fee will be decided based on the land value,” he added.

The move comes in the backdrop of the World Bank deciding to also consider Bengaluru and Kolkata while arriving at India’s ease-of-doing business rankings. Till now, it had been considering only New Delhi and Mumbai. The BBMP’s single-window clearance system is expected to push up India’s ranking, which is currently 63.

The work on BPAS began after Kumar, mayor M Goutham Kumar and other Palike officials recently visited the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). MGCM has an online no objection certificate (NoC ) approval software through which all the required approvals are routed and people are said to be more than happy with the system. “The approvals are granted real-time and people are able to keep track of their applications,” said mayor Goutham Kumar.

“Soon, we will be implementing the same technology in BBMP. More than 10 agencies, including BWSSB, BESCOM, GAIL and BDA have to grant approvals for construction of highrises and this only delays things,” explained Anil Kumar.

According to another senior BBMP official, zonal officers have the power to sanction buildings less than 15 metres high, but anything above needs clearance from BBMP central office.

“In the current process, at least 90 days are lost in getting approvals from various agencies. Through BPAS one can get all the required approvals within 10 days,” said Anil Kumar.

Under BPAS, a date will be fixed for officials from various civic agencies to jointly visit the site for inspection. BPAS will also have a provision for ‘deemed approval’. If a civic agency doesn’t grant approval or raise an objection within the stipulated time, the project will be deemed to have got all clearances and any liability will fall on the civic body.

“The various civic agencies involved in granting approvals will have to get their act together, failing which they’d be held responsible for any violation,” said a senior BBMP official.

Confirming that all civic agencies are on the same page on BPAS, Anil Kumar said: “We are holding meetings with officials of other civic agencies and discussing the modalities.”

Stoppage of iron ore mining in Goa has impacted revenues worth over Rs 3,400 crore and the livelihoods of seve... Read More

PANAJI: Unemployment and retrenchment due to mining closure has not only devastated families economically, but is also threatening the social fabric of the state besides negatively impacting the confidence of investors, the Goa Livelihoods Forum has stated in its Livelihoods Report 2020 released at an event on Tuesday.

Stoppage of iron ore mining in Goa has impacted revenues worth over Rs 3,400 crore and the livelihoods of several dependent segments have been affected due to ceasing of mining activities. It has left industry stakeholders without any alternative sources of income.

“Not confined to only the mining talukas, income and savings have been severely hit, exceeding well over 40% in most of the caseslt,” the report stated.

“The stoppage of mining in the state has not only caused revenue damage and job loss within the state, but has also led to major loss of investor confidence, which would have a long-term negative impact on Goa’s economy,” the report stated.

Regional and rural areas may experience severe economic upheaval where unemployment has been known to induce substance abuse, the report said.

Criticising the Supreme Court’s verdict, the forum stated, “In the national debate on mining, both in courts and civic societies, the voices of these people are lost.”

“The decision has directly impacted more than 60,000 households and three lakh livelihoods in the state. The ban has stopped potentially 20 million tonne of iron ore exports. It has disrupted an entire ecosystem of downstream, upstream and allied industries, including logistics suppliers, individual truck owners and barge owners as well as equipment suppliers,” the report stated.

Over 90% of the responses indicated the loss of livelihoods as the most significant factor worrying the communities. The strongest negative predictor of the acceptance of mining was the impact on the environment followed by the impact on agricultural and tourism sectors and impact on living cost.

“Majority of the respondents in the mining belt stated that they hoped that the state and central government come together to resume mining by any means as necessary in the next few months as another year without any source of livelihood for them would result in a socio-economic catastrophe on them from which there would be no return,” the report stated.

BENGALURU: Two people who allegedly bought bikes and scooters on online marketing portal OLX to snatch chains have been arrested in the city. Police said the arrests have helped them crack nine chain-snatching cases.

Friends for seven years, Rama Murthy, 33, a resident Chikka Banaswadi and Karthik, 35, a resident of Electronics City, worked as labourers before starting a business venture that flopped, leaving them with huge debts. The duo decided to take to chain-snatching after reading about the crime in newspapers.

They watched YouTube videos and trained themselves for a month. Acting as agents, they would buy bikes from OLX and later post ads on the same portal to sell them off, but only after using the two-wheelers for five to six days to snatch chains at different places.

Police said the purchase and sale operation was nothing but a sleight of hand: the vehicle’s documents would remain in the name of the original owner and even if police managed to find out the registration number of the vehicle used to commit the crime, the trail wouldn’t lead to the culprits. Investigators said the duo was caught for the first time, but they confessed they were into chain-snatching for nine months. However, their failed attempts outnumbered successful ones. Police have recovered three two-wheelers and 307g of gold ornaments worth Rs 15 lakh from the duo.

According to police, the duo would operate in newly-developed colonies and targeted women who were alone in their house.

They would then use pepper spray on the victim and rob their gold. Bhanuvikas and Manasa were caught during a vehicle check at Boduppal Kaman.

Shyam Asolekar said that he stands by his decision to oppose Metro card shed at Aarey

MUMBAI: Though the Metro-III car shed at Aarey is a done deal, Shyam Asolekar, professor at Centre for Environmental Science and Engineering, IIT-Bombay , said he stands by his decision to oppose it.

Asolekar, along with Rakesh Kumar, director, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, who were appointed members of the technical advisory committee by the Devendra Fadnavis government to find an alternative site to Aarey, had filed a dissenting note on locating the car shed there.

At a seminar titled ‘Urban Climate Resilience: Aarey and Mumbai City’ at Mumbai Press Club on Tuesday, Asolekar said he wrote the dissenting note as he believed in it.

In the note, both Asolekar and Kumar said the proposed car shed site at Aarey was right next to Mithi river forming its catchment. “If the car shed is constructed, then during monsoon the water rentention ability of the plot will be lost to concretization. Hence, all the excess run-off water will find its way in Mithi, which will increase the risk of downstream flooding in Chakala and the international report,” read the note.

Asolekar said the trend globally was to counter every argument to protect the environment by saying there is a technological solution. “Technology cannot offer solutions for all environmental degradation. When taking up monumental projects we need to instead ask what is good for the environment. What we should not do and what should not be used,” he said.

Technology, said Asolekar, is not the solution for environmental destruction. “Social engineering and a business model based on equitable justice is the only way to get over confrontations and avoid environmental degradation.” He recounted the revival of a lake around Jaipur’s Amer fort not only brought in a variety of birds but also revived the local economy. Maha Vikas Aghadi government has appointed a new committee headed by additional chief secretary Manoj Saunik to suggest an alternative site.

BENGALURU: Property owners may have to pay 2% of their property tax in the form of land transportation cess from financial year 2020-21.

On Tuesday, the BBMP council decided to collect 2% cess and inform the government that it would be used for maintenance of roads, drains and streetlights. The council decision will have to be cleared by the urban development department.

The collection of 2% property tax as land tranportation cess was allowed by an amendment to the KMC Act, in 2013. The council had on June 2018 approved the proposal to reintroduce collection of LTC in order to provide better infrastructure for vehicles in the city.

“BJP leaders opposed the cess then, stating it would burden taxpayers. But how are they agreeing to it now,” asked Abdul Wajib , leader of the opposition, adding, “Now since there are no funds, they have decided to collect the cess.”

BBMP had earlier refused to hand over LTC to the directorate of urban land transport. “All the facilities are provided and maintained by the Palike. Why should we give the money to some other agency?” wondered council member Muneendra Kumar .

HYDERABAD: The din over allowing five ex-officio members — Rajya Sabha MP K Keshava Rao and four others — to utilise voting rights in the poll to elect Tukkuguda municipal chairperson took a new turn on Tuesday with Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) lobbing the issue in the municipal administration department’s court.“Registration of ex-officio members and allowing them to vote in any municipality comes under purview of government — in this case, the municipal administration department. As far as Keshava Rao exercising his voting right, only the Rajya Sabha authorities can clarify on the matter,” TSEC secretary M Ashok Kumar told TOI on Tuesday.On the other hand, director of the municipal administration TK Sreedevi disassociated herself on the issue, saying it was the decision of the supervisory officer to allow the ex-officio members to vote. She said the local supervisory officer and adjudication officer (local municipal commissioner) will have to respond on the issue.A controversy broke out over granting voting rights to Keshava Rao, minister P Sabita Indra Reddy, MLCs — Nayani Narasimha Reddy, Yegge Mallesham and Katepally Janardhan Reddy — in Tukkuguda. Both Congress and BJP alleged that all the five ex-officio members were allowed to move from Badangpet municipal corporation to Tukkuguda and termed it illegal. Congress also questioned as to how Keshava Rao, who was allotted to Andhra Pradesh, was allowed to exercise his franchise in Telangana.Sources said all five ex-officio members were first registered with Badangpet corporation on January 25 as TRS was not sure about winning the mayoral post and where their votes could prove to be crucial. However, TRS got a shot in the arm in Badangpet with some members joining the party after they got elected on a Congress ticket. The ruling party felt there was no need of ex-officio members in Badangpet and moved them to Tukkuguda next day — January 26 — where the party did not have required numbers to win the chairperson post.As per section 5 of the new Municipalities Act-2019, an ex-officio member registered with a particular urban local body to exercise is vote is final and irrevocable. “The five ex-officio members gave in writing on January 26 to register their names in Tukkuguda to allow them to vote. As per the Act, they can register within 30 days and I allowed them. I was not aware that they were earlier registered in Badangpet and withdrew from there,” Tukkuguda commissioner R Gnaneshwar told TOI.Interestingly, Sreedevi and commissioner, TSEC, V Nagi Reddy had announced at a recent joint meeting that the ex-officio members were required to register by giving option of municipality where they were planning to utilise their voting right before 5 pm on January 25 and they cannot change the option. But, according to the Act, ex-officio members can give their option within 30 days from date of election in writing duly signed by them, specifying the municipality.Badangpet municipal commissioner C Satyababu refused to comment over the issue, saying that “it is a closed chapter.”",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73730827,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-127482,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/sec-lobs-ex-officio-members-voting-issue-into-govts-court/articleshow/73710236.cms

BAREILLY: A 10-year-old girl, a student of Class III was allegedly raped by her 50-year-old uncle in a village in Shahjahanpur district on Monday.

Finding her alone at home, the uncle allegedly barged into the house and raped her. Upon returning home, the girl’s mother found her crying in pain and rushed her to a hospital, where doctors told her that her daughter was ""sexually assaulted”. After regaining, the girl, too, told her parents about the crime.

An FIR was registered against the uncle and police are searching for him.

On Monday, the girl’s father and brother, both labourers, left for work and her mother went to a cow shelter in the village for making cow dung cakes, leaving her alone at home when her father’s younger brother barged into the house and raped her.

The medical examination of the girl was conducted a primary health centre (PHC) in Tilhar by emergency medical officer Dr Shalini on Tuesday and the report is awaited. The girl was, however, discharged from the PHC after her condition improved.

The mother told TOI, “Upon returning home, I found my daughter wriggling in pain. I took her to a doctor with the help of locals and informed my husband about her condition. Later, we came to know that my brother-in-law raped her. He is absconding. I have demanded stringent punishment for him.”

Additional superintendent of police (rural) Aparna Gautam said, “We have registered an FIR against the accused under sections 376 (rape) and 452 (house-trespass with intent to hurt) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The girl is stable after treatment. We have deployed several police teams to arrest the accused at the earliest.”

Her mother Wasima Bano lodged an FIR against Shagufta’s husband Mohammad Asif at Alambagh police station on Tuesday. Shagufta and Asif got married five years ago. Bano alleged Asif had been harassing her daughter for dowry after they got married. Asif had been demanding Rs 1.5 lakh, a motorcycle and e-rickshaw, Bano alleged and added that Asif and his family members killed Shagufta and hanged her.

In another case, Neha Srivastava died after falling from the terrace of her home in Krishnanagar. She was married to Alok Srivastava six months ago. Neha’s brother Prakash has lodged an FIR against Alok and her brother-in-law Dilip with Krishnanangar, accusing them of killing Neha for dowry.

On Saturday, Dilip informed Prakash about the incident and asked him to reach a private hospital in Krishnanagar where Neha was admitted. Neha died in the hospital. Prakash told police that Alok was an alcoholic and had been harassing his sister for dowry. He claimed Alok was drunk on the day of the incident and threw Neha off the terrace.

Police are verifying the allegations of the two families. But prima facie it appears that the two women were being harassed by their husbands and committed suicide, police said.

Surat: A resident of Jujva village was booked at Valsad town police station on Sunday for allegedly stealing rubble worth Rs3 lakh dumped on his land to level it for parking during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit in August 2018. The offence was registered after Gujarat high court asked police to investigate the theft on a PIL filed by a native of Valsad district.

Bipin Patel was booked for allegedly stealing the rubble dumped on his land by panchayat department’s road and building division. Modi was visiting Valsad to inaugurate an irrigation project and address a public meeting.

Due to non-availability of enough government land, Patel’s plot was used for parking of vehicles after taking his approval. Patel had written to the department to remove the rubble from his land after the event was over but it didn’t, Anil Patel, executive engineer, panchayat department, said in his complaint.

“An RTI activist alleged that the rubble was stolen and complained to local authorities and also approached the high court. Following the PIL, the high court asked police to inquire into the matter after which an offence was registered,” a police officer said.

Surat: Sidhhi Pandya , 18 , a medical student , arrived home in the city on January 13 to give surprise to her family on her birthday, but this has saved her from a nightmare as Wuhan city of China is battling coronavirus for the past few days.

Pandya, a second year student of MBBS at Hubei University, is now being examined daily by a government medical team to verify if she was infected with the deadly virus. She has been declared healthy and normal, but is likely to be kept under medical observation for a few more days. Members of her family are also being kept under watch by the health officials.

“We are subjecting the girl to daily medical checkup. Her health is normal at present but she is being examined regularly,” said a health official of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC).

Pandya did not inform anyone in the family of her arrival and had booked tickets from her savings in October 2019, and left Wuhan on January 12.

“All members of her family were surprised when she arrived. We were slightly unhappy about unnecessary spending, but now feel relieved as she was able to escape coronavirus there. We think she is lucky,” a family member said.

“I had some savings and wanted to celebrate my birthday on January 26 with my family. This is why I came here. I am worried for my friends who are still there. I wish they are safe. My friends told me that they were being helped with food and water by university teachers. But they and their family members are very tense,” Sidhhi said.

She said there were about 10 students from Gujarat in Wuhan and they are not being allowed to leave the city. Pandya was to return to Wuhan in February but her vacation is likely to be extended.

Health officials from Centre and state government contacted her soon after her arrival and informed her on the need to keep her under medical observation.

Panaji: The tourism department has proposed that the total bill raised by Drishti Lifesaving for the last quarter of 2019 be reduced by one-third as there were less men deployed during the period due to the strike by lifeguards.

“The deduction suggested has been submitted for government approval after which the decision will be conveyed to Drishti,” an official said.

Drishti has raised bills totalling over Rs 1 crore for October, November and December 2019, an official said. On verifying them, the department found fewer lifeguards had been deployed on beaches during the period as many had gone on strike, he said. “Accordingly, the department has suggested a one-third reduction in the total bill raised,” the official said.

Over 100 lifeguards had gone on strike initially, demanding that their arrears be paid with immediate effect. Some had also demanded that they be employed by the government. Some lifeguards had continued to protest until recently. The tourism department has recently extended Drishti Lifesaving’s contract by two-and-a-half years.

The official said that the tourism department is set to sign a formal agreement with Karnataka Commercial Industries Pvt Ltd, a new beach cleaning agency appointed in September, for a period of three years at a cost of Rs 30 crore. The contract can be extended to two years subject to conditions.

Panaji: The Goa chapter of the Bihar Foundation, which was launched by Bihar industries minister Shyam Rajak on Tuesday, will help impart training in soft skills to migrant Bihari labourers working in Goa.

Stating that 25% of all migrant workers in Goa are Biharis, Rajak said the objective of the Bihar Foundation is to bring migrant Biharis together and to help them better integrate with their place of migration. The foundation’s Goa chapter is the 21st in the world and the ninth in India.

Sarfaraj Alam, who will head the chapter, said the foundation will focus on training migrant Bihari labourers in soft skills.

“In many cases, labourers coming from Bihar do not know how to dress or behave. Many times, this leads to irritation against them in their place of migration. We want to train them in soft skills, etiquette, how to dress and how to behave,” Alam, who is a hotelier, said. He also said the foundation will work to improve the image of Bihar in the minds of people everywhere.

Rajak said the infrastructure in Bihar had improved tremendously in recent years and that Biharis are talented workers who work for the prosperity of their place of settlement. He also said Bihar has a culture of migration, which is where the idea of a Bihar Foundation was born. “We want to promote among them a sense of service and dedication towards their place of migration,” the minister added.

“Trade is also promoted through the Bihar Foundation and Bihar-origin investors living in different parts of the world will be able to explore investment opportunities in Goa,” Alam said.

Palakkad: Glass has been a major attraction for people from time immemorial and Egyptians were the first to use glass containers in 5 BC.

Though many substitutes for glass were introduced, particularly plastic materials, glass continues to fascinate people.

A designer and builder of four decades , V P Chandran of Palakkad was trying to make valuable glass products from waste bottles, particularly the littered liquor bottles which became a big environment menace on the streets.

He had set up a workshop in his Scholar Design Centre and started research on developing various products from waste glass and after more than a year of tireless work he succeeded in developing many attractively designed items.

“Glass recycling is the processing of waste glass into usable products. To be recycled, glass waste needs to be purified and cleaned. Then depending on the end use, the local processing capabilities, might also have to be separated into different colours. Glass is ideal for recycling since none of the materials are degraded by normal use”, he said.

“During the thought process of utilizing the waste I decided to concentrate first on the used glass bottles which were found littered in garbage landfills and water bodies. A large amount of such used glass bottles was kept in various hotels, bars and clubs as the management had no idea of its effective disposal”, Chandran said.

His first step was collecting such glass bottles and segregating it manually.

Then they were cleaned and decontaminated and crushed into pellets.

These pellets were effectively used to manufacture various products like art pieces, furniture, wall decorative, tiles, partition materials etc.

He said that in the process the main bottleneck was to find a medium to effectively bind these glass pellets to derive the required compression strength and solidification properties.

After lot of research on the invention of glass and its development process he could arrive at a medium which had the best binding properties for glass pellets.

After finding the right medium, he had to do various trials, combinations and ratios to arrive at the best by-product in a cost-effective manner.

He used wooden planks and pieces which was a waste by-product after carpentry, combined them with the pellets, turned them into various furniture like stools, dining tables, wall panels etc.

Chandran said that he is now “trying to develop suitable machines to mechanize the process and get a patent for these process and products to make value-added products from polluting glass waste.”

Hubballi: Union minister Pralhad Joshi urged district minister Jagadish Shettar to convene a meeting of officials of different departments to make good use of projects sanctioned by the Union government in the recent years.

Pointing out lapses of the state government officials, he said there is a need to train them on how to issue building permission and expand infrastructure utilizing grants of the state and central governments.

“For instance, when the Union government came forward to construct outer ring road from Navalgund Road-Gadag Road-PB Road-Kalghatgi Road, state engineers prepared a blue print in which the proposed road was shown dividing Hubballi south station. When this proposal reached Delhi, an official checked on Google and found that there is a station through which the bypass passes. He returned the proposal to state officials. The irony is that officials took over two years to rectify this error. If this is the functioning style of the state officials, Hubballi-Dharwad will lose many facilities,” he rued.

Addressing the gathering at the inaugural ceremony of ROB on Tuesday, Joshi, mentioning low quality work of the railway under bridge at Desai Circle, said the slab is already destroyed. “How did the HDMC officials issue building permission for an apartment at 2-3 gunta site at Bhavani Nagar? While constructing this ROB also, they had forgotten to connect it to Circuit House” he said.

He said the Union government is investing Rs 100 lakh crore in infrastructure sector in the coming five years. “Out of this, Rs 50 lakh crore will be invested in railway infrastructure like electrification and line doubling. If trains are electrified, we can save on oil import. We are also planning to increase solar energy production from 125 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts. As a result, price of electricity will come down. Rate of road construction, which was 3kms per day, is now increased to 8kms per day and we aim to make it 10kms per day,” he added.

311,['29/01/2020'],Complaint against Church body over kids at CAA protest,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Panaji: An NGO’s child protection coordinator has written to the women and child police station in Panaji, asking that action be taken against a Church body—Council for Social Justice and Peace (CSJP) and another organisation— for including children in the anti-CAA meeting they organised in Margao last Friday.

Providing photographs as proof of participation of children at the gathering held at Lohia Maidan in Margao, Emidio Pinho of the NGO ‘Scan’ said that having impressionable children at such events places them in vulnerable situations.

The anti-CAA/NRC/NPR meeting was organised by CSJP and National confederation of Human Rights organisations.“Children are exposed to political ideology, aggressive and often derogatory language and this can leave a lasting memory. The impact can be detrimental to their sensitive minds. Also, at such meetings, the participants can become violent and innocent children become victims,” said Pinho in his letter to the police. “We also request you to analyse every speech, and if any derogatory words were used, then provisions of the Goa Children’s Act too need to be attracted,” Pinho said.

He said that recently the national commission for protection of child rights had written to director generals of police (DGP) across the country, requesting them to be vigilant to the misuse of children at such meetings.

Pinho has also sent his letter to the Goa DGP and the chief minister.

As per the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, any adult or an adult group’s use of children for illegal activities shall be liable for rigourous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to pay a fine of Rs 5 lakh, Pinho states.

Union minister for defence Rajnath Singh (File photo)

NEW DELHI: India is “fully capable of giving a firm response” to cross-border terrorism like it did through the surgical strikes in 2016 and the Balakot air strikes last year, said defence minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday, while slamming Pakistan for using “terror as a state policy” rather than peacefully settling disputes through dialogue.

“We have made it clear that talks and terror cannot go together and that Pakistan must take demonstrable steps against terror groups responsible for launching various attacks on India from its soil,” said Singh, addressing the 12th South Asia conference in New Delhi.

Pakistan’s use of terror as an instrument of its foreign and security policy has “promoted radicalism and terrorism in the region”, with Mumbai, Pathankot, Uri and Pulwama being “grim reminders of state-sponsored terrorism”, while all the other Saarc countries have adhered to the principles of non-interference in each other’s internal affairs and not supporting cross-border terrorism, the defence minister said.

Rampur DM Aunjaneya Kumar Singh. (Image taken from his official Twitter account)

RAMPUR: Amar Singh, the police officer investigating the case against 34 people who were arrested on December 21, 2019, for protesting against the just ratified Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), on Tuesday produced two separate applications before two courts, in which he pleaded that no offence under charges of murder, attempt to murder and dacoity could be made out against 26 of the jailed protesters.

They had been arrested after violence broke out at Hatikhana square, in which one protester, Faiz Khan, was shot dead.

The charges of heinous crimes — murder, attempt to murder and dacoity — were dropped after the courts accepted the investigating officer’s applications. The investigation is still on, with police now trying to track the “real culprits”.

On that December afternoon, Kotwali police arrested 24 protesters and sent them to jail under IPC sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapons), 149 (unlawful assembly), 307 (attempt to murder), 302 (murder), 333 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt to deter public servant), 353 ( assault or criminal force) and sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Section 7 of the CLAA (Criminal Law Amendment Act) was also invoked against the protesters.

According to officials, 10 protesters were sent to jail by Ganj Kotwali police station, under charges of rioting, assault on public servants and attempt to murder.

Speaking to TOI, Rampur DM Aunjaneya Kumar Singh said, “No innocent shall be booked. The entire investigation is being done on the basis of evidence. We had ordered officials that if evidence of heinous offenses couldn’t be found against those arrested, charges should be dropped so that they can be released by courts,” adding, “Charges of murder, attempt to murder and dacoity have been dropped against 26 of the jailed protesters.”

Special prosecution officer Shiv Prakash Pandey said, “The courts of the chief judicial magistrate and additional chief judicial magistrate have allowed the applications filed by IO Amar Singh, in which he had mentioned 26 names and prayed before court to have the charges dropped. The IO informed the court that no clinching evidence could be found against them.”

He added, “The remaining sections of IPC, which include rioting, assault on public servant, damage to public property, etc, will remain in force against the offenders.”

The SPO also said charges of murder, dacoity and attempt to murder will remain in force against the eight remaining protesters, who are still in jail.

Police and administration became active after Muslim clerics gathered at Jama Masjid during Friday prayers and set January 29 as deadline for resolving the cases against those who have been “falsely accused”, stating that if their demands were not met by then, they would decide their next course of action on January 30.

Hubballi: Minister of state for railways Suresh Angadi has asked the South Western Railways (SWR) to start Hubballi-Vijayapura Intercity Express from February 15.

Speaking at the inauguration of the Road Over Bridge (ROB) at Desai Cross here on Tuesday, Angadi said that the proposed train will connect Hubballi and Vijayapura in less time compared to existing passenger trains.

Angadi said line doubling is the first priority of the Railways. “As part of this vision, line doubling between Bengaluru and Pune has been expedited and all work incuding electrification in Karnataka will be completed by 2022,” he said.

Comparing the growth of railway network in India with that of Korea, which also got independence in 1947, Angadi said that trains in Korea are running at a speed of 400 KMPH whereas in India we are still struggling to enhance the speed to 100 KMPH. “With line doubling, we aim to take passengers from Bengaluru to Hubballi only in four hours,” he added.

Ajay Kumar Singh, general manager, SWR, said that the ROB is reconstructed as part of the ongoing Hospet-Tinaighat railway doubling project. The new bridge, which is built at the cost of Rs 14.6 crore, accommodates double line as well as extension of Hubballi station yard.

317,['29/01/2020'],No clarity yet on transfer of Elgar case hearing to NIA court,"This story is from January 29, 2020

There was no clarity about the timing of transferring Elgar Parishad case papers to the NIA court at the case ... Read More

PUNE: There was no clarity about the timing of transferring Elgar Parishad case papers to the NIA court at the case hearing on Monday, the first after the Centre ordered the transfer of its further probe to the National Investigation Agency last Friday.

Besides, clarity also eluded on the place of hearing, Pune or Mumbai, in the case.

Special UAPA judge SR Navander, hearing the case for now, told the representing lawyers that the court had received no official word yet about the transfer. Special public prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar told the court that the prosecution was seeking a copy of the order from the authorities concerned while the defence lawyers said they had no idea about the matter.

Lawyer Rohan Nahar, who is representing one of the arrested activists P Varavara Rao, told TOI, “As per our information, the charge of NIA court in Pune is with district and sessions judge AY Thatte. However, only those cases wherein the state government has initiated probe transfer to NIA are expected to come up for hearing before the NIA court here. In the instant case, the transfer of further investigation has been ordered by the Centre. As such, the case papers may go to NIA court in Mumbai. We have to wait and watch what happens ahead.”

Other defence lawyers said there was still some time before the case papers were actually moved to the appropriate NIA court for hearing. This is because the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government in the state has protested the Union home ministry’s move to transfer the case to the NIA without seeking its permission or even formally notifying it about the move. State home minister Anil Deshmukh has declared that the government was seeking legal opinion before taking a call on challenging the transfer move in the court of law.

“Legally speaking, there are sufficient grounds for the transfer move to be challenged before the higher courts. If such a challenge is made, it will take some more time before the NIA court starts hearing the case,” said a defence lawyer.

Till then, the special UAPA court in Pune will continue to hear the matter.

318,['29/01/2020'],"Fomento gave truncated RFP docu, MMC tells court","This story is from January 29, 2020

Margao: The Margao Municipal Council (MMC) at the hearing of the Sonsoddo case in the district and sessions court on Tuesday, said that Fomento Green submitted to it a “truncated” copy of its request for proposal (RFP) which, it claimed, was different from the original document.

The RFP was issued by MMC to Fomento in 2009 for setting up the garbage treatment plant, and it was required to be returned to the municipality after filling in the details.

Advancing his arguments in the case, MMC counsel Sandesh Padiyar poked holes in Fomento Green’s appeal to the court that MMC be stopped from bringing waste into the Sonsoddo plant as it was already choked with excluded waste.

Padiyar sought to suggest that if Fomento Green has already stopped operations at the plant, its prayer to restrict MMC from bringing waste to the plant was effectively infructuous.

Padiyar then referred to the RFP submitted by Fomento and pointed out that certain pages and paragraphs from the original document were missing. “It’s truncated,” he said while pointing out missing components, particularly from clauses pertaining to scope of work, relocation of the existing dump and construction of sanitary landfill.

The argument assumes significance as several changes that took place subsequent to the signing of the concession agreement in February 2011 led to a change in the scope of the work of the project, though no addendum to the concession agreement was carried out.

Terming the accusation as “serious”, justice B P Deshpande directed the MMC to place before the court the original RFP.

Countering Fomento’s contention that all changes in the scope of work were made upon the directions of the high-powered coordination committee on Sonsoddo chaired by the chief minister, Padiyar pointed out that the minutes of the HPCC meetings were not placed on record.

The court then directed that minutes of the HPCC meetings also be placed before it within the next three days. It expressed its displeasure over the failure of the Goa State Pollution Control Board to submit its report of the samples of waste collected by it to determine the nature of waste lying inside the plant at Sonsoddo.

The court said it would write to the board, asking to submit the report to it within a week.

The matter was adjourned to February 6 for further arguments.

Sharjeel Imam

PATNA: Sharjeel Imam , the JNU student on the run since January 24 after FIRs were filed against him four states, was arrested by a joint team of Delhi and Bihar Police in Jehanabad around 3 pm on Tuesday. He was produced in a local court, which granted a transit remand of 36 hours to the Delhi Police to take him to the national capital.

The PhD scholar, who reportedly played a key role in the launch of the Shaheen Bagh protest against the CAA, faces charges ranging from sedition to promotion of religious enmity. He was reportedly caught at his ancestral village of Malik Tola in Kako.

“We arrested Sharjeel in the Kako police station area during a joint operation by police personnel from Bihar and Delhi. Earlier, the crime branch of Delhi Police had lodged an FIR against him,” Bihar ADG (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar said, adding, “Further details about him and the case can only be shared by Delhi Police.”

Another officer privy to the operation against the JNU scholar, added, “Prior to Sharjeel’s arrest, police carried out search operations at Sabjibagh, Alamganj and Phulwarisharif (all in Patna) and Jehanabad after a Delhi Police team arrived in the state on Saturday.”

Sources said as part of their search operation, Delhi Police had earlier questioned three member of Sharjeel’s family, including his brother Muzammil Imam.

Sharjeel went into hiding after UP Police slapped a sedition case on him following his inflammatory speech at Aligarh Muslim University where he allegedly said Muslims should cut off Assam from the rest of India. Later, three FIRs were lodged against him in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur.

In a tweet purportedly posted more than an hour after his arrest, Sharjeel claimed that he had given himself up to police. He wrote, “I have surrendered to the Delhi Police on 28.1.2020 at 3 PM. I am ready and willing to operate (sic) with the investigation. I have full faith in due process of law. My safety and security are now in the hand of Delhi Police. Let peace prevail.”

His lawyers, too, released a statement claiming that he surrendered before the Delhi police team at Kako on Tuesday.

“We received Delhi Police summons under Section 160 CrPC on Monday after which we (a team of two lawyers) flew to Patna from Delhi and reached Jehanabad around 2.45pm. We handed over the summons to Sharjeel after which he appeared before the Delhi Police team with us,” Sharjeel’s counsel Ahmad Ibrahim told TOI. He added that Sharjeel was formally arrested after being taken to Kako police station.

“Sharjeel has been brought to Patna by Delhi Police. We will prove in court that he did not say anything seditious,” Ibrahim said, adding, “The FIR lodged by Delhi Police is for several speeches delivered by Sharjeel between December last and January this year.”

Reacting to the arrest, CM Nitish Kumar said, “Anyone who acts like this will be arrested. Nobody should go against national interest and the Constitution. Giving opinion is one thing but saying that they will break the country is impossible,” Nitish said, adding, “No one in this world can break India.”

Locals said Sharjeel’s family is associated with the ruling JD (U). One of them recalled, “Sharjeel’s father, the late Akbar Imam, had lost in the 2005 assembly election when he fought from Jehanabad on a JD (U) ticket. His uncle, Arshad Imam, is a block-level leader of JD(U) at Kako. His brother, Muzammil, is a social worker.”

320,['29/01/2020'],"Revenue mop-up: Soon, pay power bills at ration shops in UP","This story is from January 29, 2020

Representative image

LUCKNOW: Now, you can pay your electricity bills while buying ration at fair price shops in your neighbourhood. This is part of the energy department’s innovative strategy to swiftly mop up revenue, particularly in rural areas, by making ration shops double up as bill payment kiosks.

Once executed, the proposal will allow approximately 80,000 FPS (68,000 in rural areas and 12,000 in urban areas) to act as one-stop bill payment centres.

Talking to TOI, principal secretary, energy, and chairman of UP Power Corporation Limited, Arvind Kumar said since ration shops are frequented by both urban and rural folk, this will allow seamless bill payment through electronic point of sale (e-POS) machines. “The procedure will be transparent and help the corporation boost revenue,” he said.

According to department’s proposal, the collection process will come with incentives to FPS operators. UPPCL proposed that the fair price shops would receive one per cent of the amount paid in every bill. The corporation has fixed the upper limit of Rs 500 per bill. “This would augment income of FPS,” Kumar said. UPPCL also plans to rope in agricultural cooperative societies and self-help groups (SHGs) for collection of electricity bills. “For this, the department would be working in coordination with the rural development department,” said Kumar.

UPPCL’s move to rope in multiple agencies for collection of electricity bills comes in the backdrop of massive power arrears of around Rs 82,000 crore, which have piled up over 20 years since the erstwhile UP State Electricity Board (UPSEB) was disbanded to form three companies relating to power generation, transmission and distribution system in the state.

Kumar said the number of electrified households in last two-and-half years has gone up from 1.8 crore to around 2.8 crore. A major contributor has been schemes like Deendayal Updhayay Rural Electrification Scheme and Saubhagya, which envisages free power connection to rural households. At the same time, cost of power has risen by 15% because of the increase in prices of coal and oil.

Kannur: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has reiterated that the UDF is steadfast to the resolution it plans to introduce in Kerala assembly, urging the President of India to recall governor Arif Mohammed Khan , alleging that he has become the megaphone of the BJP.

Flagging off the ‘Sahana Samara Padyathra’, an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act campaign against the Centre and the state government, led by DCC president Satheesan Pacheni, at Mahe on Tuesday, Chennithala also said that there is an understanding between the government and the governor. If the resolution fails, the UDF would go ahead with legal measures, he added.

“Though other states, including Rajasthan and West Bengal, passed the resolution against CAA, the governors there did not humiliate it but here the Kerala governor has become the megaphone of the BJP, and he is publicly humiliating the resolution by talking against it all over the state. The governor has completely ignored the sentiments of Keralites, and also humiliated them,” Chennithala said.

Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan is silent about it and hence we decided to move the resolution demanding the recall of the governor, said the opposition leader.

“I thought the chief minister would speak against the governor, who rebukes the resolution against CAA, as he has the responsibility to uphold the status of the House. So I waited for one week, but when he remained silent and failed to uphold the status of the House, I, as the opposition leader, decided to give a notice for the resolution,” he said.

If the government is sincere in the campaign against CAA, it should support the resolution planned in the assembly’s budget session, he added.

Meanwhile, K Muraleedharan, MP, who also addressed the function, said the real colours of the chief minister would come to the fore when the governor delivers the policy speech in the budget session.

He too alleged that the chief minister has reached an understanding with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as he is afraid of the verdict in SNC-Lavalin case.

LUCKNOW: To ensure smooth passage for chief minister Yogi Adityanath ’s cavalcade during his proposed visit to Mirzapur, a PWD executive engineer deputed nine teams to stop stray cattle from breaching the CM’s security cordon and VIP movement.

The order may have gone down as just another directive before CM’s visit, except that junior engineers in the district were asked to stand along the VIP route with their teams and armed with ropes to keep stray cattle at bay.

Executive engineer Kanhaiya Jha ’s order went viral on social media, triggering embarrassment to the district administration. Finally, Jha was forced to withdraw the order. “Ukta avar abhiyanta apne gang ko sath 8-10 rassi lekar ingit karyasthal par upasthit rahenge. Yadi awara pashu sadak par ayen toh unko baandh kar rakhein taki mukhyamantri ke avagaman mein koi vyavadhaan na utpan ho. (Junior engineers will remain present with their teams and 8-10 ropes on the designated spot. They must catch hold and tie up stray animal coming in way of the CM’s convoy).

Reacting to the order on Tuesday, Engineers Association of Mirzapur wrote UP PWD official, stating that their engineers were not trained to catch animals. “Who will be responsible if any of them were injured while executing their duty,” the letter stated. “It would be better if the administration deputes this work to some other agency or persons who have the expertise,” the association suggested. The order also gave Opposition parties ammunition to corner BJP on two counts — first inability of the administration to deal with stray cattle and deployment of government employees on bizarre duty.

“BJP is responsible for the stray cattle menace. Apprehending that CM may fall prey to his own folly, the officers went overboard and issued a bizarre order,” said Ajay Kumar Lallu , UP Congress president.

After the embarrassment, DM Sushil Patel directed Kanhaiya Jha to revoke the order. “I came to know about the order on social media and ordered its rollback,” Patel said. In his defence, Kanhaiya Jha said: “The move aimed at ensuring seamless movement of the CM’s cavalcade and those deputed are managers who can multi-task. But now the order has been revoked.”

Chennai: The Centre’s decision to shift the Intellectual Property Appellate Tribunal ( IPAB ) out of Chennai to any north Indian state has come in for flak, with the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry adopting a resolution against the proposal. The Madras Bar Association (MBA) also passed a similar resolution against the controversial proposal.

“IPAB is functioning in Chennai since 2003. Now, it appears that there is a proposal to move the principal bench of IPAB from Chennai to outside of Tamil Nadu. As we have received representation from various bar associations against the move that it would affect the interest of public and the legal fraternity in the state, the council has passed a resolution requesting the Union government not to shift IPAB but to fill the vacant chairperson’s post for its effective functioning,” the council’s chairperson P S Amalraj said.

Expressing a similar view, senior counsel and DMK Rajya Sabha MP P Wilson said: “IPAB exercises powers under the Patent Act, Trade Mark Act and the Geographical Indication Act. Its principal bench has been effectively functioning from Chennai for the past 16 years.”

P Sanjai Gandhi, advocate and president of Intellectual Property Rights Advocates Association, said the IPAB’s track record had been good and there was no compelling reason to disturb it location.

Justice Jagadeesan was the first chairman of IPAB preceded by Justice Prabha Sridhevan and Justice K N Basha. After the term of Justice Basha, the same was not filled for a long period prompting the Bar to move the Supreme Court to direct the Centre to make the appointment immediately. The apex court extended the term of Justice Maninder Singh as chairman by one more year, and asked the Centre about the location of IPAB.

Hyderabad: A person from Hyderabad, who went missing in Dubai in January last year, was found in Abu Dhabi in a mentally unstable condition.

Mohammed Abdul Wahab, 34, with his dishevelled appearance was recognised by another person from Hyderabad who immediately called up his roommates in Dubai to inform them about Wahab found in Abu Dhabi on Monday. He last spoke to his family on January 17 last year.Wahab’s father Mohammed Abdul Gani had written a letter to external affairs minister S Jaishankar to help trace his son.

Wahab worked as a telecom technician in a company and stayed at Mitsubishi building, Daira Dubai. He suddenly disappeared from his room and did not take any of his belongings. Wahab had gone to Dubai three years ago.

“Wahab is unable to speak and is incoherent. He is unable to even recognise us when he was made to speak on the phone with us,” brother Mohammed Abdul Rauf, a resident of Chintal basthi in Khairatabad, told TOI.

According to social worker and MBT leader Amjed Ullah Khan, the Consulate General of India (CGI), Dubai, should step in to help Wahad return to Hyderabad. After Wahab was traced, the company where he worked said it would withdraw the case it had filed against him after he went missing.

“Wahab’s family is poor and cannot afford his return fare. We have written to CGI to help Wahab so that he gets legal clearance as his passport is with his employer. Since he has overstayed, a penalty of Rs 5 lakh will have be paid to the government there. The issue should be taken up by CGI,” Amjed Ullah Khan said.

Kerala health minister KK Shailaja

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As part of offering more loans to women, the government has offered Rs 100 crore additional loan guarantee for The Kerala State Women’s Development Corporation(KSWDC), said health minister K K Shailaja .

The guarantee has been assured by the government so as to obtain more loans from National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation ( NBCFDC ). The corporation originally had only a guarantee of Rs 140 crore to avail loans from the national financial corporations which the present government enhanced by an additional Rs 350.56 crore, the minister said. The minister added that the corporation also began offering loans to women from scheduled tribes during the current government’s tenure.

With more guarantee provided by the government, the corporation will be able to avail more loans and thereby disburse more loans to women for self-entrepreneurship at reasonable interest rates, the minister said. The state women’s development corporation is the channelizing agency of multiple agencies of Centre and state government to ensure financial empowerment of women in the state through providing loans at affordable interest rates for the past 30 years.

After the present government came to power, the corporation has been able to offer various services to as many as six lakh women through various schemes.

CLEARED SKHER

Kolhapur: The state government has approved the proposal to set up a new drama theatre with a seating capacity of 2,000.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar , after a meeting with the district authorities, declared that several proposals pertaining to the city’s development had been accepted. “There was a proposal to develop a new drama theatre in Kolhapur . We have approved it and the provisions for the funds will be made,” he said.

Last year, a delegation of the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation had met Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar and sought funds for new drama theatre. Pawar had agreed to take up the issue with the state government and asked the KMC to draw a plan and design for the theatre in the meantime.

At present, there is only one theatre — Keshavrao Bhosale Natygruha — in the city. It was recently renovated at a cost of Rs 6 crore in the first phase.

Civic officials said the new theatre could come up in the E ward, near the government circuit house. Land in its vicinity had been identified for the purpose, an official said, requesting anonymity.

On Tuesday, district guardian minister Satej Patil said the work to develop the theatre will start in next three months. “The theatre will be a multi-purpose complex having facilities to hold several activities in its premises,” he said.

Patil added that artists have suggested some changes to the Keshavrao Bhosale Natygruha, for which, a comprehensive meeting will be held soon.

Among other announcements, Pawar said that Rs 5 crore would be released to develop facilities at Mahalaxmi temple. Also, the plan to beautify the Rankala and Kalamba lake will be drafted. Pawar said that he would personally speak with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray regarding the proposal to build a memorial of Shahu Maharaj at abandoned complex of Shahu Mill in the city.

330,['29/01/2020'],BJP’s first protest march for complete loan waiver,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Kolhapur: The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) district unit took out a huge protest march from Dasara Chowk to Collectors Office demanding complete loan waiver for farmers affected by floods last year.

The state government has decided to waive off loans of up to Rs 2 lakh. The BJP; however, claims that before coming to power, Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) had assured complete loan waiver and that they are not keeping their promise.

The march was attended by farmers from the district. Huge police security was deployed along the route and at the Collectors Office. This was the first protest march of BJP after the Maha Vikas Agahadi came to power.

BJP state president Chandrakant Patil said, “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray should tell us difference between hectare and acre and what does FRP (fair and remunerative price) mean. The loan waiver decision has been taken without any study or calculation. The affected farmers have got no relief. When we were in power, we gave Rs 50,000 grant to those farmers who paid the loan amount regularly. The farmers who suffered crop loss due to untimely rains have not been considered in the loan waiver.”

BJP district president Samarjit Ghatge lashed out at ministers Satej Patil and Hasan Mushrif stating that they both have not provided satisfactory answers to the questions raised over the loan waiver scheme.

“We expect remuneration up to Rs 1 lakh to the farmers paying the loan amount regularly. Guardian minister Satej Patil requested us to discuss the issue before taking out the protest march. We have requested him that if the government comes up with a resolution to waive off the entire loan amount of farmers, we will take back the protest march. If our demands are not met, we will protest outside Mantralay under the leadership of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.”

The protesters demanded that the terms and conditions such as no loan waiver for the person who both working in a co-operative institute as well as carries out farming, loan dues with micro-finance companies should be withdrawn.

331,['29/01/2020'],Commercial properties on rent to undergo scrutiny,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Done

Kolhapur: The Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) is going to initiate random scrutiny of commercially-rented properties after receiving several complaints regarding less tax being charged on such properties.

The KMC has found two such commercially-rented properties for which the tax has been charged less as per the rates decided by the civic body. The tax for commercially-rented properties is more in comparison with commercial and residential properties that have not been given on rent.

Charging less tax for commercially rented properties leads to huge loss of revenue to the KMC. A senior official of property tax department said, “We have received complaints of around 80 commercially-rented properties where the tax charged was as per the properties that have not been given on rent. This leads to loss of revenue. We have found two such properties. Officials ignoring such cases will be fined and tax will be recovered from the owners of the commercially-rented properties.”

Properties rented for the commercial purposes are banks, ATMs, shopping outlets and offices of the private firms. Recently, civic activists claimed that the property tax department staff runs a nexus with owners of the commercially-rented properties.

“Changes are edited in the online software by designating the property as owned property rather than commercially-rented property which automatically reduces the tax bill,” a civic official said.

“We have stopped the online system for a while. We will scrutinise all commercially-rented properties and if we find any discrepancies, a bill of the additional amount will be issued to the owner,” he added.

Last year, after demand from the trader’s body, the KMC had reduced property tax on the commercially-rented properties.

Kozhikode: IUML has suspended a party leader who participated in the anti-CAA human chain organized by the LDF on Sunday.

K M Basheer, vice-president of the IUML’s Beypore mandalam committee, was suspended from the party, pending inquiry, by the state committee for violating party discipline.

Party leader M K Muneer said that disciplinary action was taken against Basheer as his statements violated party discipline. “He justified it and said that he would repeat such activities. Such remarks violated party discipline, necessitating the disciplinary action,” Muneer added.

IUML Kozhikode district president Ummer Pandikasala said that besides participating in the LDF’s human chain, Basheer made public statements through news channels against IUML and UDF, and behaved in a manner challenging the party which is why Beypore mandalam committee recommended disciplinary action and the party district committee endorsed it.

Meanwhile, Basheer reiterated that there was nothing wrong in participating in LDF’s human chain against CAA as IUML had not issued any direction to party workers against attending it.

“Everyone will have to join together in this agitation, today or tomorrow. IUML leader M K Muneer and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala had stood together with chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the joint agitation against CAA held in Thiruvananthapuram. The people of Kerala wish to have that kind of unity and do not favour attempts to disrupt it for vote bank politics,” he added.

CPM district secretary P Mohanan said that the controversy revealed the uncertainty within IUML over the issue. “If IUML starts disciplinary action against party leaders and workers for participating in the LDF’s human chain, then it will have to act against thousands,” he added.

333,['29/01/2020'],Trans couple runs from pillar to post to register their marriage,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Coimbatore: Despite the Madras high court ruling in their favour nine months ago, a trans couple in the city has been running from pillar to post to get their marriage registered for the past two years.

On April 22 last year, the Madras high court ruled that the term “bride” under the Hindu Marriage Act includes transwomen and directed authorities to register a marriage between a man and a transgender.

But register offices in the city have been turning away the couple claiming that the computing system has still not been changed to allow registration of a transgender as a bride.

R Manikandan and Surekha, a transgender, tied the knot at Paranjothi Mariamman Temple on Mettupalayam Road in 2018.

“A few months after our wedding, we decided to get it registered. We first approached the district register office within the collector office and submitted an application for the registration,” says Manikandan.

“We submitted all documents including both our Aadhar cards, voter ID cards, our photographs from the temple and a certificate from the temple, but they sent us away stating they will get back to us,” says the 25-year-old who works as an autorickshaw driver.

Surekha, who works in a dairy farm in Narasimanaickenpalayam, says she has also submitted the other documents like proof of name change and getting it printed in the gazette, certificate and proof of the sex change surgery she underwent among others.

“We received no reply from them. After the court ruling, we again went four times, but they said they have not received a government order yet and once they receive it, they will contact us themselves,” she said. After giving up on the district register office, the couple approached the Vadavalli register office on January 21 and applied again for registering their marriage. On the next day, the Vadavalli register office wrote to the couple stating that they cannot register their marriage because under Section 5(111) of the Indian Marriage Act, the word bride literally means a woman who just got married or is going to be married. “The word transgender finds no place in the act,” they added.

“They replied saying that they can’t register the marriage but have advised us to approach the collector and the district register office, and get a special order directing them to register the office,” Manikandan said.

The couple says they want the registration because it gives them and their relationship legal protection. “I don’t have my parents or any siblings, because I left home as a child. I also need some legal family,” says Surekha.

“They ask for marriage registration certificate for even small things like applying for an electricity board connection, a passport, opening a joint bank account,” says Manikandan. “Importantly we want to adopt a child and start a family in a few years after we are more financially settled. That too can’t happen without registering our marriage,” he said.

Kolhapur: A proposal to divide the land of Jayprabha Studio into two parts — one open space purportedly for development and another part as a heritage site — has been made to the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC).

The proposal has angered local artists and actors. Former actor and Congress corporator Surekha Shah had sought information about the proposal from the town planning department. The department has accepted that a proposal to divide the Jayprabha Studio land has been made by power of attorney. Deputy town planner Narayan Bhosale confirmed that such a proposal has been made and the department has prepared a report that will be tabled before the general body.

Already, the general body has decided to not to allow non-film activities at the Jayprabha Studio. The studio and the land are owned by veteran singer Lata Mangeshkar. She had moved a petition in civil court that granted her permission to develop the open space last year. Akhil Bhartiya Chitrapat Mahamandal had demanded that Mangeshkar not be allowed to develop the site, claiming that already seven acres of the 10-acre site has been developed for residential and commercial purposes and there should no further encroachment.

Congress corporator Shah said: “The studio is a heritage building and we want the site to be used only for film-related activities. The site should be protected. Once the development activities start, no one can be able to protect it. I will raise the issue in the GB meeting.”

The local court had upheld Mangeshkar’s that the property was bought by her in an auction. Her legal counsel then maintained that no other person, institute or the government can claim the right over the property and that the heritage site has not been damaged nor the property is sold to another person.

336,['29/01/2020'],Government considers capping number of floors in high-rises in core Bengaluru,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Government says limiting the height of highrises will ease stress on existing infrastructure

BENGALURU: The government is in the process of formulating a policy to limit the height of high-rises in core areas of Bengaluru city — the entire area within the Peripheral Ring Road — in a bid to ease stress on existing infrastructure. The decision appears especially driven by the slow pace of building mass transit systems such as the Metro. Bengaluru has a population density of 4,381 per square km as per the 2011 population census.

Urban development department (UDD) officials say they are considering “limiting the number of floors” permitted for construction. “However, this is in correlation to the government’s policy of transit oriented development (TOD) and challenges with regard to stress on basic infrastructure within city limits,” said a senior UDD official.

UDD sources say a decision on capping the number of floors in high-rise structures will be taken in consultation with the fire service department, which must sign-off on multistory constructions. Another criterion is the extent of public transport available and the load-carrying capacity.

“As per the TOD policy, depending on available public transport and the extent of carriageway, we will allow an increased number of floors. But this has to be matched with the basic infrastructure challenge,” said the UDD official.

However, urban experts believe sanction for high-rise structures must be in correlation with the extent of public transport available. Urban expert RK Misra told TOI it will be far more difficult for the government to provide infrastructure if the city expands horizontally.

But Misra did sound a word of caution, saying: “However, vertical development will work only with efficient transport infrastructure.”

Some urban experts were derisive of the move, saying decisions with regard to high-rises is purely based on pressure from the real estate industry, which cannot afford land in core city areas and thus want to develop on the outskirts.

PATNA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar and senior JD (U) leader Prashant Kishor seemed all set to part ways after they indulged in a war of words on Tuesday. The former said the poll strategist is “free to leave” and the latter hit back calling his party boss “a liar”.It all began when Nitish, while talking to the media here, said, “I don’t have any problem if he (Kishor) wants to leave the party. But if he wants to stay, then he will have to follow the basic structure of the party.”He added, “Rahega to theek, nahi rahega to theek.” He further said, “Someone (referring to Varma) wrote a letter and I responded to it. Someone is tweeting, let him (Kishor) tweet. What can I do about it? People can stay in the party till the time they want. They are free to go whenever they feel like.”Nitish reminded Kishor that he was inducted in the JD (U) on the recommendations of Union home minister Amit Shah . “Amit Shah Ji told me to take him in the party. But he (Kishor) works for different kinds of people as a (poll) strategist. He is now working for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He might have ambitions to go places. He is free to go,” the CM said.Soon after this, Kishor, in a tweet, hit back at Nitish, saying, “@NitishKumar, what a fall for you to lie about how and why you made me join JDU !! Poor attempt on your part to try and make my colour same as yours! And if you are telling the truth who would believe that you still have courage not to listen to someone recommended by @AmitShah? (sic).”Earlier also, Nitish, on many occasions, had said, JD (U) admitted Kishor in its fold in September, 2018 at the “advice of Amit Shah.” He even accused Kishor of not losing any opportunity to attack the Centre’s policies, including CAA, NPR and NRC.",patna,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73717754,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-457182,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/patna/prashant-exit-certain-after-spat-with-nitish/articleshow/73709541.cms

Representative image

KOCHI: The state government has the responsibility to implement the Supreme Court’s verdict in the Orthodox-Jacobite fued over church control without losing its spirit, the high court said on Tuesday.

The government cannot raise an objection to implementing the apex court’s verdict in favour of Orthodox faction citing law and order issues and it should issue clear directions for implementing the verdict, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque directed.

A petition seeking police protection for conducting religious rituals at St Stephen’s Church at Koothattukulam is being considered by the court. The petition was filed by Kochuparambil Geevarghese Ramban and priest Rajan George, who belong to the Orthodox faction, through senior advocate S Sreekumar.

Ordering the government to provide police protection to conduct religious rituals, the court said police should not prevent believers of the parish who peacefully attend the services at the church.

In the petition, it was alleged that police are not providing protection despite there being a judgment in favour of the Orthodox faction. Therefore, the high court should issue an order granting police protection for entering and conducting religious services at the church, the chapel, and the cemetery.

During the hearing, the court pointed out that as the apex court’s order exists, the lower court should be moved for implementation of the order, instead of filing a separate civil suit. However, petitions seeking police protection are being regularly filed. It is the state government that has to implement the SC judgment and it cannot desist from implementing the judgment citing law and order issues.

Further, the court said the government should be aware about the law and order issue that may arise while trying to implement the right of one faction. The issue won’t be solved by the court issuing an order for providing police protection. Police should be willing to extend support in implementing the order. As it is a law and order issue, the government should inform its stance, the court directed while scheduling a hearing on February 11. State government, district collector, and state police chief should inform their views regarding the demands made in the petition, the court said.

Chandigarh: The suspected patient of novel coronavirus (nCoV) admitted to PGI is stable and no organ dysfunction has been reported, doctors said on Tuesday. The patient will remain in the hospital till the National Institute of Virology, Pune, sends its report.

Dr Vikas Suri, internal medicine department, PGI said, “The patient has travelled to various provinces of China from January 16. He was 800km away from Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus. He returned to India on January 22 and developed fever on January 26.

He said, “The patient had recurrent fever and he reported to the emergency with his wife. His vitals were fine. We took his family detail and quarantined his daughter, wife and mother at home.”

“As the family members have no symptoms, as per the protocols, we have home quarantined them,” said Dr Suri.

The Pune institute has received the throat swab and blood samples of the patient. “We have sent the samples for both H1N1 and nCoV tests. This is the season for influenza as well,” said Dr Suri.

“The blood samples will try and find the antigens. As this is a new virus, it is not known if it will enter the blood stream or not,” said Dr Gagandeep Grover, state programme officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, Punjab,

The suspected patient is under observation in the communicable diseases and isolation ward in PGI. “There are some recent studies in the Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine, which report that unlike the H1N1, this virus does not affect the throat but causes pneumonia. However, this is in a very small sample and cannot be generalized,” said Dr Suri. He said, “We can only focus on prevention by maintaining hygiene and regular hand wash.”

The NIV is the only authorized laboratory for testing the virus in the country. “We had a video-conferencing with the Union health secretary on Monday. It was informed that the NIV is receiving daily around 50 samples from all states,” said Dr Suri.

341,['29/01/2020'],Anti-CAA rally gridlocks city for two hours; BRTS suspended too,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Hubballi: A massive protest rally against the Citizenship Amendment Act brought traffic to a halt in the central business district for two hours on Tuesday. Scores of commuters, especially rail and bus passengers, were stranded as bus services were suspended until movement eased.

The rally against CAA, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register was organised by various Dalit organisations under the aegis of Vividh Dalit Sangha-Sansthegala Mahamandal. Addressing the protesters, Hubballi-Dharwad East MLA Prasad Abbayya said the Centre was trying to divide the country on religious and caste lines.

Offering garlands to Ambedkar’s statue, hundreds of agitators set off from Ambedkar Circle and passed through Lamington Road, Sangolli Rayanna Circle and Channamma Circle to reached Mini Vidhana Soudha.

“The government is playing a game with the Dalits and minorities of the nation. It says CAA was amended in the past also. But the Centre should remember that Congress never amended it on grounds of religion and caste,” Abbayya said.

Mahamandal convener Gurunath Ullikashi alleged that the NDA government had implemented CAA to cover up its failure on development. “Amit Shah, during his recent visit to Hubballi, said 70% of refugees are Dalits. By issuing such a statement, he is again trying to divide Dalits, who are deprived of jobs, healthcare and other rights,” Ullikashi said.

Dalit leader Pitambarappa Bilar, former minister AM Hidasgeri, former mayor Venkatesh Mestri, former corporators Ganesh Tagargunti, Altaf Kittur, Congress leaders Anilkumar Patil, Altaf Hallur, NWKRTC former chairman Sadanand Danganavar, Samvidhan Suraksha Samiti’s Vijay Guntral, Anwar Mudhol, Ashraf Ali, Ismail Kalebudde and Devanand Jagapur were present at the rally.

Police diverted vehicles arriving from Gadag road at railway underbridge via Keshwapur and vehicles arriving from Hosur at Swimming Pool Complex. As buses were stopped, passengers headed to the Old Bus Stand and railway station ended up getting fleeced by auto-rickshaw drivers.

BRTS Mess

Though BRTS services were suspended, staff of BRTS counter at Yatri Hotel near BSNL office had issued tickets to passengers. “BRTS staff issued tickets, saying we could travel by any BRTS or NWKRTC bus, whichever comes first. But when the NWKRTC bus arrived, they did not allow us to board and said we should wait for BRTS bus. This is just their way of making money,” said Veeranna Raichur, a passenger. No refund was offered and passengers were forced to wait for the BRTS buses.

Traffic controller GR Renake said tickets were issued since BRTS buses were expected to ply. “We were helpless as buses were halted on way due to the protest,” he said.

342,['29/01/2020'],39 gram panchayats told to prepare sewage treatment plan,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Kolhapur: Aman Mittal, the Kolhapur zilla parishad’s chief executive officer (CEO), has warned the gram panchayat officials of around 39 villages — that are located along the Panchaganga river and are mainly responsible for the river’s pollution — to prepare a plan for sewage treatment by February 10.

He said if these gram panchayat officials fail to comply, they will face strict action.

Mittal told TOI that the villages have been given the deadline to produce the sewage treatment plan , which will be approved by month-end.

Uday Gaikwad, an environmental activist, said various industries are responsible for 10% of Panchaganga’s pollution. Almost 90% of the pollution is caused by effluents from the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC), Ichalkaranji municipal council and 174 gram panchayats. Out of these 174 gram panchayats, 39 need immediate attention and, therefore, the officials have been asked to prepare the plan.

“The pollution from sugar mills and other industrial units has dropped a lot in recent times. But when it comes to the villages, there needs to be an effective way of treating the sewage water. Unfortunately, the villages have not taken any initiative so far. This needs to change. The pollution control board had served notices to these villages in the past,” he said.

“The District Planning and Development Committee (DPDC) has already allotted around Rs 22 crore for the STPs, so there is nothing to worry about in terms of funding,” he added.

It has to be noted that the Panchaganga originates from Prayag Chikhali, 8km from Kolhapur, and is formed by four tributaries — Kumbhi, Kasari, Tulsi and Bhogavati. Around one million people from urban and rural areas are dependent on Panchaganga for their daily water needs.

Kolhapur: After a long wait of ten years, the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) has finally got the land for setting up a training centre at Nandwal village in Kolhapur district.

The state government has sanctioned 115-acre land from Karveer taluka to the IRB. In October 2010, several villages from Kolhapur district were identified but everyone objected to the plan of setting up a training centre.

The government has, however, put some conditions which include making available the 12-meter road to the identified site. The social forestry department has done tree plantation at several places in the identified location and the government has asked the concerned authorities to do the construction activities without harming the plantation done in the region.

The IRB will conduct a survey of the land through a government surveyor and get approval of the construction plan from the concerned department. The will be further looking after the growth of these plants.

After the state government decided to set up an IRB unit in Kolhapur, the Kolhapur Zilla Parishad had identified Rendal village from Hatkanangle for setting up the unit. The area was around 175 acres and was identified for the training centre.

However, the villagers were adamant to only lease the land. The government officials then chose land from Dindnerli village but here too villagers denied land for the project. Even after repeated attempts to convince the villagers, they remained adamant.

Later the villagers from Radhanagari taluka came forward with a proposal to set up the IRB unit but the proposal was not accepted due to the geographical location of the unit as it was necessary for the unit to act quickly during emergency situations in the district.

There were also options of Majale village (Hatkanangle taluka) and Tamdalge village (Shirol taluka) but things didn’t materialise on those aspects. Finally, the land from Nandwal village was chosen for setting unit of IRB.

According to sources, the IRB unit in Kolhapur is a must as it will act as an additional force of trained personnel in maintaining law and order during emergency situations.

KOLHAPUR: Karveer police have registered a case against 14 directors of KMT workers cooperative society from Pachgaon for allegedly siphoning of Rs 7 lakh by submitting fake bills .

Police have registered a case against them under sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code.

According to police, the alleged scam took place between the years 2016 and 2017.

“The suspects were directors of the cooperative society when the fraud has been reported. The incident came to light after the government approved auditor conducted the audit of the society for the financial year 2016-17 and found the discrepancies in the accounts of the society,” a police officer attached with Karveer police station said.

“The suspects withdrew money from the society by showing some works and expenses but did not submit proper bills. They had also constructed a temple on the premises of the society, but had not taken prior approval from the authorities concerned. The expenses cannot be included in the audit of the society as per the rule,” he said, adding that they are investigating the case in detail and will take appropriate action against the suspects.

Nagpur: After a delay of 144 days, Reach III of Nagpur Metro (Sitabuldi to Lokmanya Nagar stretch) was flagged off by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday. The first train on the Aqua Line, as the East-West corridor is called, chugged out of the Subhash Nagar station for Sitabuldi inter-change.

The line was to open on Sept 7 last year by prime minister Narendra Modi but the function was put off following heavy rain warning in Nagpur. MahaMetro has since been waiting for dates from VIPs to open the line.

The 11-km stretch between Lokmanya Nagar and Sitabuldi inter-change was thrown open for public commencing Nagpur Metro’s East-west run that was named Aqua as it runs along the scenic Ambazari lake and Nag River, before passing by Gandhisagar.

Like Thackeray, Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri too participated in the flagging off ceremony through video link. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Home minister Anil Deshmukh, minister of urban development and public works Eknath Shinde, dairy development and animal husbandry minister Sunil Kedar, guardian minister Nitin Raut, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and mayor Sandip Joshi were also present.

The first commercial run on Aqua Line started at 2pm on Tuesday. From Wednesday onwards, trains will run from 8am to 8pm. Initially, they will depart after every 30 minutes in both directions. Only 6 stations — Lokmanya Nagar, Vasudev Nagar, Subhash Nagar, Institution of Engineers, Jhansi Rani Square and Sitabuldi Interchange — are operational.

Under Maha Vikas Aghadi government, the inaugural function saw potpourri of politicians of different parties sharing the dais. Everyone tried to take credit for Metro’s achievement. Kedar, who belongs to Congress, reminded the gathering the Metro was planned during the tenure of CM Vilas Deshmukh. Raut, also from Congress, gave credit to Prithviraj Chavan for bringing Metro to Nagpur. Former CM Devendra Fadnavis from BJP thanked the people of Nagpur for bearing with the his government as the Metro work was under way.

Deshmukh, Shinde and Raut also took a ride in the inaugural train post the flag off event.

Thackeray, while addressing the gathering via video link, urged Union minister Nitin Gadkari to support the current government in more such developmental works. “Works like Samruddhi Mahamarg, which we (Shiv Sena and BJP) started during our previous regime, would be carried on with equal vigour. Though we (Sena and BJP) aren’t boarding same trains, we can at least halt at same stations and plan things,” the CM said.

Emphasizing the word ‘Majhi’ in ‘Majhi Metro’, the name given by the agency to Nagpur Metro, Thackeray urged the Nagpurians to keep Metro clean as it was their property too. Congratulating Nagpur Metro for being the greenest, the CM also added the development should be done but not at the cost of harming the environment.

Gadkari heaped praises on MahaMetro MD Brijesh Dixit and said that he would soon felicitate the MD in a public function.

Durga Shankar Mishra, secretary, Housing and Urban Affairs, read out a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulating MahaMetro and citizens of Nagpur. “The expansion of Nagpur Metro Rail Project will bring new areas of Nagpur on Metro map. This will help fulfil the collective aspirations of the region and also open new vistas of opportunities for the people,” Modi wrote.

While politicians took potshots in their speeches, there was also camaraderie on display. When Dixit was about to welcome Fadnavis with a bouquet, the former CM urged Dixit to go by the protocol and welcome Kedar first. The Congressman, however, refused to stand up and urged Dixit to welcome Fadnavis first. The healthy banter carried on for a few more seconds until Fadnavis accepted the bouquet from Dixit.

348,['29/01/2020'],"Nagpur, Chandrapur, Wardha dist plans cut by Rs446.88cr","This story is from January 29, 2020

Nagpur: The shift in centre of power back to Western Maharashtra in the state has begun to show. Unlike previous Devendra Fadnavis government that favoured the backward region of Vidarbha, the new government has made massive cuts in district plans for at least three Vidarbha districts, including Nagpur. Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has reduced the annual plan expenditure for Nagpur, Chandrapur, and Wardha districts by Rs446.88 crore for 2020-21 compared to previous year. Nagpur districts plan size was slashed by Rs225.48 crore, Chandrapur’s by Rs151.4 crore and Wardha’s by Rs 70 crore.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, who addressed media in city on Tuesday, justified the cut saying Fadnavis and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had diverted funds meant for other districts to favour their native places against the norms. He blamed BJP for allocating Rs112 crore more to Sindhudurg, as one of the BJP’s ministers of state hailed from there. He later clarified his government didn’t cut allocation of both districts for this financial year (2019-20).

In recent District Planning Committee’s (DPC) meeting under guardian minister Nitin Raut, a proposal to increase the expenditure by Rs 125 crore in addition to already allocated Rs 525 crore was sent to the government. As against this, Pawar, who holds finance minister, allocated Rs104.22 crore more to his Pune, where he is the guardian minister, as per reports. Earlier government had granted Rs520.78 crore for Pune, which Pawar increased to Rs625 crore.

Pawar said Fadnavis government had reduced the funds of Mumbai by Rs37 crore, Pune by Rs310 crore, Nashik by Rs196 crore and Aurangabad by Rs91 crore, totalling Rs651 crore.

Speaking after DPC review meeting, Pawar admitted guardian minister Nitin Raut, home minister Anil Deshmukh and other ministers were upset over cut in Nagpur’s pan size. “All three ministers expect their constituencies should get good allocation compared to what last government gave, as voters would otherwise question them for reduced funds. Though, I was unable to meet their expectations, I managed to satisfy other guardian ministers in state.”

Pawar added the allocation proposed by his department wasn’t final until approved by the cabinet and CM Uddhav Thackeray. “The proposed expenditure is fixed taking into the consideration population (30%), area (30%), human development index (HDI) (20%) and other factors. Last government had proposed an expenditure of Rs9,000 crore which we proposed to increase to Rs9,500 crore in next fiscal.”

The Baramati MLA said among all districts Gadchiroli, Washim, Osmanabad and Nandurbar were found with less capita income. MVA government would be allocating special funds to them to bring them at par with other districts.

“We have decided to give sufficient money to Naxalited affected Gadchiroli district as demanded by its guardian minister Eknath Shinde and other public representatives. Similarly, three towns in Chandrapur and Gondia, where Maoist presence is there would also get increased funds. Shinde pointed out Gadchiroli cops were finding it difficult to move in absence of sufficient vehicles, so government has decided to allocate up to Rs2 crore for vehicles. We are allocating Rs15 crore more for building homes for families of policemen so they can effectively fight the Naxalites.”

On Wardha, despite the cut, the deputy CM said since the nation was celebrating Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary, the government had decided to earmark more funds to the district. “Even centre has planned some programmes to celebrate the occasion. Wardha had close relations with the Father of the Nation,” he said. However, officials from his department disclosed Wardha’s funds were reduced from Rs190 crore to Rs120 crore.

Stressing that no injustice would be caused to Vidarbha and Nagpur, the second capital of state, Pawar said government needed to ensure equal distribution to all 36 districts as per set formula. “I was finance minister for four years and Jayant Patil for nine years but we never granted more funds to particular districts by reducing allocation of others,” he said.

349,['29/01/2020'],Metro BG to Gadchiroli will help end Maoist terror: Shinde,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Nagpur: Extension of the proposed broad gauge (BG) project of MahaMetro to Wadsa will offer faster connectivity to mofussil areas in the region which in turn will help eradicate Maoist terror, which has plagued Gadchiroli district for over three decades, said urban development and public works minister Eknath Shinde.

Shinde, who is also guardian minister of Maoist-affected Gadchiroli, was speaking at the inauguration of AquaLine of MahaMetro Reach III in the city on Tuesday.

The minister sounded hopeful that the broad gauge project will prove to be a boon as it will offer better transport facilities to the people. This will boost economic activities benefiting the residents even in remote parts. Once economic activities pick up, the prevailing frustration among youths living under the shadow of Maoist terror will also be a thing of the past, he said.

Union minister of road transport & highways Nitin Gadkari said MahaMetro’s broad gauge would offer faster connectivity to mofussil towns like Narkhed to Bhandara, Gondia to Chandrapur, Ramtek to Bhandara and Saoner to Wadsa in Gadchiroli. “Metro trains on the broad gauge would run faster and would also be cheaper as the cost of running it is lesser,” he said.

State government under former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had already initiated steps in this direction and it needs a decisive push now for the broad gauge to become a reality soon, said Gadkari.

State home minister Anil Deshmukh too highlighted the efficacy of taking the MahaMetro’s broad gauge to places like Saoner, Bhiwapur, Nagbhid and so on as it will help develop smaller towns in the region.

Other guards rushed to the spot, rescued her and caught hold of the two. The two were arrested and later released on bail.

On August 29, 2019, an attendant of a patient had lost her cool when she was told to sit outside a ward in GMCH. The woman allegedly attacked a woman security guard and manhandled a woman cop as well.

Udhagamandalam: To create greater awareness among local residents and tourists about littering in public places in the Nilgiris, the Nilgiris administration has produced an audio-visual clipping for circulation. The song accompanying the 3-minute visual has been sung by collector J Innocent Divya and P Babu, project director, Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihood Mission. It was released on Sunday.

“The audio-visual is part of our ‘Clean Nilgiris’ programme. Even at the first meeting of the representatives of the local body held recently, the focus was mainly on cleanliness of our surroundings,” said Divya, perhaps the first collector to render her voice for a song on awareness.

“It was a wonderful experience to sing a song on a concept which the Nilgiris is focusing on,” said Divya, who has learnt Carnatic music during her school days.

According to Divya, the audio was recorded in an hour at her camp office after her office hours. “The quality of the video will be enhanced further by incorporating more of nativity and involving local communities,” she said.

This is the first time an audio-visual product on littering has been developed by the administration, Babu said. “Since the past three months we have been planning this project. We thought if the collector renders her voice the reach will be more.”

He said the song was inspired by the Hindi number, ‘Pekho math’ awareness based song on littering.

Babu, who has penned the Tamil lyrics for the song, said the tune was taken from the Hindi song.

Interestingly, the music for the Hindi song ‘Pekho math’ was inspired by the Michael Jackson number ‘Beat it’.

“Besides posting it on social media, we are planning to screen it in theatres in Ooty and Wellington,” said Babu.

On March 8, 2019, a VCD was released by the Nilgiris administration on the Nilgiris titled, ‘I love Nilgiris’.

Littering is prohibited in the Nilgiris and it would attract a fine of Rs1,000.

On the highways road within the boundary of the Nilgiris district, dustbins are located every one kilometer to keep the forest areas litter-free.

Chandigarh: Two juveniles accused of heinous crimes have converted a barren land into an orchard in Sector 53, planting 150 fruit-bearing trees and nurturing them on their own.

Following the directions of a local court, the two — 15-year-old and 16-year-old — were attached with the UT forest department to undergo their punishment and reformation period of a year. The two were members of a gang that committed dacoities. The juveniles told TOI they had committed petty crimes and never knew they could gain confidence by working in the Sector 53 nursery.

“We have understood that we were in bad company. Now, in six months, we have created life here by nurturing and looking after trees, watering them, taking their care and watching them grow. Our efforts will help the environment and these trees will provide fruits to people. I have also got a part-time job enabling me to contribute financially to my family,” said one of the juveniles.

Abdul Qayum, deputy conservator forests, UT, said the department received directions from the court to make the two work in the field of environment and submit weekly report. “We were directed to reform them, give them tasks and teach them how to grow trees and flowers. The idea was to bring them into the mainstream and divert their minds of crime. We made them realise that being part of creativity is like serving mankind. They were given social work and they responded positively,” he said. The forest department provided them guidance, tools, space and saplings. They were asked to toil on their own on the barren land. Qayum said, “They have planted 150 various fruit bearing trees covering approximately 1,000 square meters of land converting. “When the boys came they were scared, could hardly speak and used to shiver, but now their body language has changed; they are confident,” he said.

The two boys had been serving their time under the supervision of Prabhunath Shahi at the nursery. Prabhunath said, “One of the juvenile is here for five months and the other for two. The first one has planted and nurtured 65 trees and the other planted 85 trees. They have shown a lot of improvement and positivity in their character. We motivated them daily and monitored their progress.” He said they have planted trees like amla, mango, guava, jamun, arjun, papaya, blackberry, desi mango and bel. They said that by doing this they have overcome their past life, he said.

Under the aegies of Madya Nisheda Andolan, women stand in Krishna river demanding liquor ban in Karnataka

BAGALKOT: Scores of women stood in waist to neck-deep cold water of Krishna river on the chilly morning of Tuesday at Kudala Sangama of Hungund taluk in Bagalkot, demanding a liquor ban in the state.

As part of the unique protest organised by Madhya Nished Andolan Karnataka , nearly 2,000 women from different walks of life congregated at Kudala Sangama and staged a protest, while 200 women took part in a “Jala-Satyagraha” holding placards and shouting slogans for over five hours.

The protest is part of the organisation’s week-long campaign seeking a ban on liquor in the state, spearheaded by women.

Speaking to TOI, campaign organiser Swarna Bhat said, “We have launched a week-long protest in Kudal Sangam which will continue till January 30.”

“More than 51 organisations are part of our campaign. Two months ago, chief minister BS Yediyurappa had assured that he will meet us to discuss our demands, but he has failed to act on it. We request the chief minister to meet our representatives immediately,” she said.

“Alcoholism has shattered the homes of these women, stolen childhoods, pushed the rural households into poverty. Government is turning a deaf ear to their demand and so, we have launched the campaign again...If the CM refuses to meet us again, we will intensify the campaign,” Bhat said.

“We want Karnataka to ban liquor in single phase, unlike Andhra Pradesh government’s plan to do it in phases,” she added.

The demand for total prohibition in the state is not new. Last year, the outfit had organised a padayatra from Chitradurga to Bengaluru demanding a ban on the sale of liquor in the state.

BENGALURU: Ramesh Jarkiholi on Tuesday demanded that he and all the newly elected MLAs, who won the bypolls after defecting from the Congress and JD(S), be inducted into the cabinet — likely on January 31 — as promised by chief minister BS Yediyurappa.

""We are hoping all 11 MLAs will be made ministers,"" Jarkiholi said. ""That is what the BJP and the CM promised us and we hope they will keep their promise."" This is the first time Jarkiholi has spoken in public on cabinet berths, ever since reports surfaced of the party high command not being in favour of inducting all the turncoats into the council of ministers.

Jarkiholi also said fellow rebel AH Vishwanath should be given a ministerial berth.

Vishwanath, formerly of the JD(S), had lost the bypolls. Jarkiholi said the rebellion would not have succeeded had it not been for Vishwanath.

""Those of us who rebelled against the JD(S)-Congress coalition government got a shot in the arm when Vishwanath supported us,"" Jarkiholi said. ""It is imperative that we support him,"" he said, even as he sought to distance himself from comments made by newly-elected MLAs ST Somashekar and D Sudhakar, who said Vishwanath cannot demand a ministerial post.

Meanwhile, the BJP issued another deadline — January 31 — to expand the cabinet. ""In all likelihood, cabinet expansion will take place on Friday,"" said an aspirant for a berth. But several BJP functionaries are skeptical of meeting the new deadline.

""Till now, the CM has not been given the green signal by the high command. This is all I can say,"" said a senior minister in Yediyurappa’s cabinet, while insisting he wouldn’t be surprised if the exercise was postponed till the Delhi elections are over.

Former minister and independent R Shankar, who along with Mahesh Kumatalli and Shrimant Patil accompanied Jarkiholi to a trip to Nanjangud, Mysuru district, has upped the pressure on Yediyurappa to field him in the bypoll to the lone vacant council seat. ""I am confident the CM and the BJP will honour promises made to me,"" Shankar said.

The former minister had joined the BJP during the rebellion, but was not given a ticket to contest the bypolls.

In Chikkamagaluru, deputy chief minister Govind M Karjol insisted he is prepared to step down if needed to enable new entrants into the cabinet. ""I’m a disciplined solider of the party. If the BJP directs me to submit my resignation, I will do so and return my official car and take a bus to Bengaluru,"" Karjol said. He said anyone who doesn’t respect the party line will not grow. ""It is imperative to toe the party line,"" he said.

Roorkee: The employee of a nationalized bank in Laksar sub-division of Haridwar has been accused of siphoning off around Rs 1 crore from 1,000 accounts. The incident came to light when some account holders found a part of their savings missing and alerted the bank management. Police as of now has ordered the bank to conduct an internal inquiry into the alleged embezzlement.

According to sources, some account holders reached the Niranjanpur branch of Punjab National Bank (PNB) on Friday to withdraw cash and found that money was missing from their accounts. Angry customers gheraoed bank employees and reported the matter to police. An internal inquiry by bank officials revealed the role of a certain employee, who allegedly used the bank manager’s user ID and password to access several user accounts and transfer money from them to other accounts (other than his). Of the 1,500 accounts presently operational at the bank, money was found to have been illegally withdrawn from 1,000.

“We have started an internal inquiry into the matter. Prima facie, the role of a fourth class employee is suspected. We will prepare a report in the matter in two days,” said Narendra Singh, circle head of PNB.

Kashi Ram, one of the victims, said, “I was saving up for my daughter’s wedding in February. When I tried to withdraw money, I found that Rs 8.5 lakh missing from my bank account.”

Police are working with the local management of the bank and said that they will start to take action against the criminals once they received the bank’s internal investigation report. “We have asked the bank for some final details. We will take action against all the fraudsters, irrespective of the number of people involved,” said Swapn Kishore Singh, superintendent of police (rural), Haridwar.

Nagpur: The local crime branch team of Nagpur rural police were a stunned lot after cops stumbled upon scores of condom packets at the dens of Rajasthan-based ATM breakers in Wadi and Wardha during searches after their arrest on January 26 following a prolonged chase.

The four ATM breakers, who were handed over to Katol police, have been remanded in custody till February 4.

Sources from the rural police said the four ATM breakers — Bahadur Bawari, Shreeniwas Bawari, Gopalram Bawari and Toofan Bawari — used to go back to Rajasthan with the stolen booty. They also transferred substantial sums of money into the accounts of their relatives. Though the accused acted tough during interrogation, the cops managed to extract crucial information.

According to a source, the cops had conducted searches at their dens, immediately after their arrest with the anticipation of seizing the stolen cash as they had repeatedly struck at ATMs in the last three months with 10 offences getting registered against them in Nagpur district, city and Wardha.

“We found several types and brands of condoms. The accused may have splurged cash in red-light areas too after striking it rich. We also cannot rule out women being brought to their dens as condoms were found in both locations,” he said.

It’s learnt that Bahadur and his gang used to communicate in ‘code language’ like flashing of the headlights during the operation. “The gang never used mobile phones while committing thefts as they were once caught with the help of the tower location while communicating. The mobile phones were kept at home before they went to rob money from ATMs,” said the source.

The gang also tried to mislead cops by refusing to acknowledge each other. They even gave fake names to give the impression that they belonged to different communities. “After intense and sustained interrogation, they broke down and spilled the beans, including an instance of bribing a witness to make him turn hostile in one of their cases,” said a personnel from the rural police.

The rural cops are now trying to nab the absconding member who brought the gang to Nagpur district by luring them with the promise of showing them several ATMs at desolate stretches and also providing them logistics support, including finding a place to stay.

The accused opened stolen ATM machines with the help of an electric cutter at their dens.

Start-stop SYSTEM

Nagpur: Once again, work on the Patanjali Group’s food park plant in Mihan area has been put on hold. The plant coming up in an area of 230 acres was dubbed the world’s largest food processing campus. Patanjali had announced a plan to launch products made with Nagpur oranges also from the unit here. The project is coming up in the non-SEZ area of Mihan.

Earlier in 2019, work on installing the machinery at the plant had been stopped for over six months from February. At that time Patanjali Ayurved managing director Acharya Balkrishna had told TOI that the company was facing financial issues as it had taken up a number of project at a time. However, the work would be revived soon, he had said.

The work has come to a standstill again since more than two months, said sources. Attempts to get a response from Balkrishna did not succeed. A message seeking his comments on the recent developments went unanswered.

Sources said machines worth hundreds of crore are lying in the area but the installation work is not being done. The company has constructed around 13 sheds but the installation of machines remains to be done. Recently, there were some job cuts in the unit too, said sources.

In September 2016, when a stone laying ceremony was performed by yoga guru Ramdev Baba, he had announced the plant would start within six months. A cheque of Rs10 crore was also handed over to buy another 7 acres land in the SEZ area. The SEZ plan is slated to cater to the international market. Sources said no work has begun in the SEZ site till date.

The company is supposed to get the food processing unit operational within 16 months of allocation of the land, with rainy season excluded from the deadline, said a source.

The non-SEZ land was granted through an auction, which had, however, led to questions as Patanjali was the single bidder in the process.

There was speculation that the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) may grant a loan of over Rs200 crore for the Nagpur project. Later, the company was also in talks with a consortium of public sector banks to finance the project. A team of bankers had come down to Nagpur for an inspection too, said a source.

In 2017, Patanjali Group had stopped payment for a cheque of over Rs60 crore for acquiring land at Mihan, due to issues with Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC). The funds were later released.

Kolhapur: District collector Daulat Desai has convened a meeting of sugar mill owners on Wednesday to discuss the issue of delay in crushing of damaged sugar cane .

The millers have shown least interest in crushing the damaged crop despite several instructions from the collector in this regard. Farmers had earlier threatened to launch an agitation if the millers fail to crush cane and clear the land for taking up the next crop for cultivation during the rabi season.

When the crushing season began in Kolhapur district, it was decided that the millers would first complete the crushing of damaged canes. But, the millers did not pay any attention to the damaged cane for cutting and crushing. Enraged with this a delegation led by veteran leader ND Patil met Desai and asked him to take immediate steps in this regard.

Desai had warned of strict action against mills that fail to finish damaged cane crushing by January 15. Now, a special meeting has been called to discuss the issue.

According to sources, sugar cane grown over 1,97,946 hectare area in the district was damaged due to heavy rainfall and floods last year. The most damaged area was Shirol taluka. The farmers had demanded to cut cane from their fields and clear the fields so that they could take up rabi crops for survival.

Last week, a delegation led by Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) state president Jalinder Patil held a meeting with Desai. During the meeting, Patil said that the sugar factories were not cutting the damaged cane despite his instructions to them in this regard.

Following the meeting, Desai then contacted the sugar commissonrate officials who said that a meeting in this regard will soon be conducted in the coming days.

Patil threatened that if the sugar mills fail to act on the collector's directives, the farmers will launch an agitation and shut down the mills until the damaged cane is cut and removed from the fields.

362,['29/01/2020'],Culling memories revive with NGO’s bid for Sukhna ducks,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Chandigarh: The isolated island in front of the Lake Club is a tragic reminder of that ghoulish, misty midnight of December 18 and 19, 2014, when more than a 100 domesticated geese or ducks were slaughtered at that spot to contain the dreaded avian flu, H5N1.

The killers were the workers of the health and forest department wearing puffed-up protective clothes and special masks.

The birds’ necks were dislocated, some were clubbed to death while others had their necks sliced in the midnight massacre.

Sukhna Lake was disinfected and closed to human activity for a month after that. But chilling memories has not stopped a section of local NGOs from lobbying hard with the UT administration to reintroduce domesticated geese or ducks at Sukhna Lake and thus again raise the spectre of risks to public and ecological health.

The H5N1 strain of avian flu is contagious to humans. The UT administration banned the reintroduction of domesticated birds in the Sukhna after the 2014 episode. But on a recent request by the NGO, Organic Sharing, seeking to release domesticated ducks once again, UT advisor Manoj Parida forwarded a plea to the concerned forests and wildlife department. Clarifying that no permission had been granted, the chief wildlife warden, Debendra Dalai, told TOI, “The matter is under examination.”

Rahul Mahajan, who runs the NGO, Organic Sharing, transplants trees that are downed, and is the owner of the popular chain of outlets, Durga Seeds, admitted to TOI that his “proposal was under the administration’s consideration”.

When informed of the risks to public health posed by his reintroduction scheme, Mahajan said he was “not aware”, but told TOI, “If such risks are there, we are ready to go in for other options such as keeping the birds in an enclosure away from the Sukhna waters, but still close by so that tourists can enjoy their presence. We would keep in mind all the health risks voiced by experts before going in for our reintroduction programme.”

Dr D D Kulkarni, former director and principal scientist, NIHSAD, and one who led the investigations and tests into avian flu at the national level for 3.5 years, told TOI, “It is risky to introduce domesticated geese or ducks into a wetland where migratory birds are regular visitors. After the turkey, it is domesticated geese and ducks which are most susceptible to avian flu. Migratory birds are routine carriers of flu viruses. But not all such migratory birds die or get sick from this virus and remain silent reservoirs. Nor is it that all migratory birds are virus carriers. One of the principal ways in which the virus is passed to other birds such as domesticated ducks are through faeces or discharges from the migratory birds. There is a possibility also of the avian flu virus spreading in the waters.”

363,['29/01/2020'],Docs remove bone stuck in man’s food pipe for 25 days,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Nagpur: On some occasions, pieces of bones in non-vegetarian food get stuck inside throat or food pipes. In such cases, the bones must be removed with the help of endoscope. Imagine the unbearable pain which people go through.

But a 60-year-old patient from Nagpur was living with a 1.25-inch piece of bone in the middle of his food pipe for nearly 25 days. He got relief from pain and was saved from life-threatening complications on Tuesday at Super Specialty Hospital (SSH).

“Eknath Sahare, a driver by profession, came to SSH on Tuesday complaining of severe pain in his throat. It had become difficult for him to swallow food or water,” said senior gastroenterologist Dr Sudhir Gupta. A team of doctors led by Dr Gupta later performed the endoscopy and removed the bone.

“We were surprised to know that Sahare was suffering from this pain since January 3. The patient is from a poor family and was thinking that the surgery would be very costly. Fortunately, at SSH, the surgery was performed for free,” said Dr Gupta.

One of the relatives of the patient said that he was trying household remedies for many days since January 3 and visited the doctor last week only. The doctor told him that he needs a surgery. But, the patient waited for one more week presuming that it would be a costly affair. Finally, he visited SSH where surgeries are performed for free on poor patients.

Dr Gupta said that the patient was lucky as the bone might have caused a tear in the wall of food pipe, which is life-threatening. Removing foreign body from the oesophagus with the help of endoscope is not rare, but this bone was stuck deep inside and left two deep ulsers at the site of impact.

Doctors have decided to keep the patient under observation for at least 48 hours. His condition is reported to be stable and improving. Gastroenterologists Dr Harit Kothari, Dr Vinita Gupta, Dr Sahil Parmar, and anasthetist Dr Ketaki Ramteke were in the surgery team.

Relief at last

The man was suffering from severe pain and had difficulty in swallowing since Jan 3

It took two weeks for him to see a private practitioner

Doctor told him about a bone stuck in his food pipe and surgery is must to get rid of it

Due to poor financial condition, the patient was not able to undergo surgery in a private set-up

He reported at Super Specialty Hospital (SSH) on Jan 28

Here, surgery was performed for free and the bone was removed from his food pipe

Mohali: The commissioner of the Punjab State Information Commission during hearing found the executive engineer (Xen) of the public health, department of water supply and sanitation, negligent in providing information sought under the RTI.

The commission fined the executive engineer of Rs 10,000 to be deducted from his salary in parts. The complainant will also be paid Rs 3,000 as compensation by the department.

The executive engineer of the department of water supply and sanitation, Anil Kumar, is accused of delaying information sought under the RTI beyond 100 days. The information was sought by Surjit Kaur and KNS Sodhi, residents of Sector 70, Mohali.

They had sought information about tube-wells installed in the area of municipal corporation, Mohali, besides some allied information.

After hearing the arguments supported by the documentary evidences from the two parties, Yashvir Mahajan, state information commissioner, noted that needless delay had been taken by the executive engineer in providing information. The deemed PIO in the office of Xen, department of water supply and sanitation, was duly informed by the PIO in the municipal corporation.

However, he dealt with the application lackadaisically, read the orders.

It has taken almost relentless pursuit of a year by the appellant to procure information. The commission observed that the deemed PIO in the office of Xen, department of water supply and sanitation, has failed to meet his obligation under Section 7 (1) of the RTI Act and thus, has rendered himself for an imposition of penalty.

He has not come up with a satisfactory response to the show-cause notice. Therefore, exercising its authority under Section 20 (1) of the RTI Act, the commission imposed a penalty of Rs 10,000 in lump sum on Anil Kumar, department of water supply and sanitation, Mohali.

The officer is directed to deposit the amount of penalty in the government treasury in two equal installments from his salary from the month of January, 2020. As the appellant has been put to undue inconvenience and harassment, he is awarded a compensation of Rs 3,000 which shall be paid to him through a bank draft by the public authority from its own account.

366,['29/01/2020'],Punjabi University to invite fresh tenders for canteens,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Punjabi University

PATIALA: A week after student bodies’ staged a protest against the authorities of Punjabi University for overlooking canteens allegedly being run without permission, the university authorities on Tuesday agreed to invigte fresh tenders of canteens and shops, owners of which had not paid rent since June 2018.

The authorities of the university have also formed a committee comprising senior medical officer of a government hospital, faculty members and students that can conduct inspections to check the quality of food in the canteens.

There are eight canteens that are operating on the premises of the university. The student bodies’ alleged that among these, four canteens had not paid rent since June 2018 as they filed litigation in the court against the university authorities against the university’s decision on hike in 30 per cent rent.

Besides canteens, the university authorities have also decided to get e-tendering of four shops that too were operational without any formal tendering after a case was filed against the university.

“It is a matter of fact that contractors of all eight canteen owners had separately filed a case in the court to challenge the decision of the university authorities on hike in rent and get fresh tendering. However, the court declared in one case that the university was authorised to take fresh tenders and a person having a contract from last 40 years does not provide them with any possession or right to continue running the canteen. Four of eight canteens landed in a compromise with the university authorities and managed to get five years contract. This happened for the first time that contractors got five years contract against the convention of three years. Now, the contractors of the remaining four canteens are still fighting the case in the court against the university’s decision. The university has not demanded rent from these four canteen owners so far, whereas, there are no restrictions or decision on this matter by the court,” said Harvinder Singh, former SYFI president, who raised the matter in May 2018 demanding e-tendering of canteens and shops.

He said the university authorities after meeting on Tuesday agreed to conduct invite tenders for four canteens and shops that had not paid rent since June 2018.

Panchkula: An emergency town vending committee meeting will be called by the Panchkula municipal corporation in the next three days after out of 162 vendors only 62 vendors turned up for the first draw of lot which was held on Tuesday by the authorities concerned.

MC commissioner-cum-administrator Sumedha Kataria said they had postponed the draw of lots which they had planned to organise on Tuesday after officials found that only 62 vendors turned up instead of 162 for the Sector 19 vending sites.

She said the town vending committee would hold a meeting to decide on how the draw for lots would be held. She said the 62 vendors who turned up, belonged to different area and she would table before the committee that if the corporation could accommodate them at the Sector 19 vending site. She said all those vendors whose documents were verified would get the site when the draw of lots would be conducted.

Officials said during the verification they found that there were vendors who were not setting up shops in Sector 19 but applied for the site in this area.

Officials also proposed that the corporation should ask the company to issue identity cards to vendors whose names were mentioned in the survey list.

They said it would be unfair on the part of the corporation to allocate vending sites as all were not present during the draw of lots. It is mentioned that residents raised objection on the name of vendors in the survey of Sector 19 and demanded to re-conduct it.

The street vending market would be constructed on one-acreland and around 458 stalls would be allocated. The MC has been given space for vending zones in Sectors 2, 4, 10, 11, 12, 15 and 19 by the HSVP.

369,['29/01/2020'],"Mundhe takes charge, NMC officials get 3 days to shape up","This story is from January 29, 2020

TIGHTENING THE SCREWS:

Nagpur: A week after being appointed, IAS officer Tukaram Mundhe, who is known for being transferred frequently, assumed charge as municipal commissioner at Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on Tuesday morning. Immediately after taking charge, Mundhe gave three days ultimatum to NMC officials to ensure a positive change in the city, and also in their behaviour towards people.

An IAS officer of 2005 batch, Mundhe announced a ‘janata durbar’ on daily basis. He would meet people between 4pm and 5pm every day on all working days at his office in NMC headquarters, Civil Lines.

Outgoing municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar was not present when Mundhe assumed charge. Bangar had gone to Mumbai on Monday to attend a meeting organized by speaker Nana Patole.

During his 14-month tenure, Bangar never fixed any time table for meeting people, and allowed visitors whenever he was available at the office. Bangar is yet to get his new posting.

As soon as he stepped into the NMC head office premises, Mundhe reportedly expressed displeasure over parking system for vehicles in front of the new administrative building.

In the meetings organized with assistant commissioners and heads of all departments, Mundhe said, “We are service providers and should work in the larger interest of public. I want discipline and transparency in working. Roads didn’t look clean, so ensure proper work within three days,” he said.

On the first day itself, Mundhe raised question on existence of public works department (PWD) engineers in other departments like slum. He directed officials to submit list of project management consultants, financial break-up of NMC, and also asked for presentations from all departments.

Expressing frustration at ringing mobile of an official, Mundhe reportedly suggested keeping mobiles on silent mode during meetings. He reportedly asked his personal assistant to seize mobile handsets of officials and donate them to any organization if they ring during the meeting. “I believe in punctuality, so all should come on time or even 10 minutes before the meeting, but I will not tolerate anyone coming after commencement of the meeting,” he said.

Mundhe has been transferred 13 times in his 15-year career. His posting at NMC is the 14th transfer. This is his second posting in the city. In 2008, he worked as chief executive officer of the zilla parishad here.

Mundhe could not meet mayor Sandip Joshi on Monday since the latter reportedly did not come to NMC in the morning, and went out of the city after attending MahaMetro’s function in the afternoon.

People excited over Mundhe coming to NMC

Immediately after news of Tukaram Mundhe assuming charge was posted on NMC’s Facebook page, over 1,300 people liked the post and 236 commented on it. Probably, this is the highest response for a post by NMC, which receives very few likes and comments. Congratulating Mundhe, many people said they expect him to free NMC of corruption, solve various civic problems including encroachments, garbage dumps etc. A retired NMC official also requested Mundhe to curb corruption in NMC health department. Considering the comments, it seems people have high expectations from Mundhe.

Top Challenges Before Mundhe

* Curb corruption in various departments like water works, PWD, health, property tax etc

* Find new revenue sources and increase recovery of property tax, water bills

* Improve door-to-door garbage collection, transportation up to Bhandewadi dumping yard, and stop dumping of garbage on roadsides, open spaces

* Control unwanted expenditure by office bearers and corporators on welcome gates, statues, sports, cultural, social programmes, tours etc

* Improve quality of works in cement and tar roads, water supply, civil works

* Remove encroachments on footpaths, roads and curb unauthorized constructions

* Improve education quality in NMC schools

* Stop destruction of playgrounds and trees

* Improve complaints receiving and redressal system

* Improve city bus service

We would be engaging with saints, seers, storytellers and use the employment mode to reach out to people. We would have to focus on unity among Hindus and make sincere efforts to end evils like casteism and untouchability, prevailing in society.”

More than 100 office-bearers from eastern UP attended the workshop on the concluding day. They have been asked to reach every house in the identified pockets and connect with more and more people and tell them about Hinduism and Indian culture.

Pune: Bhashkar, a 42-year-old school teacher, began to lose focus and was constantly distracted. Often, he had to leave the classroom midway and rush to the washroom. The increased urge to pass stool with mucus discharge had put him in embarrassing situations. He was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome.

Bhashkar opted for a gut flora analysis and based on the report, he was put on pre and probiotic supplements for a few weeks, advised dietary changes and simple lifestyle modifications. Six weeks later, Bhashkar reported significant relief from the symptoms and in his overall health.

He was one of the 15 participants in the six-month study conducted by the city-based doctors since December 2018. Under the study, stool samples of the enrolled patients suffering from constipation, inflammatory bowel diseases, irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis were analysed.

“These samples were sent for gut microbiome analysis to the Bengaluru-based laboratory. The samples were further processed in the US as well,” consultant colorectal surgeon Ashwin Porwal, founder-head of Healing Hands Clinic, said.

Gut flora or microbiota are the micro-organisms that live in the digestive tracts of humans. The study also undertook an indepth analysis of the gut microbiome and the impact of pre and probiotics on the changes in the gut flora, and the resultant change in the symptoms of the patients. “The patients were also put on a Kiwi fruit extract regimen, a rich prebiotic, for a month. After the period, stool samples of all the patients were collected again and sent for gut microbiome analysis to study the changes,” Porwal said.

At the end, a comparative pre- and post-study data suggested that all the patients, except for one who was lost to follow-up, showed a significant improvement in symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis and chronic constipation.

“I was amazed to see how my gut diversity score improved with dietary changes and supplements,” Bhashkar said.

Diversity score is the diversity index of gut, in which the mathematical measure of the gut flora is represented in numbers. “A higher number represents higher diversity and better gut health,” Porwal said.

While the gut microbiome test has a lot of potential, it has drawbacks as it is in its nascency. “The faecal-based testing does not provide microbiota information of the whole gut, but primarily of the large intestine only. Besides, the cost of the technology and hence the affordability at the present charges is another major limitation of the gut microbiome test,” physician Leena Dhole, one of the investigators of the study, said.

KOTTAYAM: Moozhikkal Pankajakshi ’s biggest wish is to hand over her knowledge and skills in the fading art form ‘Nokku Vidya Paavakali ’ to the future generation. The 83-year-old artist, who was recently honoured with Padma Shri, was successful in finding a successor when her granddaughter Ranjini K S started showing keen interest in the art form.

The grandmother took it as a mission to impart the skills to Ranjini. “Nokku Vidya Paavakali is my grandmother’s life. So, I can’t leave this art form. I wish to carry on with it along with my education,” said Ranjini.

On Tuesday, Pankajakshi, daughter Radhamani and granddaughter Ranjini were at a function held to honour the Padma Shri awardee at the Press Club here. She hails from Monippally in the district.

Pankajakshi is the last surviving link with Nokku Vidya Paavakali, the centuries old traditional puppetry of Kerala. As a child, Pankajakshi wanted to go to school. But being the eldest of five siblings, her father wanted her to practise the traditional art form practised in the family. She started acquiring the skills of the art form at the age of 11. She took the art seriously after she got married and her husband Sivarama Panikkar joined her.

Ranjini started studying the art form at the age of 8. Ranjini says that it took five years to learn the art form. “High concentration and dedication is needed. Physical exertion in presenting the art form is another challenge,” said Ranjini, a BCom student in St Stephen’s College in Uzhavoor.

375,['29/01/2020'],Court of inquiry into scrap pilferage at Chennai depot,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Pune: The Army’s Southern Command has ordered a Court of Inquiry to investigate the alleged pilferage of 28 tonnes of scrap material from the Avadi Ordnance Depot (AOD) in Chennai.

The depot stores spares of Army vehicles, clothing items of recruits and tent-related items. It provides these material to the units based in the southern sector of the command. A junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Army lodged an FIR with the Avadi Tank Factory police station on December 20 against a private contractor.

“It is intimated that the Court of Inquiry for the case is under progress. The time frame is related to availability of witnesses and cannot be specified exactly. Details of violation of procedures as per the standard operating procedure (SOP) will be ascertained after culmination of the Court of Inquiry. Further details of legal action against the contractor/agency may be ascertained from the police authorities,” a command officer said.

“A Brigadier rank officer has been appointed the presiding officer of the Court of Inquiry panel. He will be assisted by three officers. The panel is yet to submit its report,” an Army officer from the Southern Command told TOI on condition of anonymity. “The depot is headed by a Colonel rank officer, who is responsible for all kinds of administrative decisions, including the dispatch of scrap material,” he said.

“There is an SOP for uploading and dispatching of the material from the depot. No outside vehicle is allowed to leave the depot without going through a weigh in. As per the procedure, the weight of empty vehicle and after filling up of the scrap is recorded separately. If a vehicle is carrying extra weight beyond the actual order, it is expected to be caught within the depot. We are surprised how the vehicles involved in pilferage were permitted to leave the establishment,” added the officer.

On the other hand, the police authorities of Avadi range said such an illegal activity could not be done without the insiders’ help. “This racket must be going on for the past few years. It is possible that the contractor stole tonnes of scrap with the help of depot officials as well. It may not be the first time that the contractor has done it,” assistant commissioner of police V Satyamurti of the Avadi Range said.

“The Military Intelligence unit of the Southern Command came to know about this illegal practice first. Based on their specific inputs, we acted,” Satyamurti told TOI over the phone.

According to Satyamurti, this contractor had been buying scrap from the Avadi depot since 2014. “He is involved in this business for the past 15 years.” he said. The police have booked the contractor under sections 465 (punishment for forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC.

376,['29/01/2020'],Disease-resistant variant to boost tomato cultivation,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Panaji: A new disease-resistant tomato hybrid ‘Arka Rakshak’ is set to bring a smile to farmers’ faces. Developed by the Indian institute of horticulture research (IIHR) in a bid to achieve high yields and resist diseases like tomato leaf curl virus bacterial wilt and early blight, the variant’s seeds have already been distributed among farmers in North Goa.

“Tomato seedlings are often plagued with the problem of wilting, due to which farmers are reluctant to grow tomatoes . However, this particular variety developed by the IIHR is resistant to wilt,” said Dilip Paranjape, project director, Agriculture Technology Management Agency’s (ATMA), North Goa.

“It has not wilted after farmers grew it in Goa last year. It has proven a hardy variety, therefore,” he said.

Last year, there was a yield of 200kg of tomatoes from a patch measuring 25sqm— it showed that a single plant could produce 11kg of tomatoes. The overall production went up to a few tons.

“If we succeed in this, farmers can go for large-scale tomato cultivation and we can slowly discontinue importing them from other states,” Paranjape said.

ATMA-North Goa is planning to have a continuous year-round programme for self-help groups in Goa, beginning with the rainy season, upto the Rabi season. “We will start with the planting ginger and turmeric, followed by vegetable nurseries in the Rabi season,” he said.

“We are however focusing more on tomato and broccoli this year,” he added.

ATMA and Krishi Vijgyan Kendra (KVK) have sponsored shade-net houses for these self-help groups; some have also been given to them by Zuari Agro, under their CSR programme. These are for farms in Ela, Old Goa; Duler, Bardez; Kavalebaag, Pernem, Valpoi and Bicholim. It costs around Rs 5,000-6,000 to erect small nurseries of 25sqm. The seeds and materials like vermicompost and coco peat are given by ATMA.

While many farmers have already cultivated the seeds and the tomato seedlings are slowly coming up, broccoli is not popular in Goa yet.

“Not many farmers are aware that broccoli fetches a very good sum in the market. There is especially high demand in the markets of the coastal areas because tourists are aware of its nutritional value,” he said.

Local residents have expressed their content with the development

Mussoorie: The damaged sewer lines that were polluting water sources of the town have been repaired by the Peyjal Nigam after TOI brought the issue to the fore in an article titled “Sewage from hotels, houses polluting water sources of Rajpur, Mussoorie”.

Speaking to TOI, Subhash Chandra, Executive Engineer of Peyjal Nigam, said that the sewer lines that were damaged at Gaddi Khana (near Gandhi Chowk) have been completely repaired by the department. “After this issue was brought to our notice, we took immediate action and now the lines have been repaired and leakage has stopped completely,” Chandra informed.

Local residents have expressed their content with the development. “We all had become concerned after getting to know about the possibility of sewerage contaminating the water supply of the town. The repair of leaking sewer pipes is a major relief. We thank TOI for raising this matter with the authorities,” said Ashish Goel, a resident of Gandhi Chowk.

Notably, TOI had come to know that just above the Bhilaru and Jincy water sources (which account for nearly half the water supply of the town), huge quantities of sewage, reportedly from the Library bazaar area of Mussoorie, was flowing down into the catchment of these water sources.

“It could have led to a major health hazard. The flowing sewage was like a huge stream flowing in the catchment of the springs and near the points where these springs were being tapped,” says Virender Bhandari, a resident of Bhilaru locality near Mussoorie.

It is worth mentioning that the entire town of Mussoorie derives its water supply through water pumped from more than 20 nearby springs. Bhilaru and Jincy are among the largest springs.

Ajit Pawar

PUNE: The proposed Shivajinagar-Kadamwak Wasti Metro extension and a fresh line from Swargate to Pulgate are likely to set PMRDA back by an additional Rs4,200 crore.

Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) is developing the 23km Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar. Last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had proposed the extension and the new route at a meeting with PMRDA and told officials to study the plan and submit a report.

According to officials in the know, early assessment reports have suggested the entire line be elevated, as an underground line would further escalate the cost. The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation will prepare a detailed project report by next month

“The estimated cost of the Shivajinagar-Hadapsar elevated Metro line is Rs4,500 crore,” an official said, adding, “The extension and the new line would further increase the expenses by another Rs4,200 crore.” Each additional kilometre is expected to cost Rs300 crore.

Nagpur: The South East Central Railway (SECR) has taken the lead in cleanliness at 283 stations which also includes mechanized cleaning at 36 stations.

SECR consists of Nagpur, Raipur and Bilaspur divisions. “We have been giving cleanliness at stations, colonies and aboard trains top priority. Apart from mechanized cleaning at 36 strategic stations like Bilaspur, Durg, Gondia, manual cleaning is being done at 115 stations,” said senior PRO Santosh Kumar.

“The SECR has topped the ranking in cleanliness across the Indian Railways in an independent survey conducted by the Quality Council of India (QCI) recently,” said Kumar.

All trains passing through Bilaspur and Raipur stations are cleaned by machines. Both these stations have fast watering facility, thereby reducing time to water trains. “Plans are afoot to start automatic coach washing units at Bilaspur and Durg stations,” he added.

Kumar said ‘Coach Mitra’ service has been introduced wherein passengers can send an SMS on 138 or 9821736069 for cleanliness-related issues.

To address the complaints of dirty linen, the capacity of mechanized laundry in Bilaspur has been enhanced from 1 tonne to 3 tonnes per shift. Similarly, the capacity of the laundry at Raipur has been increased from 1 tonne to 4 tonnes. “SECR’s 22 trains have been supplied linen through these laundries,” he added.

Belsare said a delegation of the association led by former Shiv Sena Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar met industries minister Subhash Desai and power minister Nitin Raut in Mumbai.

The association demanded strict action against unauthorised mathadi organisations, a reduction in the water tax and land transfer fees of the MIDC, slums on MIDC land be removed and such land be allotted to set up new industries and measures to control rising prices of raw material and property tax for industries.

Belsare said, “Desai said a meeting will be held in Mantralaya to discuss these problems.”

The association’s memorandum to Raut said the new proposal given by MSEDCL to MERC for increasing the power rates will make it impossible to run industries in the state.

They also wanted that industrialists be permitted to pay their power bills in instalments and sought strict action to prevent power theft. Belsare said, “ Raut said efforts would be made to solve the problems of the industrialists.”

Sudhamchand, who ran a movement — restoration of joint elections in Pakistan, was shot dead in the Jacobabad t... Read More

Nagpur: Sudhamchand Chawla, a political activist in Pakistan, who fought against the system of separate electorates based on religion, was shot dead in public view in the Jacobabad town of Sindh province on January 28, 2002. Sudhamchand, who ran a movement — restoration of joint elections in Pakistan, had won a case against separate electorates in the Supreme Court less than a month before his killing.

The assassination had led to an uproar on both sides of the borders. Narendra Modi, who was the then chief minister of Gujarat, had called him the Mahatma Gandhi of Pakistan. Jacobabad was shut for three days and in Nagpur, the RSS had held a public meeting to condemn Chawla’s killing.

Eighteen years down the line, his family, settled in Nagpur, still awaits justice.

In the backdrop of the protests against CAA-NRC and recent developments of alleged abductions in Pakistan, public meets to mark Chawla’s death were held on Tuesday. The day was marked in Indore and Nagpur.

Chawla’s story had slipped into oblivion. “Whatever has happened lately, has left the community disturbed again,” says his son Manoj, referring to incidents of alleged abduction of a girl (Mahek Kumari) in Jacobabad and the daughter of a Granthi (priest) in the Sikh shrine of Nanakana Sahib. “May be public memory of my father is a reaction to those incidents,” he says. For years, the family drew attention of even the international media.

“His (Chawla’s) main intent was to do away with separate religion-based elections. He believed in bringing all voters and candidates at par. With separate electorates, voters of the minority communities were being alienated from Muslim politicians. My father wanted to break the barriers,” he says.

“The case was won on January 5 and on the 28th, he was going to the Jacobabd collectorate’s office for some work related to the case. The assailants shot him from the rear,” says Manoj, who was in Nagpur that day.

“I had already joined my kin in Nagpur in 1992 and studied in SFS School. The others joined us after my father’s assassination,” he says.

His uncle Laxman came down to Nagpur from Pakistan in 1978 and was a member of the BJP.

The assailants were shot dead when they were going to depose before the court against Aijaz Jhakrani, a politician from the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP), who allegedly masterminded Chawla’s killing. The case hasn’t moved any further. “We had filed a plea two years ago from Nagpur but because of our absence, no progress has taken place,” he says.

“Jhakrani had been named in the FIR. I have written many letters to leaders like former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, federal ministers and chief justices. The last letter was sent to Asif Sayeed Khosa, the then chief justice, three months ago,” says his brother Kanwar Chawla.

“Ghinwa Bhutto was among the many politicians who expressed outrage over the killing. She compared Chawla’s killing to her husband Murtuza Bhutto’s assassination,” he says.

“Chawla was a cult figure in Jacobabad and had the support of both Hindus and Muslims,” says his friend and social activist Azeez Abro from Pakistan.

Representative image

MUMBAI: After a gap of two years, the city has witnessed an organ donation from a public hospital this week. Parel’s KEM Hospital on Monday facilitated the cadaver donation of a 52-year-old man whose liver saved the life of a Satara man.

In an otherwise growing organ donation programme, the contribution of public hospitals has been lacking in the city. In 2019, for instance, out of the record number of 79 donations, not one came from a public hospital. In fact, the last time public hospitals contributed to a handful of donations was in 2017 when J J Hospital facilitated two and Sion one. KEM Hospital had last recorded a donation in May 2016.

The recent donor was admitted to the hospital with a history of fall. Subsequently, he was diagnosed as having suffered a stroke. Dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh said the patient was declared brain dead after two apnea tests on Monday. “The family willingly consented to donate his organs. Due to certain blood parameters, his kidneys were not considered suitable for donation by the kidney committee of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC),” he said. The liver was allotted to Apollo Hospital, where the organ was transplanted into a Satara man. “We have restarted the program after over two years. The family has also expressed their desire to assist in spreading awareness about organ donation,” he said.

Experts say the reasons for failure to convert brain deaths into successful donations in public hospitals range from inability to carry out timely apnea tests within six hours, finding doctors to complete the brain death certification process to maintaining the donor. “Lack of awareness among the clientele coming to public hospitals is also an issue. But the situation is changing fast,” said a social worker. He added that awareness drives by the state’s medical education department have managed to make people aware of the concept of organ donation.

Dr S Mathur, president of ZTCC that distributes cadaver organs, said they have provided a transplant coordinator to handhold KEM with paperwork and other processes. “We believe the participation of public hospitals will grow. We will provide them with whatever support we can” said Mathur and added this month has seen seven donations in the city.

Video of the man cutting his wedding cake with a machete went viral

CHENNAI: A young man who cut a cake with a machete at Thiruverkadu on Monday to celebrate his marriage after being persuaded by his friends found a police team on his doorstep the next day. Bhuvanesh’s friends had come to greet the man who was a ‘bus route rowdy’ when they were all in college.

The law enforcers, however, let 23-year-old Bhuvanesh off with a warning that any such ‘heroic’ activity in future would see him behind the bars. “We considered his future,” said an investigating officer.

The trend of cutting cakes with machetes, which began with gangster Binu Papachan, has led to police booking those celebrating in such fashion. But Bhuvanesh’s friends, all of who travelled on the bus route that he had lorded over during their college days, didn’t know that.

When they trooped into the wedding hall where the resident of Karumariamman Koil Street had got hitched to his girlfriend on Monday, the ‘gifts’ they carried a cake and a few machetes took everyone by surprise.

Bhuvanesh, a history graduate, was wondering about the unusual present, when his friends convinced him to cut the cake with the ‘sword’. Taken in by the promise of instant stardom, he gave in. The 29-second video of Bhuvanesh cutting the cake and two of his friends, also holding machetes on the stage, and cheering the bride and hailing their former ‘leader’ soon went viral on social media platforms. His friends had shared it without informing him.

On Tuesday, Bhuvanesh was all over social media and even television after some channels had picked up the video clip and had started flashing it. A few of his shocked relatives rushed to his house to know what had happened. Soon, a police team reached the spot looking for him. He was taken to the police station and a few of his friends were also picked up for interrogation.

Investigation revealed that the man who had brought the machete was a man named Mani, Bhuvanesh’s junior in college. He is said to have switched off his mobile phone after the incident. Bhuvanesh, who now works at a private firm, had been booked for a few minor offences during his college days, said a police officer.

384,['29/01/2020'],PMRDA’s plea for allotment of 4 TMC water remains pending,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Pune: The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s demand for 4 TMC water from 15 dams in the district is still pending with the irrigation department, casting a shadow on the liveability of the proposed townships.

“A review meeting was conducted last week, but no clear guidelines were issued on water allocation from the dams. With several constructions to come up in the area, water allocation is a must,” said an official of the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA).

At present, people solely depend on the extraction of underground water in the PMRDA limits.

The estimated present population of nearly 29 lakh in the PMRDA limits is expected to double in the next two decades. The Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation has to clear its proposal for fetching water from dams like Vadiwale, Andra, Chaskaman, Bhatghar, Rihe, Urawade or Pusane.

“A number of projects such as town planning schemes, ring road and Metro line have been proposed in the PMRDA limits. Against this backdrop, allocation of water to the area should be given priority,” said another PMRDA official.

Many areas around Hinjewadi and Wagholi have been protesting over water shortage and citizens have raised an alarm on tanker mafia.

On Monday, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar told TOI that they would request for 10 TMC water from Tata dam to help meet the demands of the city as well as the rural areas. He discussed the water allocation for the PMRDA limits last week but steered clear from the assessment of the dams in its area.

The state government had constituted a six-member committee last September to revise water distribution and usage plan for the area. The panel headed by the principal secretary of the state urban development department made recommendations about the distribution to the water resources department on the available storage and the use of water in the metropolitan region. It also carried out a survey of all reservoirs in the district to assess the ways to meet the demand.

Dehradun: In a bid to increase the survival rate of lakhs of newly planted saplings, the Rudraprayag forest division has started an initiative in which local women in the villages will be hired to look after the plants. Till now, plantation watchers -- with salary of Rs 8,000 a month -- took care of the plants, but still the survival rate of the saplings had not improved. Under Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act (CAMPA), several crores of saplings were planted in the state.

In a pilot project, one plantation spread over 10 hectares each in all the six ranges of Rudraprayag forest division -- Agasthyamuni, Khakra, North Jakholi, South Kakholi, Rudraprayag and Guptkashi -- has been handed over to women Self Help Groups (SHGs) for upkeep. Each forest division is given additional funds annually for the maintenance of these plants, and forest officials are of the opinion that women, by playing an active role, will not only help in safeguarding the newly planted 'mini forests' but will also ensure that saplings are protected from ‘forest fires’, which are primarily responsible destruction of saplings.

“Till now, each plantation is looked after by one plantation watcher. But it is not possible for one man to look after all the plants. Now, with SHGs in the role, we will have over hundred eyes and hands to safeguard the saplings, especially from forest fire. It will also promote transparency in the system as these women will be responsible for taking care of each sapling . They will also get paid for it. We have given a month-wise checklist to these women to which they will have to adhere to ensure that the saplings survive,” said Vaibahv Singh, DFO, Rudraprayag forest division.

Rudraprayag forest division is spread across 59, 867 hectares of land and has massive plantation of kachnar, gooseberry, bamboo, deodar and ringal -- based on topography and location.

Environmentalists have praised the initiative as it creates a win-win situation for the hill women and the forest department. They say women had spearheaded some of the world renowned movements to protect trees. “In the hills, women have always been emotionally connected to the forests; for example, the Chipko Movement. Hence, it is a praiseworthy move by the forest department. It would not be taxing for these women to do the task as they go to the jungle to collect fodder every day,"" said Padma Shri KS Rawat, founder of Maiti Aandolan who initiated a similar move in 1995 under which a girl plants a tree in her parents' place on her wedding day and thereafter her mother takes care of it.

The women are all agog about the new initiative, saying the hills will be saved now, “These are our forests, we will always need fodder for our livestock. By protecting the plants, we are protecting our future,” said Manju Devi (38) of Mahila Mangal Dal Jakholi, Rudraprayag.

388,['29/01/2020'],Padmavati refuses to end fast despite officials’ request,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Haridwar: Senior officials of state government, including Haridwar’s DM and SSP, couldn’t convince Brahmacharini Padmavati (23) to end her hunger strike against what she terms as the government’s apathy towards river Ganga .

The officials met the woman seer from Bihar on Tuesday at Matri Sadan Ashram. Padmavati, who has been fasting for 45 days now, cleared that she won’t end her strike until all the four hydropower plants on Ganga are shut.

“Most of her demands are being considered but it takes a while for things to happen. We have urged the seer to call off her hunger strike,” Haridwar SSP S Senthil Avoodai Krishnaraj told TOI.

Incidentally, their visit was followed by the visit of anther senior official from Muzaffarnagar district (in Uttar Pradesh). The UP official jotted down Padmavati’s demands and identified those which have already been met.

According to seers, the UP official came to Matri Sadan after state chief minister Yogi Adityanath was quizzed about the efforts being taken to meet Padmavati’s demands during his visit to Bijnor to flag-off the five-day long Ganga Yatra. “Padmavati is risking her life for the cause of Ganga. If not Uttarakhand CM, we hope at least the UP CM pays heed to her demands,” said Brahamachari Dayanand, a Matri Sadan seer.

On Saturday, Matri Sadan seers had expressed their fear that the state government might use force to end the ongoing fast-unto-death by Padmavati. Some had even said that the state government might make an attempt to kill Padmavati or Matri Sadan Ashram chief Swami Shivanad Saraswati.

In an application given to Haridwar chief judicial magistrate, Brahmachari Dayanand has claimed that two Matri Sadan seers – professor GD Agrawal and Swami Nigamanand – were “killed” for protesting against Ganga pollution.

A few days ago, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene to end the fast being observed by Sadhvi Padmavati.

Sewage flowing into the Pavana river before the repair work

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The drainage department of the civic body has repaired the broken drainage chambers and diverted sewage from a nullah through pipelines to the Kalewadi sewage treatment plant (STP) to prevent pollution of Pavana river.

Thergaon Social Foundation (TSF) found that a nullah and three broken drainage chambers in Thergaon and nearby areas were polluting the river. It drew the attention of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) towards plugging the pollution sources.

Rahul Sarvade of TSF said, “Fish deaths have been a common occurrence in Pavana river over the past few years because of untreated sewage entering the river. We received information from Chinchwad residents in December about foaming water being seen in the morning near Dhaneshwar bridge. We found three broken drainage chambers near Sukhwani society.”

Prashant Patil, the executive engineer of the drainage department, said, “We laid a new pipeline to connect the chambers to another pipeline for taking the sewage to the nearest STP.”

City Corporation officials will be visiting Singapore to study a ‘mosquito laboratory’ in a bid to contain the... Read More

CHENNAI: Greater Chennai Corporation officials will be visiting Singapore to study a ‘ mosquito laboratory ’ in a bid to contain the spread of dengue .

Singapore has successfully bred male mosquitoes in controlled laboratory conditions and injected them with the Wolbachia strain of bacteria. The mosquitoes are released in the surroundings with guns. When infected mosquitoes mate with the females, the embryos formed die. In effect, the male mosquitoes are rendered sterile by the bacteria.

Over a period of time, this can gradually bring down the number of the mosquitoes carrying the dengue virus, thereby reducing the spread of dengue, said a senior official. There are published studies documenting this, he said.

In Tuesday’s review meeting, corporation commissioner G Prakash briefed local bodies minister S P Velumani on the steps taken by Singapore. Prakash informed the minister about the civic body’s plan to conduct a study tour.

While Velumani is understood to have given a green signal, he said the conditions and landscape in Singapore was different. Spread of dengue is dependent on conditions like how water is stored and the extent of urban planning which impacts mosquito behaviour, a source said.

The officials are likely to conduct a study of how the mosquito colonies are reared, how the eggs are produced and the male mosquitoes are maintained.

B Dhanraj, retired chief vector control officer of the corporation, told TOI that in principle the idea worked but there would be practical difficulties in executing it.

“Singapore is an island, where the sterile male mosquitoes will mate with wild females. However, Chennai is an open place and there are many wild males which may come along with migrants coming on bus or train from nearby towns or districts,” Dhanraj said.

However, there was no harm in conducting a trial and gauge its success. “Since we are going against nature, rate of success will depend on many factors,” he said.

Dhanraj recalled how in 70s, chemo-sterile mosquitoes were released in Delhi but faced a public backlash when the mosquitoes were released. “It was because the residents had not been informed and educated about the process and benefits it would give,” he said.

Representative image

PUNE: The admission process for the 2020-21 first year junior college (FYJC) in the state will have additional features such as possible options of institutes for the students and a toll-free call centre to address their queries.

The new system will also have an online payment option for the students to buy soft copies of the booklet on guidelines. State education director Dinkar Patil said the Kolhapur division has been included in the online system, while Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Aurangabad and Nashik would continue with the e-admission process.

“We are constantly trying to upgrade the system to make the Standard XI admission process user-friendly and convenient for lakhs of students across the state. Out IT team is working on ways to incorporate the latest technology inputs in the system and the new features will be added from this year. We have floated a tender for companies to implement the new features,” Patil said.

When a student will file the “option” form Part 2, the new system will pop up possible options of colleges for him or her to choose from.

“The data from the previous year will be used as the base for this feature. The system will automatically show the options to the students. They can refer to the options while filling their college preferences,” the official said.

Every year, the students complain about several issues while filling the forms, after submitting them and also when the merit list is announced. Students from outside Maharashtra and from the non-state board willing to apply to colleges and schools affiliated to the state board require time-to-time assistance.

Patil said the call centre would be set up to address the queries of all the applicants.

Another important feature is on the book of guidelines the students receive at their respective schools. “Instances of parents returning home from work during late hours are galore and it is difficult for them to buy the booklet from the schools. Keeping this in mind, we have introduced the system of an online guidebook. The students can get a soft copy of it following an online payment.”

Among the new features in the current request for proposal in the system are customizations of the old online admission system, the eligibility module and cellphone application. Close to one lakh students from Pune take part in the online FYJC admission process every year. The number of students from Mumbai is around 2.25 lakh.

PANAJI: Goa witnessed a sharp decline in tourist footfalls from the UK in the last two months of 2019. While November saw a 40% reduction from the same month the previous year, the drop in December was a 50% from the same month in 2018. The collapse of British travel company Thomas Cook is mainly responsible for the decline, stakeholders said.The UK has been a traditional charter market for Goa, but Sita Travels’ chief operating officer Ernest Dias said that Goa has only been receiving four charters a week from there this season. The November-December period in 2018 saw 69 charters from the UK bring in 19,956 tourists, while the same period last year saw 9,723 tourists arriving in 36 charters.However, while the drop in British arrivals is along expected lines, Goa isn’t receiving charters from Finland either. Dias said that while a leading operator that handles Finnish charters has discontinued service to Goa, travellers from Finland, Sweden and Denmark are still visiting Goa via scheduled flights.However, not all foreign tourist arrivals are down. This rise has been contrary to expectations of stakeholders. Since Russian footfalls witnessed a drop during the last two seasons — from 1,67,339 travellers in 2017-18 to 92,396 in 2018-19 — stakeholders anticipated a further decline.But November 2019 saw 59 flights with 19,727 passengers and December, 65 flights with 21,471 passengers, a substantial rise from 2018, in which November saw 48 flights with 15,010 passengers, and December, 50 flights with 16,370 passengers.However, Dias doesn’t believe that this season has seen more tourists than the previous one. “I don’t think the figures are right,” he said.Meanwhile, Travel and Tourism Association of Goa (TTAG) president Savio Messias said that two other operators who handle Russian charters also have admitted to a slight rise in Russian tourist numbers, but also a drop in revenue. “We are not receiving high-spending tourists,” Messias said, adding that Russian tourists have turned away from Goa since they’ve found cheaper destinations elsewhere.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73718234,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-716366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/goa-sees-sharp-fall-in-tourists-from-uk-finland-but-russia-rises-to-the-occasion/articleshow/73711538.cms
395,['29/01/2020'],PMC bid to beautify spaces below flyovers with murals &amp; gardens,"This story is from January 29, 2020

The Ramesh Wanjale flyover at Dhayari Phata and the space below it is full of two-wheelers parked by citizens

PUNE: If the civic administration has its way, the spaces under flyovers across the city will soon be free of encroachment, illegal use and unauthorized parking .

Pune Municipal Corporation ( PMC ) officials said the administration has decided to beautify such spaces with landscape designs, murals, hanging gardens and artificial lawns.

A proposal to develop the spaces has been tabled in the draft civic budget for 2020-21 presented by municipal chief Shekhar Gaikwad on Monday. The PMC has allocated Rs5 crore for the beautification work.

The city currently has 18 flyovers. The officials said two additional flyovers were under construction and many more at the proposed stages. In the coming financial year, the officials said, the administration was looking forward to beautify spaces under at least 10 flyovers. The administration has decided to inspect each flyover and then chalk out the beautification work.

PMC officials said steps have been proposed in the civic budget to keep a tab on the illegal use of the spaces under flyovers and curb encroachments. They said many citizens have been using the spaces to park their vehicles . At many spots, food stalls have taken over such spaces. “The administration will first seal the spaces and then go ahead with the beautification work,” an official said.

The state urban development department had in 2009 issued a notification banning parking of vehicles below flyovers, bridges and underpasses. The notification was issued after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks and on the ground that parking of vehicles posed security threats to flyovers.

Copies of the notification were sent to all municipal corporations/councils and planning authorities to ban parking of vehicles at such facilities. The Bombay high court also banned parking of vehicles under flyovers on June 20, 2013, upholding the government’s 2008 decision and its 2012 stand on the threat perception.

The civic administration has carried out repeated drives to free the spaces under the flyovers of encroachments and stop illegal parking of vehicles. The problems, however, continued to persist, much to the chagrin of the civic administration and the law abiding citizens.

The civic body has initiated steps to find permanent solutions against encroachment under flyovers and bridges. Its city improvement committee (CIC) recently passed a resolution to vacate the spaces under flyovers. In fact, the CIC in its proposal stated that the city traffic police should shift all the chowkies that have come up under the flyovers to other places.

A CIC member said, “The space under a flyover should ideally be vacant, despite there has been a demand to develop these areas as authorized parking lots. The CIC has passed a resolution to keep a tab on encroachments below the flyovers. Such spaces should be utilized for the road users.”

Commuters and local residents have been frequently complaining about the illegal use of such spaces. One such example is the space under the flyover in the Patil Estate area. The space under the Patil Estate flyover in Wakdewadi is in a disarray because of illegal parking of vehicles and dumping of garbage. Over the time, it has become an extension of the Patil Estate slums, with people using it for all private purposes.

Sanjay Shinde, who regularly travels from old Pune-Mumbai road through the Patil Estate area, said, “The space under the flyover has been occupied by vehicles. There is no control over such activities. The space should be vacant.”

“The PMC can put up a mesh around the space to avoid its illegal use,” he added.

Pune: A scrutiny by All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) of teachers on the rolls at engineering colleges across the country found that over one lakh either existed on paper or were working without the requisite qualification or teaching at multiple institutes as full-time faculty.

“Since renewal or continuation of engineering courses depended on AICTE’s approval of information provided by the colleges, the institutions were forced to submit correct data which eventually resulted in the number of teachers coming down from about 6.5 lakh to 5 lakh at engineering colleges. The number of seats in engineering colleges too has come down to about 14 lakh,” AICTE chairman Anil Sahasrabuddhe told TOI.

Sahasrabuddhe said, “We wanted to identify bogus teachers or ghost faculty in engineering colleges. We told all colleges to submit the data of their teachers when they apply for renewal or continuation of technical courses. As for the ID card, we asked them to submit the PAN card details or the Aadhaar card details of the faculty. We found that there were many colleges, which were showing ghost faculty or bogus faculty on their rolls. We also found that there were people who had their names as teaching faculty of several colleges. We were able to bring down over 1 lakh such teachers and now the number of teaching faculty is about 5 lakh.”

There were about 16 lakh seats in all engineering colleges of the country. After progressive closure clause, many colleges had to shut down divisions, some did it due to non-availability of students. About 10 lakh students enter engineering colleges across India. The remaining seats are vacant, Sahasrabuddhe added.

397,['29/01/2020'],Heated chemo drugs have more impact: Doctors,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: Certain chemotherapy drugs when heated up can become more effective, say cancer specialists.

The novel method — Hyperthermic Intra-Vesical Chemotherapy ( HIVEC ) — is currently being used in city hospitals to treat bladder cancer patients.

The process involves warming the chemotherapy drug before releasing it into the cancer-affected bladder through a special catheter. The drug is heated up to 43-45 degree Centigrade. It’s circulated four times in a minute within the bladder and found to have encouraging results in preventing further development of cancer, say doctors.

Recently, the technique was used on a 58-year-old male bladder cancer patient at Fortis Hospital. “We use the heated chemo drug in the confined space of the bladder. This has greater bio-absorption and improves the entire process of chemotherapy. It further stimulates the body’s immunity to enhance the drug’s benefit,” said Dr Mohan Keshavamurthy, director urology, uro-oncology Fortis Hospital, who headed the treatment team.

“In high-grade bladder cancer, removal of the bladder is an option, but it has social and psychological consequences for a patient. In such cases we suggest HIVEC. Also, there is a significant probability of recurrence of cancer among many patients, which can be prevented using HIVEC,” said Dr Mohan.

At HCG hospital, HIVEC has been used to treat seven first-stage high-risk bladder cancer cases in the last two years.

“Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), an intravesical immunotherapy used for treating early-stage bladder cancer, may turn out to be unresponsive for some patients. In such cases, we heat a chemotherapy drug, intravesical mitomycin, up to 43-45 degree Centigrade,” said Dr Raghunath S Krishnappa, uro-oncologist, HCG.

Heated chemotherapy drugs are also used in treating select cases of third-stage cancer in gastrointestinal tract and ovaries at some city hospitals. In HIPEC (hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy), the heated drug is passed via peritoneum, a membrane forming the lining of the abdominal cavity.

According to Dr Manjunath N, medical oncologist, Vydehi Hospital, HIPEC is being used at their hospital for close to seven years. “Increased temperature enhances the efficacy of the drug. It increases cell penetration,” he explained. Dr Rani Bhat, head and senior consultant, gynaecological oncology, HCG said: “Currently, we use HIPEC treatment only for select patients. The outcomes have been satisfying. However, research on this issue is on and we need to understand the future better.”

Not at govt-run Kidwai yet

The heated chemotherapy treatment mode is yet to be tried out at government-run Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology (KMIO). The required equipment costs no less than Rs 25 lakh, while one opting for HIPEC pays Rs 60,000.

“HIPEC is more essential at a public hospital like Kidwai, where we get patients in third and fourth stages of cancer. It can be very helpful in treating ovarian colorectal and stomach cancers. After removing the tumour, one sitting of HIPEC can check the recurrence,” said Dr C Ramachandra, director, KMIO.

“We can buy the equipment only when Ayushman Bharat-Arogya Karnataka scheme allows cashless treatment for the same. Else, it becomes very expensive for patients,” Dr Ramachandra told TOI.

400,['29/01/2020'],International Theatre Festival of Kerala concludes on Wednesday amid demand to make it more vibrant,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Those associated with ITFoK said it was an ‘average affair’ in terms of selection, seminar and discussions

THRISSUR: The International Theatre Festival of Kerala ( ITFoK ) will conclude on Wednesday, leaving behind a demand: a thorough revisit of the present format to ensure that it is on the same page with its founding goals.

Those associated with ITFoK said the festival was an ‘average affair’ in terms of play selection, seminar and discussions. Theatre activist Sheena A M said the usual festive mood at Regional Theatre was missing and the ambience felt silent as a grave during the festival on most occasions. C G Byju, another theatre activist, attributed this to lack of public participation largely to bureaucratization and organizers limiting their efforts to the limited few in their circles.

But festival coordinator K Jaleel refuted the charges and said some theatre activists in Kerala adopt an indifferent attitude if their plays are not included at ITFoK. He said paucity of funds was the culprit for 80% of the shortcomings. Only Rs 1 crore was sanctioned for ITFoK when Rs 3 crore was required, he said.

Prabalan Velur, who is active in this field for two decades, said an atmosphere of subtle fear was prevailing in the academy where theatre activists are not free to express their opinions and it is important to know why this is happening. P N Prakash, who was a member of the selection panel for Malayalam plays, said discussions at seminars did not reflect the intensity prevailing in India’s political landscape. Theatre activist K V Ganesh said the setbacks of this edition should be a lesson to evolve a more mass-based, vibrant festival in future.

Among international plays ‘Silver epidemic’ from Brazil and ‘Coriolanus’ from Iran was widely appreciated. Plays like ‘An evening with immigrant’ from the UK and ‘I is another–Rimbaud in Africa’ from Norway invited criticisms for failing to communicate with the audience. Among Malayalam plays, ‘Veendum Bhagavante Maranam’, ‘Bhaskara Pattelurum Thommiyude Jeevithavum’ and ‘Old Man and Sea’ were well received, while the play ‘Bombay Sketches’ invited criticism. ‘Salma Deewani’ from Hyderabad and Kala Dhabbah Badel Ki Tarah Aa Raha Hai from Bhopal were appreciated by the audience.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court will on Wednesday deliver its order on the plea of one of the death row convicts in Nirbhaya case , challenging rejection of his mercy plea by the President on the ground that all the relevant material was not placed by the government before him.A bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna reserved its order after hearing the case for one and half hours during which senior advocate Anjana Prakash, appearing for Mukesh Kumar, contended that the President was not given all the documents to decide the mercy plea and there was non-application of mind in rejecting it. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, however, refuted the allegation and said there was no illegality in dismissal of mercy petition as all relevant materials were placed before the President by the Union home ministry.Alleging that there was undue haste on the part of the government in deciding the mercy plea, Prakash contended that the convict was physically and mentally tortured inside Tihar Jail and he was illegally put in solitary confinement, which must be considered while deciding on his plea. She said Mukesh was beaten on a daily basis inside the jail and was even forced to have sexual intercourse with other convicts in the Nirbhaya case in public glare inside the prison premises.Countering her contentions, Mehta reminded the court of the brutal and bestial act of the convict in merciless rape and killing of Nirbhaya and said that the mercy plea is not a “luxurious jurisdiction” for him. Mehta said suffering inside the jail cannot be a ground to seek mercy and told the bench that the convict was never placed in solitary confinement. He said Mukesh was kept in a separate cell on many occasions like many of the prisoners and was allowed to mingle with other inmates.“There was no arbitrariness in the decision to reject his mercy plea. It is a mandate of law to expeditiously decide mercy plea as delay caused dehumanising effect on the death row convict. The home ministry placed all the documents along with report on his medical condition before the President,” Mehta said. He also placed before the bench two original files containing correspondence for consideration of mercy plea and file noting.Observing that it has very limited jurisdiction in examining the validity of the decision taken by the President, the bench reserved its order.Nirbhaya, a 23-year-old paramedic, was brutally assaulted and gang-raped in a moving bus in south Delhi and thrown out of the vehicle with her male friend on December 16, 2012. She died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.The trial court awarded the convicts death sentence in September 2013 and six months later, Delhi high court upheld their conviction and sentence.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73717232,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-124515,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/tortured-sexually-abused-in-jail-convict/articleshow/73711558.cms

Raghunath Mashelkar addresses the gathering at CSIR-Neeri

Nagpur: India needs a new innovation framework which is affordable, scalable and sustainable for which there should be a ‘quantified’ system to assess, fund and monitor everything, from start-ups to various projects, said Raghunath Mashelkar , former director general of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).

He was speaking on his book ‘From leap frogging to pole-vaulting: Creating the magic of radical yet sustainable transformation’ at CSIR-Neeri auditorium.

Mashelkar said suitable framework should be used for start-ups, government-funded, and in-house institutional and industrial projects. He showed how the assured framework can be used for judicious evaluation of successful as also unsuccessful innovations.

In his book, Mashelkar has laid out the contours of an integrated strategy with assured success. He also spoke about why start-ups should pole-vault and not leapfrog, based on the assured framework. It looks at scalability and sustainability in economic, environmental and societal context and delves on why start-ups should be distinctive, he added.

He said there were some recent game-changing assured innovations which had a deep impact. He said the telephone could reach 50 million users in 50 years, but a recent mobile phone entity took only 83 days. This is pole-vaulting, he said.

Earlier, Mashelkar had a meeting with Rakesh Kumar, director of CSIR-Neeri. He also interacted with Sunil Mansinghka, coordinator, Govigyan Anusandhan Kendra.

PK Labhasetwar, senior principal scientist and head, water technology and management division, CSIR-Neeri, briefed on performance evaluation of 12 water treatment technologies and other issues.

JS Pandey, chief scientist and head, climate change and skilling division (CCSD), introduced Mashelkar. Sadhana Rayalu, chief scientist and head, environmental material division (EMD), proposed a vote of thanks.

Shalini Dhyani conducted the proceedings while scientists Ankit Gupta, coordinated the event.

PUNE: Seven standard VIII students of an English medium school in Kondhwa were booked on Monday by the Wanowrie police on charges of rioting and assaulting their classmate on November 22, last year.The assault took place during the recess after a quarrel over the 15-year-old victim’s prompt replies to the teachers’ questions in class the same day.The victim’s father said he had reported the matter to the school’s authorities immediately, but they did not act on his complaint. He then met senior officials at the police commissionerate and then lodged an FIR against the students.He also said that some students in his son’s class do not like that his son replies to questions that teachers ask in the course of their study.The school’s authorities told TOI that the student was not beaten up and the allegations levelled by the father were false and baseless.“During the recess, the seven students cornered the victim and sought an explanation from him about his replies to the teachers’ questions. They told the victim that because of him the teachers scolded them,” the police said.Matters grew heated and a quarrel broke out among them. “In a fit of anger, the students abused the victim, then thrashed and kicked him. The FIR says one of the students pulled out a window curtain rod and attacked him. The other students gagged his mouth with the curtain and then beat him up, injuring him,” the police said.Investigating officer sub-inspector Abhijit Joagdand said they are recording the statement of the doctors treating the student, collecting his injury certificate and recording the statements of teachers and other students.“We will take a call on any action against the students who are 15-year-olds,” Joagdand added.The father said he took his son to three hospitals for treatment after the November 22 attack and filed a complaint with the school’s principal seeking action against the students who beat up his son but no action was taken even after several reminders.“When the school did not give me justice, I filed a complaint plea with the Pune police commissioner. The Wanworie police later called me and recorded my complaint,” he added.The school’s chairman told TOI that they took the boy to a private hospital immediately after he sustained injuries in school.“We inquired into the incident immediately and learned that the student had a fall after he was pushed by his classmates and fell unconscious. The student was not thrashed. We suspended all seven students involved in the incident for six days,” the chairman said.“The students and their parents parents were counselled for three days. We took an undertaking from them that they will not indulge in violent behaviour. We also counselled the injured student and his parents.

Makrand Nikam, chief of the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation’s (PCMC) water supply department, said the civic body would soon launch a drive to recover the Rs60 crore arrears.

PCMC officials said the maximum amount of arrears Rs10.19 crore was from the Zone C comprising areas such as Chikhali, Moshi, Bhosari and parts of Pimpri.

405,['29/01/2020'],Govt ‘confused’ on gas relief hike,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Bhopal: Ahead of Supreme Court constitutional bench hearing the curative petition for enhanced compensation for Bhopal gas victims, Madhya Pradesh government seems to be confused on its stand on the issue.

Bhopal gas relief and rehabilitation minister, Arif Aqueel said he is ‘unclear’ whether state government can provide supportive documentation pertaining to increase in number of deaths and injured, owing to the Bhopal gas disaster of 1984.

Confusion over the state’s stand comes at a time when enhanced compensation is being demanded by the NGOs as interveners in the case. It is pegged at USD 15 billion, at current exchange rates.

When contacted, state government officials did not clarify on what will be the increased number of dead and injured, 34 years after the Bhopal gas disaster.

On Tuesday, a five-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra adjourned the hearing till Wednesday and said Chief Justice of India S A Bobde would take a call on composition of the bench to hear the matter. Supreme Court Judge Justice S Ravindra Bhat on Tuesday recused himself from hearing the Centre’s plea seeking Rs7,844 crore as additional fund from successor firms of US-based Union Carbide Corporation for giving compensation to the gas victims.

Five years after the world’s worst industrial disaster in 1989, GOI made an out-of-court settlement with Union Carbide Corporation of US$470 million or Rs713 crore at exchange rate of 1989. “Settlement was based on basis of assumption that there were 3,000 deaths and 20,000 injured. The magnitude of the disaster was grossly underestimated,” said Bhopal Gas Peedith Sangharsh Sahayog Samiti (BGPSS) co-convener ND Jayaprakash. Late Abdul Jabbar challenged the settlement between Union government and UCIL, and later it was converted into a curative petition.

“The number of deaths attributed to gas leak is about 20,000 and over 1.70 lakh are seriously injured,” he added.

“MP government is an intervener in this petition for enhanced compensation and justice for Bhopal gas victims. It is a chance to correct a historic wrong,” said gas activist, Rachna Dhingra.

“State government would infwsorm the court of accurate number of dead, owing to the disaster,” said Aqueel, after a meeting with officials including principal secretary Pallavi Govil. Enhanced compensation for gas affected and their dependents has been of the major poll promises of the Congress party. NGO activists have taken on the government and the chemical company (now Dow Chemicals) seeking rehabilitation and enhanced medical care compensation.

Going by MP government records number of cases awarded compensation as a result of injury or death due to the Bhopal gas leak are 5,74,366.

On January 8, 2012 then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan wrote to the PM seeking that as per records 15,342 people have died as a result of the disaster and there family members should all receive appropriate compensation in the category of death.

406,['29/01/2020'],All you need to know about Schengen VISA,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Amit Sharma, regional head of VFS Global, a visa facilitation firm that processes visa application in India for 50 governments and has 508 application centres in 17 cities, answered questions that often spring up in a traveller’s mind regarding visa application

Q. When seeking Schengen visa for multiple countries visits, to which country should one apply?

A. Application needs to be made to the country where one will spend the maximum number of days. Hence, if one plans to visit Italy, Germany and France with maximum number of days in Germany, then one needs to apply for Schengen visa from Germany although port of entry may be Italy and exit France. But if one spends equal number of days in all the countries, then the visa should be taken from the country where the port of entry is located

Q. How early should one apply for visa?

A. Most countries accept applications three months in advance. From February 2, Schengen that allows access to 26 countries in Europe will allow applications six months in advance. The time required to process the visa application and get back the passport may range from one working week (5 days) to three weeks (15 days). Between mid-March and July-end, the peak season for applications ahead of the summer break, it is best to apply for visa at least a month in advance

Q. What should one be careful of before applying for visa?

A. Go through the checklist of documents required for visa from the particular country and keep them ready for submission. Not only do documents vary from one country to another, the specification of passport photo (size and background colour) also varies. A mistake may lead to rejection of the application

Q. If one has taken a country’s visa that requires biometric enrollment or a Schengen visa, does one need to provide biometric yet again if travelling the next year?

A. If one travels to the same country or any one of the Schengen countries within 59 months or one month short of 5 years of the previous visit, one does not require to submit one’s biometric. That means, the visa application can be submitted by anyone and not necessarily the applicant

Q. If one’s visa application is rejected by a country, does that mean one can never travel there?

A. There is no restriction on making a fresh application to travel to the country. The rejection may happen due to several reasons, including the situation and circumstances at the time that may change when the person applies again. If there is query in the application inquiring if there has been a rejection of visa in the past, the correct answer needs to be furnished

Q. If a country rejects a visa application, will the visa fee be refunded?

A. Most countries do not refund visa fee. UK refunds application fee less an administrative fee

Q. Does availing specialised, prime time or premium service ensure early processing and expeditious issue of visa? Can a travel agent help in issue of visa?

A. No. The services offered by visa application centres are like premium lounge and allied offerings at an airport to different category of passengers who must wait to board the same plane. A travel agent can help file the visa form and arrange the documents but no one can influence the process, which is in the hands of the particular country’s consular staff. Any attempt to influence may actually lead to visa rejection

HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has urged the 15th Finance Commission to allot an additional Rs 12,000 crore to Telangana this year. He said the state would badly require the funds to complete Kaleshwaram irrigation project and Mission Bhagiratha.In a two-page letter, the chief minister said Telangana has taken up irrigation and infrastructure projects under a mission mode and urged the Finance Commission to allot funds liberally. “Since Telangana and Gujarat have begun implementing the scheme of providing drinking water to every household, we asked the commission to allot funds. The Finance Commission has responded positively,” said finance minister T Harish Rao, who submitted the chief minister’s letter during the commission’s interaction with various states in Delhi on Tuesday.The chief minister also reminded Finance Commission chairman NK Singh how he had lauded the efforts of Telangana in the irrigation and infrastructure sectors. “The geographical terrain of Telangana is such that major rivers like Krishna and Godavari flow deep below ground level. Therefore, irrigation is possible only with multi-stage lift irrigation schemes, which require large-scale capital investments,” he said in the letter.KCR said Telangana had made Mission Kakatiya operational within a short period by investing Rs 80,000 crore. He said Telangana needs a substantial investment of Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the irrigation sector and recalled how Mission Bhagiratha is being lauded by other states.The operational and maintenance cost of lift irrigation projects is pegged at Rs 40,168 crore and for Mission Bhagiratha, it is Rs 12,772 crore. KCR said the Finance Commission should consider allocating funds so that state could complete works.Meanwhile, Harish said that when they asked the Finance Commission to hold its regional conference in Hyderabad, Singh had agreed immediately.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73717352,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-386597,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/cm-seeks-rs-12k-cr-from-finance-panel/articleshow/73709908.cms

CHENNAI: Chennai airport may be taking steps to screen passengers for coronavirus symptoms, but the airport lacks a well-equipped and isolated quarantine centre to handle people with infection.A plan which was floated to set up a quarantine and isolation centre outside the terminal during the Ebola breakout in 2014 has not materialised yet. Land has been identified near the airport terminals by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Airport Health Organisation (APHO) under ministry of health and family welfare. But construction is yet to begin.The airport has now set up a quarantine room at the international arrival terminal to handle passengers who have influenza-like symptoms because coronavirus is spreading in China.The new building that was to come up near the terminal was supposed to accommodate Airport Health Organisation officials, isolation ward for infected passengers and a quarantine area to observe healthy passengers who need monitoring to find out if they would develop symptoms for infectious diseases (example for yellow fever).“The idea is that the building should be away from the main building and should not have common air conditioning or common sewage link,” said an official.Sources said the construction was stuck because APHO, which comes under ministry of health and family welfare, and AAI, which comes under ministry of civil aviation, are unclear about who should build it. Though it is meant for passengers at the airport, it will be run by APHO.“There are no cases of coronavirus yet. But if some passenger is found to be infected, they cannot be kept at the terminal for long because the air conditioning is common,” said an official.Dr Roshni Arthur senior regional director regional office of health and family welfare said, “Land has already been identified to build a centre for the airport. But it has not taken off because of some problems regarding construction. It is difficult to say when it can be completed. Now, we use Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.”Passengers who come from countries with a risk of yellow fever without vaccination are sent to the quarantine facility at general hospital where they are observed for three to five days and are allowed to go if they do not develop symptoms.“There is a difference between quarantine centre and isolation centre. Quarantine is to keep the healthy people to see if they will develop symptoms like in the case of yellow fever while for coronavirus the need is for isolation of the passengers with symptoms,” Dr Roshni said.A quarantine facility is not needed for coronavirus because people with symptoms need to be isolated and a facility has been created at general hospital, she said.Airport director C V Deepak said, “The land was identified so that APHO office can be moved from the current location along with quarantine centre so that it can be taken up for development. They have to take a call on who should build and decision has to be taken at the ministry level. If the health ministry decides that we should build then the ministry of civil aviation needs to decide.”",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73716264,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164048,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/coronavirus-no-facility-at-city-airport-to-handle-infected-flyers/articleshow/73709947.cms

Pune: A senior officer of the city police on Tuesday said they were waiting for directives from the office of the director-general of police before taking a call on handing over the investigation papers of the Elgar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency.

On Monday, a team of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had visited senior officers at the Pune police commissionerate in the wake of the Union home ministry’s order on January 24, transferring further probe into the Elgar case to the NIA.

“The NIA officials sought to give us a letter requesting handing over of the case papers to them, but we could not accept it, nor did we hand over the case papers to them as we are waiting for specific directives in this matter from the DGP (director-general of police (DGP)’s office,” the city police officer told reporters with a request not to quote him.

“Normally, letters which order transfer of sensitive cases from one agency to another, ought to be routed through proper and legal channels. For instance, the transfer happens only when there are orders from the DGP’s office or from the court. We shall hand over the case papers to the NIA on the receipt of directives from the DGP’s office and we expect this to happen soon,” he said.

The officer said, “The NIA officials were allowed to see the documents related to the case which are already in public domain. These included the FIRs and the two chargesheets filed so far in the court, among other papers. Apart from these documents, nothing else was shown to the NIA officials. We cannot share the sensitive information, which is still with the police.”

Jaipur: The humble khadi may not have the same global appeal as its patron who saw it as a symbol of strength and self-reliance, creating a contemporary story for the iconic fabric would be a topic for the frontline designers from India, UK, Japan and other countries at an event to be held for marking the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

While lack of branding, designing that is fashionable to the youth, capacity building for increasing production volume and incentives to make the products cheaper is attributed to khadi losing out to competition, the fallout has also not helped the rural artisans and workers engaged in the sector.

Additional chief secretary, Industries, Subodh Agarwal said the two-day international conference will seek to address these challenges. “There is a sense of urgency for addressing issues of poverty eradication, community empowerment, social justice, gender equality and environmental concerns. Discussions will revolve around production capacity, quality designing, export potential, employment and livelihood at the conference,” said Agarwal about the two-day event that starts from January 30.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, whose government extended 50% discount on khadi products as part of its celebrations of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi’s, will inaugurate the event.

HYDERABAD: An accused in theft cases attacked his associate with a knife at Film Nagar basthi on Tuesday during an argument over a cellphone. The accused, Irshad, 23, was taken into custody and an attempt to murder case registered against him. Irshad and his friend Ravinder met at their residences and soon entered into a heated argument over the phone.

“In a fit of rage, Irshad attacked Ravinder on his neck with the knife. Family members and neighbours rushed Ravinder to a hospital where he is out of danger,” Banjara Hills inspector N Kalinga Rao said. Police said the duo has a criminal record. Both are accused in cellphone and two-wheeler theft cases registered at Banjara Hills, Jubilee Hills, Raidurgam and Narsingi police stations.

A few days ago, during the birthday celebrations of Ravinder, Irshad took his friend’s cellphone without informing anyone. Later, Ravinder realised that the phone was at Irshad’s home.

“Ravinder went to Irshad’s house and took the phone from his mother. Later, Ravinder and his friends roughed up Irshad accusing him of trying to steal the phone,” Rao said.

PUNE: The government will set up a task force to ease the foreign students ’ visa issues , said HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ on Tuesday.

The task force would be set up by the ministry of human resource development (HRD) with the ministry of external affairs and officials of the University Grants Commission and Indian Council of Cultural Relations (ICCR), he said.

Pokhriyal was in the city to inaugurate the two-day conference “Destination India”, aimed to develop a road map for the country to attract more foreign students. The ICCR, in collaboration with Symbiosis International and Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), is conducting the conference at Symbiosis International’s Lavale campus.

Pokhriyal spoke about the country’s “soft power” — ayurveda, yoga, classical dance and music, Indian literature, among others — and called for promoting it to attract foreign students.

Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, the president of the ICCR, spoke about various avenues to be explored if India wanted foreign students to choose it as a favourite destination. He said there was a need to strengthen the network of international students passing out of the Indian universities. Even making sure they got the food they prefer in the Indian universities would go a long way in attracting them, he said.

“We should look at standardizing traditional Indian knowledge systems (TIKS) such as Bharatnatyam, yoga and ayurveda, and allow easy access to students seeking them,” Sahasrabuddhe said. He also said there was need for an English test for students seeking admission in India with preparatory classes in Indian embassies abroad and at ICCR.

The director-general of ICCR Akhilesh Mishra spoke about the need to make the “Indian experience” an asset and emphasized on the importance of creating better infrastructure to attract more international students.

The secretary of UGC, Rajneesh Jain, spoke about enhancing collaborations with universities overseas.

SB Mujumdar, founder and president of the Symbiosis Society , Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor of SPPU, and Anil Sahasrabudhe, chairman of All India Council for Technical Education, among others were present at the ceremony.

Bhopal: The family of 10-year-old Mayank Chhawani, whose mother’s body could not be used for cadaveric organ donation, is demanding a thorough investigation into the goof-up at Gandhi Medical College (GMC).

“I would have been more proud if other organs (heart, lung, liver and kidneys) of my mother’s body could have benefited others. Only her eyes would give sight to others,” said Mayank, a class 5 student with tears of pride in his eyes. He had lost his father when he was three-and-a-half-years-old.

On Tuesday, Mayank and his family members planted saplings in Bairagarh, also putting the ashes of his deceased mother in the soil. “When the trees provide green cover and give fresh air to all, it will remind me of my mother,” he said. The family planted saplings of Neem, Tulsi, Mango, Sheemshan and Asoka. Mayank’s mother was holding the holy Tulsi plant in her hand when she met with an accident on the BRTS bus stop in Halalpur on January 23.

“The loss of his mother and the organ donation fiasco has moved Mayank immensely. I am not sure what is going on in his mind. He wants to serve the society. I only want to be his guide,” said his uncle and lawyer, Jadgish Chhawani. He did not rule out seeking intervention in the matter from the Prime Minister’s Office, National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation and other agencies.

“Government hospitals should be at the forefront of organ donation. At the time, my sister-in-law was in hospital, there were eight head injury patients. Two of them died. Their relatives could be convinced about organ donation too,” said Chhawani. The harrowing experience of the past week has left him deeply disappointed.

The deceased was considered fit for organ donation. However, the body was declared unfit for organ donation within a matter of hours. Interestingly, a private hospital’s final report stated that the patient was ‘declared brain dead in Hamidia hospital surgical ICU at 5 pm on January 25’. In the same page, it notes that the ‘patient underwent cardiac arrest at 8.42 am on January 26’. A post-mortem and funeral soon after, considered highly unusual on a national holiday.

“I agree with the contentions raised. I would seek an explanation from authorities concerned,” said GMC dean, Dr Aditya Agarwal.

Sheo Shekar Shukla, principal secretary of the Directorate of Medical Education (DME), said, “I am in Delhi and would reply after looking into the matter.”

Two days after the goof-up, the DME or GMC are yet to issue showcause notices to the doctors involved.

Jaipur: The affected land owners of Ninder scheme on Tuesday submitted two more proposals to provide compensation to the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA). In a meeting, the farmers demanded that the authority should either provide compensation as per Land Acquisition Act, 2013 or as per two other fresh proposals.

As per the first proposal, the farmers urged that government should provide lease deed of the 25% developed land only after charging Rs 1 token fee. This land will be provided in the new scheme (which will be developed by JDA) as a compensation for acquiring their land. The farmers demanded cash compensation of Rs 2,250 per square metre for remaining 75% land.

The second proposal of the farmers says, if the JDA is not willing to provide cash compensation of Rs 2,250 square metre, it should develop 35% land in the scheme. Moreover, it should provide Rs 1,650 per square metre as a cash compensation for remaining 65%.

Samiti coordinator Nagendra Singh said, “We are not adamant and have given JDA all the options. Now, JDA has no option to refuse to the farmers demand,” he said. According to JDA records, a housing scheme is proposed on 327 hectares. Till date, approximately 204 hectares have been surrendered by farmers, while possession of 123 hectares are yet to be taken by the civic body.

A senior JDA official said, “The process of acquisition of land has already been completed. Directions will be sought from the state government on providing the compensation,” he said.

425,['29/01/2020'],Understanding complex legacy of Periyar,"This story is from January 29, 2020

CHENNAI: Burning of Rama portraits took place in 1956, and continued even after 1971.

It is more than 46 years since the passing of Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy, later known as EVR and Periyar , yet he continues to dominate Tamil Nadu’s political space.

The controversy stoked by actor Rajinikanth’s recent reference to the 1971 anti-superstition conference in Salem of the Periyar-led Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) has not died even after a fortnight as some AIADMK ministers have entered the fray asking Rajinikanth to tender an apology for trying to discredit Periyar.

Such has been the extent of Periyar’s dominance that any party that claims to have a Dravidian tag has to defend him, even while distancing itself from an indefensible act like burning of Rama’s portrait. While Dravidian parties concede that it was morally wrong to burn images or portraits of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana as Periyar and his supporters sought to do right from the 1950s, they want to be politically correct to be seen as Periyar supporters, since he founded the Dravidian, social reform movement and enabled the DMK and the AIADMK to come to power.

Periyar’s diatribe against brahmins could have resulted in the movement towards a casteless society going off on a tangent, but he had a creditable record of having fought for women’s rights, including the right to property, widow marriage, self-respect and intercaste marriages, rights for entry of dalits, Tamil archakas and Tamil mantras in temples, reservation in educational institutions and government jobs. As Periyarists would like to say, let us not throw out the baby with the dish water.

What is surprising, however, is the lack of awareness about Periyar and DK’s acts of burning portraits or effigies of the Hindu gods. The 1971 Salem incident was not the first nor was it the last. While some rationalists, seen as Periyarists, have sounded almost defensive on the issue, Periyar himself had made no bones about it. The act of burning Rama pictures by Periyar was to celebrate Ravana Leela to counter the Ram Leela in Delhi during the Dussehra festival, his argument being that Ramayana sought to perpetuate the Aryan domination over Dravidian ‘sudran’, Ravana of Tamil origin.

Earlier, in 1953, Periyar organised agitations for the desecration of Ganesha idols. He had said in a speech in 1953, ""We have to eradicate the gods who are responsible for the institution which portrays us as sudras, people of low birth, and some others as brahmins of high birth... We have to break the idols of these gods. I start with Ganesha because it is he who is worshipped before undertaking any task."" In 1956, Periyar publicly announced an agitation to burn pictures of Rama on the Marina beach. Paula Richman, in ‘The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia’ (Chapter 9: E.V. Ramasami’s Reading of the Ramayana) described in detail the events leading up to the burning of Rama’s pictures.

""On the first day of August in 1956, E. V. Ramasami (henceforth E.V.R.) set out for the Madras Marina to lead his followers in burning pictures of Lord Rama, hero of the Ramayana. This symbolic action would represent a reversal of the culmination of north Indian performances of the Ramayana, in which images of the epic’s villain, Ravana, are put to the flames as spectators watch in delight."" The account goes on to detail how political leaders implored Periyar to cancel the event so as not to offend orthodox Hindu Tamils, but Periyar remained unmoved, noting that ""there was bound to be a difference of views regarding any measure aimed at bringing social reform"". On the following day, the deputy commissioner of police arrested Periyar when he was stepped out of his house to head to Marina. Periyar seemed prepared for this eventuality, in addition to the picture of Rama and a box of matches, he was carrying a bedroll to spread on the hard prison floor.

In 1971, Ravana Leela was a fixture at the Salem conference. This was published in detail by the DK daily, ‘Viduthalai’, which was not only unapologetic, but also hailed the burning as a celebration by more than two lakh Tamils assembled there. After his death, Maniyammai, who took over the DK leadership, and her associates, were arrested for burning effigies of Rama, Sita and Lakshmana to re-enact the Ravana Leela at the DK headquarters, Periyar Thidal, in 1974.

In an article on Periyar, Cho Ramaswamy had said, ""There was no shade of hypocrisy in him (Periyar) and he never attempted sophistry while propounding his social philosophy."" The former Tughlak editor added that though EVR is still hailed as one of the leaders of the Tamil people, his philosophy is hardly valued. He fought superstitions, but his followers in the AIADMK tonsured their heads for the good health of their former leader J Jayalalithaa; he cursed the caste, now offshoots of his movement — the DMK and the AIADMK — are using caste politics to fight elections, and more caste-based parties have come up in Tamil Nadu; he was the apostle of secession, but his followers swear allegiance to national integration. Cho aptly surmised the idea of the man, saying, ""Periyar the singer was admired, his song was ignored. As a man Periyar was the embodiment of civility, which is why he is still loved. The man was greater than his message."" That’s something that ought to be remembered now.

In fact, we wanted to promote our three wheeler EVs for last mile connectivity for metro passengers but could not make much headway. However, in other states like Delhi, we have 1,000 vehicles running… we have our e-ricks running in Kochi and Nagpur as well but we don’t find the support here,” Kinetic Green founder and CEO Sulajja Firodia Motwani said.

She pointed out that though Telangana had announced the setting up of a dedicated park for EV manufacturing it has failed to attract players as the demand for EVs is yet to pick up in the state. Her company has sold around 300 units in the state compared to 3,500 in AP, 10,000 in UP and around 3,000 in Bihar.

While the lack of policy is deterring buyers, Michael Liu, chairman, Dao EVTech, said the Telangana government should also abolish road tax on EVs like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. “Telangana state does not have ancillary units supporting electric vehicle manufacturers, so the government should give EV companies more incentives/ subsidies to set up manufacturing facilities,” he added.

Dao EVTech is currently setting up a 4000 square meters facility on the outskirts of Hyderabad and is in talks with the Andhra Pradesh government to set up a bigger manufacturing plant as AP has a favourable policy towards EV manufacturers.

While industry leaders have high expectations from the state, industries & IT principal secretary Jayesh Ranjan pointed out that the state government has guidelines in place and has been able to attract four battery manufacturers in the state and is also hopeful of clinching two mega deals by OEMs in the coming days. He also added that many startups working in the EV space have thrived in the city and are driving innovation.

While challenges remain, Arun Sreyas, founder, RACEnergy, points out that a large network of public transport and last mile connectivity options in Telangana provide an opportunity for electrification of mobility in scale. “Ranked second in the country in installed solar power capacity, the state also offers added opportunity to make EVs cheaper and cleaner,” he said.

He points out that the cost of EVs remains high primarily because of the high cost of the battery. RACEnergy has set-up an R&D facility and prototyping lab in Hyderabad and will be launching pilots in the near-term. “For commercial vehicles, the problem of lack of infrastructure is compounded as the drivers do not want to wait to charge their vehicles. Also, a vast network of public charging infrastructure is required to cover widespread areas of cities in Telangana,” he said.

Jayesh Ranjan

HYDERABAD: It will soon be mandatory for students of JNTU to study a module on cyber security , regardless of their stream and course, said Jayesh Ranjan , principal secretary (IT).

Ranjan made the announcement after inaugurating cyber security Centre of Excellence (CCoE), a joint initiative of the Government of Telangana and Data Security Council of India (DSCI) at Manjeera Trinity Corporate on Tuesday.

“The modules on cyber security will be mandatory for all students in the 300 plus colleges affiliated with JNTU, regardless of the course or stream (including management or pharmacy). This will help them understand security concerns and have an idea about basic cyber hygiene,” said Jayesh Ranjan.

The module will be introduced by this academic year, he further added. “We are planning to introduce it to students from the second or third year. The marks of the module will not be added to the final score, but it is mandatory to pass the test. Teachers will also have to undergo training and tests,” Ranjan said.

Speaking about CCoE, Rajendra Pawar, Founder and Chairman, NIIT Group said that it has been set up with the objective to create awareness about the cyber security ecosystem. The centre will also focus on the rising threats of Cybercrime and the need for cyber security. “The centre is equipped with an incubation centre for start-ups, an experience zone, and a training centre which will aim at providing a conducive cyber security ecosystem in the city,” he said.

The 6,000 square feet facility will serve as the epicentre of cyber security development in Telangana. The centre will have a training room, a 30-seater incubation zone. This centre will propel cyber security innovation and product development.

Speaking on the occasion, Rama Vedashree , Chief Executive officer, DSCI, said, “We are grateful to the government of Telangana for their support in establishing a CoE and helping us collaborate with stakeholders to uplift cyber security ecosystem. We partner closely with the government to build entrepreneurs that will impact the future of cyber security.”

Rasika Barla’s artwork with the theme ‘Digital well-being’ features in Google’s 2020 calendar

Nagpur: Little did Rasika know that her love for doodling and drawing artistic graphics will lead to being featured in Google’s annual calendar. Rasika Barla ’s artwork shares space with 11 other artists in Google’s annual calendar for 2020 with the theme ‘Digital well being’.

Google’s theme aimed to bring technology and art together to help people establishing digital well-being. Google collaborated with 12 selected artists across India, and Rasika was one of them.

Rasika, who specializes in the most intricate hand-drawn doodle art with a real sense of depth and art journaling, was one of the few people selected. Doodle art is a creative and fun way of expressing emotions and situations, which catches the fancy of many and is shared actively on social media platforms. Despite all the buzz, it still remains an underrated form of art.

Rasika's work offers an array of numerous, beautiful, black and white, and colour-filled doodles, all of which can be found in her awe-inspiring Instagram portfolio. She enjoys graphic design and illustration, and has made a name for herself with her series of flat lays and doodled notes from art session talks that add a fantastic visual element to boring old note-taking.

She has turned a collection of sketch notes into powerful journals. Expressing her thoughts about her art, she said, “The brief was to depict the idea of digital well being and creating a concept of playing with ideas. It is a rare opportunity to be given a free rein on such a brilliant canvas.”

All of her doodles are work of mind and hand, and some applications, which come handy, “The doodles were all hand-drawn, then scanned in, edited and composited in Photoshop.”

Rasika has collaborated with various artists and constantly worked towards growing the art quotient of Nagpur, conducting various art jamming sessions and workshops on doodling, art journaling etc.

Sharing her thoughts and happiness on being featured in Google Calendar, she said, “I am glad and extremely happy about the achievement. Art journal is an important part of my life and a place for creative expression.”

She stressed on the fact that spontaneous art acts as a mirror to our inner world and can help you to express, release, see, and heal your emotional pain.

HYDERABAD: The Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday announced that testing for the dreaded Novel Corona Virus (2019-nCoV) will begin at the ICMR lab in Hyderabad and at three other places in the country. In fact, several suspected cases of the virus which has now spread to at least six countries, have been reported in Hyderabad city.

The samples are being sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune. In a bid to cut out the time and hassle of transporting the samples (likely to have the highly contagious virus) the decision has been taken. The ICMR lab in Hyderabad, located in the Gandhi Medical College at Secunderabad, is biosafety level four lab which is the highest level and at par with the NIV lab.

ICMR has 10 labs in the country. The labs are only used for research and are not used for testing samples even in case of outbreaks. “The plan is to prepare it in 7-10 days for testing of samples. Since many suspected cases are being reported, the sample load is expected to increase,” said Dr K Shankar, director Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM), Meanwhile, Hyderabad has a Biosafety Level 2 lab at the Institute of Preventive Medicine (IPM) where tests for Swine flu are currently done but the lab is not prepared as yet to do tests for more contagious viruses. It is currently stuck in an upgradation process.

The vehicle carried 47 logs of khair wood of one cubic metre volume

PANAJI: There was high drama in Virdi, Sakhali, on Saturday night, after a man who was nabbed by forest guards for illegally transporting khair wood first tried to burn his vehicle and himself and then attempted to attack the forest guards with a knife.

Prahlad Chari, a resident of Virdi, was chased by three forest guards in the Keri range including Surla beat guard Shekhar Gawas after they received information that he was scheduled to transport illegally cut khair logs from Surla-Keri to Virdi. Upon intercepting him, they found that Chari did not have valid permissions for cutting and transporting the logs, which were estimated to be worth Rs 50,000.

Realising that he was cornered, Chari tried to first set his vehicle on fire and then immolate himself. Both attempts were foiled by the forest guards.

“Finding no way to escape, the offender attacked the forest personnel on duty with a sharp knife. The forest guards, however, thwarted his attempts and with assistance from the Bicholim police, nabbed him and took him into custody,” an official said.

Chari was subsequently booked by the range forest office at Keri for the illegal cutting and transportation of khair wood. An FIR for attempt to murder was also lodged against him.

Around 47 logs of khair wood having a volume of one cubic metre were seized together with the vehicle used to transport them.

“The seized khair wood has a market value of around Rs 50,000. More recovery of wood from the offender is anticipated as he has hidden the same at different places,” the official said.

Khair wood has substantial market value in Maharashtra’s Sawantwadi taluka as it is used in the preparation of ‘kattha’. The forest department has carried out similar seizures in the past.

HYDERABAD: With constant monitoring of student movements and by issuing regular warnings to those participating in protests , the central universities located in the state are said to be suppressing the voices of students against CAA, NRC, and NPR or any other issue.While students of English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), who organised a protest programme on Monday on the campus, said they were warned that they will be thrown out of the hostel if they take part in the programme. Same is the case with University of Hyderabad (UoH) students, who have been asked to take prior permission to organise public meetings.“We have organised a protest programme in the form of canvass painting event, where students can come and paint slogans to show their dissent. The administration immediately asked us to stop our protest. We were even threatened that protesters will be asked to vacate the hostel,” said an EFLU student, adding they are constantly being monitored.Students said that the university is stopping them from organising any kind of protests after Union human resource development minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal, said that the Centre will not tolerate universities becoming political hubs. UoH students, too, said that the administration is trying to snatch the democratic rights of students by abstaining them from organising public meetings without prior permission.“Every other day, the administration is releasing new circulars,” said Abhishek Nandan, president, student union, UoH. “They are asking us not to organise any protest programmes, and take prior permissions. Even today, there is a new circular saying that we can hold protests, dharnas, or marches only at Gurubakksh Singh Maidan or open air auditorium. They are just trying to snatch our democratic rights.”While EFLU administration said they are only asking students to follow ‘ordinance 61-rules of discipline-students’, UoH said that they are only asking students to organise protests in a democratic and peaceful manner.“The ordinance has been there since 2016,” said E Suresh Kumar, vice-chancellor, EFLU. “We have uploaded it recently on the website. Maybe, that’s why students are assuming that these are new rules.”Vinod Pavarala, UoH spokesperson, said that they had to release a circular saying that students can’t organise protests after 9pm as they are disturbing others on the campus.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73719570,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-334152,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/central-varsities-suppressing-our-voice-allege-city-students/articleshow/73711598.cms

The number of eligible people is around 80,000. So far, 1.97 lakh property owners in Delhi’s 1,731 unauthorised colonies have registered on DDA’s web portal for getting the ownership rights, he added.An official said over 4,000 applications with complete documents had been uploaded on the portal, out of which geo-coordinates and site mapping of around 300 properties had been completed.In October 2019, the Union Cabinet approved a proposal to grant ownership rights to the residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi under PM-UDAY.

Head-on: File photo of an accident that happened in Bantwal

Mangaluru: The Dakshina Kannada police , which has recently conducted a survey, has identified 123 spots prone to road accidents or black spots. The survey reports have been submitted to the PWD and NHAI, requesting them to make necessary changes on the roads, which witness frequent accidents.

The survey was conducted recently under the leadership of superintendent of police B M Laxmi Prasad . The government, which has taken into consideration the report of the Dakshina Kannada district police of the border road from Mani to Kodagu, has earmarked Rs 2 crore to make necessary changes to rectify accident spots.

“The Dakshina Kannada police which operates in Bantwal, Sullia, Belthangady, Puttur and Kadaba taluks, recently conducted a survey to find out spots prone to accidents or black spots, which saw fatal and non-fatal accidents in the past few years. The survey was conducted by personnel of various police stations, and they found 123 accident spots on the Bantwal-Bengaluru highway, BC Road-Belthangady Road and Bantwal-Sampaje road (which is in the border of Kodagu district). Now, we have asked the government bodies who are responsible to take corrective measures to prevent accidents from happening,” Laxmi Prasad told TOI.

The highest fatal and non-fatal accidents occur on the Bantwal-Sampaje road. According to Laxmi Prasad, these roads are wide and motorists tend to speed here, resulting in many head-on collisions, which result in multiple deaths.

The measures include making curved roads straight so there is clear visibility , construction of proper drains beside roads, installation of speed breakers, pedestrian crossings, road strips, cat eyes or reflectors, road marking and sign boards, road widening in certain places, removal of shops or any hurdles, installation of lights wherever there is poor illumination, construction of safety walls and trimming of trees.

“These are all simple changes but will have a great impact when implemented, and help reduce accidents,” added Laxmi Prasad.

In the first phase, changes will be made on the Mani-Sampaje highway, which is about a 70 km stretch. The government has earmarked Rs 28 crore for road widening and other works, and also kept aside Rs 2 crore to make necessary arrangements in accident spots. “The work has already commenced,” said Laxmi Prasad, adding that work on the BC Road to Belthangady Road stretch will begin soon, but the Bantwal-Bengaluru highway road widening, which has been stalled, will take some time, as a fresh tender is necessary for the same.

Nagpur: There is lot of panic among people over coronavirus these days. WhatsApp forwards are adding to their confusion. Doctors, on the other hand, have told people not to panic at all as lots of screening, tranquillization, and treatment initiatives have been taken across the state.

People affected by this virus are mainly those who have travelled to China recently. Most of such passengers are getting screened at major international airports in the country. So far, no person affected with new coronavirus has been found in India.

As far as Nagpur is concerned, there is absolutely no need to panic as no flyer coming via China reaches Nagpur airport without screening at some or the other international airport. “Still, we have issued advisory to keep record of travellers coming via China. Even if they are non-infected, the government will keep track of their health record,” said Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, deputy director (health) for Nagpur division.

Public health system in government as well as private set-ups have been asked to stay alert.

Microbiologist Dr Ashwini Tayde said that following common respiratory antiquates and hand washing habits are points to remember for all of us. “Coronavirus is not new for microbiology. But, one new variant in this family has been found in China and it is creating panic. Coronavirus is responsible for common cold and flue-like illnesses. As a result, staying away from viral infections can be a good preventive measure,” she said.

According to her, majority of victims of new coronavirus in China are elderly and ill people. So, keeping yourself fit and fine is the best way to stay safe.

Another news creating panic among people is that doctors in China are using HIV drugs for treatment of illness caused by coronavirus. Dr Milind Bhrushundi, who is expert in HIV treatment, said the two viruses are different.

“No vaccine has been developed to treat the new coronavirus yet. So, doctors are trying different combinationsfar. One of them is a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir — drugs used for treatment of HIV. But, both these viruses function differently,” he said.

Even WHO advisory has stated that standard recommendations to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses should be followed. This include maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, safe food practices and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.

Nagpur: The Nagpur University (NU) board of examinations and evaluation (BoEE) has set up a panel to inquire into the alleged paper leak at St Vincent Palloti College of Engineering, where the model question paper on November 22 exactly matched the Engineering Chemistry paper of NU exam on December 7.

There has been no action, however, in a similar inquiry panel into an earlier paper leak at Kamala Nehru College of Pharmacy. Here, the model question given on December 6, 2019, matched NU’s BPharm 3rd semester Organic Pharmaceutical Chemistry III paper.

The inquiry in the second case was conducted by BoEE director Prafulla Sabale, Dean of Science and Technology GS Khadekar and a subject expert. Acting pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande is likely to take a final decision on action to be taken in this case.

Sabale and Khadekar, beside a subject expert, would also be holding an inquiry into the Palloti case, which the TOI had reported on January 26. Deshpande refused to comment on both issues.

NU officials said the panel for the pharmacy paper leak has recommended strict action against the paper setter and moderator. They said there was a possibility that questions in internal exams by chance matched those appearing in university exams.

“The question paper set that goes for print is chosen through a rigorous process. This can’t be a coincidence. But, it is also expected that a teacher would avoid giving same practice questions he or she has put for university exams during class tests or revision,” officials said.

They said apathy on the part of moderator too can’t be ruled out, and therefore the panel has recommended action against both.

However, there may not be any immediate action, as the Pro-VC would refer the case to Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC), which will take a long time.

Former NU chairman of mass communication board Sunil Mishra said vice chancellor SP Kane must lodge an FIR as per norms. “Both cases amount to playing fraud with the university,” he said.

Nagpur: Despite efforts from the Central and state governments, farmer suicides continue unabated in the six Vidarbha districts coming under Nagpur division.

An RTI reply to activist Abhay Kolarkar’s queries stated that 4,286 farmers committed suicides in the six districts between 2001 and 2019, not only due to mounting debts, but also on account of nature’s vagaries, which often led to continuous crop failure on one or the other count — like unseasonal or excessive rains. Schemes like crop insurance too failed to stem the farmers’ deaths in the region.

The Maharashtra government, however, could find only 2,170 farmers’ families eligible for receiving compensation, while 2,042 were declared ineligible and 74 cases were pending for inquiry. In this period of 19 years, the government distributed compensation of over Rs21 crore.

Of all the deaths, 1,592 took place in the last five years, raising doubts over the government’s claim of providing aid to farmers through loan waivers and other schemes. The loan waivers introduced by both UPA and NDA governments also failed to grant any solace to the struggling farmers.

In reply to Kolarkar’s queries, Naib Tehsildar Padmashree Tasgaonkar of revenue section from the divisional commissioner’s office further informed that of over 4,000 deaths in Nagpur division, 3,086 took place between 2001 and 2015, and 1,200 since 2016.

Among the six districts, Wardha topped the list with 623 deaths, followed by Chandrapur with 352, Nagpur with 256, Bhandara with 206 and Gondia with 107. The naxal and tribal-dominated Gadchiroli witnessed 48 farmer deaths in the last five years — the least in the division.

Flaying the Central and state governments for ignoring the plight of farming community, Kolarkar said that while incomes in all sectors were rising, those in farming were still struggling to make ends meet. Successive governments failed to address the root cause for the large number of suicides and only indulged in pep talk for all these years, he said.

Nagpur: Miffed by friends-turned-foes, a man posted a threat message on a social media group in Etapalli taluka vowing to eliminate his rivals after joining the Maoist movement in Gadchiroli district.

Police are trying to zero in on the man who posted the message in the wee hours of Thursday.

The man, who is allegedly debt-ridden, mentioned ‘Lal Salam’, a key word used by Maoists, at the top of his post which he ended with a dramatic phrase ‘yeh Raj Naxal commando ka vada raha’ (This is a promise of Maoist commander Raj). He elaborated by stating that he would ensure that four persons from Etapalli and one of Mulchera taluka will have to pay for breach of trust which made him desert his family, including his daughter.

SP Shailesh Balkawade said the man behind the message may not have joined the rebel outfit as of now but police are trying to verify his antecedents. “We are looking into the motive behind the post. He is debt-ridden,” said the SP.

Apart from settling scores with ‘traitors’, who led him to financial ruin, the man also intends to pay back his creditors and that too at their doorstep, after joining the movement.

Till the filing of this report, no complaint was lodged by the ones named in the post.

443,['29/01/2020'],Income Tax Dividend: Does your dividend income need to be taxed thrice?,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: If you attend any annual general meeting, inevitably you will find a shareholder standing up and demanding her fair share of dividend. While capital appreciation is one of the primary reasons why people seek to invest in equity , dividend income is always welcome.The sweetness, however, is blunted to some extent by the triple levy of tax on the dividend. Dividend is a distribution of ‘after tax’ profit of a company and the tax paid by the company is the first level of tax that dividend bears. Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) is the second levy and the recently introduced ‘Super Rich Dividend Tax’ is the third. Shareholders earning dividend income of Rs 10 lakh or more have to bear a tax of 10% on such income. Thus, it comes as no surprise that both shareholders and companies are hoping for abolition of DDT.There are other challenges, too, for shareholders. If any expenditure is incurred in earning tax-free income, like dividend — say interest on borrowed funds for investments in equity, based on a formula, such expenditure is disallowed in the hands of the shareholder, as per the provisions of section 14A.Dividend, no matter the quantum, is tax-free in the hands of foreign shareholders. However, in most cases (unless the investment is structured via a few favourable countries such as Mauritius), investors cannot claim credit in their home country on the underlying tax — DDT.The triple whammy impact and a future scenario where DDT is abolished are explained by this illustration and the accompanying graphic: X is a small shareholder and has total income of less than Rs 5 lakh. In short, he does not bear any tax liability.Y earns dividend income of more than Rs 10 lakh and has total income of more than Rs 5 crore.In computing the scenario where DDT is abolished, it is presumed that the dividend income will be taxable in the hands of all shareholders at the applicable income-tax rates. While Budget 2020-21 may change the tax slabs/rates, the illustration uses the existing rates.Today, no country in the world has a DDT regime. While South Africa had introduced such a regime it was later abolished. Historically, in India, dividend has been taxed in the hands of shareholders and it was only in 1997 that DDT was introduced in the income-tax law. Interestingly, DDT was scrapped in 2002 only to be re-introduced in the next year on grounds of ease of tax administration.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has publicly termed DDT as regressive. Ideally, the DDT regime should be replaced by the classical system of taxing dividends in the hands of the shareholders. However, as seen in our illustration, given the high rate of surcharge of 37% in the hands of the super-rich, a concessional rate for taxing dividend income should be introduced.If this is done, it will not only help domestic shareholders, but also attract foreign investors who will get a foreign tax credit on the regular tax paid by them and not face the challenges relating to non-credit of DDT.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73715790,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-591624,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/does-your-dividend-income-need-to-be-taxed-thrice/articleshow/73715793.cms

NEW DELHI: Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri has “advised” all national carriers to suspend Kunal Kamra from flying for the next six months following the comedian’s “unacceptable behaviour” with TV anchor Arnab Goswami on an IndiGo flight. Puri posted his views on Twitter after IndiGo had suspended Kamra for the same duration and tagged the minister. Late night, Air India too banned Kamra from its flights “until further notice”.

Kamra, while aboard a Mumbai-Lucknow flight, had asked Goswami for an explanation of his “journalism”. He tweeted a nearly 2-minute-long video around 4pm, with caption “I did this for my hero... I did it for Rohit (deceased Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula ).” It shows Kamra talking to Goswami, while the latter remains silent.

Hours after the video went viral, IndiGo tweeted a statement saying it had suspended Kamra from using its services for next six months. Within minutes, Puri tweeted back to Indigo replying, “Offensive behaviour designed to provoke & create disturbance inside an aircraft is absolutely unacceptable & endangers safety of air travellers. We are left with no option but to advise other airlines to impose similar restrictions on person concerned,” Puri wrote. This means Kamra’s name could feature in a No Fly List . Soon after the suspension, Kamra tweeted, “Thank you Indigo a six month suspension is honestly very kind of you... Modiji might be suspending Air India forever.”

LAHORE: A top member of a pro-Khalistan outfit, wanted in India, has been shot dead by two unidentified attackers outside a gurdwara near the Wagah Border, a police source said on Tuesday.

Harmeet Singh alias ‘Happy PhD’, a member of the Khalistan Liberation Force , was killed on Monday near Dera Chahal Gurdwara on the outskirts of Lahore, the source said.

Singh, who hailed from Amritsar and was allegedly involved in the murder of RSS members in Punjab in 2016-2017, was among eight Khalistan-linked terrorists against whom the Interpol had issued “red notices” last year.

No FIR has been registered over Singh’s murder.

“We have been asked not to pursue this case. Therefore, no FIR has been registered in the murder of Harmeet Singh,” the source said.

The law enforcement agencies have cordoned off the area near the gurdwara since Monday and no one, including journalists, are allowed to go there. The source said the body has not been shifted to any of Lahore’s morgue for autopsy. Asked about the murder, a police spokesperson, however, expressed his ignorance over it. “We have no knowledge of such an incident,” the spokesperson said.

There are reports that Singh was shot dead by a local gang over financial disputes related to drug smuggling.

Singh had a degree of doctorate that earned him the alias “PhD”.

446,['29/01/2020'],‘Kids with 3 hours of screen time a day grow up less active’,"This story is from January 29, 2020

NEW DELHI: Is your little one spending more time watching television, videos on phone or using computer? If so, you need to be careful. Children aged two to three years, who spend more than three hours a day viewing screens such as tablets and televisions, grow up to be less physically active at age 5.5 years, compared to those who used screens for an hour or less each day, says a new study published in Lancet.

The study found that excessive screen time in childhood is linked to a range of health problems, including increased risk of obesity and reduced cognitive development. Doctors say screen viewing is becoming common among children in India with working parents being busy and finding inadequate time to spend with them. Also, screen viewing often comes as an easier option for parents as they go about their chores.

“Screen viewing, especially at an early age, impacts functioning of the brain, cognitive functions, social interactions, mood regulation and academic performance,” says Dr Yatan Pal Singh Balhara, additional professor of psychiatry and in-charge of behavioural addictions clinic at AIIMS. “It is parents who initially decide for their children but if these children get habituated in their formative years, it becomes a lifestyle for them as they grow up with an addiction during adolescence,” he further states.

Doctors say screen-viewing influences health mainly because it replaces time that would otherwise be spent doing something else, like physical activity and sleep.

World Health Organisation has already classified addiction to digital and video gaming as a mental health disorder. The latest study, involving more than 500 children in Singapore and published in Lancet Child and Adolescent Health journal, suggests that adhering to WHO guidelines to limit screen time to one hour per day or less among children aged two to five years may promote healthier behaviour in later life.

Parents were asked to report how much time the children spent on average either watching or playing video games on TV, using a computer, or using a hand-held device like mobile phone or tablet. These screen habits were recorded when the children were aged two years and again at three. Children in the study spent an average of 2.5 hours a day watching screens at age 2-3 years. The findings revealed that children who had used screens for three or more hours a day at age two to three years spent an average of 40 minutes more time sitting down each day at age five than those who had used screens for less than an hour a day at the same ages.

NEW DELHI: BJP Tamil Nadu stirred an online controversy on Tuesday after it posted a tweet from its verified handle stating the party had sent a razor set to former J&K CM Omar Abdullah . The tweet was deleted after online outrage.

The post came after an image believed to be of Abdullah with a grizzled beard went viral on January 25, when 2G internet services were restored partially in the union territory, only to be snapped again.

On Tuesday, BJP’s state unit tweeted, “Dear Omar Abdullah. It is very disheartening to see you like this while your corrupt friends are enjoying life outside. Kindly accept our sincere contribution, in case of any assistance, feel free to contact ur (sic) counterpart (Congress) for further help in this regard.”

The tweet was accompanied by a screenshot of the delivery receipt of e-commerce website Amazon addressed to Omar’s residence. The parcel contained a razor set. The tweet was criticised by several users as insensitive, including journalists, following which it was deleted.

DMK spokesperson Manuraj S @manuraj1983 attacked the BJP over the tweet, “And then no one wondered why @BJP4TamilNadu gets lesser votes than NOTA in Tamil Nadu. (B)ad Taste. (J)uvenile. (P) uerile.

Visakhapatnam: The CPM Visakhapatnam district committee has demanded that the state government revoke the GO No 72, which was issued to facilitate pooling of about 6,150 acres of land in 10 mandals of the district for housing projects. In a press release, CPM district secretary K Lokanatham said that thousands of farmers in 64 villages in these mandals could barely eke out a living by cultivating these lands for the last several decades.

“As per the guidelines stipulated in the earlier government order No 294, the government should not pool lands being utilised for farming. Even the recent government order No 72 made it clear that the land pooling exercise shall follow the guidelines mentioned in the earlier order (GO No 294). But again the same order unfortunately included assigned lands and other lands being used for farming in the land pooling proposals,” said Lokanatham.

“As per the government order, the assignees will get 900 square yards developed plot per an acre. The encroachers who have settled in these lands for more than 10 years will be given 450 square yards plot per an acre, while the encroachers for 5 to 10 years will get 250 square yards land. It is very unfortunate to mention these farmers as encroachers in the order. It is purely government’s mistake to not regularise the lands in the name of the farmers, ” said Lokanatham.

Visakhapatnam: A special task force, comprising officials of the prohibition and excise department have destroyed ganja plantations across 500 acres land over the last one month in Visakhapatnam Agency with the help of drones and satellite images and the support of the police, forest and revenue departments.

Now, officials are chalking out plans to destroy ganja plantations in 4,000 acres land. While the government agencies are being vigilant, rooting out ganja cultivation in the area remains a challenge as the green drug is cultivated across 15,000 acres land across the Agency.

The special task force began the exercise of destroying ganja plantations across 4,000 acres land in a bid to root out its cultivation in the Agency and parts of East Godavari district in September 2017.

Speaking to TOI, T Srinivas Rao, deputy excise commissioner of Visakhapatnam said that the special task force has destroyed ganja across 4,300 acres land since 2017 in seven mandals of the Agency. “The drive to destroy ganja will continue,” he added.

Meanwhile, officials of ITDA (Integrated Tribal Development Agency), Paderu have come forward to help tribals switch from growing ganja to growing rajma, millets, turmeric and other cash crops.

“We hope our drives will yield results as more ganja growers will switch to other crops. We are using drones and satellite images to identify plantations in remote areas,” Srinivas Rao further said.

On the other hand, K Surendra of CPI(M) said that some farmers are managing to make a lot of money by growing ganja, which is why they are averse to switching crops.

Surendra further said that the special task force has only managed to destroy ganja plantations in roadside villages and the force is hesitant to foray into remote areas suspecting the presence of Maoists and possibility of facing resistance from tribals.

Sources informed that many ganja growers are reluctant to switch to other crops is because of its high profitability.

However, the cultivation, smuggling, selling, buying and consumption of ganja are punishable under the NDPS Act, said ACP (Task Force), Vizag , A Trinad Rao. He added that many people, from tribals to inter-state land sharks are involved in the trade.

According to activist G Srinivas, most of the ganja cultivation occurs in remote areas along the Andhra-Odisha border. Srinivas said that if officials can put an end to investment in the crop, tribals will gradually migrate to other crops.

A majority of the students of Andhra University belong to weaker sections and rural and tribal parts of the region. The nearly 50% fee hike is sheer injustice to them,” said Naidu.

Meanwhile, registrar Prof V Krishna Mohan tried to pacify the students . He said the university’s executive committee took the decision a year ago.

But, L Chinnari, SFI Visakhapatnam city committee president, said students had no clue about the fee hike. “They came to know about it only after they approached the varsity office to pay the fee. Chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy promised to reimburse 100% tuition fee of the students. But now how can the state government increase the fees?,” questioned Chinnari.

The AU students told TOI that university authorities have promised to address the issue in the next few days. tnn

Visakhapatnam: The state government issued a fresh notification on January 27 overriding the previous notification inviting applicants for the position of the vice-chancellor of Andhra University . It will be followed up by the setting up of a new search committee.

After the then incumbent vice-chancellor Professor G Nageswara Rao’s tenure came to an end in July 2019, Prof PVGD Prasad Reddy was given the additional charge of vice-chancellor. Consequently, the state government invited applications for the post and constituted a committee in August to select three suitable candidates.

After a series of meetings and scrutiny of more than 100 applications, the search committee submitted its report to the government about three months ago. But with the new notification, the selection process may be protracted.

According to well-placed sources, although the search committee received more than 100 applications for the post of vice-chancellor. “But a total of only 20 names were short-listed in the preliminary stage and finally three names were chosen. But we don’t know why they cancelled the earlier notification,” the source said.

The state government’s decision however has led to several speculations among varsity circles. There were discussions on how the new notification and committee may affect the chances of serious contenders for the post.

Andhra University has to expend the Rs 100 crore given to it in the second phase of the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme by April 2020 to become eligible for receiving Rs 1,000 crore funds in the third phase.

Andhra University is one of the 10 state universities from across the country to get the Rs 1,000 crore assurance from ministry of human resource development. The delay in the appointment of a new vice-chancellor may adversely affect the RUSA project.

Much of the harvested fish will be sent to Kerala.In each HDPE (high density polyethylene) cage of 6 metre diameter and 3.5 metre depth, around 2,500-3,000 fingerlings were stocked from end of May to beginning of June, 2019.After eight months of culture, with around 90 % survival rate, the fish are now ready for harvest, yielding around 2-2.5 tonnes of fish from each cage. CMFRI pioneered cage culture of pompano and orange spotted grouper species in 2015-16.Dr Shubhadeep Ghosh, principal scientist of Visakhapatnam regional centre of CMFRI said, “Fingerlings were initially fed artificial pellets containing 45% protein. Average body weight at harvest ranges around 700 gms. The cost of production is around Rs 220 per kg and the market price is Rs 320-Rs 350 per kg. In 2015, for the first time in the world, CMFRI grew seeds of the Indian Pompano species. The institute has produced over two lakh seeds so far. The species is scarce in the wild but can withstand a wide variety of temperatures and salinity and is suited for cage culture. NFDB has provided funds worth Rs 3.5 crore for 100 cages in Andhra Pradesh. There are 20 cages installed at various sites off Vizag coast.Imelda Joseph, head of the mariculture division of CMFRI, Kochi averred that the government needs to support and facilitate marketing of the harvested fish.

The protestors staged a demonstration at the Mahatma Gandhi statue near the GVMC administrative office on Tuesday.

Speaking on the occasion, B Ganga Rao of CPI(M) said that the BJP government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is spoiling the ‘unity and sovereignty’ of the nation. “People from all over the country have united against NRC and CAA,” he said.

Rao further said that the BJP government has failed to address issues of unemployment, white collar offences and inflation and has been trying to divide the nation by introducing CAA and NRC in the country.

“We have decided to organise satyagraha against CAA and NRC on January 30. CAA and NRC will lead to violence and will hurt the development of the nation,” another protester said.

GURGAON: The CRPF has carried out a mega audit of its over three lakh personnel to check for any possible “subversive” elements in the wake of a Jammu & Kashmir Police officer being caught with terrorists recently, the chief of the paramilitary force said here on Tuesday.

CRPF Director General (DG) A P Maheshwari said the incident involving Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh was “grave” and an “area of extreme concern” for the security forces, adding that all should see that these things don’t occur.

So it was “common sense” to carry out such an audit of its manpower, deployed as the lead force for counter-terrorist and anti-Naxal operations across the country, when any incident like this take place, he said.

A senior official said the counter-intelligence units of the force were recently asked to check the credentials of the personnel after obtaining data from all available sources and they have been asked to be kept on “active mode” for some more time.

“No security grid should be allowed to be weakened by such episodes. So, all forces have to keep an internal watch,” he said on the arrest of DSP Singh.

J&K Police had arrested Singh in J&K’s Kulgam district along with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists Naveed Baba and Altaf, besides a lawyer who was operating as an overground worker for terror outfits, on January 11.

Maheshwari said that somebody from a security force trying to collaborate with adversaries is a “serious matter”. However, he added that a lone incident cannot be used to “brand” the entire force which has done onerous work in the past.

CRPF has deployed close to 70,000 personnel in Kashmir Valley for counter-terrorist and law and order duties.

From the moment ‘Superstar’ entered the Karnataka forest, meme creators have gone wild. By Tuesday, social media was celebrating stills from Rajinikanth’s old films in which he was seen with wild animals. The tagline read: ‘Leaked scenes from Rajini Vs Wild’.

Stills from ‘Annai Or Aalayam’, in which Rajinikanth plays a hunter, ‘Siva’, in which he confronts a leopard, and ‘ Padayappa ’, in which he kisses a cobra, after picking it up from its hideout were the hot favourites on social media.

Rajinikanth’s characters were not always that brave when it came to animals. A scene in ‘Thambikku Endha Ooru’ (1984) was a laugh riot as it shows a cobra entering Rajinikanth’s room.

Rajinikanth, who was busy shooting in Hyderabad for his 168th film, allocated two days for “Man Vs Wild” episode.

Manisha Mhaske worked as an assistant driver on a goods train after joining in 2002

MUMBAI: Manisha Mhaske (45) is rapidly gaining speed in her career. Starting out as an assistant driver on a goods train, she graduated to suburban locals, and now hopes to be in the driver's seat of the Rajdhani.

Mhaske will pilot the first AC train on Central Railway 's trans-harbour corridor between Thane and Panvel when services begin on January 30. Sixteen services will run on the corridor, of which three each will be in morning and evening peak hours.

Mhaske, who joined CR as an assistant driver in January 2002 has been piloting electrical multiple unit services since September 2019. ""It is a privilege and big responsibility. I will cherish this moment forever,"" said Mhaske.

Her career took off after a vocational course in electronics. Initially, she was not keen on the railway job when she was selected. ""I was told to join duty in Solapur. I was not keen, but my elder brother pushed me,"" said Mhaske, who stays with her husband in Badlapur.

Joining in 2002, she worked as an assistant driver on goods trains and later worked as a driver for a decade before being promoted as motorwoman. She is the only motorwoman to pilot a suburban train, even though there are two female seniors on the rota.

CR's chief public relations officer Shivaji Sutar said, ""She is an excellent driver with a superb track record. Mhaske has never been involved in incidents like jumping a red signal or overshooting a platform.""

Mhaske, who grew up in Ulhasnagar, said, ""My ultimate aim is to pilot Rajdhani Express once I graduate to be a mail/express driver.""

On why a woman was chosen to pilot the train, Sutar said, ""CR has always taken decisions to empower women. We got an all-woman TTE train. Matunga station, India's first woman-only station, is another shining example. Mhaske's piloting the train will inspire many other women to take up the profession.""

NEW DELHI: A cybersecurity researcher has claimed that “3,202 government email IDs have been leaked on the deep web and their passwords available in plain text” across multiple databases. Several key government institutions and ministries, including Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc), Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), Securities and Exchanges Board of India (Sebi), figured in the list of organisations whose officials have had their email IDs compromised, according to the researcher.Sai Krishna Kothapalli, an IIT-Guwahati alumnus and founder of cybersecurity startup Hackrew, said, “I did an analysis on a huge database of password dumps that are publicly available and these are the number of Indian gov email IDs and plain text passwords that are out there right now. (The leaked data) is part of databases containing over 1.8 billion leaked emails-passwords. For the last 4 years, I have been collecting such data that I could find in the deep and dark web. There was no way to clean such a huge data dump. I found a total of 3,202 email IDs that are in the format*@*.gov.in. However, I will refrain from mentioning where exactly I got this data as it is sensitive.”According to the expert’s chart, Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) is on the top with 365 emails and passwords leaked and Barc trailing with 325. “What blows my mind is the fact that the top two organisations whose employees emails IDs and passwords were hacked belong to atomic research. The number of employees’ credentials that are leaked from IGCAR and BARC is twice the number credentials belonging to Sebi (No. 3 on the list). I tried to make some correlation as to why the atomic research organisations’ credentials were leaked more. Some of these accounts were not part of any breaches according to ‘Have I Been Pwned’ service. This leaves only one conclusion that they must have been victims of a targeted phishing campaign,” according to Kothapalli’s online report.Reacting to the hacking claims, Isro director (PR) Vivek Singh told TOI, “We have informed all our Isro centres to check their systems for any threat and submit a detailed report at the earliest.” He said, Our actual operational PCs are not on internet, but intranet. Only administrative systems are on internet and they are vulnerable. Therefore, we have sought a report.” He said that last year too a security check was done at these centres after a hacking report appeared and all systems were found safe. On being approached, Department of Atomic Energy secretary K N Vyas told TOI, “DAE is nothing to comment on it, right now.” Top nuclear scientist Anil Kakodkar , whose emails and systems were claimed to have been hacked last year, told TOI, “I got my systems checked by experts and they found them safe with no manipulation.”On October 30 last year, TOI had reported that a malware was detected in a personal computer of Tamil Nadu's Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. Later, it was reported that a Seoul-based non-profit intelligence organisation claimed that “all top authorities in India’s nuclear energy sector were targeted by North Korean hackers”.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73716403,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-354139,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/cyber-expert-claims-3000-government-email-details-leaked-on-deep-web/articleshow/73716394.cms

The HC had in August 2018, in interim orders, restrained the BMC from handing over possession of the premises, which was a welfare centre, to the IAS Academy. The premises are in a building at Union Park on the ground and first floor in Bandra West.

The Bandra residents, represented by senior counsel Prasad Dhakephalkar, sought quashing of allotment and said the BMC ought to follow all the rules and issue advertisements first and follow due procedure.

On January 24, 2020, a day after a bench of Justices S J Kathawalla and B P Colabawalla expressed views critical of the allotment, Karl Tamboly, the counsel for Vijay Kadam, trustee of the academy, submitted that its March 2018 application to the BMC be “treated as withdrawn and allotment of the welfare centre to the academy be treated as cancelled.”

Anil Sakhare, special civic counsel, said the BMC has prepared a draft policy in September 2019 for such allotments and it shall soon be placed before the general body for approval.

The HC bench hence directed that the “letter of Intent issued by the Corporation dated 23rd April, 2018 to Shiv Vidya Prabodhini Balasaheb Thackeray IAS Academy allotting the premises of 4600 sq ft for being used as Welfare Centre stands cancelled.” The HC directed that the “corporation shall allot” the premises as a welfare centre after inviting applications from interested organisations and directed that the academy “is at liberty to respond to advertisement issued by BMC.”

The residents body had, in a bid to garner support in its fight against the civic “wrong,” had approached other resident bodies in Bandra and Khar in its fight against the BMC giving out the welfare centre in the locality to a coaching institute, Shiv Vidya Prabodhini Balasaheb Thackeray IAS Academy, without following the tendering process.

The secretary of the Pali Hill citizens’ body, Madhu Poplai, had met members of the H West Federation, Khar Residents Association, Gadzarband Residents Association, Welfare of Stray Animals, St Martin’s Road Association and Daulat Nagar Residents Association to seek their support to write toCM Uddhav Thackeray.

West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh

KOLKATA: West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh sparked fresh controversy on Tuesday by ask-ing why anti-CAA protesters at Park Circus and Shaheen Bag were surviv-ing the cold and not dying.

Ghosh said at Kolkata Press Club: “There should have been deaths there. Surprisingly, people died in the queue during demonetisation.”

He also took a dig at anti-CAA activists like Kanhaiya Kumar and Aishe Ghosh. “Kanhaiya could not even win an election from his home turf Bihar. People don’t want to listen to their own leaders like Biman Bose . It is unfortunate that Congress leaders li-ke Somen Mitra are attending such meetings,” Ghosh said.

In Bankura, BJP MP Saumitra Khan said: “If TMC workers dare repeat what they did during panchayat polls, we will skin each one. We know how to stop the police. If they work for TMC, police jeeps will be set on fire.”

Scene of protest at Nazrul Mancha

VC: Situation was not conducive for ceremony

KOLKATA: Anti-CAA protesters followed governor Jagdeep Dhankhar to the Calcutta University convocation at Nazrul Mancha on Tuesday, holding up the ceremony for 45 minutes and forcing him to return without setting foot on the dais.Dhankhar left the venue after a futile hour-long wait, inside the Nazrul Mancha green room , for the protests to subside. Tuesday’s agitation came more than a month after a similar protest during the Jadavpur University convocation, where university staffers forced him to return and graduating students protested against his “pro-CAA stand”.Tuesday’s protesters, who forced Dhankhar to return, said they were students of various CU-affiliated colleges from all over the city. The governor later vented his ire in a tweet: “(The) convocation was at Nazrul Mancha and not on the campus. There was total failure of the state machinery to maintain law and order. The obstruction was stage-managed.”Dhankhar, before leaving the convocation venue on Tuesday, signed the honoris causa scroll for 2019 Economics Nobel Laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee. Banerjee delivered his address after order was restored, where he ignored the chaos that happened before but touched upon the work that had brought him the honour and his past as an undergraduate student of Presidency College (then a CU affiliate): “It is, in many ways, homecoming for me. It is a little bit hard for me to entirely comprehend it.”Another of Tuesday’s honorees, Johns Hopkins University Anthropology professor Veena Das (who received the Sudhindra Chandra Chakraborty Memorial Medal), felt students had the right to protest as there a nationwide stir against the atrocities they were subject to.Some of the doctoral degree recipients and guests, however, felt that the protesters could have spared the convocation. “We have waited for this occasion for years. Why should a section of outsiders, claiming to be students, force the chancellor to leave?” one of them, Debashish Chakraborty, asked.The protesters were in no mood to listen. Cops and the governor’s security somehow managed to make way for his car to reach Nazrul Mancha, where he got off and made his way to the VIP room off-stage, ignoring the black flags and posters pasted with anti-CAA slogans. The protesters then shifted to inside the auditorium, where they went on with their slogans against the new citizenship law.Trinamool Chhatra Parishad member of the CU unit claimed most of the protesters were from affiliated colleges. “We did not have any protest plans at all,” CU MBA student and TMCP member Rony Ghosh said.Vice-chancellor Sonali Chakraborty-Banerjee finally took the stage a little after 1 p.m. and requested the demonstrators to clear the aisle to make way for the convocation procession. But, with no one listening to her, she was finally forced to say that the chancellor would neither accompany the convocation procession nor hand over the D.Litt to the Nobel laureate.But the impasse continued as she could not promise that Dhankar would not preside over the convocation. Chakraborty-Banerjee then returned to the green room to tell Dhankhar about the situation.The VC returned to face the protesters after a few minutes but, by then, the governor had had enough and left the venue. The protesters, too, left soon after they were told that the governor had left. The ceremony finally began around 1.45 p.m..Chakraborty-Banerjee later said she was forced to tell Dhankhar that a section of students would not let the convocation take place as long as he was there. “I told him that it would not be possible for me to conduct the ceremony in such a situation,” she said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73718491,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-536811,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/guv-forced-to-leave-cu-convocation-programme-by-anti-caa-protesters/articleshow/73712888.cms
474,['29/01/2020'],IAF retraces path of 1977 crash that Morarji survived,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Kolkata: Nearly 43 years after then Prime Minister Morarji Desai’s narrow escape in an air crash at Jorhat, Assam, the Indian Air Force has launched an event to honour the five-member air crew killed in the accident.

While all in the PM’s entourage escaped without major injury, the cockpit of the IAF’s Tupolev-124 was totally crushed, killing the occupants. An inquiry revealed that members of the Air Headquarters Communication Squadron, in charge of the aircraft, did their best to ensure the safety of passengers at the cost of their lives.

“On Monday, a bicycle expedition started from the crash site at Jorhat to Palam in Delhi. The team members will reach Delhi on February 12. The contingent comprises 13 air warriors of Air HQ Communication Squadron. The team will cover a distance of 2,500 km over a period of 17 days and will symbolically retrace the path of the aircraft from the crash site back to the squadron. The expedition was flagged off from the crash site (nearly eight km from Air Force Station Jorhat) by Air Cmde M K Jha, AOC, Air Force Station Jorhat in the presence of R K Khirmey (ex-MP of Arunachal Pradesh), who was a survivor of the crash, and Group Captain Saurav Shiv, the current CO of the Squadron,” said IAF spokesperson Gr Capt Anupam Banerjee.

The Communication Squadron was formed on November 1, 1947 and has been based at Air Force Station Palam since its inception. The primary role of the Squadron is to convey VVIPs/VIPs of India and visiting foreign heads of states and governments. On November 4, 1977 a Tu-124 of this squadron took off for Jorhat from Palam carrying Desai, P K Thungon (then CM of Arunachal Pradesh), John Lobo (then IB chief) and Kanti Lal Desai (the PM’s son). Those killed in the accident were Wg Cdr Clarence J D’Lima, Wg Cdr Joginder Singh, Sqn Ldr VVSNM Sunkara, Sqn Ldr Mathew Cyriac and Flt Lt OP Arora.

The cycling team is being led by Wing Commander Irfan Wahid Khan Jarial. Commissioned in 2003, Jarial is a helicopter pilot with over 4,500 hrs of flying and is posted in the squadron.

475,['29/01/2020'],Mamata: Talks with Centre only after CAA is repealed,"This story is from January 29, 2020

Kolkata: A day after the Be-ngal assembly passed a resolution to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and withdraw NRC and NPR, chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Tuesday she was ready to hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, provided CAA is repealed.

The CM’s statement came shortly after Modi’s speech at an NCC meet in New Delhi.

“It is good that he now wants a dialogue. But he should first tell political parties and the common people that he will repeal CAA,” Banerjee said at the Gandhi statue, where the CM along with other artists took up the brush to express dissent against CAA, NPR and NRC.

“CAA was implemented without consulting the opposition. Even on Kashmir (abrogation of Article 370), the opposition was not consulted. First you implement, then you invite for talks. This cannot happen in a democracy. Talks are the only way in a democratic process, so the PM should first repeal CAA and win the confidence of the country. The PM should assure the people of the country that CAA will be repealed and only then there can be talks,” Banerjee said.

“In the name of NPR, wh-at is BJP doing? The issue is burning and the country will be divided. This NPR, NRC and CAA are interrelated and one cannot see these as isolated incidents,” she added. The CM reached the Ga-ndhi statue on Mayo Road around 12.30pm and stayed there for more than an hour. Painters Jogen Chowdhury and Subhaprasanna were also present.

Banerjee also criticised the PM on his approach tow-ards minorities of Pakistan. “BJP is glorifying Pakistan. Why should I talk about Pakistan? Let us talk about India first. Pakistan is not my country, so why glorify Pakistan? Sometimes I feel they have become the brand ambassador of Pakistan? I am a proud citizen of this country and am only concerned about my nation,” she said.

To a question that the issue was now in the Supreme Court, the CM said: “We are only raising the issue of the common people. India still is a democratic country, which ensures freedom of expression to its citizens. It is the voice of the people.”

NEW DELHI: Oxford University Press (OUP) on Tuesday named ‘ Samvidhaan ’ (Constitution) the Oxford Hindi Word of 2019, saying it received widespread attention in the year which was witness to the spirit of the Indian Constitution being embraced across segments of society.

The Oxford Hindi Word of the Year is a word or expression that has attracted a great deal of attention and reflects the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the past year.

OUP said ‘Samvidhaan’ means a “body of fundamental principles or established precedents according to which a state or other organisation is acknowledged to be governed”.

GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Tuesday said it won’t set up any of the proposed 200 foreigners’ tribunals that are supposed to hear appeals filed by those excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) until the SC decides on the validity of the citizenship rolls.

“These 200 tribunals are meant to exclusively hear appeals filed by the 19 lakh people left out (of the NRC). If the tribunals are set up now, we will have to pay salaries. Unless the SC approves the published NRC, who will go to the tribunals to appeal?” minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

The government has identified 79 locations to set up the 200 tribunals that will potentially handle 19,06,657 appeals against the final NRC that was published last August.

AGRA: Demanding resignation of vice-chancellor Tariq Mansoor and registrar Abdul Hamid, over 10,000 students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have decided to boycott examination from Wednesday, putting the varsity administration in a tight spot.

Students of almost all the streams, including commerce, management, science, art, social science, life science and law are part of the protest, the administration confirmed. The protesting bloc includes 3,095 students from AMU’s Women’s College. The protesting bloc has announced a “lockdown” from Wednesday.

One of the women students, Sadaf Shakeel , who is leading the protest at Women’s College, told TOI, “Students feel insecure on campus after the incidents which took place on December 15 and January 26.” Students were allegedly beaten up on December 15 by security forces, who entered the campus after getting permission from the registrar and the VC. Four students were also detained on January 26 for shouting slogans against the VC.

University spokesperson Shafey Kidwai said that the administration is trying to persuade the agitators against the boycott.
