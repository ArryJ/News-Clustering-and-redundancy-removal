0,2020/03/17,Japan Olympic panel official has coronavirus,"“Today, my test result showed positive for the new coronavirus,” Tashima said in a statement

Japan Olympic Committee deputy chief Kozo Tashima said on Tuesday he had contracted coronavirus.

“Today, my test result showed positive for the new coronavirus,” Tashima said in a statement, issued via the Japan Football Association, which he also heads.

“I have a mild fever. Examinations showed a symptom of pneumonia, but I’m fine. I will concentrate on treatment following doctors’ advice,” he said.

Tashima said he had been on a business trip since February 28, first heading to Belfast to attend the annual general meeting of the International Football Association Board (IFAB).

From March 2, he visited Amsterdam for a Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) meeting to give a presentation on Japan’s bid for the 2023 women’s World Cup.

And On March 3, he attended a general meeting of the same body.

“In Amsterdam and in Europe in early March, the level of nervousness against the novel coronavirus was not the same as now,” he said in the statement.

“Everyone was still doing hugs, handshakes and bises (cheek kissing).”

He then travelled to the United States to watch the Japanese women’s team in action and to lobby for the women’s World Cup, before returning home on March 8.

“In the United States, too, the sense of crisis about the novel coronavirus was not as serious as now,” he said.

Staff at the Japan FA have been working from home as a precaution against the virus, but Tashima said he went to the association building several times last week and attended meetings. He began feeling chills and experienced a mild fever from Sunday. He went to a local public health centre on Monday and told them about his travel history.

During the UEFA gatherings, Tashima said he saw Swiss and Serbian football chiefs, who have tested positive for the virus, although he added it was not clear how he contracted the infection.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rc4qyn/article31093032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18TASHIMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/japan-olympic-panel-official-has-coronavirus/article31093033.ece
1,2020/03/17,"No need for ‘drastic decisions, says IOC","IOC committed to the Tokyo Games in four months

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) does not plan any “drastic” decisions about the Tokyo 2020 Games, saying on Tuesday it remains fully committed to the event being staged in four months’ time despite the global spread of the coronavirus.

Following discussions with international sports federations, the IOC said changes would need to be made to the qualifiers due to the impact of the virus, but it still plans to go ahead with the July 24-Aug 9 Olympics.

“The IOC remains fully committed to the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, and with more than four months to go before the Games there is no need for any drastic decisions at this stage. Any speculation at this moment would be counter-productive,” it said in a statement.

“The IOC encourages all athletes to continue to prepare for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 as best they can,”

Earlier on Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Group of Seven leaders had agreed to support a “complete” Olympics, but he dodged questions about whether any of the leaders had brought up the possibility of postponement.

Sports competitions have come to a halt in many parts of the world, wreaking havoc with Olympic qualifier events across 33 sports. The IOC on Monday scrapped any remaining boxing qualifiers due to the virus.

“The health and well-being of all those involved in the preparations for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 is our number-one concern,” IOC president Thomas Bach said.

“All measures are being taken to safeguard the safety and interests of athletes, coaches and support teams. We are an Olympic community; we support one another in good times and in difficult times.”

The IOC will hold further talks with National Olympic Committees and athletes’ representatives in the coming days.

So far 57% of the 11,000 athletes have already secured their spots, while for the remaining 43% of places the IOC is working with federations to adapt the qualifying procedures for Tokyo. Qualification could also be based on ranking or historical results as well.

“The IOC has confidence that the many measures being taken by many authorities around the world will help contain the situation of the COVID-19 virus,” the IOC said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ewg32e/article31092926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18CHESS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/no-need-for-drastic-decisions-says-ioc/article31092927.ece

3,2020/03/17,The Games that became the ‘Missing Olympics’,"Tokyo’s 1940 bid was spearheaded by Jigoro Kano, the founder of modern judo and first Japanese member of the IOC

Fears are growing that this year’s Olympics may be postponed or axed because of the coronavirus pandemic but Japan has been here before — the cancelled summer Games of 1940 were also due to be hosted in Tokyo.

Also read: IOC set for crisis talks as fears grow for Tokyo Olympics

Japan’s military aggression in Asia forced the annulment of what became known as the “Missing Olympics” after the Games were switched to Helsinki before finally being scrapped because of World War II.

Tokyo officials originally touted a bid for the 1940 Games as a way to show the city had recovered from the devastating 1923 earthquake, according to author David Goldblatt in his history of the Olympics entitled “The Games”.

‘Recovery Games’

In much the same way, Japan has framed the 2020 Olympics as the “Recovery Games” — a chance to show the country is back on its feet after the catastrophic 2011 triple disaster of earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown.

Tokyo’s 1940 bid was spearheaded by Jigoro Kano, the founder of modern judo and first Japanese member of the International Olympic Committee, who stressed the importance of bringing the Games to Asia for the first time.

“I carry a grave resolve. The Olympics should naturally come to Japan. If they don’t, the reason for this must be something unjust,” said Kano in his plea to the IOC.

The Japanese had a special reason for wanting to celebrate 1940, as it coincided with the 2,600th year since the enthronement of the nation’s legendary first emperor, Jimmu. Tokyo launched an official bid in 1932 and found themselves up against Rome and Helsinki.

Japan engaged in a fierce lobbying campaign that included pleading with Italy’s fascist dictator Benito Mussolini to step aside in their favour.

“In the you-scratch-my-back kind of deal that has become the norm in international sports politics, Mussolini announced with unusual candour, ‘We will waive our claim for 1940 in favour of Japan if Japan will support Italy’s effort to get the XIIIth Olympiad for Rome in 1944,” wrote Goldblatt.

With just Tokyo and Helsinki left standing, the IOC plumped for the Japanese capital by 37 votes to 26.

‘Cultural diplomacy’

Before the bid had been tabled, Japan in 1931 invaded the Chinese province of Manchuria and two years later withdrew from the League of Nations — the precursor to the United Nations — after the body refused to sanction the occupation.

The Olympic bid was therefore also an attempt to shore up international diplomacy, according to Asato Ikeda, assistant professor at Fordham University, New York, who has written about the 1940 Games.

Also read: Olympics could be postponed to end of year: Japan minister

Japan’s bid was “part of its international cultural diplomacy in order to ameliorate the relationship with the Western democratic nations, especially Britain and the United States,” Ikeda wrote in an essay in the Asia-Pacific Journal.

As preparations for the Games gathered pace, a schedule was drawn up and posters were printed. The Opening Ceremony was set for September 21, 1940.

There were some hiccups though, including questions about whether the Emperor could declare the Games open, as the Japanese then held him to be semi-divine and therefore unable to be seen and heard by ordinary citizens.

‘No other course’

As diplomatic pressure grew on Japan from outside, there was increasing clamour inside the country for cash to be diverted for military purposes.

Japanese diplomats at the time voiced concern in cables back to Tokyo that powers such as Britain and the United States could boycott the Games over Japan’s war-like activity. Yet, in words familiar to those following the story of the 2020 Games, Tokyo insisted the show would go on.

Also read: COVID-19 | Cancellation or postponement of Olympics over virus ‘not mentioned’ at IOC meet, says Bach

Barker cites a cable from Tokyo City Hall to the IOC which said: “The citizens of Tokyo are doing their utmost to make the 1940 Games a success.” But the Japanese Olympic Committee eventually bowed to the inevitable and forfeited in July 1938, saying what they euphemistically called “the trouble with China” had made staging the Games impossible.

“The organising committee and the people of Japan were deeply disappointed in having to give up the Games, but, in the circumstances, no other course was open,” the “Olympic News” bulletin published in Tokyo wrote at the time.

“With the worsening international relations and increasing military activities in the Asian continent, the cancellation might not have been that surprising,” Ikeda said.

The Winter Games, due to be held in the northern Japanese city of Sapporo, were also scrapped and the war put paid to the proposed rescheduling in the Finnish capital.

The next time the Olympic torch was lit was for London in 1948, four years after the city had originally been due to host. But Japan, as a defeated power, was excluded and Helsinki staged the next summer Games in 1952.

4,2020/03/17,Better sleep is better health: Here are the top devices to help you sleep better,"Scientists use medical-grade sensors and equipment to track body movements, brain activity, heart rate and more to monitor sleep. This process is called polysomnography. Most smartphone apps that track sleep mimic this process, but they do not monitor brain activity.

Research shows that one-third of a person’s life is spent sleeping. Much like eating and drinking, sleeping is a basic human need that is important for overall health and well-being.

However, 49% of adults surveyed admit they weren’t satisfied with their sleep, according to Wake Up Call: Global Sleep Satisfaction Trends report. People sleep less than the recommended level of quality sleep per night, the report said. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends seven or more hours of sleep per night for adults aged between 18-64.

Insufficient or poor sleep can worsen memory and make one less productive at work.

To highlight the importance of healthy sleep, the World Sleep Society hosted the 13th World Sleep Day on March 13, 2020. The goal of the society is to advance knowledge about sleep, circadian rhythms, sleep health, and sleep disorders worldwide.

A regular breathing pattern is a key determinant of a good night’s sleep. Persistent disruption of the breathing function leads to sleep apnea, which causes daytime sleepiness and fatigue.

Scientists use medical-grade sensors and equipment to track body movements, brain activity, heart rate and more to monitor sleep. This process is called polysomnography.

Most smartphone apps that track sleep mimic this process, but they do not monitor brain activity.

A common feature in fitness trackers and wearables is the accelerometer, which tracks sleep by interpreting movement as wakefulness and stillness as sleep. It is most effective when paired with a heart-rate monitor as the accelerometer alone can inaccurately interpret a person simply lying down to be asleep.

Some smartphone apps analyse the sound of different movements during various sleep cycles. The apps define fewer movements as deep sleep, and more movement as disturbed or light sleep.

Another way apps track sleep is through optical heart-rate monitoring. Tiny LEDs on fitness bands and wearables shine light on the user’s skin to read blood flow. As the flow changes, the LEDs reflect the it back to the device. This information is coupled with the user’s movement data to build a sleep report. Most wearable use this method to track sleep.

Here are some of the wearables that monitor sleep:

Oura Ring

Packed with infrared LEDs, NFC temperature sensors, a gyroscope and an accelerometer, the Oura ring tracks your body’s pulse, movement and temperature. The device showcases a holistic view of the user’s health.

Oura interprets a flurry of body signals through the night and gives a report on its app. The report captures data on deep sleep, REM sleep, sleep score, latency and sleep stages.

Motiv Ring

The Motiv Ring tracks the complete sleep cycle and gives a detailed report on the quality of sleep. The device also has a three-day battery charge, allowing users to store the health data even when they don’t use their smartphones. The ring syncs with the app when the smartphone is brought near it. Motiv Ring currently ships only to the U.S.

Beddit

Beddit sleep monitor tracks your sleep and work with the Beddit app on the iPhone. It’s a simple sensor strip that can be placed on your bed -- under the sheet or on the mattress. The strip is extremely thin and soft.

It tracks sleep time, heart rate, breathing, room temperature and humidity. If you give the device access to your iPhone’s microphone, it can even track snoring.

The Health app on the iPhone or iPad receives the data from the device. Also, this device is compatible only with iOS.

Fitbit

The Fitbit band tracks light sleep, deep sleep and REM stages using heart rate monitor and motion sensors. It measures time spent in each sleep stage and when the user is awake. It also helps in creating a sleep schedule based on the user’s routine.

Its database of sleep stats helps the user compare their sleep quality to those of the same age and gender.

Urgonight

By far the only wearable that comes closest to the medical-grade sleep analysis in our list of wearables, the Urgonight is a padded headband. It connects to an app that measures EEG. It also uses games to teach the user how to control their brain waves that impact sleep. The device uses neurofeedback therapy to show the user in real-time their brain activity. This feedback is to be used to change behaviour and routine to get a good and healthy sleep.

5,2020/03/17,French anti-trust watchdog slaps $1.2 billion fine on Apple,"The French Competition Authority penalised Apple for being guilty of anti-competitive practices within its distribution network and abuse of economic dependence on its independent resellers “Premium”

France’s anti-trust watchdog on Monday slapped Apple with a $1.2 billion fine, saying the tech giant conspired with distributors like Tech Data and Ingram Micro to fix prices of its premium gadgets and limit competition.

The French Competition Authority penalised Apple for being guilty of anti-competitive practices within its distribution network and abuse of economic dependence on its independent resellers “Premium.”

The two wholesalers, Tech Data and Ingram Micro, were also penalised, respectively for 76.1 million euros and 62.9 million euros for one of the cartel practices, the watchdog said in a statement.

Isabelle de Silva, President of the French Competition Authority, declared: “During this case, the Authority deciphered the very specific practices that had been implemented by Apple for the distribution of its products in France (excluding iPhones), such as the iPad.”

First, Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilising the wholesale market for Apple products.

“Secondly, so-called Premium distributors could not risk promoting or lowering prices without risk, which led to an alignment of retail prices between Apple’s integrated distributors and independent Premium distributors,” she commented.

Finally, she added, Apple abused the economic dependence of these Premium distributors on it, by subjecting them to unfair and unfavourable commercial conditions compared to its network of integrated distributors.

In a statement to CNBC, an Apple spokesperson said: “The French Competition Authority’s decision is disheartening. We strongly disagree with them and plan to appeal.”

The $1.2 billion is a record fine for France’s competition authority.

6,2020/03/17,Microsoft Bing team launches COVID 19 tracker globally,"While Google is still working on a coronavirus screening and tracking website, Microsoft Bing team has already launched a web portal for tracking COVID-19 infections worldwide.

The website, accessible at bing.com/covid, provides up-to-date infection statistics for each country.

The COVID019 Tracker currently lists 168,835 as total confirmed cases, 84,558 active cases, 77,761 recovered cases and 6,516 deaths.

There are at least 3,244 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in the US and at least 61 deaths.

“Lots of Bing folks worked (from home) this past week to create a mapping and authoritative news resource for COVID19 info,” Michael Schechter, General Manager for Bing Growth and Distribution at Microsoft, was quoted as saying in a ZDNet report on Sunday.

An interactive map allows site visitors to click on the country to see the specific number of cases and related articles from a variety of publishers.

Data is being aggregated from sources like the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

Microsoft announced the website two days after US President Donald Trump said Google has begun working on COVID-19-related portal for US citizens.

Google’s website is being built by Verily, a subsidiary of Alphabet focused on healthcare services.

“More than 1,700 engineers are currently working on the site”, Trump said during a press briefing last week.

The tool will triage people who are concerned about their COVID-19 risk into testing sites based on guidance from public health officials and test availability.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has been declared the winner of last week’s Democratic presidential primary in Washington State, giving him victories in five out of six States that voted on March 10.

After nearly a week of counting votes, the former Vice-President on Monday held onto a small lead over Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders that turned out to be insurmountable.

Washington was a State that Mr. Sanders had been hoping to win.

In 2016, he won more than two-thirds of the delegates from the Washington caucuses over Hillary Clinton.

Of the State’s 89 pledged delegates, only 31 are allocated based on the Statewide result. The remaining 58 are determined based on the results of the State’s 10 congressional districts, and those results might not be calculated until the election is certified by the secretary of State’s office, which could be as late as March 27.

Mr. Biden won four other states last Tuesday — Missouri, Mississippi, Michigan and Idaho. Mr. Sanders won North Dakota.

12,2020/03/17,Little-known ex-Governor Zurfi named new Iraqi PM,"He is tasked with forming a government within 30 days

Iraq’s President designated Adnan al-Zurfi, a former regional Governor with little national political profile, as Prime Minister, tasked with forming a government within 30 days in a bid to overcome months of unrest and political deadlock.

Mr. Zurfi, who served as Governor of the predominantly Shi’ite Najaf province during the U.S. occupation after the fall of Saddam Hussein, is head of the small Nasr parliamentary group of former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, a U.S. ally.

Lawmakers told Reuters that President Barham Salih had named Mr. Zurfi only after larger rival Shi’ite political parties failed to decide on a successor to Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned in November during mass unrest, in which hundreds of people died.

Mr. Zurfi, who lived in the U.S. as a refugee in the 1990s after fleeing Saddam, is seen as a comparatively secular figure in a country long dominated by sectarian parties.

He now has to win the confidence of Parliament for his new Cabinet, a difficult task as major Iranian-backed groups objected to his nomination.

“Zurfi will face tough resistance inside Parliament and he will need a miracle to pass his government,” said a Shi’ite lawmaker, on condition of anonymity.

13,2020/03/17,Trump administration seeks $850 billion stimulus fund,"Package to contain the economic damage from COVID-19

U.S. President Donald Trump will ask Congress to approve a massive $850 billion emergency spending package to contain the growing economic damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, according to media reports on Tuesday.

The measures are expected to include a payroll tax cut and $50 billion in aid to troubled U.S. airlines hit hard by the near total shutdown in the travel industry, The Washington Post reported, citing four officials familiar with the matter.

The package, which is in addition to the $100 billion in spending directed at paid sick leave and expanded unemployment benefits already moving through Congress, surpasses the $700 billion emergency program known as TARP to save the banking system during the 2008 global financial crisis.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected to present the proposal to Senate Republicans, the Post reported.

Democratic package

Republican leaders last week dismissed the Democratic package in the house as an inflated wish list of items. And since then the damage has accelerated with businesses forced to close and whole States under lockdown.

Trump has been pushing for a cut or suspension of taxes deducted from all American paychecks at least through the November presidential election.

But Democrats and many economists say focus on payroll taxes misses workers who are laid off, unemployed or are paid hourly.

A spat between the U.S. and China over COVID-19 escalated on Tuesday as President Donald Trump angered Beijing by referring to the pathogen as the “Chinese Virus.”

The two countries have sparred over the origin of the virus for days, with a Chinese official promoting conspiracy theories claiming it was brought to China by the U.S. Army and American officials using terms seen as stigmatising a nation.

“The U.S. will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday night.

He doubled down on the comment on Tuesday while Tweeting about how U.S. States were being affected, saying: “Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all.”

Mr. Trump’s allies had previously referred to the pandemic as “Chinese coronavirus”, but Beijing said on Tuesday it was “strongly indignant” over the phrase, which it called “a kind of stigmatisation”.

The U.S. should “immediately stop its unjustified accusations against China,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

17,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | France locks down over pandemic fears,"Macron asks the French to stay at home for 15 days; EU plans to ban non-essential travel to continent

France moved into a near-total lockdown on Tuesday over fears of COVID-19 spread, the latest country to impose draconian restrictions affecting the lives of millions of people.

European leaders also plan to ban all non-essential travel into the continent on Tuesday in a bid to stem a pandemic that has killed thousands, upended society and battered economies.

With French President Emmanuel Macron describing the battle against COVID-19 as a “war”, governments around the world are scrambling to keep the public safe with measures rarely seen in peacetime, slamming borders shut and forcing citizens to stay home.

The crisis is infecting every sector of the economy, and global stocks have been on a rollercoaster ride, with Wall Street on Monday sinking more than 12% in the worst session since the crash of 1987.

Investors are still in panic mode, despite emergency interventions by central banks and governments to shore up confidence.

After the initial outbreak in a Chinese city in December, Europe has emerged as the epicentre of the virus SARS-COV-2, with more deaths now recorded outside China than inside.

COVID-19 has now killed more than 7,000 people worldwide, including over 2,100 in Italy, the worst-hit country outside China, and over 1,80,000 cases have been recorded in 145 countries.

In a sombre address to the nation, Mr. Macron ordered the French to stay at home for 15 days from midday Tuesday, following similar measures by other European countries.

Most shops, restaurants and tourist sites in the world’s most visited country are already shuttered, but in some areas desperate shoppers crowded supermarkets before the new rules took effect.

About 1,00,000 police and gendarmes will be out on the streets to enforce the measures, after Mr. Macron warned violations would be punished.

“We are at war, a public health war certainly. We are fighting not against an Army or another nation. But the enemy is there, invisible and elusive and on the move,” he said.

Meanwhile, Spain on Tuesday confirmed nearly 2,000 new cases of COVID-19, sending the total spiralling past 11,000, with 491 deaths.

With European nations already closing their borders, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she would ask the leaders of the bloc’s Schengen visa-free border zone to stop all non-essential travel into the area.

Spanish football club Valencia has confirmed that 35 per cent of players and staff members have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

In a statement, the club said the virus spread among the squad following last month’s trip to Milan, “an area confirmed as ‘high risk’ by the Italian authorities days afterwards”, for the first leg of their Champions League last—16 tie against Atalanta.

“Despite the strict measures adopted by the club after their UEFA Champions League game against Atalanta on February 19th in Milan —an area confirmed as ‘high risk’ by the Italian authorities days afterwards—, which included maintaining a distance between the squad and club employees/the general public, these latest results show that the exposure inherent to such matches has caused a positive test rate of around 35 per cent,” the statement read.

“We also wish to express our confidence in our healthcare system and the recommendations by the Ministry of Health for those cases of coronavirus infection being treated with isolation,” it added.

20,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | Uncertainty surrounds Democratic primary as Ohio scraps vote,"Not since New York City postponed its mayoral primary on the day of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has an election been pushed off in such a high-profile, far-reaching way.

The Democratic presidential primary is consumed with uncertainty after leaders in Ohio called off Tuesday’s election just hours before polls were set to open, citing the need to combat the new coronavirus. Officials in Florida, Arizona and Illinois said they would move forward with the vote.

Not since New York City postponed its mayoral primary on the day of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has an election been pushed off in such a high-profile, far-reaching way. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine initially asked a court to delay the vote and when a judge refused to do so, the state’s health director declared a health emergency that would prevent the polls from opening.

The decision was a reminder that the most elemental act of American democracy - voting - will be severely tested Tuesday as several states hold presidential primaries while also confronting the impact of a global pandemic. The contests are playing out as the virus’ impact is becoming more tangible with schools closing across the country, workers staying home and restaurants and bars shuttering.

The U.S. stock market on Monday plunged to its worst day in more than three decades.

The rapidly shifting developments amounted to a kind of chaos rarely seen in an election season. And it may not end soon as some states that have presidential contests in the coming weeks have already moved to postpone them and others were being pressed to follow.

“These are unusual restrictions,” Susan Lerner, executive director of Common Cause New York, said of recommended federal limits to try and control the spread of the virus. Her group is urging the delay of that state’s 2020 presidential primary from April 28 to June 23, when congressional and legislative primaries are already scheduled.

""Normally, we do not support postponing elections, but these are extraordinary circumstances,” Ms. Lerner said.

Campaigns spent Monday sifting through data and talking to contacts on the ground to assess the impact of the coronavirus on turnout in places that will hold elections Tuesday. Former Vice President Joe Biden is moving closer to securing the Democratic presidential nomination, but could face a setback if the older voters who tend to support him don’t show up. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, can’t afford to lose support from young voters who have been his most loyal supporters.

The tumult has left the campaign in a state of suspended animation. In-person rallies have been replaced with sometimes-awkward virtual events.

Mr. Sanders, the last Democrat standing between Mr. Biden and the nomination, isn’t planning to drop out. His campaign looked to have nowhere to go after a big loss last week in Michigan, and another blow landed Monday night when Mr. Biden was declared the winner of the primary in Washington state, giving him victories in five out of six states that voted March 10. Yet Sanders’ top advisers see no downside to staying in the race as they assess how the coming days and weeks unfold.

Mr. Sanders staged a virtual rally Monday night featuring himself, rocker Neil Young and activist actress Daryl Hannah. He also released a video criticizing Biden for suggesting as a senator that he’d be willing to cut Social Security benefits - a line of attack he employed frequently during Sunday’s debate.

""I don’t have to tell anybody that we are living in a very unprecedented and strange moment in the history of our country,” Sanders said, urging supporters that it may be time to “rethink our value system, rethink many of the systems we operate under.”

Sanders’ team had expected Mr. Biden to do well in all four states set to vote on Tuesday. But the Vermont senator has also cast some doubt about the entire process, saying no one should risk being infected while voting and noting that it’s important “to make sure that everybody who wants to vote has the right to vote, and that may not be the case now.”

Still, Mr. Sanders faces an increasingly tough path to the nomination. About half of the delegates in the Democratic primary have already been awarded and, if Biden has another big night Tuesday, he will pad an already large and perhaps insurmountable lead. Mr. Sanders trails Mr. Biden by more than 150 delegates nationally, meaning he’d need to win more than 57% of those yet to be allocated to clinch the Democratic nomination.

Biden’s campaign is trying not to look presumptuous about its prospects at this sensitive moment. Still, the former vice president is making moves to rally more voters to his campaign, including his announcement during the debate that he would choose a woman as a running mate.

Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, one of Biden’s campaign co-chairs, said the former vice president has “started the process of looking at people seriously.”

Mr. Biden appeared to keep his focus Monday on winning the nomination, as he encouraged voters in a telephone town hall to participate in Tuesday primaries but to do so safely.

Joining him was former Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served during President Barack Obama’s second term. Dr. Murthy encouraged voters at high risk of contracting coronavirus to vote by mail or use curbside voting, if available, but he also explained precautions elections officials are planning in the Tuesday primary states.

The call came three days after Biden’s initial effort at remote campaigning was marred by technical difficulties, a testament to the challenge of balancing what amounts to a national shut-in with the demands of a presidential campaign. “I appreciate everyone bearing with us as we figure out all the logistics of campaigning in a new way here,” Biden said Monday night.

The coming weeks will present additional uncertainties. After Tuesday, the campaign had been set to shift to Georgia next week, but officials there have already postponed their Democratic primary until May 19. That means voting isn’t scheduled again anywhere until March 29 in Puerto Rico - and island officials are also seeking a delay.

The first week in April, meanwhile, would have featured Louisiana, but its decision to delay the primary until May leaves only primaries in far-flung Alaska and Hawaii and caucuses in Wyoming through April 4. That could leave the campaign in further limbo, perhaps prolonging a primary race that might otherwise have been wrapped up.

Voting rights groups have advocated for upcoming elections to be postponed, or for states holding them as scheduled to adopt more lenient vote-by-mail and absentee ballot rules so that people don’t have to choose between showing up at a polling place and putting their health at risk.

But Mustafa Tameez, a Democratic strategist with ties to many of the party’s top donors, noted that Americans voted during World War I and World War II.

""There should be no circumstance in which we say, because of a crisis - regardless of the crisis - that we stop our electoral government,” Tameez said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jwd2zy/article31052206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020JOEBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uncertainty-surrounds-democratic-primary-as-ohio-scraps-vote/article31088927.ece
21,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | U.S. begins clinical trial of investigational vaccine for coronavirus,"The trial began at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle as the first participant received the investigational vaccine.

Supported by a global coalition founded by India and Norway, the US has begun the phase one clinical trial of an investigational vaccine designed to protect against the coronavirus disease which has claimed the lives of over 7,000 people globally.

The trial began at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle as the first participant received the investigational vaccine.

“I’m pleased to report today that a vaccine candidate has begun the phase one clinical trial. This is one of the fastest vaccine development launches in history. Not even close. We’re also racing to develop antiviral therapies and other treatments,” Trump told reporters at a White House news conference on Monday.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is funding the trial. The open-label trial will enrol 45 healthy adult volunteers aged 18 to 55 years over approximately six weeks.

“Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,” said NIAID Director Anthony S Fauci.

“This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step towards achieving that goal,” he said.

According to the NIH, the study is evaluating different doses of the experimental vaccine for safety and its ability to induce an immune response in participants. This is the first of multiple steps in the clinical trial process for evaluating the potential benefit of the vaccine.

The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by the NIAID scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the Phase 1 clinical trial, the NIH said.

Conceived in 2015, CEPI was founded in Davos in 2017 by the governments of Norway and India, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum.

According to its website, CEPI so far has secured USD 760 million toward its USD 1 billion funding target, with multi-year funding from Norway, the UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, Ethiopia, Australia, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Wellcome.

Among its 12 voting members are Cherry Gagandeep Kang from Christian Medical College Vellore and Rajeev Venkayya Vaccine Business Unit, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Indian Soumya Swaminathan is a non-voting member and represents the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Board.

Early this week, CEPI, the organisation set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases, made an urgent call for USD 2 billion to support the development of a vaccine against the virus responsible for COVID-19.

In a statement, the NIH said that infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, can cause a mild to severe respiratory illness and include symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath.

The number of deaths due to coronavirus has passed 7,000 worldwide. More than 175,530 cases have been recorded in 145 countries.

COVID-19 cases were first identified in December 2019 in China’s Wuhan in Hubei province. As of March 15, the WHO has reported 153,517 cases of COVID-19 and 5,735 deaths worldwide. More than 2,800 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths have been reported in the United States as of March 15, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

“Currently, no approved vaccines exist to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2,” the NIH said, adding that investigational vaccine was developed using a genetic platform called mRNA (messenger RNA).

The investigational vaccine directs the body’s cells to express a virus protein that, it is hoped, will elicit a robust immune response. The mRNA-1273 vaccine has shown promise in animal models, and this is the first trial to examine it in humans, it said.

Scientists at NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center (VRC) and Moderna were able to quickly develop mRNA-1273 because of prior studies of related coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The Phase 1 trial is led by Lisa A Jackson, MD, senior investigator at KPWHRI. Study participants will receive two doses of the vaccine via intramuscular injection in the upper arm approximately 28 days apart. Each participant will be assigned to receive a 25 microgram (mcg), 100 mcg or 250 mcg dose at both vaccinations, with 15 people in each dose cohort, according to a statement.

The first four participants will receive one injection with the low dose, and the next four participants will receive the 100 mcg dose. Investigators will review safety data before vaccinating the remaining participants in the 25 and 100 mcg dose groups and before participants receive their second vaccinations. Another safety review will be done before participants are enrolled in the 250 mcg cohort.

“This work is critical to national efforts to respond to the threat of this emerging virus. We are prepared to conduct this important trial because of our experience as an NIH clinical trials center since 2007,” Dr Jackson said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/efzucn/article31088487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKVACCINEVOLUNTEERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-us-begins-clinical-trial-of-investigational-vaccine-for-coronavirus/article31088464.ece

23,2020/03/17,Philippines first country to suspend all financial markets as coronavirus spreads,"Global markets are in meltdown as the pandemic spreads, with roughly $14 trillion in shareholder value erased and even safe assets such as gold have been sold to cover losses.

The Philippine Stock Exchange closed indefinitely on Tuesday while currency and bond trading were suspended, the first market shutdowns worldwide in response to the coronavirus, with authorities citing risks to the safety of traders.

The shutdown comes after some bourses around the world closed trading floors or paused trade after withering falls in market value, but it is the first blanket market halt.

And while it was done for health reasons, amid a broad lockdown in the Philippines, it raises the prospect other exchanges may follow and has drawn analysts' attention.

“Given the unprecedented speed of the slump in equity prices, it has been suggested that stock exchanges might be closed soon if things don't turn around,” research house Capital Economics said in a note on Tuesday.

AdMacro research head Patrick Perret-Green had also raised the possibility in a note issued over the weekend, before the Philippines move.

“We have seen it before. I believe we could see it again,” he said. “Governments do not need or want the added stress and distraction at this time.”

The Philippine Stock Exchange said trade was suspended until further notice “to ensure the safety of employees and traders,” amid a broader national lockdown.

National Treasurer Rosalia de Leon cited the lockdown as the reason for the suspension of fixed income trade. Currency trading is to resume on March 18.

In Malaysia, where a similar lockdown comes into force on March 18, the securities regulator said all capital markets will operate as usual.

CME Group Inc last week shut its storied trading floor in Chicago, to reduce large gatherings, and Mideast bourses have taken similar measures, though electronic trade remains available.

Kuwait's exchange has suspended trade at least twice this month, after daily falls of more than 10%, while in Indonesia, Jakarta's bourse has introduced new circuit breakers which halt trading for half an hour if the main index falls 5%.

That comes amid a swathe of short-selling restrictions in markets from South Korea to Italy and Spain.

Capital Economics, however, said closures are ineffective at salving investor sentiment. The consultancy expects - as in the Philippines - health reasons to be invoked should other bourses shut.

“On the rare occasions when stock markets have been shut in the U.S. in the past, it has usually only been for practical reasons, such as after 9/11, rather than as means of trying to restore confidence...(It) might not work in any case.

“Investors might end up selling anything else they could if they needed to raise cash in a hurry.”

Global markets are in meltdown as the pandemic spreads, with roughly $14 trillion in shareholder value erased and even safe assets such as gold have been sold to cover losses.

The Philippines benchmark index fell 8% on Monday and is down 20% for March so far, already its worst since October 2008.

26,2020/03/17,"In bid to slow coronavirus, Canada shuts borders to foreign nationals","Trudeau urged people to stay home and restrict contact with others

Canada closed its borders to all foreign nationals except U.S. citizens and permanent residents on March 16, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urging people to limit social contact to stem the spread of COVID-19.

Several other countries have taken the same step. The 27-nation European Union proposed shutting its external borders for 30 days on Monday.

“We will be denying entry into Canada to people who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents ... it is a significant step that we take in exceptional circumstances,” Trudeau told reporters outside his home, where he is under quarantine after his wife, Sophie, tested positive for the respiratory virus.

As the virus' spread accelerates in Canada, Trudeau urged people to stay home and restrict contact with others. “Staying home is an important step to protect the community and each other. We all have to do it,” he said.

Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, said that the next two weeks were crucial in trying to stem the outbreak.

The death toll in Canada rose to four on Monday from one on Sunday. The number of infected jumped to 407 from the 341 reported at 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) earlier in the day, medical officials said.

Trade will not be affected by the border closing.

Asked why U.S. citizens were exempt, Trudeau said the close bilateral integration meant the United States was in a different category from other nations. But he added that more measures could be announced soon. “Both countries rely on each other to provide essential goods ... so it's very important we do this with a degree of precision and in the spirit of a strong relationship,” Health Minister Patty Hajdu later told reporters.

British Columbia said, however, it was concerned that U.S. citizens would be allowed in. “Our strong message (is) that visitors from the United States not come to British Columbia,” said provincial Health Minister Adrian Dix.

The border closure helped drive down Air Canada's stock by as much as 38%.

Canada will reroute all international flight arrivals to four airports - Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver - and has imposed tougher screening.

Weddings, Baptisms on hold?

The country's main stock market index tumbled nearly 10% and the Canadian dollar hit a four-year low.

Ontario, the most-populous province, and one that accounts for nearly half of confirmed cases, said it would delay a March 25 budget and instead deliver an economic and fiscal update.

Toronto, Canada's largest city, recommended that bars and restaurants stop in-person service and that theaters close.

Quebec on Monday recommended the suspension of all religious functions, including baptisms, weddings and funerals. For any funerals that proceed, the number of mourners should be reduced, the province said, without specifying how many. “If its possible for you to express your caring to the family, do it by internet, or by phone,” Public Health Director Horatio Arruda said.

Trudeau, who has promised to unveil a major stimulus package soon, said that “in the medium term and then into the long term, we will need to invest significant amounts to restore people's confidence in the economy.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j70wmh/article31088038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKCANADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/in-bid-to-slow-coronavirus-canada-shuts-borders-to-foreign-nationals/article31088039.ece
27,2020/03/17,"Coronavirus | Spain sees 1,000 cases in 24 hours","More countries impose lockdowns and close borders; the worst is ahead of us, says U.S. doctor.

Bars, restaurants, cinemas and schools were shutting down from New York and Los Angeles to Paris and Dubai in a worldwide effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, as financial markets tumbled despite emergency action by global central banks.

Also read: All about COVID-19

Spain registered nearly 1,000 new COVID-19 infections over 24 hours, said the Health Ministry said on Monday. Over the same period, the number of deaths rose by nine to 297, the Ministry’s emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said. The country said it would close its land borders, as its total number of cases inched closer to 10,000.

The figure for new cases was lower than weekend numbers, when 2,000 infections were detected between Saturday and Sunday and the number of deaths rose by around 100.

The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time in less than two weeks, but Wall Street opened with a dizzying plunge that set off circuit breakers.

EU finance ministers were planning a coordinated economic response to the virus, which the European Commission says could push the European Union into recession.

Leaders of the G7 countries were due to hold a video conference on Monday to discuss a joint response.

European stocks fell on Monday to their lowest level since 2012, with investors still worried about the threat to the global economy. Wall Street's S&P 500 index fell more than 9% as trading resumed after an initial automatic 15-minute cutout.

Record deaths in Italy

In Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe, there were 368 new deaths from the COVID-19 outbreak on Sunday, a daily toll more dire than even China was recording at the peak of the outbreak that first hit its central city Wuhan. “Many children think it is scary,” Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told a news conference, at her office, dedicated to answering children’s questions about the pandemic.

“It is okay to be scared when so many things happen at the same time.”

Several countries banned mass gatherings such as sports, cultural and religious events to combat the disease that has infected over 1,69,000 people globally and killed more than 6,500.

Just a month ago, financial markets were hitting record highs on the assumption that the outbreak would largely be contained in China. But there have now been more cases and more deaths outside mainland China than inside.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday he was ordering restaurants, bars and cafes to sell food only on a take-out or delivery basis. He also said he would order nightclubs, movie theatres, small theatre houses and concert venues to close.

“These places are part of the heart and soul of our city,” he said. “But our city is facing an unprecedented threat, and we must respond with a wartime mentality.”

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued similar orders. Spain and France, where cases and fatalities have begun surging at a pace just days behind that of Italy, imposed severe lockdowns over the weekend. West Asia’s business and travel hub of Dubai said it was closing all bars and lounges until the end of March. Thailand plans to close down schools, bars, movie theatres and popular cockfighting arenas. “The worst is yet ahead for us,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious diseases expert in the United States.

U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said it was important to react aggressively.

“Do we want to go the direction of South Korea and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates or do we want to go the direction of Italy?” he told Fox News.

Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told daily Corriere della Sera that the outbreak was still getting worse, though the Governor of Lombardy, the northern region that has suffered the worst, said he saw the first signs of a slowdown.

Contraction in output

Britain has asked manufacturers including Ford, Honda and Rolls Royce to help make health equipment including ventilators to cope with the outbreak and will look at using hotels as hospitals.

The worldwide financial policy actions were reminiscent of the sweeping steps taken just over a decade ago to fight a meltdown of the global financial system, but the target now is forcing entire societies to effectively shut down.

“The issue for investors that still remains is that the virus's economic impact is still not known, if this is a one-month event or if this is a one-year event, and how deep the cutback in consumer spending is going to be,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.

Airlines said they would make more drastic cuts to their flying schedules, shed jobs and seek government aid because of sweeping global travel restrictions. China said industrial output contracted at the sharpest pace in 30 years in the first two months of 2020. The International Olympic Committee will hold talks with heads of international sports organisations on Tuesday, a source close to a federation briefed on the issue said, amid doubts the Tokyo 2020 Olympics starting on July 24 can proceed.

28,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | Sri Lanka Opposition parties ask President to postpone election,"On March 3, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved Parliament and announced polls on April 25.

Many Opposition parties in Sri Lanka have called for postponing the general election scheduled for April 25, in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in the country. Their request comes a day after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa told SAARC leaders — who connected on a video call to discuss regional strategies to combat COVID 19 — that Sri Lanka’s parliamentary election will be held as scheduled.

Sri Lanka has so far 28 confirmed cases of coronavirus. The first case — a Chinese tourist who tested positive in February — has since recovered and returned to China while all other patients are currently undergoing treatment at government hospitals. One patient, officials said, had returned from Kerala recently.

Prominent Opposition politician Sajith Premadasa, who now leads an alliance of a faction of the United National Party (UNP), and its allies, urged the government to utilise funds allocated for polls to step up Sri Lanka’s response to the virus. Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has urged the President to convene an all-parties meeting to discuss ways to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and possibly postpone poll in the wake of such a health crisis, the Daily FT newspaper here reported.

The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on Monday said it was concerned about the possible spread of COVID-19 and noted that the safety of the public is “our paramount concern”. “For this reason, and for the reason that all democratic aspects cannot be properly be adhered to in this abnormal situation, we request the postponement of the general election due to be held on 25th of April 2020,” its spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran said in a statement.

Public health concern

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) took a similar position. “This is a big public health concern and as a country we must focus on preventing it from further spreading,” said Bimal Rathnayake, who represented the party in Parliament in the last session. On March 3, President Rajapaksa dissolved Parliament and announced polls on April 25.

“In the current situation, you can’t campaign or hold rallies and that affects the Opposition parties the most, because government still has state media and even some private media to put out its messages. This situation gives the incumbent government an unfair advantage,” he told The Hindu.

The Tamil Progressive Alliance, a grouping of Malayaha [hill country] Tamils, also sought a postponement. Its leader Mano Ganesan urged the government to act responsibly “before the situation gets out of control”. “Let us activate our systems beyond party divides. Electioneering now will expose the country to more unjustifiable health risks,” he said in a tweet.

The Election Commission of Sri Lanka is yet to respond to the requests made by the different parties. Sources said a crucial meeting was summoned on Monday. The parliamentary election — estimated to cost over LKR 5 billion — will see the direct election of 196 MPs to the 225-member legislature, and 29 others through the National List. Following a public holiday on Monday, Sri Lankan courts have decided to remain closed through the week to prevent large groups from gathering.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/78pmqr/article31085035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GOTABAYA-16mar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-sri-lanka-opposition-parties-ask-president-to-postpone-election/article31085025.ece

30,2020/03/17,Google removing fake corona videos from YouTube: Sundar Pichai,"In a blog post, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that since January, Google has blocked hundreds of thousands of ads attempting to capitalise on the coronavirus pandemic

Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company has taken down thousands of videos related to dangerous or misleading coronavirus information using its Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based technology.

In a blog post, Pichai said that since January, Google has blocked hundreds of thousands of ads attempting to capitalise on the coronavirus pandemic.

“Last week, we announced a temporary ban on all ads for medical masks and respirators,” he said on Monday.

“We continue to remove videos that promote medically unproven methods to prevent coronavirus in place of seeking medical treatment. On Google Maps, our automated and manual review systems continue to take down false and harmful content such as fake reviews and misleading information about healthcare locations,” Pichai elaborated.

Meanwhile, Google said the coronavirus tracking and screening website that U.S. President Donald Trump announced the company is building with 1,700 engineers is delayed to “later this week.”

Google’s subsidiary Verily is building the website to direct people to testing facilities.

“With local and national guidance evolving rapidly, Google will continue working with relevant agencies and authorities to roll out a website later this week that will surface authoritative information for people in the U.S., including on screening and testing,” Google said in a statement.

Pichai said the company is partnering with the U.S. government in developing a website dedicated to COVID-19 education, prevention, and local resources nationwide.

“Right now, on the Google home page, we’re promoting the ‘Do the Five’ campaign to raise awareness of simple measures people can take to slow the spread of the disease, according to the WHO,” he informed.

‘Do the Five’ raises awareness of simple measures people can take to slow the spread of the disease, according to the World Health Organisation.

“On YouTube, we’re using the home page to direct users to videos from the CDC or other locally relevant public health agencies. We’re highlighting content from authoritative sources when people search for COVID-19, and inserting information panels to provide additional context from high-quality sources,” Pichai said.

Google is also witnessing more people using the premium features of Meet, its video-conferencing app, which it made available to all G Suite customers at no cost until July 1.

“Through our philanthropic arm Google.org, we are committing $50 million to the global COVID-19 response, focusing on health and science, access to educational resources and small business support,” said Pichai.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/lh4mhm/article31089447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17NETGOOGLEPICHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-removing-fake-corona-videos-from-youtube-sundar-pichai/article31089448.ece
31,2020/03/17,33% movie-goers say they will stay away from theatres during outbreak,"Offline script registration stopped, Dharma suspends all administrative and production work

With cinema halls in Delhi and subsequently Maharashtra downing shutters, watching films should be the last thing on any person’s mind. And 33% of the country’s regular theatre-goers are likely to stay away from theatres till the threat of the novel coronavirus has reduced, a continuing Ormax Media study on the impact of the pandemic on theatre-going behaviour has said.

The survey was conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu industries belt between March 12 and 15. This was an increase from the 23% in the poll conducted between March 6 and 8 and 26% in the one conducted between March 9 and 11.

However, 33% still does not seem that huge a figure given the enormity of the health crisis and the fact that cinema halls are closed. “This is people’s perception,” said Ormax CEO Shailesh Kapoor. “If theatres were open and a film that you wanted to watch was running, would you still stay away because of the threat? The trend is more important than the number. It has grown from 26% to 33% in just four days.”

In the days and weeks to follow, the figure is likely to go up even more. “It's a good measure of public panic levels. So when it stops going up or starts going down, one can say panic levels are also going down. All will depend on how many new cases are diagnosed in India in the next few days,” Mr. Kapoor said. The spike was sharper this time in the Hindi-speaking markets, with 39% saying they will stay away as opposed to 28% in the previous poll, and 26% in the one before that. In the South, too, the rise was substantial — 30% from 21% and 17% respectively.

Meanwhile, the Mumbai-based Screenwriters Association (SWA) informed its members that offline script registration and the new admissions procedure shall remain closed at the SWA office from March 16 to 31. The SWA’s legal officer won’t be available for appointments either. “In case the situation demands further preventive actions, we shall inform you of the same,” the notice said. The online script registration process on the website shall remain active 24x7.

The Association of Film and Video Editors, too, has called a halt on all editing and post-production work from March 21.

Leading Bollywood studio, Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions, suspended all administrative and production work until further notice. “We are complying with all the precautionary measures suggested by the government to minimise the risk of exposure to our cast, crew, workers and audience,” it said in a statement, signing off: “We will see you at the movies soon.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9p4e5x/article31086330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMCoronacol,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/33-movie-goers-say-they-will-stay-away-from-theatres-during-outbreak/article31086331.ece

British actor Idris Elba said on March 16 he has tested positive for the new coronavirus.

Elba, who starred in TV drama The Wire and many of the Thor movies, said in a Twitter post that he had no symptoms but was isolating himself from others. It was not clear where he was located.

33,2020/03/17,The walls of Indian Air Force Station in Avadi get a facelift by city-based artists,"The walls of the Indian Air Force Station in Avadi are being painted with graffiti by well-meaning volunteers of city NGO Thuvakkam and Chennai artists

The sprawling campus of the Indian Air Force Station in Avadi is unusually colourful. Last month, a bunch of art student volunteers had arrived at the otherwise inaccessible campus, with paint cans and brushes. Their aim? To relieve the campus of the often-seen shades of grey and green and inculcate appreciation for the visual medium among people there. Over 8,000 square feet of wall area, will see public art, graffiti work with messages on social awareness by both professional artists and student volunteers in collaboration with Nippon Paints and Thuvakkam, a city-based NGO.

Though patriotism, aviation, and social awareness seem to be dominant themes, some of the artists have also worked on metaphors that encapsulate the work the IAF does for the country. The latter has always been a running theme. Thuvakkam has been working with the IAF Station in Avadi since last year when they kicked off a tree-plantation drive within the campus. “IAF wanted to create awareness, especially among the local community, through wall art. This will be done in different phases through March,” says Krishna Kumar of Thuvakkam. Nearly 40 to 50 walls will be taken over by the volunteers who have been sought out through an open call. A few art enthusiasts are already registered volunteers with Thuvakkam. “For this initiative, there are specific art-trained volunteers who will sketch the outlines, which will be later filled in by others,” says Krishnakumar adding that each phase expects to see 50 to 80 volunteers and two phases of this scale will be held over the month.

Artist Indrani’s is an underwater scene, replete with corals and marine life which dot the canvas with colour in an otherwise blue façade. Says the 60-year-old, “Above the surface of the water, everything is clearly visible and noisy; but underwater, it is a completely different story. It is packed with dangerous action in the dark. I felt this to be similar to the lives of those in the Forces,” says the artist who is also a member of the NGO. She has also made sure the wall is as colourful as possible. “I wanted to use vibrant colours that also soothe viewers.”

Thuvakkam calls for volunteers who wish to participate. They need not necessarily be trained artists. According to Krishna Kumar, the idea is to inculcate a sense of community by such activities. Officers in the station are also likely to join in.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/f8s6o/article31089969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16mpart3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-walls-of-indian-air-force-station-in-avadi-get-a-facelift-by-city-based-artists/article31089970.ece

35,2020/03/17,FPI sales at a record high as virus spooks markets,"Expect uptick in purchases by foreign portfolio investors, as some macro signs look good, say analysts

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who have been the prime drivers of every bull run that the Indian capital market has seen till date, have been record sellers during the current month.

Till date in March, FPIs have sold equity and debt cumulatively worth ₹67,306 crore, which is the highest ever witnessed in any single month, as per data from National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL).

Further, while equity has seen the worst-ever monthly outflows of ₹36,217 crore till date in March, debt outflows at ₹31,982 crore is the highest in nearly seven years. In June 2013, FPIs were net sellers at ₹33,135 crore in the debt segment. Incidentally, some of the recent trading sessions have seen foreign investors sell shares or bonds close to $1 billion in a single day on the back of increasing concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic that has made investors move away from riskier asset classes.

On March 13, the net selling by FPIs in the equity segment was $910 million. On March 11, the debt segment saw foreign investors’ net sales at almost $1.08 billion.

Similarly, on March 9, when the benchmark Sensex recorded a fall of 1,941.67 points — its biggest single-day fall till then — foreign investors sold shares worth $948 million.

In the current calendar year, FPIs are net sellers at ₹57,379 crore as the first two months of 2020 saw some amount of buying by such investors.

Sales to slow down

Market participants, however, believe that with the valuations taking a massive hit on account of the ongoing fall, institutional investors, especially overseas entities, will slow the pace of selling to buy heavily beaten down quality stocks. “We might see some more selling by FPIs, after which there should be buying activity visible,” said Harendra Kumar, MD, institutional equities, Elara Capital.

“There are many good-quality stocks that are available at their book value or even below their book value. Also, crude is at a very low level that benefits India more than many other economies and rupee has performed relatively better than other Asian currencies,” he said.

“So, some of the macros are in favour of FPIs investing in India,” added Mr. Kumar. In 2019, FPIs were net buyers in the equity and debt segments at ₹1.01 lakh crore and ₹25,882 crore, respectively.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/9iwtz6/article31093125.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18FPIcol,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fpi-sales-at-a-record-high-as-virus-spooks-markets/article31093126.ece
36,2020/03/17,Yes Bank all set to lift deposit withdrawal cap,"CEO designate says liquidity not a problem; ATMs fully loaded; lender eyes recovery of up to ₹8,500 crore next year

Private sector lender Yes Bank has assured all its customers they need not worry about their deposits after the moratorium is lifted, as branches and automated teller machines (ATMs) will have adequate cash.

The moratorium, which was imposed on March 5 with deposit withdrawals capped at ₹50,000, will be lifted on Wednesday at 6 p.m. This is the first time in banking history that a moratorium will be lifted from a commercial bank as, in all previous cases, such lenders were merged with other banks.

Watch | Yes Bank crisis explained

“We have taken adequate precautions. All our ATMs are full with cash. All our branches have adequate supply of cash. So, from Yes Bank’s side, there is absolutely no issue on the liquidity front,” said Prashant Kumar, the Reserve Bank of India-appointed administrator of the bank. He will take charge as the MD and CEO of the reconstructed bank on March 26, along with a new board. The RBI has assured liquidity support to the bank, if required, after the moratorium is lifted.

Allaying concerns that the depositors will rush to withdraw their deposits after the moratorium is lifted, Mr. Kumar said only a third of the depositors have withdrawn the full amount available during the moratorium period. In the past three days, more money came into Yes Bank compared with the withdrawals, he said.

But Mr. Kumar acknowledged that deposits were his biggest concern.

“We want to build a granular retail deposit franchise and we need to move away from the dependence on bulk deposits,” he said.

As part of the reconstruction plan, the bank has received investments from eight banks, including the State Bank of India, which will be largest shareholder with a 48% stake.

The capital adequacy ratio of the bank, which had dipped below the regulatory requirement, will be addressed by this capital infusion.

Regulatory requirement

“If we take into account the the capital infusion of ₹10,000 crore and written down value of AT1 bonds, then, we are above the regulatory capital requirement,” Mr. Kumar said. The bank would raise more funds before it finalises the annual results, that is, during the first quarter of FY21.

“[As much as] 80% of the funds raised in the next year will be for growth,” he said, adding the bank is also expecting a strong recovery in the next financial year — to the tune of ₹8,500 crore.

Though the revival scheme of Yes Bank mandates that the SBI cannot reduce its stake below 26% in the next three years, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said not even a single Yes Bank share it holds would be sold before the three-year lock-in period ends.

37,2020/03/17,"Bike-taxis can create 2 million jobs, generate $4.5 billion in revenue in India: Ola study","Bike-Taxis have the potential to create over two millon livelihood opportunities and revenues of $4.5 billion, predicts a study conducted by Ola Mobility Institute (OMI), a policy research and social innovation think-tank of ride-hailing platform, Ola.

As per the study, titled ‘The Power of Two Wheels Bike-Taxi: India’s New Shared Mobility Frontier,’ two-wheelers are primarily a utilitarian choice for Indians, rather than an aspirational or lifestyle choice, and one in three people in the country use them for their daily commute between home and work.

India is the world’s largest two-wheeler (2W) market and 2Ws constitute 81% of the automobiles sold in the country,contributing significantly to the country’s GDP. As per SIAM (2019) data, some 63,000 2Ws are sold in the country every day and for every 1,000 people, there are 102 2Ws here.

“The figures of ownership, usage, and market size of 2Ws truly paint a holistic picture of the ubiquity of 2Ws in India. This asset category has become a symbol of empowerment for the (hitherto) under-represented communities as can be gleaned from its widespread use,’’ said the report.

The study also emphasised the importance of legalising bike-taxi operations in the country, after analysing data from Ola’s bike-taxi operations and interviews with 100 plus drivers affiliated to bike-taxi platforms in Gurugram and Jaipur.

“Bike-taxis are a popular choice of intra-city travel in India’s urban agglomerations as well as the hinterlands. Bike-taxi operations in Gurugram, for instance, witnessed 100% growth in the number of bookings within seven months of launch.’’

Further, with 70-85% of the rides under 7 km in cities of varying sizes, bike-taxis are an effective mode of travel for short distances. The widespread promotion and use of bike-taxis is therefore expected to shift individuals from their private cars with low occupancy to shared mobility such as bike-taxis. This will, thereby, reduce traffic congestion and the need for individualised parking spots all over the city, observed the study.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bike-taxis-can-create-2-million-jobs-generate-45-billion-in-revenue-in-india-ola-study/article31092865.ece

Moody’s Investors Service has said that global spread of new coronavirus (COVID-19) will significantly slow economic growth, which will in turn amplify its financial impact on several key free movement-driven sectors.

“Sectors reliant on trade and the free movement of people are most exposed, such as passenger airlines, shipping, and lodging and leisure, which includes cruise lines and restaurants,” Vice President - Senior Credit Officer - Benjamin Nelson at Moody’s said in a statement.

Global automakers are also under great pressure because of their reliance on international supply chains, while gaming and non-food retail in certain regions are also exposed to supply chain disruptions, and the inevitable decline in foot traffic.

“Companies’ ability to withstand the effects of the virus will depend on its duration, and we caution that as events unfold very rapidly on a daily basis, our assessment of exposure will change over time,” another Vice President - Senior Credit Officer - at Moody’s Richard Morawetz said.

Moody’s assessment is based on its baseline scenario, which assumes a normalisation of economic activity in the second half of the year, and the ability of some companies to withstand the effects of the virus will depend on its duration.

The agency’s downside scenario factors in a jump in cases and public fear that the virus will not be contained in the first half of 2020, leading to extensive and prolonged travel restrictions and quarantines, along with a prolonged slump in commodity prices.

The number of deaths around the world linked to COVID-19 has topped 7,000, after Italy announced a new surge in fatalities, with over 1,75,000 infections recorded globally so far.

39,2020/03/17,Nowhere to go: India-based OCIs stranded abroad appeal to government to allow them back,"Indian missions worldwide are inundated with urgent requests, but India is enforcing travel bans from 37 countries so far

When Sundareshan Krishnaswamy, a vice president with American tech company Oracle, left Bengaluru on March 3 for a business trip in the United States, he couldn’t have imagined the nightmare that awaited him, that divided his family across four countries, and has left him stranded without a home and access to much needed medicines.

Hundreds of Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) cardholders like him, who are permanently based in India but were travelling, studying or working abroad, have appealed to the government to make an exception for them to return, with little headway so far.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Officials say their hands are tied as the government decided on March 11 to cancel all visas issued to non-Indians, and suspend OCI rights for the duration of the coronavirus-related directions as well.

‘Needs to return’

“We have lived in India for 15 years, and don’t have a home outside,” Mr. Krishnaswamy’s son Siddharth Aatreya, a student at the U.K.’s Cambridge University told The Hindu over the telephone, barely able to conceal his worries from his voice. “[My father] has a limited supply of insulin and hypertension medication, which will run out in two weeks, he needs to return home to India,” Mr. Aatreya said.

Mr. Krishnaswamy was in North Carolina, U.S., when the government issued its notification aimed at keeping out all non-essential passengers to India. According to his son, he immediately re-scheduled his flights to travel home via Chicago and Frankfurt.

However, when he went to board his flight to Bengaluru in Frankfurt, he and about 15-20 other OCI cardholders were told that the airline would not board them.

This left Mr. Krishnaswamy, who is a Canadian citizen, stranded in Germany, while his wife is in Bengaluru, one son is in the U.K. and the other is studying in Canada. “Living outside India for all of us will mean moving into a hotel, which is a huge financial strain,” said Mr. Aatreya, who has tried to contact the local Indian High Commission and even addressed tweets to the Ministry of External Affairs, with no response yet.

Huge response

While Indian missions worldwide have been authorised to issue visas for urgent requests, they too are inundated, said officials. Several missions that had originally put the ‘emergency visas for OCIs’ form on their website have had to take them down, given the huge response.

Hopes for the Krishnaswamy family returning early have been further complicated as more and more countries are put on the Ministry of Health’s no-fly list, and airlines are cancelling flights to India.

Apart from business travellers, the OCI rule has affected hundred of students with OCI status in various universities abroad, whose parents and family live in India. Anju Sharma (name changed at her request) says that she had no choice but to fly to the U.K. so as to care for her children, whose hostels have been shut down, but they can’t fly home.

Many are going online to try and have their protests heard. A petition on the website change.org started by a parent last week has received nearly 4,000 signatures. “Please let our children enter India,” says the petition addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, by the parent, Kavitha Prasad. “Our kids have to vacate their college rooms and have nowhere to go,” it adds.

‘Constant review’

When asked about the demand from OCIs to allow them to return to India, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the matter is “under constant review by the Group of Ministers and the Committee of the Secretaries”.

However, at present, any OCI cardholder who intends to travel for compelling reasons must contact local Indian missions. “The discretion to decide on compelling cases rest with Heads of Mission. However, the country-specific travel advisories and applicable health protocols will still be enforced,” said Mr. Kumar.

As of Monday, India has banned the travel of all passengers from about 37 countries, including the U.K., 32 European countries, Turkey, Malaysia, Philippines and Afghanistan, a list that is likely to grow.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nsq1fb/article31094224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GERMANY-HEALTH-VIRUS-TRAFFIC-AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nowhere-to-go-india-based-ocis-stranded-abroad-appeal-to-govt-to-allow-them-back/article31093468.ece

The Union government has no plans to privatise the Railways now or in future as it is the property of the people, Railways Minister Piyush Goyal said in the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.

Mr. Goyal was responding to the discussion on the working of the Railways Ministry that went for two days. Replying to concerns raised by MPs about the potential sale of the Railways, Mr. Goyal said there was no such proposal. However, there would be public-private partnerships.

After MPs complained about delayed rail projects, Mr. Goyal said the Centre was focusing on projects without land, forest clearance or encroachment hurdles. He hit out at the West Bengal and Kerala governments in this regard.

He said the government had identified 58 “super critical” and 68 “critical”, “rather than spreading resources thin”.

Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said there had been slow progress in the project to connect Banihal to Baramulla in Kashmir. Mr. Goyal replied that the project would be completed before India celebrates its 75th Independence Day on August 15, 2022, connecting the length of the country, from Kashmir till Kanyakumari.

He said the Railways was on course to achieve its target of 100% electrification by 2024. On the issue of safety, he said till Tuesday, there had been no deaths this financial year from rail accidents.

The Opposition, however, hit out at the government over the financial health of the Railways. Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien asked why the growth in freight had decreased from 4% to 1% and why the Railways was facing a revenue deficit of Rs.25,000 crore.

The Lok Sabha on Tuesday passed a Bill to extend the upper limit for permitting abortions from 20 weeks to 24 under special circumstances.

The “special categories of women” include rape survivors, victims of incest, the differently abled and minors, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said moving the Bill.

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020, which seeks to amend the MTP Act, 1971, was passed by a voice vote after a debate that lasted two-and-a-half hours. Though Opposition members had moved amendments, they were defeated.

Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar of the Trinamool called the Bill a step in the right direction and offered several suggestions. She said that an anomalous foetus could be identified by a ultrasound scan within 16 to 18 weeks instead of waiting for 24 weeks.

Ritesh Pandey of the BSP and Amol R. Kolhe said abortion should be considered a fundamental right of a woman.

Over 80 trains have been temporarily cancelled across the country citing low occupancy amid outbreak of the COVID-19, even as the Ministry of Railways on Tuesday constituted a “COVID response” team for monitoring the preparedness to deal with the pandemic.

To regulate the crowd at the stations, the platform ticket price will also be temporarily hiked to ₹50 from ₹10, particularly at important stations that see huge visitor rush.

“Across Indian Railways, the cancellation percentage has gone up by about 80%,” a press statement from the East Coast Railway (ECoR) said, adding the zone itself has seen cancellation of more than one lakh tickets in the last six days, which is 67% higher than cancellation during the same period last year.

The statement said if required more trains could be cancelled.

Following the meeting, it was decided that a COVID response team be constituted, comprising the Executive Directors from the Railway Board. It will have six members and will coordinate all preparedness activities. “They will monitor progress through an online dashboard and other forums, resolve issues of railway zones/PUs, issue advisories and media briefs and prepare position for review meetings at various forums,” an official added.

In a statement, the CPI(M) Polit Bureau pointed out that “ironically”, last year itself, Justice Gogoi had observed, “There is a strong viewpoint that post-retirement appointment [of a judge] is a scar on the independence of the judiciary.”

“By nominating the former CJI to the Rajya Sabha, the Narendra Modi government is brazenly undermining the independence of the judiciary and subverting the separation of powers between the organs of the state, an inviolable principle enshrined in our Constitution,” it said.

The party said the recent events, including the midnight transfer of High Court judges and the delay in the hearing of the challenges to dilution of Article 370 and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, did not inspire confidence in the people. “The Polit Bureau is firmly opposing the move by the government in the light of widespread criticism that the judiciary is being pressurised by the Executive, and abdicating its responsibility.

Justice Gogoi was one among the four judges, along with Justices (all retired) J.S. Chelameswar, Madan B. Lokur and Kurian, who held an unprecedented press conference on January 12, 2018 to warn the nation about the perceived encroachments by the government into the highest judicial institution, the Supreme Court. The four judges had cautioned the nation at the press meet that certain sensitive and political cases were being assigned to select Benches of the Supreme Court by successive Chief Justices. The press conference was held when the Judge Loya death case was pending the apex court.

“We have discharged our debt to the nation’ was the statement made by Justice Ranjan Gogoi along with the three of us on January 12, 2018. I am surprised as to how Justice Ranjan Gogoi, who once exhibited such courage of conviction to uphold the independence of judiciary, has compromised the noble principles on the independence and impartiality of the judiciary,” Justice Kurian said on Tuesday.

Justice Lokur had also reacted sharply to the nomination of Justice Gogoi.

Justice Gogoi’s nomination comes less than six months since his retirement in November 2019. As CJI, he had led the Constitution Bench which ruled in favour of the Hindu side on the ownership of the disputed land in the Ayodhya title appeals.

Justice Kurian said public faith in an independent judiciary would crumble the moment there is a perception that a section of the judges are biased or looking forward.

Party spokesperson and Rajya Sabha member Abhishek Singhvi cited the remarks of former Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley about the pre-retirement judgments of a judge being influenced by his desire for post-retirement jobs. “I am quoting him..., ‘For two years after retirement, there should be a gap [before appointment], otherwise the government can directly or indirectly influence the courts and the dream to have an independent, impartial and fair judiciary in the country would never actualise.’ These are his [Jaitley’s] words,” he said.

Mr. Singhvi said former Chief Justice of India Ranganath Misra became a Rajya Sabha member, five or six years after retirement.

51,2020/03/17,Coronavirus casts shadow on Bodoland council polls,"“Our feedback is that there is no threat of the virus in the BTC areas, as people from outside are not involved in campaigns,” Assam’s Social Welfare Minister Pramila Rani Brahma told The Hindu.

The Assam government’s decision to restrict large gatherings as a precaution against the COVID-19 causing coronavirus may cast a shadow on the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) elections scheduled for April 4.

Most of the candidates have filed their nominations for the 40 seats straddling the four districts that comprise the BTC. The deadline for submitting papers is Wednesday and the last date for withdrawal of candidature is March 21.

People across the BTC, particularly in headquarters Kokrajhar and other towns, have raised concerns about the poll campaign and election rallies where hundreds of people come into close contact.

“We have not had any instructions,” said Pramod Boro, the president of the United People’s Party Liberal, which seeks to end the 17-year rule of the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) in the BTC. “So the election is on unless a decision is taken in view of the pandemic,” he added. Mr. Boro filed his nomination from the Tamulpur council seat on Monday.

A former ally of the Congress, the BPF has also been ruling Assam as one of two minor regional partners of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) since 2016.

“Our feedback is that there is no threat of the virus in the BTC areas, as people from outside are not involved in campaigns,” Assam’s Social Welfare Minister Pramila Rani Brahma told The Hindu. “There is no need to panic and impact the polls,” she added.

Ms. Brahma represents the BPF from the Kokrajhar East Assembly constituency and is one of the key campaigners of the party.

The Congress, however, contended that it would be foolish to think that the people of BTC were immune to the virus that has killed more than 6,000 people across the globe.

“Why was the decision to hold the polls taken in such a crisis,” asked State Congress general secretary Durga Das Boro. “I have told the State election authority that we should not take any chances against the pandemic,” he added.

The State Election Commission, which is conducting the council polls, said any decision on rescheduling the polls because of the pandemic would be taken by the State Governor, who is the constitutional head of areas under the Sixth Schedule.

The 8,871 sq km BTC falls under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.

Governor Jagdish Mukhi could not be contacted immediately, but a Raj Bhavan official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the matter (possible effect of the pandemic on the polls) would be discussed.

According to the existing schedule, the results of the BTC elections are set to be announced on April 8.

52,2020/03/17,"With two weeks to census start, uncertainty clouds NPR","At least 13 States and Delhi oppose new NPR format.

At least 13 States, and Delhi, covering almost 60% of the total population of India, are opposed to the revision of the National Population Register (NPR) in the format being prepared by the Centre, even as the nationwide exercise is scheduled to kick off in barely two weeks time on April 1.

Home minister Amit Shah told Parliament last week that people could choose to not respond to questions, but Chief Ministers and activists have said that this is no guarantee that they would not face any problems in the future.

Explained | What connects the NPR, NRIC and Census?

Discussion with States

On March 3, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) had informed the Lok Sabha that it was in discussion with States that had expressed concerns over the controversial additional questions in the NPR form. There has, however, been no further clarification from the government since then. On February 18, the MHA had informed a parliamentary panel that during works towards updating the NPR 2020, “it is proposed to collect data on some additional items like place of last residence, mother tongue, Aadhaar number (voluntary), mobile number, passport (Indian passport holder), voter ID card, driving license number, date and place of birth of father and mother”. The Centre hasn’t as yet officially published a pro forma for the NPR.

“The Centre has said it is not mandatory, but hasn’t dropped the questions,” West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee observed earlier this month. “Now, if you don’t provide these documents, they won’t ask for it. They will simply mark you as a D (doubtful) voter,” asserted Ms. Banerjee, who spoke before Mr. Shah’s statement last week that nobody would be marked ‘D’ for their inability to provide such documents. Activists such as Yogendra Yadav and Harsh Mander have since pointed out that as the law stands, not providing information for the NPR can be an offence and the NPR could be used for identifying genuine citizens and doubtful ones. The Centre has shown no inclination to change the form or the existing rules to give legal backing to Mr. Shah’s statement that this will not be a basis for identifying citizens.

West Bengal was the first State to announce that it would not canvass the NPR form during the census operations, followed by Kerala. Both States have put the NPR exercise on on hold. The works towards updating NPR is meant to be part of the first phase of the census — the house listing — that is set to take place from April 1 to September 30. The second phase is population enumeration, which will be from February 9 to February 28, 2021, throughout the country simultaneously.

Among the 13 States that are opposed to the NPR in its current form are Bihar where the BJP is a partner in the Nitish Kumar-led government, and Tamil Nadu, where the ruling AIADMK is its ally. Mr. Kumar has said nobody would be asked to furnish information like their parents’ birth place in the form, as his government has sent a letter to the Centre seeking omission of contentious clauses from the NPR form. In Jharkhand, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha-led government is yet to take an official decision on NPR, but CM Hemant Soren is said to be against the NPR exercise in the State. States where the Congress is in power are all opposed to the NPR in its current form, and some such as Chhattisgarh have said they would use the 2010 format for data collection.

Barring Bihar and TN, no other State under BJP-rule or governed by its allies is holding out. The seven contiguous north-eastern States are ruled by the BJP on its own or in alliance with regional parties or, in the case of Mizoram, by the Mizo National Front, which is a member of a BJP-fronted development forum. The Mizoram government has remained silent while the other States have started or are in the process of training officials for the exercise. Although the Centre has exempted Assam as it had conducted the National Register of Citizens, the State government had in February appealed to the Registrar General of India for conducting the NPR contending that the exercise “will come in handy while detailing welfare schemes”.

“We are training about 11,000 enumerators for collecting the NPR data from May 16 to June 29,” Tripura’s Census Department Director Pradip Kumar Chakraborty said. “We are trying to spread awareness among the public on the process and benefits of the register,” Manipur Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren said. “We are well prepared for the exercise that will be conducted without segregation of any community,” asserted Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma. “We are focussing on the accuracy of data, as there have been gaps in the execution at the grassroots in the past,” Mr. Sangma added.

The BJD government in Odisha appears to be taking the Centre’s assurance on the NPR at face value. Trainers have been asked to devote two days on the NPR in a five-day-long district level training beginning from March 16. The NPR format,which seeks answers on date and place of birth of parents in the 13(ii) column, is being used for training purposes. While Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’s government has not spoken about the contentious NPR format publicly, the State government had expressed reservations on the NPR form’s 13(ii) column. The State, however, seems to have accepted the Centre’s clarification that the question would be optional, not mandatory.

The Srinagar administration on Tuesday decided to organise televised classes for the thousands of students forced to stay at home following the outbreak of COVID-19.

“All the heads of departments and educational institutions are directed to submit proposals for televised coaching and classes by March 20. These efforts should be supported and financed by the district administration, Srinagar,” District Magistrate, Srinagar, Dr. Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said.

J&K has closed all educational institutes, including schools and colleges, due to measures imposed to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak, from March 11 to March 31.

Prolonged pause

The closure of these educational institutes has only added to the prolonged pause the education system here has faced since August 5, 2019, when the Centre revoked J&K’s special status. In the past 280 days (eight months), the Kashmir valley has witnessed just 20 days of classwork, the longest ever.

Many parents and authorities of the schools have asked the J&K administration to resume the suspended high-speed 4G Internet on mobile phones so that students can access video classes online.

“Be it curfews, post-August situation or now coronavirus scare, our children have been denied education for the last more than seven months. Online education could have considerably compensated for the losses faced by children but unfortunately, the government is not in a mood to relent or even acknowledge it,” said Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK) president G. N. Var.

Internet needed

Demanding restoration of 4G Internet, Mr. Var said, “For coaching, training and education, high-speed Internet connectivity is must. If the government doesn’t want to darken the future of our younger generation, it must restore Internet connectivity immediately.”

“Since all schools, colleges and universities are closed as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, millions of students are missing classes, creating an unparalleled disruption in education for the region. It has posed a serious challenge to our children to cope up with their counterparts elsewhere in the country, who enjoy all other educational facilities, including high-speed mobile Internet,” Mr. Bukhari said.

Both the patients have been admitted to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida.

Mr. Bhargav said it was not unexpected as symptoms take 4 to 14 days to appear.

He said not all the residents would be tested. “Only those who are symptomatic would be checked. Rest have been asked to go into self-quarantine,” he said.

Dr. (Brig.) Rakesh Kumar Gupta, Director, GIMS, said both the patients are stable. “They are in their 20s and are expected to recover soon.” On the line of treatment, he said, as there was no specific medicine, physicians are treating them according to symptoms. “One of them is Tamiflu.” He refused to divulge whether the physicians were following the same line of treatment followed by the doctors of the Sawai Man Singh hospital in Jaipur while treating two Italian patients.

“My husband is a convict in the Nirbhaya case but he is innocent…Now, I want to be legally divorced from him before he is hanged as I don’t want to live the life of a widow,” Punita Devi, wife of Akshay Thakur, said in her petition filed at a family court in the local district court of Aurangabad. Son of Saryug Singh and Malti Devi, Akshay Thakur hails from the Lahangkarma village of Bihar’s Aurangabad district. The court has fixed March 19 as the next date of hearing.

‘Right under Act’

“My client [Punita Devi] has a right to seek divorce from her husband under section 13(2)(II) of the Hindu Marriage Act, which says a woman can seek divorce from her husband if he has been found guilty of rape, sodomy or bestiality. I have filed her petition in the family court of the district,” Mukesh Kumar Singh, Punita Devi’s lawyer told local journalists in Aurangabad. Ms. Devi also has a son to look after.

However, some advocates in Patna told The Hindu “it [the divorce petition] may be another delaying tactic by a Nirbhaya case accused person but at the same time everyone has a legal right to justice”.

Along with Akshay Thakur, the other three convicts in the Nirbhaya case — Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma are currently lodged in Delhi’s Tihar jail. Earlier, their hanging was postponed twice.

‘Eerie silence’

At the Lahangkarma village, Akshay Thakur’s family members have not been speaking to anyone on the case. An eerie silence has engulfed the village.

63,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | GoAir suspends international operations,"Introduces leave without pay; enhances all cleaning procedures

On account of the cancellations and visa restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, low-cost carrier GoAir on Tuesday announced a temporary suspension of all its international flights between March 17 and April 15 along with implementing a short-term temporary rotational leave without pay programme that will not only help the company counter the short-term reduction in capacity, but keep employees away from their workplace.

In a statement, the airline said the aviation industry has been one of the most affected as governments have issued far-reaching travel advisories, special events have been postponed or called off, customers have curtailed their individual travel plans and businesses have restricted the movement of their employees.

“Knowing that this will put a financial burden on the affected employees and having studied what companies have done in other countries to help guide our plans, this decision was not taken lightly,” a spokesperson said referring to the two decisions.

The GoAir has daily fights to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Muscat, Bangkok, Phuket and Male from Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and Kannur.

It also said it has enhanced all its cleaning procedures in the interest of the customers’ and employees health and safety. “There is nothing more important than this. We have also tried to put our customers at ease by offering them a waiver on change fees so that they can be confident about booking their travel today while maintaining full flexibility in the future. Despite going over and above to implement these safeguards, the sharp decline in air travel that we are currently experiencing is unprecedented,” it said.

In addition to addressing short term financial and network requirements, the GoAir said airlines in India have petitioned the government for immediate support, as most governments around the world have already provided to their similarly affected airlines.

“We have also taken many immediate measures to make our business more efficient; measures that will help us create an even stronger airline in the long run. GoAir remains on track to receive 12-15 aircraft each year through the end of 2025 in support of our planned growth. We also reaffirm our focus and commitment to punctuality, reliability and the highest level of customer experience,” the GoAir statement read.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v4kx7g/article31091632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDDELHIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-goair-suspends-international-operations/article31091634.ece

Around 54,000 people across the country are being kept under community surveillance through health workers to contain the spread of COVID-19, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan told the Rajya Sabha.

He appreciated the work done by medical staff. “As one metre social distancing is required to be taken while dealing with those affected with the virus, I laud doctors and paramedics who are working honestly and with dedication while taking risks in treating the patients..”

He was replying to a supplementary question raised by BJP MP Ashok Vajpayee. He said the ICMR scientists are in touch with scientists all over the world on the use of retroviral drugs and in the research under way in finding treatment for the virus.

“We have also heard about some research being done in the United States,” he said, adding new vaccines can be introduced only after following a procedure. “We are using all kinds of retroviral drugs for treating patients...We are thoroughly seized of the issue. We are trying to do our best for patients and treating them.”

Congress MP Anand Sharma, while appreciating the medical community, raised questions on the quarantine facilities, especially the unhygienic condition of toilets. He asked the Health Minister to set up a committee to look into the issue.

Mr. Vardhan urged the MPs to visit the facilities in their respective areas and suggest ways to help improve them and take care of deficiencies. He said these reports are but few.

“I can agree with you that the facilities may not be good. It is quite possible that at some places bathrooms may not be 5-star type. We are conveying in strongest possible manner on such complaints. These are rare complaints and are not frequent complaints received,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7si19f/article30736740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HarshVardhan-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-54000-people-under-community-surveillance-across-country-says-harsh-vardhan/article31090927.ece
65,2020/03/17,"COVID-19 | Save us, say Indians stuck in Iran’s epicentre Qom","We fought as part of the Ladakh Scouts during Kargil war but now our country has abandoned us, they say

Claiming that a number of Indians in Iran are facing extreme difficulties, a group of pilgrims from Kashmir and Kargil has urged for immediate intervention from the government.

Nadeem Yaqoob Hussain Bhat of Kashmir’s Budgam left with a team of 33 Shia pilgrims on January 31 to visit Iraq, Syria and Iran but is now stuck without food and money in Iran’s Qom. The team visited shrines of Imam Hussein, Bibi Zainab and Imam Ali in Iraq and Syria before reaching Qom as the city became the epicentre of the COVID-19 crisis in Iran prompting cancellation of Iranian flights to India.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

After 16 days, Mr. Bhat says he is on the verge of a mental breakdown. “Iran is cracking down on the emergency and in Qom especially there are many hard measures but our biggest worry is that the longer we stay here the greater is the chance that we could all fall sick if left here any longer. We are scared and have no money. We are risking our own health and if we fall sick then there is no scope of getting treatment here as there is no space in Iran’s hospitals that are overrun with their own patients,” said Mr. Bhat painting a dismal picture.

Mr. Bhat is a team leader of a large group of pilgrims who carry out frequent tours to Najaf, Karbala, Mashad, Qom and other holy places in West Asia. The number of pilgrims stuck in Qom from Kashmir, Ladakh and Kargil is around 850, according to him. Asghar Ali, a team leader of another group of pilgrims from Kargil, is among those who are trying to control the worsening situation.

“We are unable to get food as restaurants have shut and hotels are asking us to get out but where do we go? We request the Indian government to urgently help us,” said Asghar Ali speaking over phone.

The pilgrims said there are many among them who are elderly and require regular medication because of diabetes and other disorders but are not getting them as they carried stock to last till January 31 and Iran’s stressed medical field is unable to cope with any extra demand. The pilgrims have reached out to Kashmiri leader Imran Reza Ansari who has been mobilising resources to help the Indians in Qom. In view of the difficulties that the pilgrims are facing in Qom, Anjuman-E-Sahib Zaman of Kargil has appealed to the government of India to help them with the medicines that some of them require and evacuate them to India as soon as possible.

“If the embassy of India extends its helping hand, the people on the ground can hire two locations where we can house the entire group of pilgrims and take necessary measures immediately to help anyone who could be sick,” said Mr. Ansari who is the general secretary of the All Jammu and Kashmir Shia Association. Another pilgrim Rehan Sahib of Kashmir said as Iran tightens control, they are even finding it difficult to coordinate essential movement within the group as there is a total ban on meetings and small gatherings.

India has allowed a limited number of commercial flights to evacuate nationals from Iran but the pilgrims allege that the government has been slow. Officials The Hindu spoke to said India has a declared position that it would not evacuate those who are found to be positive in the test being conducted by the Indian medical team and quarantine facility along with necessary care would be ensured by the embassy in Tehran.

But Mr. Asghar has alleged that they are not getting timely feedback from the Indian mission regarding their requirements. The Hindu reached out to the Indian embassy for a response on the allegations but the officials declined to comment. At a press conference here on Monday, Lav Agarwal, Joint Secretary, Union Health Ministry, also declined to elaborate the plans to help the Indians saying the matter is being coordinated by the Ministry of External Affairs. Pilgrims are upset as they had valid tickets but missed the flights as they were cancelled.

“We ran out of money and now we are pooling in resources. How can we ensure our treatment in a foreign land if we fall sick. In Kargil we are highly patriotic and we have fought as part of the Ladakh Scouts during the Kargil war but now our country has abandoned us,” said Mr. Ali sobbing over phone. In view of the worsening crisis, Hamid Arabnejad, top officer of Mahan Air, has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi proposing to fly all Indians including the pilgrims of Qom without commercial considerations to India as a “humanitarian initiative”. The letter also argues that Indian carriers have been unwilling to fly to Iran because of the U.S. sanctions.

The pilgrims in Qom are one part of a large group of Indians stuck in Iran including around 5,000 nationals who live in Tehran and Bandar Abbas and the Mahan Air’s offer of free passage is meant for the entire community as per the letter of Mr. Arabnejad. Mr. Ansari said 44 students are also stuck in Tehran which is in a state of lockdown and frequent curfew. “They arrived in Tehran from Kish on Monday and we have sent them some money to take care of immediate needs. The need of the hour is generous official assistance from India.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/azvge8/article31090785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDQOM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-save-us-say-indians-stuck-in-irans-epicentre-qom/article31090786.ece
66,2020/03/17,"CAA will not end in illegal migrants’ expulsion, MHA tells Supreme Court","The ‘benign’ Act merely offers ‘amnesty’ without hurting India’s secularism., says Ministry

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was a “benign” law, which did not lead to expulsion or refoulement of illegal migrants, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA ) told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

Also read | MHA clarifies on citizenship to migrants from three nations

Other laws dealt with the expulsion of illegal migrants. The CAA, on the other hand, merely offered “amnesty” without hurting India’s secularism. It relaxed the settled principles of Indian citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians persecuted in the “theocratic States” of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, the MHA said. The CAA, however, does not cover persecuted Muslims from these countries.

But the MHA argued that “the country was divided primarily on the basis of religion with no fault of citizens” in 1947 and these six persecuted minorities have been suffering historical injustice in the three countries. “India represents the sole rational and logically feasible place to seek shelter for these communities,” it said in a reply spanning over 130 pages in the apex court.

The Ministry said the “numerous military regimes” in Pakistan, the civil wars and Taliban in Afghanistan and the “horrific civil war” that led to the creation of Bangladesh accentuated the existing religious persecution of these six communities. India was their natural place of return.

Dismisses fears on NRC

The MHA dismissed fears about the CAA facilitating a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) to expel “doubtful citizens”. Section 14A of the Citizenship Act of 1955, which provides for the preparation of NRC and issuance of national identity cards, was introduced way back in 2004. The section, along with the Citizenship Rules of 2003, dealt only with the “process” of registration of Indian citizens and issuance of national identity cards. They did not arm the Executive with powers to strip a person of his citizenship. Legal rights and citizenship regime would continue as before, it said.

Nevertheless, the preparation of a NRC was a must, the MHA argued. “The preparation of a National Register of Citizens is a necessary exercise for any sovereign country for mere identification of citizens from non-citizens,” it said.

Besides, the Centre had an “unfettered discretion” concerning deportation of illegal migrants as per due process of law. Illegal migrants cannot file PILs in the Supreme Court claiming citizenship. Indian citizens also cannot file PIL demanding freedom of expression (Article 19) or right to religious non-discrimination (Article 15) for illegal migrants “at large” in the country or foreigners outside India.

The MHA said international conventions or treaties cannot be used to test the CAA’s legality in the Supreme Court. Besides, India was neither a signatory to nor had ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 Protocol. Recently, the UN Human Right Commissioner filed an amicus brief in the Supreme Court to intervene in the CAA case.

Exclusion of other sects

The government said the exclusion of other persecuted sects in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan like the Ahamadis, Shias, Bahaiis, etc, from the CAA was not discriminatory.

“Intra-religious or sectarian persecution or persecution due to non-recognition of particular sects to be within the fold of majority religion in these countries, cannot be equated with the persecution of religious minorities...” the MHA reasoned.

On why Rohingya, Sri Lankan Tamils or Tibetan Buddhists did not find a place in the CAA , the MHA justified that “the CAA is not meant to be an omnibus solution to issues across the world”.

Finally, on the choice of three countries - Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan – for the CAA, the government said they formed a “class” as they followed a “specific State religion within the neighbourhood of India”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/payws4/article26363099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-will-not-end-in-illegal-migrants-expulsion-mha-tells-supreme-court/article31090684.ece

Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked BJP MPs on March 17 to spread awareness about the coronavirus and made it clear that the ongoing Parliament’s Budget Session will not be curtailed as lawmakers should be seen to be doing their work at a time when a health concern stares at the masses.

69,2020/03/17,SC allows permanent commission for women in Navy,"Denying permanent commission to women officers who have served the nation would result in a serious miscarriage of justice, it said.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld the right of serving Short Service Commission (SSC) women officers of the Navy to be granted permanent commission (PC) on a par with their male counterparts.

A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi said the “101 excuses” devised by the government, including motherhood and physiological limitations, reeked of a stereotypical mindset.

“The battle for gender equality is about confronting the battles of the mind. In the context of the Armed Forces, specious reasons have been advanced by decision makers and administrators. They range from physiology, motherhood and physical attributes to the male dominated hierarchies,” Justice Chandrachud observed in a 64-page judgment.

Policy letter

The judgment was based on a case filed by 17 women SSC officers, represented by senior advocate Aishwarya Bhati, who were denied PC and discharged despite completing 14 years of service as SSC officers. They had challenged a February 26, 2008 policy letter of the government granting PCs to SSC officers in all the three branches of the Armed Forces. However, the offer was restricted to certain categories and was to operate prospectively for the benefit of future batches inducted on SSCs after January 2009.

In a slew of directions, the court quashed the stipulation in the policy letter of September 26, 2008, making permanent commission for women prospective and restricting its application to specified cadres/branches of the Navy. It directed that SSC women officers found suitable for the grant of PC shall be entitled to all consequential benefits, including arrears of pay, promotions and retirement benefits as and when due.

SSC women officers who were denied consideration for the grant of PCs on the ground that they were inducted prior to the issuance of the September 26, 2008 letter and who are not presently in service shall be deemed, as a one-time measure, to have completed substantive pensionable service.

In the judgment, Justice Chandrachud referred to a submission that vessels of a Russian origin are deployed by the Navy and they have no bathrooms for women officers. The court called these submissions both illusory and without any foundation.

Contrary submissions

“Women officers have worked shoulder to shoulder with their men counterparts in every walk of service. The supposed explanations based on duties at sea or Russian vessels are devices adopted to justify an action which is not germane to the proper discharge of duties and the maintenance of discipline among members of the Armed Forces,” the court said.

It held that such submissions were plainly contrary to the policy letter of February 25, 1999 issued by the Ministry of Defence to the Chief of the Naval Staff, emphatically stipulating that women officers of all branches/cadres could be directed to serve on board ships, both during training and subsequent employment in accordance with the exigencies of service.

“In the face of this communication, it is impossible to countenance a submission that women cannot sail alongside men sailors,” the court held.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article22540538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28INTHVLRNAVY1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-allows-permanent-commission-for-women-in-navy/article31089114.ece
70,2020/03/17,"COVID-19 | Plans afoot to involve private labs for testing, says ICMR","There is no immediate need for their involvement, says institute

With 125 positive COVID-19 cases in the country, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said it has specific plans to involve private laboratories for COVID-19 testing but will do so only if the numbers rise.

It is, however, in talks with the private sector for bringing in rapid-testing kits that can cut the testing time. Raman R. Gangakhedkar, head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases-I (ECD-I), division, ICMR, said: “We have increased testing capacity from 51 to 65 not just for preliminary testing, but also for confirmatory testing. The improved strength will cut the lag time by 24-48 hours for test results. Now 63 labs [62 virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLS)] and one National Centre for Disease Control are testing for COVID-19. Nine other labs will also start functioning shortly.”

Also read: Cases go up to 10 in Karnataka

Balram Bhargava, Director General, ICMR, noted that even for the COVID-19 reconfirmation test, which was previously done only at National Institute of Virology, Pune, ICMR has expanded the facility to 31 laboratories.

“But reduction in testing time is what we are looking at currently. This would enhance our testing capability and cut through the time taken. We have to look at the standard of the tests and ensure that they are up to the best,” he said.

“Quality control and safety of personnel are issues we have to keep in mind when involving private labs for testing. We are open to it and will involve them when needed,” he added.

Dr. Bhargava added that India’s testing capacity of 100,000 samples could be increased further by adding ICMR’s network of 106 VRDLS within days.

Dr. Gangakhedkar has noted that India is currently showing no evidence of any community transmission and that enough tests were being done to pick up any early indication of third-stage transmission.

“We are testing enough and so far there is no evidence for the need to go in for mass testing. ICMR is doing random testing to understand and gain any indication of community transmission. We will be getting the results of our random sampling by Wednesday, which will give us an indication of where we are headed. As of now, the transmission is localised and our labs are underwhelmed by the number of samples that we are getting,” he added.

71,2020/03/17,Special court sends Rana Kapoor to ED’s custody till March 20,"Yes Bank Chief, family members got a kickback of ₹600 crore from DHFL promoter, says ED

The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which arrested former Yes Bank Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Director Rana Kapoor on March 8 for disbursing loans to various firms for pecuniary gains, is now investigating debentures and loans to the tune of ₹5,402.1 crore that the bank had given to the Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL), its group companies and Sumer Group. Based on the submissions by the ED, the court granted the agency custody of Mr. Kapoor till March 20.

ED’s counsel Anil Singh, additional solicitor general, informed the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court that the bank had invested ₹3,700 crore in short-term debentures of the DHFL between April to June, 2018.

Also read: Comment | Beneath the ‘Yes mess’, some stark truths

For the debentures, Mr. Kapoor and his family members got a kickback of ₹600 crore from Kapil Wadhawan, promoter of the DHFL, who paid the sum to DOIT Urban Ventures (India) Pvt Limited under the garb of repayment of ₹300 crore for a loan taken earlier, and the rest for general purposes.

The loan was given on the basis of five properties whose value was inflated from₹ 39.66 crore to ₹735 crore under the assumption that the 7.79 acres at Alibaug and 91.63 acres at Raigad could be converted from agricultural to residential by obtaining approval from local authorities, and thereby use it for construction and eco-tourism activity.

The ED found that the DOIT was in the name of Mr. Kapoor’s daughters Roshini Kapoor, Radha Kapoor Khanna and Raakhee Kapoor Tandon, and it also found that the daughters had never dealt with the firm and only Mr. Kapoor did the dealings of the DOIT.

The ED also informed the court that the Yes Bank had sanctioned a loan of ₹750 crore to RKW Developers Private Limited, a group company of the DHFL, for their Bandra Reclamation project and that the entire sum was siphoned off by Mr. Wadhawan.

The loan of ₹750 crore was taken by Belief Realtors, an RKW group company, which was immediately transferred to KYTA Advisors Private Limited through three group companies of Dheeraj Realty, and KYTA Advisors transferred the full amount to RIP Developers Private Limited which transferred the whole amount to the DHFL immediately. Once the DHFL received the ₹750 crore loan, it then sanctioned a loan to the Radius Group and the Paresh Shah Group, who in turn, paid ₹450 crore from the monies received from the DHFL, to the Yes Bank for repayment of earlier loan to these companies, claimed the ED.

It also told the court that the Yes Bank had sanctioned a loan of ₹202.1 crore, in parts, to one Mack Star Marketing Private Limited, a joint venture of De Shaw Group and promoters of HDIL Group — Sarang Wadhawan, Rakesh Wadhawan and Waryam Singh. The whole amount of loan sanctioned by the bank was siphoned on to the HDIL group companies and this amount was used for payment of earlier loan taken by the HDIL to the Yes bank. The said loans were on the verge of becoming non-performing assets (NPA).

Mr. Singh said, “It is clearly established that Mr. Kapoor in connivance with Wadhawans had sanctioned the loan of ₹202.1 crore, without permission of the investor, and received back the almost whole loan money in Yes bank with sole intention to avoid NPA/Insolvency of HDIL getup companies whose promoters viz the Wadhawans were in very close relationship with Mr. Kapoor himself.”

The agency also claimed that Mr. Kapoor had obtained illegal gratification in the property deal with Avantha Reality Private Limited owned by Gautam Thapar at a much lesser price than the prevalent market price. The agency claimed that the property was purchased by Bliss Abode Private Limited for ₹90 crore where Mr. Kapoor’s wife is one of the directors. The agency claimed that that, no transparent process of sale of the charged property was initiated by the bank.

The ED claimed that the property was under mortgage with the ICICI bank for a loan of ₹350 crore and also with the DCB bank for a loan of ₹50 crore. The agency claimed that Kapoor had sanctioned a loan of ₹400 crore to the Avantha Reality Private Limited as lease rental discounting for 10 years. The agency told the court that the valuation of the property at the time of sanction was at ₹550 crore.

72,2020/03/17,"Coronavirus | MP wants railways, airlines to waive cancellation charges","Issue raised in Rajya Sabha by CPI(M)’s Elamaram Kareem; worth considering says Venkaiah

Rajya Sabha chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu on Monday asked the government to consider a suggestion by CPI(M) MP Elamaram Kareem for directing the railways and airlines to forgo ticket cancellation charges in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

“This suggestion is worth considering,” Mr. Naidu told the Leader of the House. “Because of the sudden closure of schools and other schedules, people are forced to cancel their programmes. So, let the airlines and the railways take note of this situation and see to it that no cancellation charges are collected. That is a suggestion by the Members. Please get it examined by the concerned Minister.”

Earlier, raising the issue, Mr. Kareem said many State governments had declared that educational and other institutions would remain closed till March-end and extension of even this period was likely.

“Similarly, some companies and manufacturing establishments have also rescheduled their manufacturing plan. On the apprehension of its rapid spread and as a precaution, many State governments have proclaimed a virtual ban on locomotion of people from one place to another. Accordingly, people are cancelling their travel plans,” he said.

Mr. Kareem wanted the government to intervene urgently. Several members concurred with him.

Later, during a short discussion on the issue, TMC’s Derek O’Brien highlighted the precautions to be taken. Sasmit Patra of the BJD said ATMs should be sanitised and capacity of testing labs must be increased.

Vikas Mahatme of the BJP, who said that NGOs and private practitioners should be roped in to address the situation, raised the issue of rumours being spread. The Chairman said the government and the Indian Council of Medical Research should issue clarifications.

Samajwadi Party’s Ram Gopal Yadav said there should be screening of visitors at the Parliament gates. AIADMK’s S.R. Balasubramoniyan asked if the government was willing to adjourn the Session in view of the outbreak. “They are very much interested in passing the Budget.

The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a petition filed by one of the Nirbhaya case convicts, Mukesh, for restoration of his legal remedies, including a curative petition, against his death sentence.

The four convicts in the case are scheduled to be hanged to death on March 20. Mukesh, through his counsel M.L. Sharma, said his earlier lawyer had coerced him to sign documents for vested political interests hatched in a joint criminal conspiracy.

The petition said: “Petitioner (Mukesh) is victim of criminal conspiracy and fraud played and hatched jointly by the R-1 (Ministry of Home Affairs), R-2 (Delhi government) and R-3 (Vrinda Grover) and other advocate who appeared in the Sessions Court, High Court and the Supreme Court in the petitioner’s death warrant case.”

The petition claimed the limitation period to file a curative petition was three years from the date of dismissal of the review plea. He sought to “restore” the rights available to him and allow him to file curative and mercy petitions till July 2021.

A Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra refused to entertain the plea, saying it was not maintainable. Mr. Sharma was finally allowed to withdraw with the court dismissing the case.

75,2020/03/17,Tobacco growers on edge as recession looms large,"Foreign players defer purchases due to coronavirus outbreak

Tobacco farmers in Prakasam and Nellore districts are on edge, with trade remaining lacklustre a month after the commencement of e-auctions in the traditional crop growing areas.

A global economic recession triggered by the outbreak of COVID-19 has added to the woes of farmers, who are already grappling with the fallout of unseasonal rains in January which has adversely affected the quality of the crop and productivity in the two districts.

The coronavirus outbreak could not have come at a more inopportune time for the farmers as overseas buyers are shying away from visiting the State to firm up export orders, according to a group of farmers.

Tobacco Board chairman Y. Raghunatha Babu attempted to allay farmers’ fears. “The foreign players do not want to travel now as COVID-19 has turned into a pandemic. They will definitely come visiting once the situation improves, and will lift the intended quantity,” he said during his visit to the auction platforms of Vellampalli, Ongole-I and Ongole-II.

The chairman impressed upon the growers to go for electric barns to ensure better curing of tobacco leaves with a view to get a better price for their produce.

While the domestic players have remained active, exporters have not turned up in full strength as yet, waiting for confirmation of orders from overseas buyers, according to sources in the Indian Tobacco Association.

A delegation from Korea has deferred its visit after the coronavirus outbreak. Unmanufactured tobacco is exported to Belgium, Korea, Nigeria and Egypt, among other countries.

“We are clueless on how to break even this year as little over two quintals of the produce per acre had pre-matured, leading to piling up of low grade varieties of tobacco,” farmers complained.

The farmers said that the Union Commerce Ministry should bail them out by offering a bonus price for low grade varieties, like how the then Union Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had intervened in the wake of a spate of farmer suicides during the 2014-15 Rabi season.

While the Tobacco Board put curbs on tobacco barns and imposed penalties on the growers for excess production, it did precious little to ensure them a remunerative price for them at the time of marketing, complained T. Ramanaiah, farmer leader from Kandukur.

FDI sought

Advocating foreign direct investment (FDI) in the tobacco sector, Ongole-II farmer leader V.V.Prasad said, “We are perplexed as to why FDI is not allowed in the tobacco sector when it is allowed even in the defence sector.”

Farmers can expect buyers to increase their purchases once the e-auctions are over in Karnataka, from later this month, according to Tobacco Board sources. The farmers have so far marketed 1.4 million kg of tobacco at an average price of ₹157.50 per kg in the Southern Black Soil (SBS) auction platforms, said SBS Regional Manager G. Umamaheswara Rao.

The buyers lifted 1.6 million kg of tobacco offering an average price of ₹154.19 per kg from the Southern Light Soil (SLS) auction platforms. The production of tobacco has been estimated at about 90 million kg in the SBS and SLS regions.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/xy9b8y/article31093665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-TOBACCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tobacco-growers-on-edge-as-recession-looms-large/article31093666.ece
76,2020/03/17,Coronavirus checkposts come up in Kurnool district,"Visitors to the Srisailam shrine to be screened at inter-State borders

District authorities have set up seven inter-State checkposts along the borders of Karnataka and Telangana as a precautionary measure to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Of the seven checkposts, five have been set up along the A.P.-Karnataka border while the other two have been set up on the A.P.-Telangana border.

These checkposts would be manned by both medical and health officers and police officers to monitor the health of the devotees visiting the Sri Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy temple in Srisailam to participate in the Ugadi Brahmotsavams to be held from March 22 onwards.

Collector G. Veerapandian said in a press release that a large number of devotees are expected to arrive at the Srisailam temple this year. Devotees trek all the way to the temple to participate in the Brahmotsavams.

Medical officers would screen the inter-State visitors and any person found with symptoms of coronavirus will be given two choices — either to return to their hometown or get themselves admitted to the isolation ward at the Kurnool Government General Hospital.

The Collector said that if a person having symptoms of coronavirus decides not to exercise any of the two options, he or she will be detained by the police and shifted to the GGH for treatment.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2c1k8a/article31093635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-COVIDCHECKPOST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-checkposts-come-up-in-kurnool-district/article31093636.ece
77,2020/03/17,ACB digs deep into UAV procurement scam,"We will submit report to MHA within stipulated time, says official

Officials of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) are probing the alleged irregularities in the procurement of Aerostat and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), in which then Additional DG (Intelligence) A.B. Venkateswara Rao was said to be involved.

The UAVs were allegedly procured at a cost of ₹25.50 crore under the Modernization of Police Forces Scheme (2017-18). Alleging that the senior IPS officer resorted to the scam, the State government had suspended him on February 8, and submitted a report to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA).

The government was using UAVs for surveillance in Maoist operations, red -sanders smuggling, elections, prevention of ganja cultivation and other activities in forests, cut-off areas and on the borders.

However, use of sub-standard equipment may put the police personnel in danger, and the misconduct of the suspended DGP may have given access to the secrets of the State posing a threat to the national security, the State government said.

Witnesses being examined

Stating that prima facie evidence was established on the irregularities in implementing the scheme, the MHA had asked the State government to take up a detailed investigation. Accordingly, the State government directed the ACB Director-General to conduct a thorough inquiry.

“ACB is investigating the matter in detail and is examining the agencies, officers and other witnesses in the UAVs’ purchase deal made with a foreign defence manufacturing company. Investigation officers are trying to collect necessary document and scientific evidence in the irregularities. The government would submit report to the MHA within the stipulated time for further action,” a senior police officer said.

Doubts over delay

Meanwhile, the delay in taking up investigation into the irregularities in which a foreign defence manufacturing equipment firm was involved, was raising many doubts. Police said Mr. Venkateswara Rao allegedly resorted to procedural and technical irregularities in procuring the Aerostat and UAVs.

The unanswered question in the multi-crore scam was why the government took about two years to identify the irregularities in the Intelligence department, which played a vital role in the Police Department in tracing and tracking criminals, Naxalites, and smugglers and provide security cover for many VVIPs and VIPs.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/acb-digs-deep-into-uav-procurement-scam/article31093621.ece
78,2020/03/17,High Court to hear only urgent cases,"Biometric attendance for staff to be waived temporarily

The Andhra Pradesh High Court has begun hearing only urgent cases in an effort to encourage social distancing in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

The HC Registrar General said in a notification that the court will consider only petitions for urgent hearing, bail and suspension of sentence.

Those with high body temperature will be denied entry into the HC and will be subjected to standard operating procedure prescribed by the Union Ministry of Health, and all necessary medical facilities will be provided, the notification said.

The notification said that parties related to pending cases may submit urgent hearing applications informing the other side if needed and in cases of expiry of interim orders, the advocates concerned can approach the Registrar (Judicial) and the court will decide on the urgency of the application. The hearing pattern would continue for at least two weeks.

The HC has also decided to take up precautionary measures to avoid mass gathering of advocates and the public on the premises. House-keeping staff have been instructed to sanitise all common areas including chambers, court halls, restrooms, corridors, Bar Association Hall, lunch room, tables, chairs and surfaces that see human contact, by using hypochloride solution.

The HC has also directed the Registry to seek deputation of two doctors and paramedical staff equipped with thermal screening guns from the government to screen people at the HC premises for symptoms of COVID-19 for at least three days initially.

Also, the HC would not insist on biometric attendance for the officers and staff and absentees will be considered as on duty. Meetings and functions in the HC premises are also not permitted.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/high-court-to-hear-only-urgent-cases/article31093613.ece
79,2020/03/17,Over 200 Indian students stuck in Kuala Lumpur,"Most of them hail from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana

Over 200 students from India are stranded in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, with the Government of India deciding to ban flights from several countries.

The students, hailing mostly from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, spoke to The Hindu on Tuesday evening, and said they were sent from Manila in Philippines as the number of COVID-19 cases was steadily increasing.

Harshina, a medical student who hails from Anantapur, was among the 200 students frantically trying to get on to a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Chennai. However, with the Indian government imposing a travel ban on many international flights, they were not allowed to board any flight. The students are now worried about their fate.

“We do not have any medical support in Manila and it is very costly there, so when the Philippines government gave us 72 hours to leave the country, we booked our tickets and landed in Kuala Lumpur in the early hours of Tuesday (IST) and are scheduled to leave for Chennai on a 9 p.m. flight,” Ms. Harshina said.

Another student Chetan Adury from Hyderabad told The Hindu over phone from Kuala Lumpur that they had contacted the Indian embassy and were pleading with the government to allow them to board flights to India. “Our documents are being verified in batches of 10 by the Kuala Lumpur immigration authorities and we hope they get a positive response from the Indian government,” said Mr. Chetan.

All of them made frantic calls to their loved ones in India, sending recorded video messages asking the Indian government to act fast and allow them to reach India as early as possible.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ujiprz/article31093596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-KUALALUMPURSTUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/over-200-indian-students-stuck-in-kuala-lumpur/article31093597.ece
80,2020/03/17,Poultry farmers feel the pinch as hoax messages play havoc,"Prices of broiler chicken and eggs crash in city as customers stay away fearing COVID-19

Hoax messages circulating on WhatsApp, warning people that they will contract the dreaded coronavirus if they eat poultry products, have led to prices of broiler chicken and eggs crashing in the city.

Retail outlets in the city did little business over the weekend, with even Sunday, the busiest day of the week, seeing no customers. There were little sales on Tuesday too, lamented retailers.

In some areas, retailers were seen taking live birds in vans to residential areas and selling them at ₹60 a kg.

Retailers in areas like Arilova and Yendada further reduced the price to ₹50 and ₹60 a kg, while some chose not to sell below ₹110 a kg despite a drop in footfalls.

“The price of broiler chicken at the poultry farms has dropped to around ₹10 from the normal price of around ₹80 a kg due to the coronavirus scare. We have asked all retailers in the city to reduce the price to around ₹50 a kg to regain the confidence of consumers,” Broiler Industry Welfare Association of Greater Visakha president Tatraju Adinarayana told The Hindu.

Netizens seem to be falling for the hoax messages despite assurances from the Government of India, Poultry Federation of India, National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) and other associations that eating poultry products has absolutely no link with coronavirus.

“We conducted a meeting on Tuesday to discuss steps will make consumers understand that eating chicken and eggs does not lead to coronavirus. We had asked the retailers to reduce the price, but most of them are unwilling to do so and are preferring to retain the live birds. We plan to conduct a meeting with all the retailers on Thursday to take stock of the situation,” Mr. Adinarayana said.

“The cost of feed will go up drastically if the birds are kept for long. Each bird has to be given about 120 gm of feed, which costs ₹3, every day. Feeding beyond a particular stage does not result in a proportionate increase in the weight of the hen. The birds attain the ideal weight in 42 days,” said Bharanikana Rama Rao, national trustee of NECC.

“The price of an egg dropped by 55 paise on a single day on Monday. A poultry farmer, who sells 1 lakh eggs a day, will lose ₹55,000. Reducing the price will enable at least the poor to consume more and create confidence among others,” Mr. Rama Rao said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wtez1w/article31093585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-CHICKEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/poultry-farmers-feel-the-pinch-as-hoax-messages-play-havoc/article31093586.ece
81,2020/03/17,SEC defends decision to postpone local body polls,"Will revisit the issue if coronavirus task force says there is no element of risk, he says

After being faulted by Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for postponing the local body elections and Chief Secretary (CS) Nilam Sawhney writing a letter urging him to revoke the orders, State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar sought to set the record straight.

In a reply to the CS, Mr. Ramesh Kumar asserted that the decision perhaps may fall under ‘moderate distancing protocol’ as per the guidelines to combat the spread of coronavirus.

“The health experts are of the view that India might have entered Stage-2! If the task force is able to categorically advise that after risk assessment permits holding elections in Andhra Pradesh, the SEC is prepared to readily revisit the issue before the 6-week postponement proposed,” he said.

Common pleading

In this three-page letter on Tuesday, the SEC said :“It would appear in retrospect that the Commission is needlessly faulted for acting just a day ahead than similarly placed States. Were the decision of postponement to be announced just a day later along with Maharashtra, West Bengal and Orissa, the scenario I am sure would have been different,” he said.

Reacting sharply to criticism that the SEC is ill-informed about the coronavirus threat and the financial implications for States, Mr. Ramesh Kumar said the SEC was neither alone nor ignorant. “SECs are a very informed and proactive group and some of the approaches I have suggested have emanated from our active information sharing platform.”

For the release of funds to local bodies (basic grants and performance grants), holding elections is one of the conditions. In the past, the State government was able to access successfully withheld funds after holding elections for the previous years as well. Since Andhra Pradesh is not alone in the present situation, the States, in a similar situation, can make a common pleading, he said.

Compressed schedule

The present election schedule is consciously evolved to complete the election process by March 31 to enable the State to make a case for accessing withheld 14th Finance Commission grant to local bodies. “Solely based on State’s comfort level, a compressed election schedule had been drawn up. This, however, had drawn flak from several quarters which I do not want to go into.”

Rebutting the allegations that the SEC did not consult the Medical and Health Department before taking a decision to postpone the elections, Mr. Ramesh Kumar asserted that putting any blame at the doorstep of the SEC was not proper. Understandably, the Health Department was busy and could not share any information or send any functionary with any data, he asserted.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sec-defends-decision-to-postpone-local-body-polls/article31093582.ece
82,2020/03/17,CUO laying thrust on modern research: Vice-Chancellor,"‘Industry-academia tie-ups also a priority area’

The Central University of Odisha (CUO), Koraput, is focused on encouraging modern research and industry-academia tie-ups.

To supplement the talent pool, the university will be hiring over 100 faculty members, according to its Vice-Chancellor I. Ramabrahmam.

In an exclusive interaction with The Hindu, Prof. Ramabrahmam has said that the university has over 30 programmes in the post-graduation, M.Phil and Ph.D courses, and efforts are on to make the courses more relevant to the mainstream industry.

“We are planning some programmes in sustainable development and public policy studies. An executive development programme in MBA for executives working in Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and NALCO are bring designed in an effort to inch closer to the industry,” Prof. Ramabrahmam has said.

As a part of its roadmap for the coming years, the university is keen on research in tribal issues in Odisha.

Tribal research

“We are proposing to set up a centre for tribal research with the help of the Government of India and the Government of Odisha. Tribal life, languages, lifestyle, highland agriculture, climate change and medicinal plants in the region will be studied. Lot of research had gone into cultivation of paddy and other crops in Koraput during the days of the Green Revolution. We also plan to revive it,” he says.

Commenting on the university’s ranking among the institutions of importance in the country, Prof. Ramabrahmam says that the CUO will be among top 100 in five years. At present, it figures among the top 200 in India.

To encourage quality of research and number of publications by the faculty members, the university offers attractive monetary incentives, he says.

Besides free Internet, the location and scenic beauty of the university at 1,000 metres above the sea level is an add on, he says.

Prof. Ramabrahmam also hopes that the conducive regulatory environment is expected to contribute to the much-needed expansion of the university at affordable cost.

“One proposal from the Central government to merge the national regulatory bodies such as AICTU, Bar Council, Pharmacy Council, and Council of Architecture will perhaps help universities seeking approvals from different bodies without delay. The decision will save time and financial resources,” Prof. Ramabrahmam says.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/yzbxjm/article31096200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJPG4-CUO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cuo-laying-thrust-on-modern-research-vice-chancellor/article31093567.ece
83,2020/03/17,"Now, have darshan in Tirumala without any wait","TTD introduces ‘time slot’ system as a preventive measure to check COVID-19

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has intensified its efforts to check the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) at the abode of Lord Venkateswara here.

With the Central government declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, and keeping in view the number of pilgrims visiting the hill temple (70,000 on an average), the TTD, besides taking up an extensive awareness drive on the preventive measures, took a major decision on Tuesday introducing the ‘time slot’ system for darshan of the presiding deity.

Under the system, the devotees are allowed to have darshan of the deity without the need to wait for their turn at the Vaikuntham complex.

The devotees are being asked to report at the complex only at the time specified on the ticket.

Counters opened

The decision was taken in the wake of the guidelines issued by the Health Ministry to avoid mass gathering and over crowding at a single point.

Fourteen counters were opened for the issuance of time slot darshan tickets at Tirumala – seven each at the Central Reception Office and RTC bus stand.

In Tirupati, the counters were opened at the Srinivasam and Vishnu Nivasam complexes, TTD choultries, and RTC and Alipiri bus stands.

At annadanam complex

At the Nitya Annadanam complex, where devotees are served food free of cost, only two persons were allowed to sit on each table against the normal four. The staff working in the complex were provided with face masks. They were also asked to periodically clean their hands with sanitizers.

The barbers (hair dressers) working in different shifts at the main Kalyanakatta building and other mini tonsuring centres were also provided with face masks and anti-septic lotions.

They were also asked to strictly maintain personal hygiene as well as cleanliness of the surroundings.

The reception wing was equipped with additional staff for sterilising the cottages and guest houses with disinfectants at least hour ahead of allotting them to the pilgrims.

These apart, members of the TTD health wing were spraying germicides and disinfectants once in every two hours at all vital places where congregation of pilgrims was large.

Control room

A round-the-clock control room with telephone number 0877-2263447 was set up at the health office to lend advice to the pilgrims on demand.

As a precautionary measure, first aid centres were also set up at all the vital points atop the temple town.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ldl4gp/article31093537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-TIRUMALAQUEUES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/now-have-balaji-darshan-without-any-wait/article31093538.ece

86,2020/03/17,Postponing local body polls not correct: MLA,"‘Country has been successful in controlling spread of COVID-19’

Postponement of elections to local bodies without discussing with the State government and not ascertaining its stand was not correct, said Narasaraopet MLA Gopireddy Srinivasa Reddy on Tuesday.

He told reporters along with YSRCP leader Koyya Prasada Reddy that the postponement of elections was unwarranted and it could be put off only when there was law and order problem. In an exigency like nominees not coming forward to file papers the polls could be put off, he said and described postponing in the name of COVID-19 was unfortunate.

Elections were postponed because of the conspiracy between TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu and State Election Commissioner N. Ramesh Kumar.

Stating that the country had been successful in controlling the spread of COVID-19, he said of the 92 suspected cases of COVID-19 only one tested positive in the State. The Epidemic Act 1987 was being implemented and rapid action teams were formed at the State and the Central level. He said 250 isolation beds in Visakhapatnam and 200 in Tirupati were made available. The government ordered all medical colleges to have 10 isolation beds each, he informed.

The MLA said Mr. Naidu was not justified in ridiculing the use of paracetamol. An expert from Christian Medical College, Vellore, as well as Kerala and Telangana Chief Ministers also spoke about use of paracetamol for treatment of the virus, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/postponing-local-body-polls-not-correct-mla/article31092028.ece

Parents from Visakhapatnam demanded closure of educational institutions over the possibility of spreading of COVID-19 virus. Though there are no positive cases in the region, a number of parents expressed their ire over the officials for running the institutions, especially schools, despite all parts of the State registering suspected cases. A few parents met the management of a few schools, here on Tuesday.

At present, government schools are running half-days, while most of the private schools are conducting full day classes. As a precautionary measure, many play schools have already announced closure of schools till March 31. Parents have been sending children with face masks on and classes are being organised amid COVID-19 scare.

“The Odisha government has declared holidays to schools after one positive case was reported. The officials here should also take a decision since it is a matter of children health,” said J. Murali, a parent from Isukathota.

Pointing out lack of proper preventive measures at many schools, several parents urged the Education Department officials to make sure all the school managements conduct thermal tests for the students while entering the school and also to supply sanitisers at the washrooms to prevent possible spread of flu.

All the Central Institutions in the city such as Indian Institute of Petroleum & Energy (IIPE) and IIM -Visakhapatnam, have declared holidays and closed their campuses and hostels till March 31. Indian Institute of Management (IIM) also cancelled its examinations and annual convocation. A private university at Rushikonda has also declared holidays till March 31.

However, private degree and engineering college managements have asked their students to come to college with face masks and to avoid travelling in packed buses.

Child Rights Protection Forum (CRPF) president G. Seetharam said that the CRPF is going to submit a representation demanding closure of schools to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Education Minister A. Suresh soon.

‘Fake messages’

A day after Andhra University management announced that it will run as usual by taking precautions, WhatsApp groups of many AU students were flooded with messages stating that the varsity has been shut down till March 31. According to the students, in the name of a ‘Important Circular’ from the V-C’s office, the messages have been spreading since Monday.

On Tuesday, Registrar V. Krishna Mohan appealed to students not to believe in such fake messages and made it clear that the varsity will run as usual. He also said that they would complain to the Cyber Crime police over the issue.

Meanwhile, members of the Student Federation of India (SFI) said that they would give representation to officials requesting to close the varsity.

Health officials on Tuesday categorically denied that a 70-year-old man, who had a travel history to the Middle East, tested positive for COVID-19 and was kept on ventilator.

Meanwhile, the number of suspect cases in the city have gone up to 25 with the admission of a new case in an isolation ward on Tuesday. The person is said to be a Belgian national and has been living in Atchutapuram area since last two years. He recently went to Belgium and returned.

All the 20 out of 25 cases, who have been kept in isolation wards at the Government Hospital For Chest & Communicable Diseases and the KGH and samples sent to the testing centres, have tested negative for COVID-19. But three out of them have tested positive for H1N1 (swine flu).

This was disclosed by the officials of Health Department here on Tuesday. However, the test results for the five other cases, including the one new case on Tuesday, are still awaited.

They said that 12 ventilators were kept ready and none of them was used so far.

“Since the symptoms for both COVID-19 and swine flu are almost similar, we have sent the samples for both tests. While it turned negative for COVID-19 for 20 cases, three tested positive for swine flu,” said Principal of Andhra Medical College and in-charge of the quarantine facility at Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) P.V. Sudhakar. “This indicates that H1N1 is still prevalent and we need to be extra cautious,” he added.

He informed The Hindu that 17 of them who tested negative for COVID-19 were discharged, but the three who tested positive for swine flu were moved from the COVID- 19 isolation ward to the swine flu ward. “They are all responding to the treatment and doing well,” he said.

In the city so far, about 8,000 people who have a travel history or have symptoms such as fever, cold, and cough were screened.

Out of them 135 were put on observation so far and 49 on home isolation.

VPT Deputy Chairman P.L. Haranadh scoffed at reports that a Chinese ship had been held up off Visakhapatnam port. He told reporters, who met him on Tuesday, that they made arrangements for quarantining crew members, if they were found with symptoms of COVID-19.

The port had earlier denied berthing to a Chinese vessel Fortune Hero for a couple of days and subsequently allowed it only after a health team from the port screened them for the virus and found everyone safe.

Mr. Haranadh said they formed three health teams to conduct various tests on the crew while at sea to find out if anyone of them had symptoms of COVID-19. The port has opened an isolation ward with 10 beds at Golden Jubilee Hospital. It has also made provision for quarantining for 14 days at a few quarters at Maharanipeta.

The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) on Tuesday dismissed a petition filed by IPS officer, A.B. Venkateswara Rao, challenging his suspension.

The tribunal which declined to set aside the order on March 7, dismissed Rao’s petition.

The State government had suspended Mr. Venkateswara Rao, a 1989 batch IPS officer in the rank of Director General of Police (DGP), on February 8, under Rule 3 (1) of All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1969.

Alleged breach of ethical code

The senior IPS officer was facing allegations of leaking critical information to an Israeli defence manufacturing company, RT Inflatables, by establishing a direct breach of ethical code of conduct under Rule 3 (a) of All India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968, to illegally award a contract to his son.

Venkateswara Rao worked as Additional DG (Intelligence) during TDP’s rule and as ACB Director General for a brief period. However, the present government has not given posting to the officer for the last few months.

Misuse of official powers

Alleging that the IPS officer had misused his official powers and wilfully disclosed intelligence protocols and procedures of the police to the foreign company, the State government had suspended him, which was confirmed by the Centre on March 7.

Subsequently, Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has asked the State government to file a charge sheet against the suspended DGP.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cat-dismisses-abv-raos-plea/article31089911.ece
91,2020/03/17,Call to take precautions to check spread of virus,"Awareness pamphlet on COVID-19 released

Leaders of various NGOs called upon people to take adequate precautions to check the spread of COVID-19, and not to believe rumours at an awareness programme, organised at the Gandhi statue near GVMC, here, on Monday.

An awareness pamphlet on ‘COVID-19’, brought out jointly by Praja Arogya Vedika (PAV), Jana Vignana Vedika (JVV) and Praja Arogya Parirakshana Committee and All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA), was released on the occasion.

They said that the number of COVID-19 cases in India was rising slowly but steadily, and the Union and the State governments should come up with strong measures to check its spread. Isolation wards should not be limited to hospitals at the district headquarters but be set up at the PHC-level. They also sought allocation of special budget, setting up of more testing labs, making drugs available and improvement of basic health infrastructure to control the spread of COVID-19.

They also demanded action against those spreading falsehood on COVID-19 through social media. The government should allocate budget for research on developing a vaccine for the virus.

The volunteers distributed pamphlets to bus passengers at RTC Complex and to passers-by at Asilametta and nearby areas.

PAV general secretary T. Kameswara Rao said that pamphlets would be distributed in all mandals and panchyats in the district to spread the message to the interior areas. They would be distributed to those visiting the King George Hospital (KGH) and at Anakapalle on Tuesday.

93,2020/03/17,"Simple measures will prevent spread of virus, say experts","‘Not everyone needs to wear a mask’

Worried about the scarcity of masks and sanitisers at medical shops and supermarkets in the city?

Relax. Not everyone needs to wear a mask. Only persons, affected by cough and cold, doctors, nurses and relatives attending to them, should invariably wear masks to prevent spread of the virus through droplets, when patients cough and sneeze, say doctors.

Healthy persons should, however, be alert and be aware of the precautions to be taken when they come in contact with sick persons. They need to wear masks, when travelling to other parts of the country, where COVID-19 positive cases have already been registered. “The government has now brought masks and sanitiSers under the Essential Commodities Act and hoarding by traders will invite penal action. We have asked traders to procure more stocks and put up display boards, mentioning the prices,” Assistant Director of Drugs Control Administration, K. Rajitha told The Hindu on Monday.

“Simple precautions like washing hands thoroughly with any toilet soap frequently, maintaining safe distance from others in public places, avoiding social gatherings and other measures as suggested by the government will go a long way in preventing spread of COVID-19,” says M.V.R.J. Somayajulu, a former Superintendent of KGH.

“Some people are going to the villages as schools have declared holidays. This will result in the spread of the virus to the rural areas also,” he says

“The scarcity of branded sanitisers has made some unscrupulous traders to manufacture them locally and passing them off as branded products. The sanitisers are being sold in 100 ml bottles with vague label information on the place of manufacture and ingredients, casting aspersions on its efficacy,” says a medical professional, who sought anonymity.

“Many patients are asking me where they could get masks and sanitisers. I tell them that everyone doesn’t need a mask. People coming from the specified countries are now being shifted straight from the airport to the quarantine centre at the Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) for observation, irrespective of their health condition. This will reduce the risk of spread of the virus,” says B. Ramachandra Rao, Associate Professor at the Government ENT Hospital. Three corona help desks, were set up by the GVMC, at the Dwaraka Bus Station (RTC) Complex to create awareness among bus passengers coming from different destinations. These desks, manned by four volunteers each, distributed pamphlets on the dos and don’t to check the spread of COVID-19.

The long wait for the test results of COVID -19, will soon come to an end, as the city will get its own testing centre shortly. This comes as a relief to those who have been kept on isolation under suspicion of carrying the virus, and awaiting the test results. The centre is coming up at Andhra Medical College in King George Hospital.

Till date the swab samples required for the test was being sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune or being sent to the virology lab of the Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, Tirupati. And at least two days was being wasted in transit time.

The city will have its own laboratory in the next 10 days and it was confirmed by the Principal of Andhra Medical College and in-charge of the quarantine facility at Visakha Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) P.V. Sudhakar.

Giving details, he said, “At present we have a virology lab in the Rajendra Prasad ward, but it is not sufficient and we do not have the required equipment for the COVID-19 test. Now we are shifting it to the annex building of Bhavnagar ward and have already ordered for the required equipment.”

According to Dr. Sudhakar, time is a crucial factor and the need of the hour is to get the test results as early as possible. Once we have the testing centre ready, then we can have the results in a day or two, he said.

The centre will be set up under the Department of Microbiology and it will have about six staff monitoring it round the clock.

Equipment

Indent have been placed for equipment worth around ₹1 crore which includes the key ones such as RT-PCR and bio-cabinet. With the setting up of the centre, results can be obtained for both COVID-19 and H1N1 (Swine flu), said Dr. Sudhakar.

97,2020/03/17,"Revenue collection on Customs duty, GST on expected lines, says official","‘COVID-19 may hit arrival of containers, bulk ships from China’

Notwithstanding the economy slowdown, the target set for Customs and GST during the financial year for Andhra Pradesh is likely to be achieved by March 31.

However, the COVID-19 threat which has led to shutdown of the factories in China impairing exports and imports may hit arrival of containers and ships carrying bulk cargo for sometime till the situation is improved.

Chief Commissioner, Customs, Central GST and Central Excise, Visakhapatnam Zone, Penumaka Naresh, told The Hindu on Monday that they had realised Customs revenue of ₹22,900 crore till February 29 as against the target of ₹26,567 crore. “We are nearing the target collection,” he said.

The revenue achieved last year was ₹22,567 crore. On GST front, as against a target of ₹15,101 crore, the department has realised ₹13,814 crore as against the last year’s ₹14,114 crore.

A target of ₹16,069 crore was fixed for collecting Central Excise this year compared to last year’s ₹12,572 crore. So far, ₹8,500 crore has been achieved. The Chief Commissioner admitted this year there could be a shortfall by about ₹3,000 crore mainly due to transfer of several products to GST and import of finished products by HPCL on account of preparation for ultra clean BS-6-compliant fuels.

The government has also realised import duties to the tune of ₹3,900 crore during the year due to dependence on sourcing of diesel and other petroleum products instead of importing crude from the Middle East.

Mr. Naresh disclosed that so far the impact of COVID-19 had not been felt on revenue realisation. “For the last few days there was a steep fall in goods coming from China. Exports to China have also fallen significantly. The affect could be overcome once fears over the spread of the COVID-19 come to an end,” he said while emphatically saying the trade and commerce would overcome the present situation after sometime.

98,2020/03/17,Vigilance sleuths to crack whip on shops selling masks at high prices,"‘We are going to conduct flash raids; violators will not be spared’

Though not a single positive case of COVID-19 has surfaced in Chittoor district so far, the scare has led to heavy demand for the face masks, with its price jumping manifold. A basic mask, which used to be priced below ₹10, is now selling at ₹60 at the medical stores, and other varieties are priced at ₹120-150 each.

The masks have become most sought-after, especially for people who make commute in buses and trains every day. For instance, close to 2,000 youth from tri-State junction Kuppam working in border towns travel by train between Chennai and Bengaluru and close to 1,000 government employees travel between Chittoor and Tirupati daily.

The medical shops of popular healthcare brands have stopped selling the masks, leaving the job to the local shops. With little or no takers for the masks in rural areas, the demand is mostly concentrated in urban areas.

It has come to the notice of officials that some private nursing homes in Chittoor district are forcing the visitors to purchase masks at ₹50 each before entering the wards.

Superintendent of Police (Vigilance and Enforcement) Rameshiah, while speaking with The Hindu, said: “No one should try to fleece those who purchase masks. In a couple of days, we are going to launch flash raids. Violators will be taken to task and cases will be booked against them.”

Uptick in demand for handkerchiefs

With the disposable masks being sold at exorbitant prices, people are forced to make masks of their own, following the guidelines on how to make the masks with handkerchiefs and tissue papers on social media.

The health-conscious people have opted for purchasing brand new kerchiefs to have their masks ready. “Since a fortnight, I have spent about ₹300 to get six masks for my two children. Now, I am happy to have the masks with handkerchiefs and I can use them any number of times,” said Prema Latha, a housewife at Sannidhi Veedhi at Srikalahasti.

The District Medical and Health Officer(DMHO), M. Penchalaiah said that it was true that there is acute shortage of masks in the district. “At this stage, the department is helpless to make any free supply of masks.

“The Finance Department will not agree to the proposal. They did not agree to [the idea of] two instalments either. Farmers are already coming forward to pay the principal amount,” the Minister said in the Legislative Council on Tuesday.

According to statistics given by the government, 75,904 farmers have defaulted on loans availed from Primary Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development banks, which now amounts to about ₹702 crore. While ₹336 crore remains the principal amount, the interest component is ₹366 crore.

Raising the issue, Janata Dal (S) member Marithibbe Gowda said farmers across the State have been affected by droughts and floods over the past few years and the 40-day window provided to them to repay the principal is too short. “Extend the deadline to September. Allow them to harvest crops and raise the principal amount. Otherwise, they will have to pledge gold or raise another loan to pay the principal amount,” he said.

Valley project by illegally drawing water from tanks by installing irrigation pump sets.

Participating in a debate on the issue, Congress members K.R. Ramesh Kumar and Krishna Byre Gowda alleged that it was not possible to fill up the tanks in Kolar district with treated water from Bengaluru under the project as farmers were illegally drawing water from the tanks. Mr. Ramesh Kumar became emotional while expressing pain over the project still not benefiting all farmers because of this issue.

Several members from the JD(S), Independent member Sharath Bache Gowda and Minister H. Nagesh, who is in charge of the district, too endorsed their views.

Replying to them, Minor Irrigation Minister J.C. Madhuswamy admitted that the government’s plan to fill 126 tanks in Kolar district through treated water from Bengaluru was yet to get completed though the project started 21 months ago as farmers were illegally drawing water.

So far, the government could fill up only 49 tanks and 93 check dams, the Minister said. Of course, the legal issues too had delayed the project, he added.

He declared that the government would now take stringent action against those illegally drawing water from tanks as it is against the Supreme Court’s guidelines.

Pointing out that the government was able to supply an average of 280 MLD of treated water, as against the commitment of supplying 440 MLD, he said efforts would be made to augment the supply in coming days.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3accxa/article31093837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGKRISHNABYREGOWDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/those-illegally-drawing-treated-water-from-kolar-tanks-to-face-action/article31093838.ece

The other person who tested positive for COVID-19 was a 45-year-old woman, who is a relative of the man who died.

The doctor served in a government facility and began a private practice after his retirement three years ago.

He visited the residence of the COVID-19 victim on March 6 and treated him.

Deputy Commissioner B. Sharat said that the doctor was kept in home-isolation after he also developed some symptoms of COVID-19.

“He will now be shifted to a quarantine ward in the government hospital. His family members and secondary contacts have been identified and home-quarantined,” Mr. Sharat said in a release. However, the DC did not reveal how many of the doctors’ primary and secondary contacts have been identified and quarantined.

No information has been released on when the doctor developed the symptoms and when his samples were sent for tests.

The 76-year-old man, who died and later his samples tested positive for COVID-19, was India’s first victim of the disease.

102,2020/03/17,"What wrong have we done to be denied Yettinahole water, asks BJP MLA","Masala Jayaram of the BJP on Tuesday told the Legislative Assembly that the farmers of Turuvakere constituency in Tumakuru would not give land for the Yettinahole project if the constituency is denied drinking water under the project.

Mr. Jayaram, representing the constituency, said he would lead the protest against the land acquisition for the project. A total of 52.28 acres of land has been notified for acquisition in the constituency.

Replying to Mr. Jayaram’s question, Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol said no water has been allocated to Turuvakere under the detailed project report. He said water would be given to the constituency only in case the project generates “surplus” water.

Irked by the reply, Mr. Jayaram shot back, “What wrong have we done to be denied water? Did we commit any mistake by giving land for the project?”

Under the project, water will be supplied to Koratagere, Madhugiri and Pavagada taluks, but not Turuvakere in the district. Mr. Karjol, replying on behalf of Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, said that since Turuvakere comes under the Cauvery basin, water would be provided to it under the Hemavati river project.

H. Halappa, Araga Jnanendra and other BJP members drew the government’s attention to the difficulties faced by people in registering revenue sites and obtaining/transferring khatas in villages included under town panchayats/city municipal councils/any other urban local body, and for houses constructed on forestland.

In their replies, Urban Development Minister B.A. Basavaraj and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C.

103,2020/03/17,"Why were six of seven mining licences given to JSW, Congress asks BJP government","The allotment of mining licence to JSW Steel Ltd. to take out iron ore in Ballari led to a war of words between the combined Opposition and the ruling BJP on Tuesday. Of the seven iron ore licences issued in Ballari through online tendering, six have gone in favour of JSW Steel.

P.R. Ramesh, who raised the issue in the Legislative Council, said, “How was the mining licence given to JSW? During the [rule of] Janata Dal (S)-Congress coalition, it was the BJP which raised the issue and tried to create an image that the coalition government had favoured JSW.” He said the BJP had then said they would not allow the licence to go to JSW despite the Supreme Court directions.

While Mines and Geology Minister C.C. Patil defended the grant of licence, as it was done under Supreme Court directions and through an online tendering process, Mr. Ramesh asked, “What has changed now? Was there no Supreme Court decision back then?”

When other JD(S) and Congress members entered the discussion, heated words were exchanged as the BJP members opposed their asking questions about an issue raised during Question Hour. Things heated up further when the Minister said, “Question should be asked in public interest, not vested interest.” The Congress members also accused the Minister of evading the question on the BJP’s stand.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/why-were-six-of-seven-mining-licences-given-to-jsw-congress-asks-bjp-government/article31093802.ece

Former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar said that the Lokayukta had become a toothless agency and there was a need to make it stronger to check corruption and lapses in administration. He suggested that the government bring out a comprehensive law to make the Lokayukta more effective.

105,2020/03/17,He had a bond beyond words with ‘Papu’,"Anyone who came to pay their last respects to Patil Puttappa (Papu) on Tuesday made it a point to pay their condolences to Syed Ali Khadarsab Naregal, who was next to the body. He had taken care of the veteran journalist for over 20 years, particularly after a fracture restricted him to a wheelchair.

Mr. Naregal, a native of Karajagi in Haveri district, helped Puttappa from the time he woke up till the the time he went to bed.

He began working for Puttappa in 1996, initially as a driver. He later became a family member of sorts and Puttappa often referred to him is his foster son. In fact, Puttappa would often jokingly say that he had become a “papu” (a child in Kannada) in the hands of Mr. Naregal, who would effortlessly carry him around, be it from the wheelchair to the dais or around the house.

While Puttappa was a crusader for Kannada and Kannadigas, his companionship had also made Mr. Naregal an advocate of Kannada. Often, Mr. Naregal would lecture those who visited his house about the need to preserve and promote Kannada, particularly if they handed him an invitation card printed either in English or Urdu.

During Puttappa’s hospitalisation that lasted over a month, and when the veteran journalist breathed his last, Mr. Naregal was with him.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/iht86w/article31093778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGSYED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/he-had-a-bond-beyond-words-with-papu/article31093768.ece
106,2020/03/17,Karnataka Vidyavardhak Sangha was Patil Puttappa’s first home,"The mortal remains of veteran journalist Patil Puttappa were kept on Tuesday on the Karnataka Vidyavardhak Sangha (KVS) premises in Dharwad, an organisation with which he had a five-decade-old association.

Puttappa, who was elected president of the Sangha first in 1967, created a record of sorts by getting re-elected till the end without any break. It was rare to see a man of his age heading the 130-year-old organisation. KVS played a key role in the freedom struggle, the State unification movement and several other movements related to Kannada and Kannadigas, and in the last five decades Puttappa’s name was synonymous with it.

His last re-election was in 2018. Undeterred by the efforts of some individuals to unseat him, Puttappa continued his winning streak. Writers such as Chandrashekhar Patil had to concede defeat against him. When in 2015, a political party tried to unseat him, the wheelchair-bound Puttappa foiled its efforts.

Even his opponents agree that but for Puttappa, KVS would not be what it is today. Puttappa was instrumental in safeguarding this institution during times of distress. Besides playing a leading role in agitations and movements on matters related to the State, language, land and the people, Puttappa also strived to nurture KVS into a hub of cultural and literary activities. The Horanadu Kannada Sammelana, a unique initiative and brainchild of Puttappa, has played a key role in organising Kannadigas living in other States and responding their grievances.

Basavaprabhu Hosakeri, an executive committee member of the Sangha, who had a two-decade-long association with Puttappa, summed it up thus, “Puttappa shaped and developed the Sangha, which is a representative body of the ethos of Kannada and Kannadigas. It is difficult to imagine the Sangha without Papu. For him, the Sangha was his first home; his own home came next. Despite being in politics, Puttappa had the rare character of going beyond politics in issues concerning society. For the same reason, the State used to look to him for advice on issues concerning land and language.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yg9nd4/article31093739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGPUTTAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-vidyavardhak-sangha-was-patil-puttappas-first-home/article31093740.ece
107,2020/03/17,Hubballi Bar association resolution on Kashmiri students disturbing: Karnataka HC,"The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday described as “disturbing” the contents of a resolution, passed by the Bar Association of Hubballi (BAH), describing three Kashmiri students as “anti-national” and having “committed [a] heinous crime”, even before the allegations levelled against them were proved in a court of law.

Observing that the criminal justice system in the country was not one of Kangaroo court trials, as the justice system gives fair trials even to foreign nationals involved in serious criminal offences, the court said that the learned members of the Bar association should not have termed the accused students criminals even before the trial.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi made these observations in its order disposing of a PIL petition, filed by a group of 24 advocates from Bengaluru. The petition had questioned the resolution passed by the BAH on February 15 asking its members not to represent the Kashmiri students, who were facing the charge of sedition for raising pro-Pakistan slogans.

As none of the lawyers came forward to take up the case of the accused Kashmiri students despite a suggestion made by the court, and it was advocates from Bengaluru who took up their bail pleas, the Bench said such conduct by Bar members was not healthy for the criminal justice system.

Meanwhile, the Bench decided not to go into the question of whether the February 15 resolution and subsequent violent scenes on the Dharward court premises amounted to criminal contempt of court, as the members of BAH had cooperated with the lawyers from Bengaluru to represent the accused students, besides withdrawing the resolution.

The Bench expressed hope that none of the Bar associations in the State will create a situation requiring the intervention of the High Court. It reminded all Bar members that it was their duty to ensure a fair trial for all accused persons.

The Bench also expressed hope that the Hubballi-Dharwad police would conduct “meticulously and with all seriousness” the investigation into the violence on the Dharwad court premises on February 24, while giving liberty to the petitioners to approach the High Court, if needed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hubballi-bar-association-resolution-on-kashmiri-students-disturbing-karnataka-hc/article31093702.ece
108,2020/03/17,Karnataka to consider amending Act to prevent IMA from treating investors as partners,"The State government on Tuesday assured the Legislative Assembly that it would examine the demand for amending the legislation concerned to ensure that investors are not cheated by being made out as partners in the multi-crore I Monetary Advisory (IMA) scam.

During to a debate on the scam initiated by Congress member Rizwan Arshad, who expressed concern about the promoters of the company cheating investors by presenting them as partners, Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy said the government would consider the suggestion of amending the Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments Act to safeguard the interests of investors.

Mr. Arshad and others expressed concern that the investors may not get back their deposits if they are treated as partners by the company. Many of them urged the government to take measures to return the deposits from the proceeds of the assets seized from the promoters of IMA.

To this, Mr. Madhuswamy said a notification had been issued through the Revenue Department to confiscate the property of IMA owners and directors worth ₹465.21 crore, but it was not possible, at this stage, to give back the deposits as the investigation was yet to reach its final stage. “Even now, we are receiving petitions from people saying that they have invested in IMA and demanding return of their deposits. We cannot begin the process of using the confiscated property to pay back depositors as the deadline for receiving petitions is not yet over,” he said.

He explained that such an appeal could be made before the High Court of Karnataka, which is looking into the issue, when the case reaches the final stage.

Replying on behalf of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, the Minister said a proposal had been sent to the Finance Department for utilising the services of Sakala call centres to the provide information to depositors through SMS.

Giving details about the case, he explained that the Central Bureau of Investigation had taken over the IMA scam probe on September 17, 2019, and updates on the inquiry were being submitted to the High Court on a regular basis.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-to-consider-amending-act-to-prevent-ima-from-treating-investors-as-partners/article31093690.ece

He took up his college education in Dharwad and became a law graduate in 1945.

Although he went to Mumbai to take up the legal profession, his interest in journalism brought him to Hubballi where he began working as an editor.

Mr. Puttappa then went to California, the U.S., for higher studies in journalism in 1949. On his return, he launched the Kannada magazine Prapancha in 1954. He then started Sangama, a digest, and then the daily Vishwavani in 1959.

He also served as Rajya Sabha member from 1962 to 1974. He became the president of the Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha, Dharwad, in 1967.

His work as president of ‘Kannada Kavalu Samiti’ towards the protection and the growth of Kannada is always remembered.

Known for his journalistic values, Mr. Puttappa also encountered controversies for his straightforward nature.

He is also remembered for his active participation in the unification of Karnataka and in the Gokak agitation.

Mr Puttappa could fluently voice his views both in Kannada and English and his impeccable memory till his days stunned many.

Many people paid their last respects to the mortal remains at his residence in Hubballi on Tuesday before it was taken to Dharwad where they were kept at the Karnatak Vidyavardhak Sangha for the public to pay tributes.

The birds located within the radius of one kilometre from the epicentre of the infection were identified and the culling of these birds as per the bird flu management protocol began. The trade of poultry had been banned in a radius of 10 km from the infected area until further notice.

The viscera samples of the two dead birds found in Kumbarakoppal area here tested positive for the bird flu (H5N1) and accordingly the operations to cull the birds in the infected area began on Tuesday under the supervision of the officials from the Department of Animal Husbandry.

According to the district authorities, 6,436 birds located within one km radius from Kumbarakoppal epicentre of the infection had been identified for culling. They include 5,100 poultry birds, 1,252 commercial birds, 254 pet birds, 12 quails, and 18 turkeys.

111,2020/03/17,"Chicken, eggs go off menu at Mysuru zoo","Bio-security steps increased with avian influenza confirmed in city locality

The Mysuru zoo that has a vast collection of birds has been on a high alert and has stepped up its bio-security measures after the bird flu (H5N1) was confirmed here.

Although it has been permanently on the guard against the avian influenza, it has doubled its safety precautions, intensifying surveillance of its birds and the migratory birds that visit its campus and also the Karanji Lake Nature Park that abuts its premises.

Safe food

As a safety measure, chicken and eggs had been taken off the menu and white meat has been replaced with beef.

For certain species of animals, including aquatic animals and small mammals, chicken bred at the zoo poultry under highly protected environment would be fed.

Zoo Authority of Karnataka (ZAK) Member Secretary B.P. Ravi told The Hindu that chicken had been withdrawn as a precaution.

Though chicken was procured in small quantities, it was the main food for some small carnivores.

Zoo Assistant Director and Chief Veterinarian K.R. Ramesh said the zoo was always under guard against bird flu, especially after the 2017 bird flu episode. But many safeguards had been in place much before the outbreak reported three years ago.

“There has been no compromise on the bio-security steps. Whether there is bird flu or no flu, these measures are permanent fixtures and complied with utmost care.” he said

Advisory heeded

The bird flu outbreak reported in Kumbarkoppal is far away from the zoo premises. Once the culling of birds in the infected area was done, the virus spread was contained.

Yet, the advisories issued in this direction are complied with.

Dr. Ramesh said chicken was sourced from a regular vendor but it has been withdrawn to prevent risks. For animals that rely on chicken, the bird bred in our poultry was sourced. Animals weighing less than five kg, such as leopard cats, would be fed beef. Chicken had been withdrawn to tigers too.

Disinfection

Three rounds of disinfection had been done at the zoo since November last year after migratory birds started arriving and breeding in and around the water bodies. The e disinfection was done intensively after the reports of bird deaths here recently.

“Keeping in view the COVID-19 scare, whatever steps needed for sanitising the areas frequented by the public including railings and viewpoints had been disinfected. The zoo closure helped us to carry out all these measures with more intensity,” he added.

Compartments

Mr. Ravi said the birds at the zoo had been compartmentalised for preventing infections, separating sensitive birds from the rest.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/d3j8h2/article31093299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MYSAVIARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/chicken-eggs-go-off-menu-at-mysuru-zoo/article31093300.ece

115,2020/03/17,Shadow of uncertainty over trekking expedition,"COVID-19 has cast its shadow on the trekking expeditions organised by a Mysuru-based adventure sports foundation. The Mysuru-based Tiger Adventure Foundation, which has been organising trekking expeditions to different regions in the country including forests, beaches and Himalayan mountain ranges since the last two decades, had planned one such expedition to Chandrakhani Pass in Himachal Pradesh from April 16 to 26.

But, poor response from trekking enthusiasts and the travel advisories issued by authorities has put organisers in a dilemma. “We are keeping our fingers crossed. If the situation eases by then, we may go ahead. If not, we will abort the expedition,” said D.S.D. Solanki of the foundation.

“We have been organizing trekking expeditions for the last two decades, but have not across such a situation”, he added.

The foundation had organised a total of 47 trekking expeditions to the Himalayas in the last 20 years, taking hundreds of people from not only Mysuru, but also different parts of Karnataka and the country, to exotic locations.

“We received 40 entries for an expedition to Chandrakhani Pass last year. But, this year, only four persons have shown interest so far”, he said. “Though we have booked flight tickets for the four trekkers, we have not collected the remaining amount towards accommodation, transport and other expenses. We may be forced to cancel the expedition and ask for a refund of the tickets,” said Mr Solanki, adding that travel agencies and the airlines had not responded to their requests for refunding or rescheduling the flight.

The Foundation has also planned a trekking expedition to Kedartal in Gangothri region of Uttarakhand from May 22 to June 1. But, Foundation is hoping for the situation to return to normal so that their planned trekking expedition to Uttarakhand is not disturbed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shadow-of-uncertainty-over-trekking-expedition/article31092957.ece

119,2020/03/17,"Karnataka: Even as schools remain closed, DPI issues timetable for teachers","While large number of professionals have been told to work from home, the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has issued a timetable that teachers of primary and high school should follow till March 31. The move has drawn flak from the teachers.

This comes after the State government announced summer vacation for all primary students and asked schools to defer examination for classes seven, eight and nine. The timetable has been chalked out for all teachers of government and aided schools who are not posted for SSLC examination duty.

Incidentally, while the State government has asked people to practice social distancing, DPI has asked teachers to conduct a meeting with the School Development Monitoring Committee (SDMC) and finalise an education plan for schools. Some of the other tasks they have been asked to do for the next two weeks includes formulating a three-year-plan for the school based on assessment of resources.

The teachers have also been told to finalise an academic plan for the 2020-2021 academic year. They have been asked to come up with a teaching solution for students after analysing the learning outcomes of students based on the assessment. They have also been asked to set a question paper before the bridge course begins.

The teachers have also been asked to sort out books for the library and sports items as well. They have been asked to prepare teaching aids and take up initiatives to beautify the school.

In addition to this, the circular also points out that teachers should brainstorm on what they will do on two Saturdays in a month that are bagless days. They have also been asked to frame content for the road safety and civic lessons. They have also been asked to plan extra curricular activities and take stock of the godown, come up with a waste management plan, identify and ensure that minor repair works for the schools are completed along with the SDMC and the locals.

Manjunath H.K., president of the Karnataka State High School Assistant Masters’ Association said, “Is the health of the teachers not important? Many of our teachers travel nearly 30 kms to reach school. They also use public transport to get to school. When the government has asked people to stay at home and stay safe, it should apply to our teachers as well,” he said.

Another primary school teacher said that most of the planning could be done from the comfort of their homes as well. “These are things we always plan and do not need officials to chalk out a timetable for us,” she said.

Department officials however said that the timetable has been planned after much deliberation.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-even-as-schools-remain-closed-dpi-issues-timetable-for-teachers/article31090461.ece

125,2020/03/17,Patil Puttappa passes away at 99,"‘Papu’ was a flagbearer for Kannada

Veteran journalist and Gandhian Patil Puttappa, better known as ‘Papu’, passed away here on Monday night after a brief illness. He was 99.

A journalist par excellence, writer, khadi activist, and a former Rajya Sabha member, Mr. Puttappa was a strong voice of Kannada and Kannadigas throughout his life. Mr. Puttappa was hospitalised about a month ago and had recently undergone a minor surgery at the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences. Although he recovered and was responding to treatment, his health deteriorated in the last couple of days.

Recipient of several awards, including the Karnataka Rajyotsava Award, T.S.R. Award, and “Nadoja’, Mr. Puttappa was born at Kurubagoda village in the then undivided Dharwad district (now, Haveri district) to Siddalingappa and Mallamma.

During his school days he was influenced by the freedom movement and fondly remembered Mahatma Gandhi’s pat on his shoulder during his visit to Byadgi. The village boy then had his college education in Dharwad and became a law graduate in 1945. Although he went to Mumbai to take up legal profession, his interest in journalism brought him to Hubballi.

Mr. Puttappa then went to California for higher studies in journalism in 1949. On his return, despite not having a solid financial backing, he went on to launch Kannada magazine Prapancha in 1954, which soon became popular. He then started Sangama, a digest, and then the daily Vishwavani in 1959.

He also served as Rajya Sabha member from 1962 to 1974. He became president of Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha, Dharwad, in 1967 and was re-elected to the post for a record number of times. His work as president of ‘Kannada Kavalu Samiti’ towards protection and growth of Kannada is always remembered.

Known for his journalistic values, Mr. Puttappa also courted controversies for his straightforwardness. He is remembered for his active participation in the unification of Karnataka and in the Gokak agitation. Mr. Puttappa could fluently voice his views both in Kannada and English and was known for his sharp memory. Always a strong critic of the ruling dispensation, he never hesitated to call a spade a spade. Mr. Puttappa was always there for the cause of Kannada, and has penned over 50 works.

Several leaders, including Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, had met him in hospital recently and Mr. Yediyurappa had announced the ‘Basava Award’ to the veteran journalist. In fact, the official presentation of the award was to take place at the hospital on Tuesday.

Mr. Puttappa is survived by a son and two daughters. The funeral will take place at Puttappa’s native place Halageri in Haveri district on Tuesday afternoon.

A host of political leaders have mourned his death.

129,2020/03/17,COVID-19 | Cough Corners to cut off airborne infection at source,"Units help protect health-care professionals and others from hospital-acquired infections

In any infectious disease outbreak, it is the front-line health-care personnel who are at the highest risk and who need to be protected. In the case of airborne infections, health-care personnel who work in emergency wing are particularly at risk.

There is new evidence that SARS-nCoV 2, the pathogen that causes COVID-19, though primarily a droplet infection spread through close contact, can also be aerosolized. This means that in certain conditions the virus has the capacity to remain suspended in air, infecting anyone who might pass through the cloud of particles.

The “cough corners” started in most government hospitals last year, as part of a major initiative to check the transmission of airborne diseases such as TB and H1N1, have more relevance now than ever. The name, cough corners, might be a misnomer as these are in fact infection control (IC) help desks set up as a separate counter in a well-ventilated area near the entrance to the hospital, where all patients coming in are screened for respiratory symptoms and then cared for separately.

“Airborne infection control in all hospitals was an initiative launched last year. The idea is to identify a person coming into a hospital with a respiratory infection immediately so that other patients and visitors to the hospital are not exposed to a new infection,” a senior Health official said.

After screening, the patients will be briefed about respiratory hygiene, the importance of hand washing and will be provided a mask or a tissue.

These patients should be separated in a well-ventilated waiting area or seated away from immunocompromised persons.

Fast track

A person with suspected infectious respiratory disease should be fast-tracked or allowed to jump the queue and see the doctor ahead as this will minimise the time he/she spends inside the hospital. A number of government hospitals and private hospitals have already adopted the concept.

Incidentally, it was Kerala’s first brush with Nipah virus (NiV) in 2018 that brought up the importance of reducing the transmission of airborne diseases inside hospitals and the necessity of adequate infection control practices in health facilities, so that hospitals do not turn out to be the potential sources of infection.

The epidemiological analysis of 2018 Nipah outbreak had revealed that except for the index case (the first icase to be documented), the rest were all due to nosocomial transmission at three different hospital settings. Of the 23 cases of NiV reported, 18 persons (who were patients, health-care personnel or visitors) had contracted it from two hospitals where the index case had been admitted. Apart from the lack of personal protection measures such as masks or gloves, crowded hospital environment and ill-ventilated settings were what had fuelled disease transmission.

On the other hand, those hospital workers or patient companions who had used masks and gloves did not contract NiV, despite coming into close contact with the index case.

IC help desks should have all information material on display as well as proper signages and provide hand sanitisers. “All hospitals need these kind of cough corners because one would be cutting off the infection at the source and protecting health-care workers and others. They should be incorporated into infection-control practices as one component of Standard Precautions,” an official said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/li92dv/article31093741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvcoughcorner750cc3eb-e045-44b9-85d0-6603f444c473,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-cough-corners-to-cut-off-airborne-infection-at-source/article31093742.ece

Seven nursing students came from Telengana and three paramedical students from Kalaburagi were sent to safe quarantine at their homes on Tuesday. So far, 36 persons have been discharged from isolation wards at various hospitals in the district.

Presently, 22 persons, including the five infected persons from Aythala in Ranni, have been placed under isolation at various hospitals.

Religious leaders’ meet

The Collector has urged leaders of different religious faiths not to include more than 10 persons in religious functions as part of the ongoing anti-COVID-19 drive. He was addressing an emergency meeting of religious leaders convened at the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium at Pramadom, near here, on Tuesday.

The religious leaders should also explore the possibility of conducting prayer sessions online, he said. District Medical Officer A.L. Sheeja said cleanliness and improved sanitation was of prime importance to keep the virus at bay.

131,2020/03/17,Next two weeks crucial: Collector,"A key NRI pocket, Pathanamthitta should practise effective quarantine norms

“Next two weeks are crucial in terms of our fight against COVID-19,’’ says P.B. Noohu, District Collector of Pathanamthitta that has become the epicentre of the second spell of the COVID-19 crisis in the State from where the first five cases were reported 10 days ago.

Mr. Noohu told The Hindu that Pathanamthitta had got a sizeable Non-Resident Indian (NRI) population spread across the globe. The wild spread of COVID-19 in Europe, China, America, and various other parts of the world was leading to an unprecedented influx of Indians, especially students and senior citizens, to their home country, from these affected areas. Kerala, particularly Pathanamthitta that has been identified as a key NRI pocket, had started receiving a good number of fellow citizens from different parts of the world over the past week.

“The success of our ongoing anti-COVID-19 drive is heavily dependent on ensuring absolute quarantine of all these people for a minimum period of 14 days, the incubation period of the virus, from their date of arrival,” he said.

Mr. Noohu said that all those who were returning from abroad should be treated as potential threat. Many people who have been tested positive for COVID-19 were those who came from the affected countries.

From other countries

The three Italian residents who returned to their home village of Aythala in Ranni and their two close relatives were the first five cases tested positive in the second spell of COVID-19 outbreak in the State. India’s first COVID-19 casualty was an elderly person who returned to his native place of Kalaburagi from Saudi Arabia. Another person, who came to Pune from Dubai, was the second casualty. Hence, any of these people could become a potential threat, once anyone of them was tested positive, he said.

“Our major concern is that, presently we have got a large crowd outside who came from various disease-hit countries. The success of our ongoing disease prevention drive is heavily dependent on how far we will be able to ensure effective quarantine of these people for the next 14 days,” he said.

Mr. Noohu sought wholehearted cooperation of all those who have returned from abroad and their contacts to strictly comply with the quarantine norms in the larger interests of society.

Ward-level committees

Mr. Noohu said that ward-level sanitation committees, comprising ASHA workers and a few police personnel headed by the local body member concerned, had been constituted in all 920 panchayat-municipal wards in the district to ensure effective quarantine of all those placed under quarantine at homes.

He said the community as a whole, including those who had been quarantined, had got a definite role to play in making the ongoing anti-COVID-19 drive a big success, he said.

Call centre

Mr. Noohu said the call centre opened at the Collectorate interacted with the quarantined people over phone, ensuring their well-being and welfare on a daily basis.

A 60-member team, comprising engineering students, National Health Mission volunteers, and doctors, is running the call centre.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f1fkjr/article31093723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvpt-noohu11,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/next-two-weeks-crucial-collector/article31093725.ece
132,2020/03/17,Fishers to press for razing resort,"Implementation of SC order to demolish Kapico

The Kerala Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi (TUCI) will organise a convention demanding the implementation of the Supreme Court order to demolish the Kapico resort, illegally constructed by Kapico Kerala Resorts Private Limited, on Nediyathuruthu island in Vembanad Lake.

The convention will be held at Panavally, near here, on April 19.

Petitions

Vedi president Charles George said here on Tuesday that petitions had been submitted to the Chief Secretary and District Collector for razing 54 cottages built by Kapico.

Vembanad Lake has shrunk to 12,000 hectares from 42,000 hectares in 50 years and action should be taken against illegal constructions.

Environmentalists, fishermen organisations’ leaders and others would attend the convention.

The Supreme Court on January 10, 2020 observed that the constructions had violated coastal and environmental regulations.

In 2007, Kapico bought the 11.5-acre island and constructed 54 villas and a main block over a period of six years.

The project, however, changed the life of fisher families in the area after licensed stake nets were removed for the construction of the resort.

After the families lost their livelihood, they filed a petition in a local court in Cherthala in 2008 demanding that the villas constructed in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Act on the island be demolished.

The petition also sought damages and restoration of nets. However, the initial plea was dismissed.

A long-drawn legal fight ensued. The vedi and others impleaded in the case. In 2013, the Kerala High Court ordered the demolition of the Kapico resort along with the illegal structures constructed by Vaamika Resorts on Vettila Thuruthu, also in Vemband Lake, in 2013.

This was challenged by Kapico in the Supreme Court.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fishers-to-press-for-razing-resort/article31093711.ece

134,2020/03/17,"More monkey deaths in Thrissur, KFD ruled out","Disease among Bonnet macaques claims 11 animals

A disease is spreading among the Bonnet macaque population in Vadakkanchery, near Thrissur, claiming 11 animals so far.

Two animal deaths were reported on Monday. Though it was initially suspected that the monkey deaths were due to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), which could be transmitted to human beings by ticks found on monkeys, the samples tested negative at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The test results from the NIV were obtained on Monday and the cause of death was not KFD as apprehended. The cause of disease needed to be investigated further, said R. Jayachandran, Chief Disease Investigation Officer, Chief Disease Investigation Office, Palode.

Suspicion

Veterinary experts suspect that a sexually transmitted disease might have broken out among the monkey population. All the dead ones were found to be females in the breeding age group. Post-mortem reports indicated that all the dead animals had uterine infections, said David Abraham, assistant forest veterinarian, Thrissur. An alpha male, which would have mated with the females, might have spread the disease among the population. There were around 15 to 20 members in the group and a few of them were exhibiting signs of being sick and inactive, he said. The deaths were reported at Vallalthol Nagar grama panchayat, near Vadakkanchery.

Forest officials in the area had been alerted and they would look out for any animal deaths, said A. Ranjan, Divisional Forest Officer, Thrissur. The carcass was burned after post-mortem.

Meanwhile, forest veterinarians have sought the clearance of the Chief Wildlife Warden, Kerala, to capture the sick animals and to keep them under observation. The monkeys had to be caught using butterfly nets as done in the case of street dogs. Tranquillisation of the animals was not advisable as the darted ones could escape to the interior forest and die there, said a forest veterinarian.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6vyxs1/article31094253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tv-monkeycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/more-monkey-deaths-in-thrissur-kfd-ruled-out/article31093704.ece

The police on Tuesday arrested three persons who had been exonerated by a POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) court here in the sensational Walayar death case of two minor sisters.

Valiya Madhu, Kutti Madhu, and Pradeep Kumar were rearrested following an order by the High Court on Monday. They were produced before the POCSO court here on Tuesday and were released on bail. The police said they were searching for the fourth accused Shibu, who has gone missing.

The case that followed the death of two minor sisters of a Dalit family at Attappallam, Walayar, on different occasions had acquired much sensation and national media attention when the POCSO court here exonerated the four accused. The police and the prosecution had failed to prove the charges of rape and murder in the case.

The State government was forced to approach the High Court seeking a reinvestigation in the case after pressures from various sides mounted.

A tense situation prevailed at Nagampadom Junction in Kottayam on Tuesday when a section of wayside vendors resisted an eviction attempt by the civic authority.

The episode began to unfold by 4 p.m. when the Health Department officials of the Kottayam municipality launched an eviction drive. The action followed a unanimous decision to this effect, made by the municipal council earlier in the day.

The vendors, caught unawares by the surprise drive, resorted to a protest and even attempted to physically prevent the civic officials from discharging their duty. Unable to proceed, the police were called in and the drive resumed soon after a police team reached the spot.

A survey carried out recently had identified over 230 wayside encroachments in and around the Kottayam town.

MVD letter

Earlier last month, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) had sent letters to the Kottayam district administration and the municipal chairperson to clear off the wayside encroachments and classify the Kottayam municipal area into vending and non-vending areas.

Pedestrian safety

According to the department, the presence of unauthorised shops along all major streets of the town severely affected the safety of pedestrians.

Besides encroaching on the public space, they have deprived the pedestrians of the footpaths, forcing them to walk on the roads near the Seematti Round, the Thirunakkara bus station, and the junction where the Kurian Uthup road meets Sasthri Road.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nagampadom-eviction-drive-triggers-protest/article31093679.ece

The Central Jail, Kannur, and Open Prison at Cheemeni, Kasaragod, have started manufacturing protective masks to meet the growing demand, in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak in the State.

According to Kannur Central Jail Superintendent Babu Raj, there is huge shortage of masks in the State. He said the Kerala Medical Services Corporation has placed an order to manufacture one lakh reusable protective masks. The prison units have so far been able to manufacture about 1,000 such masks and have supplied it. There is also a huge demand for single-use masks. The Kannur airport authorities have purchased about 600 such masks on Monday. Orders for over 1,000 masks had been placed by the Kannur District Medical Officer’s office, he said. Single-use masks are being sold at the counters for ₹4, he said, adding that reusable masks were not for sale.

Mr. Raj said materials for reusable masks were being supplied by a company in Aluva, while those for single-use masks were purchased locally. About 40 prisoners, who were trained by the company, and a doctor from Sree Avittom Thirunal Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, are engaged in manufacturing masks.

Since there are only 15 machines, there are hurdles in fulfilling all orders immediately, he added.

Meanwhile, at the Cheemeni Open Prison, the process to manufacture masks began on Monday. Reusable masks would be manufactured and about six prisoners have been employed for the work, said Jail Superintendent Ashokan Arippa.

He said they were planning to hand over reusable masks to the Health Department. The Rotary Club, Payyanur supported the initiative by supplying cotton cloth, he added.

Mr. Arippa said there were also plans to manufacture hand sanitisers. The support of the Drugs Control Department would be sought to get raw materials.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prisoners-in-kannur-kasaragod-make-masks/article31093584.ece
148,2020/03/17,Thangal quotes to be on show at Arakkal Palace,"Arakkal, Thangal families have maintained close ties for over three centuries

The Sayed Shihab International Summit held in Dubai last week witnessed the release of a specially designed art frame containing quotations from late Sayed Mohammedali Shihab Thangal, former State president of the Indian Union Muslim League.

The special art frame titled “Shihab Wise Frame” was handed over to the Arakkal family of Kannur considering the relations between the Arakkal and Shihab families. Conceived as part of a “visibility outreach” project of the Shihab Summit, the Shihab Wise Frame will now hang on the walls of Arakkal Palace, Kannur.

Kerala Muslim Cultural Centre (KMCC) national president Puthur Rahman handed over the art work to Siyad Arakkal Adiraja, who accepted it on behalf of the Arakkal dynasty head Adiraja Mariyumma alias Cheriya Bikkunhu Beevi.

Apart from Arakkal family members Musa Adiraja and Shurabeel Adiraja, KMCC leaders P.K. Anwar Naha, Chemmukkan Yahumon, P.V. Nasar, K.P.A. Salam and R. Shukkur attended the function. Mujeeb Jaihoon, whose hugely popular coffee table book on Shihab Thangal titled “Slogans of the Sage” had been instrumental in spurring the Shihab Wise Frame, also attended the function.

Delineating the historic link between the Arakkal dynasty and Sayed Shihab Thangal family of Panakkad, Mr. Anwar Naha said that both families had maintained strong and close relations ever since the Sayed Shihab family immigrated from Hadhramaut in Yemen to Valapattanam in Kerala three centuries ago.

Sayed Hussain Thangal, belonging to the 33rd generation of Prophet Mohammed’s descendants, married a woman named Khadeeja from Arakkal dynasty. Breaking away from the matrilineal custom, the couple left the palace and chose to settle elsewhere.

Their son, Sayed Muhdhar Thangal, reached Panakkad near Malappuram and settled there, laying the foundation for one of the most reputed Thangal families in Kerala now.

“The Shihab Wise Frame will add glitter to the age-old Arakkal-Shihab family connection. It will definitely give a new experience to the visitors reaching the Arakkal Palace, home to the only Muslim royal family in Kerala,” said Mr. Anwar Naha.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vsahai/article31093382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvmpm-Shihab-Thangal-Art,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/thangal-quotes-to-be-on-show-at-arakkal-palace/article31093383.ece
149,2020/03/17,Wayanad on high alert against COVID-19,"Twenty teams deployed at 10 checkposts on State’s borders with TN, Karnataka

The District Health Department has intensified preventive measures, including checking of vehicles at the State border, to tackle the spread of COVID-19 in the district.

District Medical Officer R. Renuka told The Hindu that 20 teams had been posted at 10 checkposts on the Kerla-Tamil Nadu and Kerala-Karnataka borders to check the travellers. Each team consists of officials of the department of health, police, excise, forest, transport, and volunteers from various NGOs.

The teams would work in two shifts a day. They checked 8,597 persons who were travelling in 2,578 vehicles on Monday and Tuesday, Dr. Renuka said. Of these, four persons were identified as fever patients and admitted to various government hospitals in the district, she said.

Meanwhile, the district administration has directed the Kudumbashree Mission to make 10,000 masks for the district. The district administration has also published pamphlets in three foreign languages

such as French, German and Spanish as well as six Indian languages on the preventive measures to be taken against the spread of COVID-19 for tourists who visit the district.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wayanad-on-high-alert-against-covid-19/article31093373.ece
150,2020/03/17,First COVID-19 case detected in Mahe,"68-year-old woman tests positive

A 68-year-old woman in Mahe, who returned from Saudi Arabia, tested positive for COVID-19 on Tuesday.

The health department officials said the woman, a resident of Palur Kunhipuramukh, had visited the country for Umrah. Her samples turned positive during the second test at the Alapuzha Virology Lab. Earlier, the primary test at the Kozhikode Beach Hospital had confirmed COVID-19.

Preventive steps

With the confirmation of the disease, the health department has prepared the route map and has started preventive measures, said Dr. S. Premkumar, Deputy Director, Health Department.

Following her visit to Saudi Arabia, the patient first visited the Rajiv Gandhi Ayurveda Medical College at Chalakkara.

The hospital referred the case to Mahe Government General hospital.

After she showed the symptoms of COVID-19, the relatives showed reluctance to admit her to hospital and brought her back to the house.

However, later that night, the police with the support of health department officials, shifted her to the isolation ward of the Mahe Government hospital for observation.

60 under observation

With the case turning positive, 60 persons have come under observation in Mahe. The officials said that the patient had contacted their neighbours and relatives after returning from the trip. The doctors and staff at the Ayurveda Hospital who came in contact with the patient are also under observation.

Arrangements

Necessary steps, including arranging of separate wards, ambulance to carry COVID-19 patients, masks and gloves for the hospital staff had been arranged, the health department said.

151,2020/03/17,State tasks police to enforce anti-COVID-19 norms,"Social distancing, quarantine and self-isolation to be monitored strictly

The State government has tasked the police to monitor COVID-19 cases unobtrusively and lookout for infected persons who leave their premises without informing authorities. Those currently under police surveillance include COVID-19 infected persons in hospitals, hostels and homes.

Law enforcement is also keeping a tab on those are believed to have been exposed to infected persons. There are a significant number of persons under quarantine or self-imposed isolation. The government has made social distancing an enforced policy.

Cases of people skipping isolation, including a batch of foreigners who boarded an aircraft in Kochi unchallenged, had prompted the government to call upon the police to implement the plan. The administration has also asked the police to limit social mixing until the epidemic threat receded proactively.

The decision had resulted in the belated arrest of television reality star Rajith Kumar at Attingal here on Tuesday on the charge of having endangered public health by organising a reception outside the Cochin international airport by his fans. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had called the television personality’s act a “challenge to the people”. The State could ill-afford such slip-ups that incrementally strain its finite resources, he had said.

The police have asked beat officers to visit homes where infected persons or those suspected of exposure to the virus are in residence and report on their well-being.

Meanwhile, the law enforcement has come under criticism from the Opposition for giving mandated anti-epidemic safeguards and other measures the go-by.

Congress charge

Congress State chief Mullappally Ramachandran slammed State Police Chief Loknath Behera for not going into isolation after he and another bureaucrat returned after a visit to London, an epidemic hotspot. He said Mr. Behera had chaired meetings and gone about business as usual without any testing. Mr. Ramachandran demanded an explanation from Mr. Vijayan.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fdj5pe/article31094244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TVKICORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-tasks-police-to-enforce-anti-covid-19-norms/article31092365.ece
152,2020/03/17,Routine health campaigns take a back seat,"In the battle against COVID-19, steps to counter seasonal infections have slackened

The health apparatus seems to be feverishly trying to slow down the possible community-level spread of COVID-19 infection in the State in the coming weeks. This has, however, reportedly slackened routine immunisation campaigns as well as preventive steps to counter seasonal infections such as dengue fever.

According to experts, the COVID-19 infection could spread at three levels. At the first level, it will affect only those who had visited infected countries. Those who had been in touch with them, termed as primary contacts, stand a chance of getting the infection at the second level. At the third level, it may spread among those who interacted with the second group. This phase is called local spread. If the infection spreads beyond this level, it is called community spread.

A senior official in the Health Department, who wished not to be quoted, told The Hindu on Tuesday that local spread and community spread cannot be stopped in the State, though efforts were on to reduce its pace to buy time. It might happen in the coming weeks.

Slow pace

“A lot of routine works that used to happen during these months are now moving at a slow pace. It is not deliberate. For the past two years, prevention measures against dengue fever used to begin in January. It had been showing results in 2018 and 2019 when the number of cases and deaths dropped drastically. However, the attention of health workers is diverted now,” K.K. Purushothaman, Professor of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Thrissur, pointed out.

Management of non-communicable diseases, their monitoring and surveillance, have also been affected. “Senior citizens, who constitute about 15% of the population in Kerala, especially those who have other health conditions, are susceptible to COVID-19. Unless these other conditions are controlled, they are likely to get infected. There should be a thrust on the geriatric population in the coming weeks, along with a stress on non-communicable diseases to maintain their health condition,” Dr. Purushothaman said.

Another area of concern is children’s health. Dr. Purushothaman pointed out that special attention should be paid to the nutritional demands of children from the marginalised sections. “Efforts to improve the nutritional levels of children as also their immunity are sluggish now. People are hesitant to take kids to hospitals to avoid possible infection. The strategy of immunisation in this epidemic period should be modified. If another episode of diphtheria or measles comes, that would have dire consequences,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fp5td1/article31094231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TVKZ-COVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/routine-health-campaigns-take-a-back-seat/article31091533.ece
153,2020/03/17,Uncertainty over development seminars in 240 LSGIs,"Seminars are key to formation of Plan projects

With the COVID-19 threat looming large, uncertainty prevails in about 240 local self-government institutions (LSGIs) over the conduct of development seminars that are key to the formation of Plan projects ahead of the next financial year.

As many as 960 out of the 1,200 local self-government institutions are understood to have conducted the seminars well before the virus threat had set in and are now awaiting their projects to be cleared by the District Planning Committees.

The government would either have to officially do away with the process or opt for convening the seminars with minimum stakeholder participation before forwarding the projects of these LSGIs for approval.

Model

Local self-government institutions in the State had set a model worth emulating in project preparation and execution and things were progressing as per the set course till a severe resource crunch followed by the COVID-19 outbreak that threatens to derail the process.

All the 960 LSGIs could go ahead as per the plan laid earlier for starting project execution from April 1, but the government would have to take a call on clearing the confusion over holding the seminars in the case of others.

Solution

The government was seized of the issue and would soon evolve a solution so that the Plan process would not be affected, Planning Board member K.N. Harilal told The Hindu.

“We are seriously exploring all possibilities to ensure the start of project execution from April 1 itself and the government would take a call on holding the seminars as well as grama sabhas and ward sabhas in the current context soon,” Mr. Harilal said.

Within a fortnight, the State would get the leeway to avail itself of loans and also the government could look forward to the revenue deficit grant that has already been awarded by the Union Finance Commission in its interim report. Which also means that 80% of the LSGIs could go ahead with project execution and will not have to face any hurdles in getting funds too.

Since the local body elections are scheduled to be held within the next six months, the committees will have to go on an overdrive to expend the maximum funds and also clear the projects.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/uncertainty-over-development-seminars-in-240-lsgis/article31091373.ece
154,2020/03/17,Tourists continue to be targeted,"Despite the Kerala government’s appeal against acts of targeting foreigners over the COVID-19 scare, instances of the visitors being singled out and humiliated have surfaced in the State again.

The latest incident was reported from Kannur where two tourists had to go without a morsel of food for four days after hotels allegedly refused to serve them any. The foreigners, a man and a woman, were seen crying out of hunger on the wayside by local people at Payyannur in Kannur, following which the police and local authorities extended them a helping hand.

The French and Italian nationals later said they had reached Kannur on March 11 but had not got any food for the last four days and had been starving. They said they wandered here and there and knocked at the door of many hotels and restaurants for food, but no one helped them. Seeing the plight of the visitors, the police and Payyannur civic body authorities bought them food and shifted them to the Thalassery taluk hospital. The tourists, who reached Kerala after visiting Mumbai, Goa and Madurai, had no symptom of the COVID-19, authorities said.

French couple

In another incident, a French couple, who reached Kannur from Wayand on a State-run bus, had to face the wrath of co-passengers. Some local passengers, who got frightened on seeing the foreigners, did not allow the bus to proceed further. A number of passengers even got out of the bus due to the presence of the French couple. The bus was later taken to the Kannur Town police station, from where the couple were shifted to the district hospital for observation. The couple, who reached the State on March 2 via Dubai, had no symptom of the virus in the preliminary examination, the police said.

In Kochi, the police extended a helping hand to 27-year-old French woman Desmazure and her three-year-old child Tao on Monday. The police traced the woman, who had lost her purse and had no money, based on the information provided by local people that a foreigner and child were roaming around the city.

Their trouble began after an enquiry by local health officials found that she had also been to Varkala, from where an Italian tourist had tested positive. She was taken to a hospital and found she had no symptoms. As she had no money, she was forced to spend the night in the hospital corridor. Though a room was provided later, it was not clean and full of cobwebs and mosquitoes.

The police later helped her to contact the French Consulate in Puducherry to arrange money and go to Delhi by train. She was also given a ‘no coronavirus’ certificate by the doctors before departing from the State, they added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/r2k8zu/article31094144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TVCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tourists-continue-to-be-targeted/article31091075.ece
155,2020/03/17,COVID-19 | MoS Muraleedharan goes on self-quarantine,"A doctor tested positive after participating in a meeting attended by the Minister

Union Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and External Affairs V. Muraleedharan, who attended a meeting at the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology on March 14, has gone into self-quarantine on his own after it emerged that one of the doctors at the institute had tested positive for COVID-19.

Also read | After doctor tests positive, Kerala's SCTIMST heads for shutdown

Mr. Muraleedharan had attended the meeting in which the Director as well as several senior doctors and senior administrative officials had taken part.

On March 15, tests had confirmed that one of their doctors, who had returned from Spain after higher studies, was positive for COVID-19.

It then emerged that the doctor, who returned from Spain on March 1 and was asymptomatic, had been working in the hospital for several days, before he was finally advised to go on quarantine on March 12.

All patient-care activities at SCTIMST, except serious emergency surgeries, have been grounded for two weeks as 76 of its employees, including 43 doctors, nurses and medical technicians have all been put on quarantine by authorities.

The district administration is currently working hard to trace all persons whom the doctor might have come into contact with. Efforts are also on to trace the passengers who had travelled on the same aircraft as him from Doha, which reached Thiruvananthapuram early on March 2.

It was in this backdrop that concerns were raised about the meeting held at the institute. While it is not clear if the doctor who tested positive had attended the meeting (the doctor had been advised home quarantine from March 12), Mr. Muraleedharan seems to have gone on self-quarantine as a preventive measure, even though he reportedly does not have any symptoms.

Sources also said that the Minister’s office has sought an explanation from SCTIMST authorities on why the matter was not brought up before the meeting.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wgaua8/article31089691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MURALEEDHARAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-mos-muraleedharan-goes-on-self-quarantine/article31089693.ece
156,2020/03/17,Kerala Governor makes a surprise visit to Law College,"Bid to mitigate panic about COVID-19

Kerala Governor Arif Muhammad Khan on Tuesday made a surprise visit to the Government Law College here.

The fourth-semester examination was on when Mr Khan arrived at the college. He waited until the tests were over and met students as they exited the examination hall. Mr. Khan inquired how they had performed and reminded them that society could combat COVID-19 outbreak only by vigilance and not panic or alarm. He also asked students not to allow fear of the infection upset their academic schedule.

Later, Mr. Khan told newspersons that anxious calls from parents on Monday night had prompted him to make an impromptu call at the examination centre.

Several had demanded that the Governor, as Chancellor, cancel the examination given the virus threat.

However, college and university authorities assured the Governor that they had taken due precaution. The invigilators had laid out the desk and benches in the examination hall with sufficient space in between. They had also provided hand sanitisers.

Mr. Khan said he wanted to send a message to the student community that it was safe to write examinations with due caution. He hoped his appearance in the college served the purpose.

Mr Khan said he did not think it worthy of commenting on a news report that he holidayed in Ponmudi when the government had closed the hill resort to other tourists. He said he drew most pleasure from reading books and not sightseeing. “Books were my greatest support even when the government jailed me during the Emergency”, he said.

On Sunday, the Raj Bhavan had tweeted Mr Khan’s activities at Ponmudi. He appeared to have spent the better part of the day interacting with forest guards, eco-tourism guides, tribal welfare officers, representatives of forest dwellers and local tourism industry leaders.

The Raj Bhavan said Mr Khan had also reviewed the government’s health initiatives to insulate tribal people from the ravages of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Governor also sought information on waste management at the hill resort and measures adopted to prevent littering.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5uyh7k/article31089657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Arif-Khan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-governor-makes-a-surprise-visit-to-law-college/article31089658.ece

Congress veteran and former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on Monday urged the LDF government to close down State-run liquor outlets in view of the outbreak of COVID-19.

“With the virus spreading in the State, the outlets under the Beverages Corporation and Consumerfed should be closed down to avoid gathering of large number of people,” he said.

In a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, he also submitted seven proposals including moratorium on various loans taken by people and financial aid to the needy who are under house surveillance, as part of extending maximum support to the common people during the distress times.

The annual school exams for the eighth and ninth standards, scheduled on March 20, 27 and 30, should be cancelled, the two-time Chief Minister suggested.

Effective steps should be taken, in coordination with the Union government, to bring back all Keralites, including fishermen from Iran, stranded in various countries, he said.

159,2020/03/17,"Coronavirus | Italy’s despair and hope, as seen by a Keralite priest","Fr. Nellikkal, director, Vatican Radio, describes the impact of the deadly virus on the community

Italy is in the midst of a lockdown, which has extended to two weeks now. But the Italians realise the extent of damage that COVID-19 can wreak and are following the orders of the government scrupulously, according to Fr. William Nellikkal, director, Vatican Radio.

He reveals how Italy, which has seen the most number of COVID-19 cases after China, is rattled by the sheer number of fatalities. However, the community is hopeful that the government-imposed restrictions will help rein in the epidemic soon.

The essential transport services are on — trams, metros, and buses, though there are very few passengers. Except for supermarkets all other shops are closed. People carry their documents, and those walking on roads have to tell the police, if asked, why exactly they are outside their homes, said Fr. Nellikkal, in-charge of the Malayalam section in the Vatican Radio.

The number of people who can enter a supermarket depends on the number of cash counters there. A supermarket in the Vatican City has four counters, so four people can get in. After they leave, another four can enter, all with gloves and masks. Restaurants and public places have downed shutters as no community gatherings are allowed.

Churches are not closed. People can visit privately, but not for a community prayer. The few who come maintain enough distance. The Church too has given a call for isolation. Sunday prayer is usually attended by 25,000 people. From last week, the Pope has been giving a live digital Mass transmitted from his personal library.

Most affected

Lumbardia is where it all began, from where over 800 deaths had been reported. The northern provinces of Italy – the Alpine Valley, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Bergamo, are among the most affected. Fr. Nellikkal lives in Rome, which has reported 200 cases with seven deaths.

He said people who had common cold and cough might have attributed them to the usual symptoms associated with season change from winter to spring, and hence delayed medical consultation. This could have been a reason for the spurt in cases.

The Vatican has facilitated a work-from-home arrangement by sharing the software. An audio clip can be sent through WhatApp to the central system that can be edited and played on the Vatican Radio.

Only those summoned by the court will be allowed to enter the complex, said a press release by K. Haripal, Registrar General of the High Court, on Monday.

Earlier, the office-bearers of the Ernakulam branch of the Indian Medical Association had met the Chief Justice to apprise him of the health situation in the district. A full-court meeting of the judges of the High Court was also held.

161,2020/03/17,Kerala initiates steps to cushion economic fallout of COVID-19,"Chief Minister says while the containment efforts would go on, life should not come to a halt affecting trade and commerce

The Kerala government has initiated measures to cushion the economic fallout of COVID-19 with the State beginning to feel the economic impact of the pandemic directly. Trade and commerce are coming almost to a standstill and many small and medium enterprises are facing the heat.

Briefing media after an all-party meeting held here on Monday to discuss the COVID-19 situation, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government would give more time to the businesses, including motor service operators, taxi and auto drivers, to pay their taxes. He urged banks to declare a three-month moratorium on debt recovery. The government would soon call a meeting of the State-level Banking Committee to discuss the issue.

Unemployment threat

The COVID-19 threat had cleared the streets of people and vehicles. Loss of wages and employment stare at the face of thousands. “It is a dire situation,” he said.

As people have reduced travel, the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation is staring at losses worth crores. The tourism industry has been the hardest hit because of the restrictions put in place, affecting the livelihood of many.

Expressing concern, Mr. Vijayan said while the containment efforts would go on, life should not come to a halt. Kerala is required to strike a delicate balance between the need for caution to limit the spread of the virus and the requirement to minimise the economic and social disruption the outbreak has caused. All political parties in the State have pledged their support for the government’s efforts, he said.

Crowding at airports

Henceforth, paramedics would screen domestic passengers for flu-like symptoms in airports. Authorities should minimise crowds at airports. Obliquely referring to the reception accorded to a reality television star outside the Cochin airport, Mr. Vijayan said the government viewed the “challenge against the State” seriously.

He said the police would escort air passengers with flu symptoms to hospitals or their homes for self-isolation in sanitised vans or buses. The State would not allow passengers with COVID-19 symptoms to travel on their own to their destinations. He also urged Customs to expedite the processes at airports to prevent queues and overcrowding.

On Census procedure

Mr. Vijayan said the State would hold the Census as per schedule. Census information is essential for national planning. The State had halted the work on the controversial National Population Register in December last. Enumerators would stick to the 31 questions notified in the gazette. The questionnaire is not much different from the one used for the 2011 census. Mr. Vijayan blamed the Centre for precipitating a political situation that sowed mistrust in the people about the Census.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sftlv7/article31085815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVCMSANITISE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/steps-to-cushion-economic-fallout-of-covid-19/article31085818.ece

164,2020/03/17,Who were the Kunjali Marakkars?,"History of 16th century Malabar involving faith, trade and politics to be in focus

On May 20, 1498, Vasco da Gama arrived off the coast of Kappad, near Kozhikode. Ten months earlier, he had set sail from the Portuguese capital of Lisbon on a small armada. He was on an ambitious mission: to change the world.

Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham (Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea), the upcoming Malayalam movie directed by Priyadarshan, is likely to kindle fresh interest in the history of the Malabar region covering a century after the arrival of the Portuguese seafarer. The movie, which stars Mohanlal in the title role, is based on the battle exploits of Kunjali Marakkar, the naval chieftain of Samoothiri (Zamorin), then ruler of Kozhikode. The movie is expected to be a mix of fact and fiction. The historical details that it does — or doesn’t — delineate may touch a raw nerve.

It is the job of professional historians to distinguish facts from fiction on any historical event or figure. Historians admit, though, that contemporary writings by the Portuguese in the sixteenth and seventeenth century portray their native opponents as corsairs and fanatics, while early Muslim writers give a patriotic and religious colour to the resistance to the Portuguese. Jornada of Dom Alexis de Menezes gives a Portuguese account of the 16th century Malabar and Tuhfat-ul-Mujahideen by Sheikh Zainuddin, 16th century Muslim scholar from Ponnani, narrates the Muslim side of the story. Perhaps, the truth lay somewhere between the two accounts.

Pioneering work

For over 300 years since the Portuguese defeated and killed Mohammed Ali Marakkar (Kunjali Marakkar IV) with the support of Samoothiri, the legendary naval chieftain lived in ballads and ‘kissa’ stories popular among the Mappila Muslims of Malabar.

For some historians, those accounts are fancifully fabricated stories. The publication of Malabar and the Portuguese in 1929 by Sardar K.M. Panikkar was the pioneering historical work that reconstructed the battles of the Marakkars against the Portuguese.

Historians trace the origin of the Marakkars to a branch of the Tamil-speaking merchants and seafaring community that came and settled in Kochi and engaged in trade and even collaborated with the Portuguese in Kochi. Tuhfat-ul-Mujahideen states that the Marakkars had turned against the Portuguese in 1524 when the latter started purchasing spices and other commodities directly from natives.

They settled at Ponnani, one of the ports of Samoothiri, and offered their service to the king to fight the Portuguese.

Here is the Kunjali Marakkar history in a nutshell. The rise of Ponnani of Pattu Marakkar, (Kunjali Marakkar III), historians say, appeared to have posed a threat to Samoothiri. The king of Kozhikode allied with the Portuguese to demolish Kunjali Marakkar’s bases. Samoothiri again sought the help of the Portuguese to suppress Kunjali Marakkar IV who is said to have overgrown his master. In 1600, the forces of Samoothiri and the Portuguese razed to the ground the Kunjali fort (Marakkar kotta) built on a strategic spot on the estuary at Kottakkal near Vadakara. He was executed by the Portuguese in Goa.

The conflictual — and at times collaborative — relationship of Muslims in Malabar with Europeans across the 16th and 17th centuries has been probed by historians. Historical accounts, though, are not without predilections of historians. As historian M.G.S. Narayanan notes, “The closer the subject of the study to our own interests and current situation, the greater are the chances of getting a defective or distorted picture of the past.” Historical narratives of Kunjali Marakkar cannot be free from this predilection.

What is undoubted is that the Malabar coast, especially the port city of Kozhikode — an important entrepot in the region from 14th century onwards — had been the hub of resistance against the Portuguese for a century ever since 29-year-old Vasco da Gama appeared off the coast in three ships with 170 men on board. His mission — commanded by King Manuel — combined religion, politics and economics. Maybe the ramifications of the Portuguese arrival five centuries ago are not yet over.

The retrieval of Katchatheevu was the “only solution” to the fishermen issue and the Tamil Nadu government was taking legal steps towards the solution, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar informed the State Legislative Assembly on Tuesday. Tamil Nadu government has been taking steps in phases to prevent disputes pertaining to fishermen drifting into Sri Lankan waters.

When Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator K.A.M. Muhammed Abubacker (Kadayanallur) raised the issue in the House, Mr. Jayakumar said the State government has been implementing the scheme to roll out tuna long liners cum gillnetter fishing vessels.

Contending that fishermen from Tamil Nadu were “not deliberately” crossing the international maritime border, Mr. Jayakumar said the boats with fishermen on board were drifting into Lankan waters due to wind currents.

To Mr. Abubacker’s suggestion for strengthening fishermen-to-fishermen contacts in Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu through a cooperative society, Mr. Jayakumar said a total of three meetings were organised over reducing tensions. The scheme would be implemented over five years, he said.

Though Tamil Nadu accepted the Sri Lankan authorities’ demand for discontinuing usage of certain type of nets for fishing, the Lankan authorities were not for giving time for Tamil Nadu to implement the decision. The Minister indicated any decision could not be implemented within a day.

The Minister also said that fishermen in the State were benefiting from the Prime Minister Blue Revolution Scheme.

Due to the efforts taken by the AIADMK government, the attacks and shoot-outs on Indian fishermen by Sri Lankan authorities have drastically reduced over the past nine years, he underlined. During another debate, intervening DMK MLA Anitha R. Radhakrishnan (Tiruchendur), Textiles Minister O.S.

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Tuesday criticised the Central Board of Secondary Education for not making Tamil a compulsory subject in schools in Tamil Nadu.

In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said that private CBSE schools are using loopholes in the law that mandates Tamil language be taught compulsorily.

“It is big challenge to ensure that CBSE schools teach Tamil language compulsorily. State Board schools teach Tamil compulsorily until class X and 90% of Matriculation schools, save for certain language minority schools, teach Tamil as a compulsory language. While the Government Order to this effect was passed in September 2014, 90% of CBSE schools have not followed the law. The Tamil Nadu government should not take a kind view towards these schools,” said Dr. Ramadoss.

He further said that Tamil should be made a compulsory subject in schools following ICSE and Cambridge board syllabuses too.

“The Kerala government has made it clear that schools that refuse to teach Malayalam will be given two warnings before their recognition is cancelled. They also give financial aid to schools that teach Malayalam at the same time,” he said.

Dr. Ramadoss urged Tamil Nadu government to take strict action against CBSE schools that refuse to teach Tamil.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ramadoss-urges-state-to-make-tamil-compulsory-in-cbse-schools/article31089771.ece

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, who explained the measures taken by the government, pointed out that visitors were no longer permitted to watch the Assembly proceedings.

Responding to Opposition leader and DMK president M.K. Stalin, he said the government was open and transparent when it came to taking action to control the pandemic. He said testing facilities were available at five hospitals and each had the capacity of testing 100 cases per day. “While Kerala, Maharashtra and other States had reported more cases, there was only one patient in the State who had tested positive.

The Tamil Nadu Medical Students Association has voiced concerns over the non-availability of masks and hand sanitisers for doctors, post-graduate medical students and interns in government hospitals across the State.

As a precautionary measure against COVID-19, five tourists from Thailand who were staying in the city were admitted to the isolation ward at Government IRT Perundurai Medical College and Hospital here on Monday night.

They were part of a seven-member group who arrived in New Delhi on a pilgrimage trip to various places in the country. Since one of their team members developed fever and is a diabetic, they decided to send him back to Thailand accompanied by one of their team member. At Coimbatore airport, while screening, he was found to have fever and was admitted to the isolation ward at Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, where he tested negative. He told officials that he was part of the team and five members were currently staying at a dargah in the city.

At 10 p.m. on Monday, a team comprising officials from revenue, health and police visited the dargah and held inquiries. Since many visit the dargah every day, health officials pointed out that they could not stay there and needed to be kept in isolation. Later, they were taken to Perundurai and admitted to the isolation ward.

Deputy Director of Health Services S. Soundammal told The Hindu that though no symptoms were found in them, as a precautionary measure they needed to be kept in isolation for 28 days after which they would be discharged.

The Senthalaivayal village panchayat in Sethubhavachatram Panchayat Union in Thanjavur district has led the way in implementing preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 by providing hand sanitisers and soaps at the village bus stop situated along the East Coast Road.

Three taps have been provided beneath a big banner listing the dos and dont’s to check the spread of the virus. Hand sanitisers and soaps are kept in baskets. Water is supplied through a pipeline linked to a water tank.

The hoarding, highlighting the need to wash hands frequently, catches the attention of commuters who board or alight from buses and draws them towards the taps.

“Initially, people were a bit reluctant to use the facility which was opened on Sunday morning. As the day progressed, people realised the purpose for which such a facility had been put up by the civic body and many started using it. Now many people are utilising the facility,” said M. Rahamathullah, village panchayat president.

Further, social activists in the village were also roped in to sensitise the commuters waiting at the bus stop or arriving from other places to wash their hands before leaving the bus stop, added Mr. Rahmathullah.

It has also been contemplated to create similar facilities in a few other places in the village such as the bazaar, where hundreds of people use to congregate, he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/m84clu/article31088115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THHANDWASHINGFACILITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/senthalaivayal-panchayat-shows-the-way/article31088116.ece

Foreigners from as many as 18 countries, which are declared as COVID-19-hit and tourists from States like Kerala shall undergo proper screening at the foothills. Only after thorough examination they will be permitted to climb the hill. Similarly, steps have been taken to check the number of foreigners in the hill station for periodic screening. They would be subject to tests and if required, the swabs taken shall be sent to Chennai for test at the Kings Institute, Guindy, Sivakumar, RDO (in-charge) said and added that the tourist movements on the hill stations would also be restricted. For instance, as a safety measure, tourists shall not travel on the ghat section from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.

However, local residents in Kodaikanal would not face any restriction on night movement. Organising night parties and gatherings shall not be permitted. The officials have appealed to the public to cooperate to fight the COVID-19 and the travelling public may have to oblige for undergoing the mandatory tests by health department officials.

Meanwhile at a review meeting, chaired by Collector M Vijayalakshmi here on Monday, she discussed the preparedness and the steps being taken by the Department of Public Health and Family Welfare. Apart from establishing health screening centres at the Kodaikanal, she also underlined the need for conducting screening of public visiting the government hospital, railway stations, markets and at public parks. Fumigation shall continue at all vantage locations and she urged the civic authorities to remove garbage without fail.

A man, who had come on a business trip to Batlagundu from Ernakulam, complained of uneasiness, fever and cough. Immediately, he was taken to the Batlagundu GH, where the doctors kept him in an isolation ward. He was advised to proceed to Theni GH, where the screening could be carried out, officials said.

Theni

In Theni, Collector M. Pallavi Baldev, commenced the distribution of lemon water to visitors at the Collectorate, when people came to the weekly grievance meeting. Officials said that this not only helps beat the heat, but also gives instant energy.

The officials explained the prevention aspects and educated them on the virus COVID 19. Workers from the district going to estates in Idukki district were told to undergo strict screening and mobile camps were functioning round-the-clock to check on passenger movement from Kerala, officials added. A jallikattu, which was planned to be held in Pallavarayanpatti in the district on March 22, has been postponed. The organisers, who met the Collector, announced about the decision due to COVID-19. The Collector explained to us about the virus and hence, we have decided to keep the jallikattu event in abeyance till March 31 and take a call later.

Ramanathapuram

District Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that considering the importance of Ramanathaswamy Temple in Rameswaram, additional manpower had been deployed to handle the public.

175,2020/03/17,Stamp on Maniammai released,"VIT founder urges parties to fight for implementation of 33% quota for women

A commemorative stamp and compilation of works by Maniammai, the late wife of Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, was released at the Periyar Thidal in Chennai on Monday to mark the conclusion of her centenary year celebrations.

Releasing the stamp, G. Viswanathan, founder and chancellor, Vellore Institute of Technology, said: “Periyar has spoken about property rights for women, widow remarriage and so many other things. Today, 33% reservation for women has not become a law for the last 24 years. Political parties across the spectrum must support it. DMK should take this issue up."" Mr. Viswanathan said that Tamil Nadu is lagging behind Maharashtra and Karnataka in passing anti-superstition law.

“In 2013, Maharashtra brought in the anti-superstition law. The BJP government in Karnataka has approved the law that was brought in by Siddharamaiah government. They have prevented all sorts of superstitions including rolling over the bannana leaves eaten by Brahmins,” he said.

‘Superstition rampant’

Mr. Viswanathan said that the superstitions in the society such as astrology, ‘asupicious’ timings have become the norm in the society. “Developed nations don’t care about caste or religion. Religions don’t need to be given so much importance and governments need not interfere or care about it. Only in developing and poor countries, people seem to care about religion,” he said.

Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani said that there is no need to worry about what could be the movement’s next step as the Dravidian leaders such as Maniammai had shown the way. He spoke about how Annai Maniammaiyar played a similar role like that of Periyar in ensuring that there was no rift among DMK leaders.

Mr. Veeramani said that former DMK general secretary K. Anbazhagan had admitted that the DMK leaders used Maniammai’s marriage to Periyar to break away when the real reason was the intention to enter electoral politics.

“Maniammai had appealed to the DMK leaders — M. Karunanidhi and Navalar Nedunchezhiyan — to resolve their differences. She wrote: ‘How will Ayya react to all this. I am not trying to fill his shoes, but since I have dedicated myself to his work, we are doing what he would if he was here,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/stamp-on-maniammai-released/article31086343.ece

178,2020/03/17,Time to enact law against organised crimes: HC,"‘Strong law needed to tackle killers’

The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Home Secretary to provide an “effective response” by March 30 on the possibility of enacting a special law, on the lines of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act of 1999, to deal with “paid mercenaries” engaged for committing gruesome crimes.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Hemalatha issued the direction, while hearing a habeas corpus petition related to the preventive detention of a person involved in a clash between rowdy gangs. The judges were of the view that a stringent law would help the police to act tough against hired killers.

During the course of hearing, the senior judge in the Bench told a government counsel that there was indeed a proposal in 2010 to enact a law in the State to control organised crimes. He wanted to know what had happened to that proposal and whether the government was shying away from enacting such a law.

“If you are afraid that if such a law is passed, it would amount to admitting the existence of rowdy gangs in the State, then such attitude is wrong. You must admit if there is a problem and try to address it. Paid killers are indeed on the prowl in the State. They are being engaged for settling every other dispute.

“Called as ‘Kooli Padai’ in Tamil, they are being engaged to settle land grabbing issues, other civil disputes and even for honour killings. The Udumalpet Shankar case is a classic example. These gangs have political, religious and communal backing and they easily escape. This shouldn’t happen,” he said.

Later, in its interim order, the Bench said it would be constrained to summon the Home Secretary and Director-General of Police if a satisfactory answer with regard to the enactment of the law, to control organised crimes, was not placed before the court during the next hearing of the case.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/time-to-enact-law-against-organised-crimes-hc/article31086275.ece

Public transport vehicles would be sanitised with the local bodies’ health officials and NGOs lending their support in the exercise, Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram said.

Prices soar

A participant from Rotary International suggested use of digital transaction to avoid transmission of virus through handling of currency notes. Participants have brought to the notice of the district administration on the “artificial scarcity” on masks, floor cleaners and other material. Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram cautioned against selling essential products at a higher price and asked the drug controllers to check and take appropriate action against the violators.

In Vellore, ordinary clinical masks disappeared from the selves of pharmacies. The reasons the pharmacists attributed was the demand and supply level.

The price of the ordinary mask had gone up from ₹5 to ₹25 and the masks were not available.

Joint Director-Medical Services Yasmeen advised the public against wearing face masks unnecessarily.

‘All steps taken’

She said all preventive steps had been taken and teams constituted for screening and monitoring and medical officers had been put on high alert about the arrival of international patients and also tourists in the city.

Ms. Yasmeen said certain simple steps had been suggested. to contain the spread of the virus

These include maintaining good hygiene, washing hands with sanitizer or soap, avoiding crowded places, and maintaining a safe distance from people suffering from cough or to sneeze would go a long way in minimising the chance of being infected.

The meeting was attended by Vellore Superintendent of Police Praveshkumar, Government Medical College and Hospital Dean R. Selvi, Deputy Director (Health Services) K.S.T.

182,2020/03/17,"Firing incidents involving fishermen have reduced drastically, govt. tells court","In High Court, govt. vows to retrieve katchatheevu

The State government on Monday told the Madras High Court that incidents of alleged firing and attack on Indian fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy had reduced drastically since the end of the civil war in the island nation in 2009. It expressed its resoluteness to retrieve Katchatheevu and restore the right to fish in traditional waters.

In a counter affidavit filed before the second Division Bench of Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar, Director of Fisheries G.S. Sameeran said 67 incidents of shooting and attack by the SL Navy were reported in the last two decades, leading to the death of 26 Indian fishermen. “Due to steps taken by the State and Central governments, the incidents of shooting and attack have considerably reduced in the last decade. Only five such incidents have been reported, in which two fishermen died and four were injured,” the counter filed in response to a PIL petition filed by Fishermen Care, an NGO, read.

The petitioner organisation had filed the case in 2018, seeking financial and other forms of assistance to the fishermen who had suffered due to arrests and seizure of their boats by the SL Navy on charges of having intentionally crossed the International Maritime Boundary Line. The counter affidavit, served on petitioner’s counsel L.P. Maurya, said around 6,000 mechanised fishing boats and 9,000 traditional craft were engaged in fishing in the Palk Bay area. Over 60,000 members of fishermen families were directly dependent on these boats for eking out a living and many others indirectly. Claiming that a permanent solution to the problem of cross-border fishing could be found if Katchatheevu, ceded to Sri Lanka by the Centre, is retrieved and included in the confines of Indian waters, the Director of Fisheries said a case filed in this regard by the State government in 2008 was pending in Supreme Court.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/firing-incidents-involving-fishermen-have-reduced-drastically-govt-tells-court/article31085993.ece

The Union Department of Expenditure received three representations from the Tamil Nadu government last year for additional allocations for various development works.

A sum of ₹10,933 crore was transferred to the State in 2019-20 under different centrally-sponsored schemes, Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said while replying to a question from Congress MP S. Jothimani in the Lok Sabha.

The Department had received representations from the State government on February 13, February 16 and July 23 last year, he said. “These representations have been forwarded to concerned line Ministries/Departments for necessary action,” the Minister added.

A sum of ₹11,337.62 crore was transferred to T.N. in 2015-16, ₹10,058.65 crore in 2016-17, ₹8,563.64 crore in 2017-18 and ₹10,011.61 crore in 2018-19 under the centrally-sponsored schemes, according to the Minister. The delay in payments under the centrally-sponsored schemes has been one of the key complaints of the State government. State Finance Secretary S. Krishnan recently pointed out that dues from the Centre stood at ₹12,263 crore, which included grants for local bodies and other centrally-sponsored schemes.

In the last five years, ₹969.43 crore was sanctioned as a special one-time assistance to Tamil Nadu for the modernisation of the State police and the development of the fisheries sector, among other purposes, according to the information provided in the Lok Sabha.

To Ms. Jothimani’s query on the measures taken by the government to address the delay in the sanctioning of funds for payment of MGNREGA wages to workers in Karur, Mr. Thakur said the release of funds to the States/U.T.s, including Tamil Nadu, was a continuous process and the Central government was committed to making funds available, keeping the demand for work in mind.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/state-made-three-requests-for-additional-funds-in-2019-mos-tells-lok-sabha/article31085926.ece

The ruling AIADMK and the principal Opposition party, the DMK, were locked in a war of words over who enjoyed the goodwill of the people of the State, and the parties’ prospects for next year’s Assembly polls.

Participating in the debate on the demand for grants for the Municipal Administration Department, DMK whip R. Sakkarapani alleged that the government had switched to indirect elections for chiefs of municipal corporations and municipalities, fearing defeat in the civic polls.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami countered the claim, saying the decision was made depending on the situation and noting that the AIADMK had won the bypolls in Vikravandi and Nanguneri Assembly constituencies. Besides, the victory margin of the DMK in the deferred Lok Sabha polls in Vellore was only 0.6%, he said. He claimed the DMK had won the Parliamentary election by making “non-implementable promises” during the campaign.

Stalin’s counter

DMK president M.K. Stalin joined the debate to say that the promises made by his party were very much implementable, and that after winning the next Assembly polls, his party would implement them.

Following this, Mr. Palaniswami and Mr. Stalin were engaged in a debate for some time, with each claiming that their party enjoyed the goodwill of the people and will win the Assembly polls.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dravidian-majors-spar-over-public-goodwill-electoral-prospects/article31085900.ece

Nutritious Noon Meal Programme, under the social audit during 2020-21.

At present, the social audit is being undertaken for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The Social Audit Society of Tamil Nadu, a body registered in 2013 under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, facilitates the exercise, to be executed by village panchayats to ensure proper implementation of MGNREGS.

In respect of the NSAP, there are 18.4 lakh beneficiaries in the State. (In addition, about 11.1 lakh beneficiaries are covered under other social security schemes). As part of PMAY-G (meant for providing houses to the poor in rural areas), around 9.11 lakh eligible beneficiaries will have to be covered. Around 5.27 lakh houses, costing about ₹8,970 crore, have been constructed since 2016-17. The Nutritious Noon Meal Programme is benefitting around 49.85 lakh children.

Initiating the debate on the demand for grants to his departments, Local Administration and Rural Development Minister S.P. Velumani said a detailed calendar was being prepared for conducting the social audit next year in 12,523 village panchayats for MGNREGS.

187,2020/03/17,"Tamil-medium education since school must for preference in jobs, says Bill","Provision will affect eligibility under ‘Persons Studied in Tamil Medium’ quota

Only the candidates who have studied in Tamil medium from primary school onwards will be accorded preference in direct recruitment under the ‘Persons Studied in Tamil Medium’ (PSTM) quota, according to a Bill tabled by the government in the Assembly on Monday.

The Bill seeks to amend the Tamil Nadu Appointment on preferential basis in the Services under the State of PSTM Act, 2010. Until now, persons who had obtained the “prescribed educational qualification” for direct recruitment through Tamil medium of instruction were eligible for getting preference in direct recruitment. The amendment is being brought in as the government had come across instances where candidates who had obtained only the final prescribed educational qualification in Tamil medium were applying under the PSTM quota for direct recruitment. For instance, for a post for which the prescribed qualification is graduation, the candidate would have obtained a degree in Tamil medium through distance education, despite having studied in English medium in school and college. The Bill, introduced by Minister for Personnel and Administrative Reforms D. Jayakumar, will be taken up for consideration during the ongoing session.

In cases where SSLC is the prescribed educational qualification, the candidate should have studied up to SSLC in Tamil medium. In cases where HSC is the prescribed qualification, the candidate should have obtained SSLC as well as HSC in Tamil medium. The same condition would apply to other cases, where the prescribed qualification is diploma, degree or postgraduation.

4% quota

Another Bill introduced by Mr. Jayakumar sought to ensure 4% reservation for the differently-abled in government jobs. Though the government had announced such a quota earlier, some provisions of the relevant Act were posing obstacles to its implementation.

The proposed legislation intends to make necessary amendments to relevant Acts to implement the G.O.s issued earlier. The government had earlier announced examinations for candidates for government service who do not possess the minimum general educational qualification of SSLC. It had also issued a G.O. to replace the chairman of the Equivalence Committee — currently being headed by the TNPSC chairman — for considering requests from educational institutions for issuance of equivalence to the courses offered by them for the purpose of appointment in public services. As per the G.O., the Secretary of the Higher Education Department will be the chairman.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-medium-education-since-school-must-for-preference-in-jobs-says-bill/article31085897.ece

“Due to Covid-19, SAI has decided that: All National camps shall be postponed except for those where athletes are being trained as part of Olympics #Tokyo2020 preparation,” Mr. Rijiju tweeted.

“Academic training in National Centre of Excellence & STCs shall be suspended till further order,” he added.

Mr. Rijiju said the move is temporary and precautionary and training will resume if the situation caused by the pandemic improves.

“This is just a temporary and precautionary step for the safety of our sportspersons. I appeal all our young athletes not to be disheartened. We will resume the academic trainings soon after assessing the situation.”

In India, the shooting World Cup and Indian Open Golf has been postponed so far, while badminton’s India Open was also deferred after the Badminton World Federation (BWF) suspended all World Tour and sanctioned events.

With the coronavirus crisis forcing the cancellation or postponement of many events, the Athletics Federation of India has decided to make a few changes to its three-leg Indian Grand Prix series which begins on March 20.

Second leg shifted

The first leg will be held in Patiala as scheduled on March 20 but the second leg, on March 25, has been shifted from Sangrur to Patiala. Both the legs will be held at the SAI-NIS in Patiala.

“Regarding the third leg, we will study the situation in Delhi and take a decision but it will surely happen.”

The AFI's competition committee, which recommended these changes, has also revised the events’ list for the first and second legs. The men’s 100m, 110 hurdles, high jump have been dropped from the first leg while the men’s and women’s discus throw has been pulled out from the second.

193,2020/03/17,Chess | Caruana favoured to come out on top,"Coronavirus notwithstanding, Yekaterinburg all set to host Candidates meet

Cinemas are closed. Shutters are down on malls. Stadia are empty. Coronavirus has pressed the pause button on the world.

Every day dawns with the news of the cancellation or postponement of a major sporting event. On Tuesday in Russia though, one of the biggest tournaments of the year in chess will get underway. The Candidates tournament opens at Yekaterinburg, which boasts some of the tallest buildings in Russia.

Three weeks of action

The next three weeks will tell who, from among the eight players, will stand the tallest and stake the claim to challenge Magnus Carlsen for the next World Championship, to be held later in the year.

For the uninitiated, the World chess champion has the privilege of playing the title match directly – a bit like the Wimbledon champion getting seeded straight to the final. That has usually been the custom in chess for decades.

So it is indeed extremely difficult for someone to emerge as the new champion.

In the 134-year-history of the championship, there have only been 16 undisputed champions.

Carlsen became the 16th when he dethroned Viswanathan Anand in 2013 in the latter’s hometown of Chennai.

In late 2018 at London, the Norwegian genius was given a tough fight in the title match by Fabiano Caruana.

The match was tied 6-6 and it was through the tie-breakers that Carlsen emeged victorious. Caruana is very much the favourite to be the challenger once again.

Watch out for Liren

The Italian-American is the World No. 2, with 2842 Elo points. He could face the stiffest challenge from Ding Laren, the World No. 3 from China with a rating of 2805.

Russians Alexander Grischuk (2777), Ian Nepomniachtchi (2774) and Kirill Alekseenko (2698), Dutchman Anish Giri (2763), France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (2767) and China’s Wang Hao (2762) are the others in the fray.

“I think Caruana is too strong for this field,” says Mumbai-based Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay. “As he proved in the last World Championship, he could pose the toughest challenge to Carlsen.”

Caruana’s toughest challenge at Yekaterinburg could come from Liren. He had arrived, along with his team, from China (the epicentre of Corona) and had been in quarantine.

Not that every chess player wanted to take on Corona and play at the Candidates. Teimour Radjabov of Azerjaiban had pulled out and had requested the world chess governing body FIDE to postpone the tournament (he was replaced by Vachier-Lagrave).

Caruana had found his flight to Russia was cancelled without notice but was able to board another later. FIDE was in no mood to change the schedule of the Candidates, stating that an eight-player tournament could not be compared to a large event.

Anand’s new role

One can follow the tournament live online and on chess.com, one can listen to the commentary of Anand, who is stuck in Germany, after competing in the Bundesliga chess league, because of travel restrictions.

The five-time World Champion is making his debut as a commentator. Given his deep knowledge, experience, the ability to analyse quickly, articulation and sense of humour, he should be a treat to listen to.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/u4oe59/article31085015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17CARUANA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/chess-caruana-favoured-to-come-out-on-top/article31085016.ece

“Winning on pro tour is fantastic. Actually, I didn’t think about winning the Oman Open when I went into it. But looking at the draw looking and my form, I thought... okay, I should be able to make it to the semifinal at least, probably, even to the final.

“In the final, I thought playing (World No. 26, top seed from Portugal) Marcos (Freitas) will be quite difficult because he’s really been in very good shape and doing very well.”

Speaking about the quality of opposition, the nine-time National champion said, “There were a lot of top-level players who didn’t withdraw because of the forthcoming Olympic Games. Though I was the fourth seed, around 16 players were pretty close to me.

“So I think the competition was pretty stiff. I was just lucky to have a draw which was more suitable to me and I did well.”

Phenomenal backhand

Reflecting on his performance in the final, which he won 4-2, Sharath said, “I played one of my best table tennis in the final. My backhand, I think, was phenomenal. I was surprised how I could hit those backhands so hard, with such good timing. Even Marcos appeared very, very surprised by the way I was hitting the backhands, and he really didn’t know where exactly to play.

“I think throughout the tournament, especially the semifinal and final, I played much better when I was trailing than when I was ahead.

“I think, I was very composed, especially when I was trailing. And even in the end, I saved five game-points in the sixth set. But all these five-six game points I gave away, were points which I could have converted myself.”

Looking at the impact of coronavirus that has sent the schedule for a toss, Sharath said, “It’s been huge. Olympic qualifiers are supposed to happen three weeks from now.

“But then, for the next six weeks, there is no tournament. And we don’t know when the next tournament will be held. In May, there are tournaments in Hong Kong and China, which I doubt if they will be organised at all. So, we really don’t know what is the fate of the tournaments in the next couple of months.

“And also what will be the qualification process for the Olympic Games because if the qualifying tournaments don’t happen, then what will be the process for qualification to Tokyo? Everything is a question mark.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/2ye3yy/article31084968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17TT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/table-tennis-i-played-my-best-in-the-final-sharath-kamal/article31084969.ece
195,2020/03/17,Power staff JAC oppose add-on report,"Telangana State Power Employees Joint Action Committee staged a protest here on Tuesday demanding the managements of four power utilities in the State — Genco, Transco and two Discoms — not allow 655 employees relieved by Andhra Pradesh utilities following the supplementary report of the Dharmadhikari Committee.

Employees belonging to about a dozen associations under the aegis of TSPEJAC participated in the protest with about 11 of them sitting on a day-long relay fast. The JAC leaders alleged that the supplementary report of the one-man committee appointed by the Supreme Court was in total contradiction of its “final report” published in December last.

The supplementary report was in violation of the modalities fixed by the committee for division of State-cadre employees among the power utilities of the two States following bifurcation of combined AP into AP and Telangana, they said. They also submitted a representation to Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Genco and TS-Transco requesting him to direct the utilities not to allow the employees relieved by AP to join duties here.

The JAC leaders said allowing the employees relieved by AP would again result in huge injustice to the Telangana employees, which they had been suffering all through in combined AP.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pinwej/article31093336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17Power,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/power-staff-jac-oppose-add-on-report/article31093319.ece
196,2020/03/17,Panel to look into groundwater pollution charge,"Locals complain to TSPCB about Divi’s Labs pumping pharma effluents into the ground

Based on several complaints by locals and observations by experts that Divi’s Laboratories Limited at Choutuppal was allegedly causing groundwater pollution, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) has directed the District Collector of Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri to constitute a multi-disciplinary committee to study the situation.

“Divi’s has been pumping pharma effluents into the ground through dug borewells, and is not using the Zero Liquid Discharge technology. The water has become unfit for consumption and agriculture. Both human and animal lives are in danger,” have been the major allegations, the PCB noted.

The multi-disciplinary committee will have representatives from the Revenue, Agriculture, Ground Water Board, the TSPCB and experts from Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) or National Environment Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), and it will conduct the study in consultation with the public, the letter read.

According to a few petitioners who received their copy on Tuesday, more than 135 persons from Thangadapally, Gujja, Aregudem and Katrevu villages in and around Choutuppal, besides environment organisations, had represented to the PCB about the “toxic condition” of air, water and soil due to pharmaceutical pollution. And, thousands of aggrieved residents are also in Panthangi, Gundlabavi, Chinnakonduru, Lakkaram and Lingojigudem, where Divi’s Laboratories Limited is located, on the NH-65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada) stretch near Choutuppal.

Environmentalists press that the situation in Choutuppal “is a visible case of human rights violations, as residents are deprived of clean water, air and soil.” Paryavarana Parirakshana Samithi, one of the organisations leading the cause, had also approached the National Human Rights Commission and filed a case for investigation recently, they say.

Following complaints, inspections by PCB were conducted in November 2019 and January 2020, and a task force committee meeting was held with all stakeholders in February. The PCB not only instructs the committee for assessment of the extent of contamination, and damage to persons, animals and lands, but also entrusts it to make compensation recommendations by invoking ‘polluter pays principle’, within three months.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/panel-to-look-into-groundwater-pollution-charge/article31093269.ece
197,2020/03/17,PM urged to stop Pharma city project,"It is a real estate project for people in power, says Bhongir MP

Member of Parliament from Bhongir Komatireddy Venkata Reddy met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday and urged him to cancel permissions given for Pharma City in Hyderabad as it would disturb the ecological balance and affect the livelihoods of thousands of farmers by contaminating the land.

In a memorandum Mr. Reddy alleged that the sole intention of the Telangana government was to use the Pharma City as a real estate project to benefit people close to them. It was initially planned in 3,000 acres and subsequently increased to 19,333 acres. There is no economic, administrative, environmental and ecological justifications for such a huge area, he said.

He said the area proposed was a pristine one with widespread agriculture, horticulture and vegetable production area fulfilling the needs of Hyderabad. Establishing 1500 pharma industries are one place will be disaster and will have an impact on 100 km radius, he claimed. He alleged that land is being acquired from farmers at ₹ 8 lakh per acre but are being sold to pharma companies for a price of ₹ 1.30 crore.

He also wanted the Prime Minister to review the environment clearance process for the project and not finalise the approval given under NIMZ by the Union Ministry of Commerce.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pm-urged-to-stop-pharma-city-project/article31092870.ece
198,2020/03/17,"Huge evolutionary divide between African and Asian cheetah, says CCMB study","DNA analyses tracks evolutionary history between the two sub-species

The divide between North-east African cheetah with both the South-east African and Asiatic cheetah is 100-200,000 years ago. Also, the South-east African and Asiatic cheetah have diverged from each other 50-100,000 years ago, according to DNA analyses to understand evolutionary history of Asiatic and African cheetahs by scientists of the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB).

The study of the sub-species of ‘Acinonyx jubatus’ was taken up in collaboration with Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences, Lucknow, University of Cambridge, UK, Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Kolkata, University of Johannesburg, South Africa and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.

“This is contrary to an existing belief that the evolutionary divide between Asiatic and African cheetahs is only of 5,000 years,” said Guy Jacobs of the University of Cambridge. The study results comes in the wake of the Supreme Court allowing the Central government to introduce Southern African cheetah in India.

Vast difference

A major parameter that decides the choice between Asiatic and African cheetah reintroduction in the country would be to see how different the two populations are. The farther back they diverged along evolution, the more different these two populations would be from each other, CCMB’s chief scientist and senior author K Thangaraj said.

“We have analysed three distinct cheetah samples — skin of a cheetah believed to be shot in Madhya Pradesh in 19th century from mammal gallery of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Kolkata, second was a bone obtained from Mysore’s Natural History Museum, dates to 1850 – 1900, and the third was a blood sample of a modern cheetah from Nehru Zoological Park (NZP), Hyderabad,” he explained.

DNA from historical skin and bone samples was separated in the ancient DNA facility of CCMB, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of these two samples and the modern cheetah sample were sequenced and analysed along with mtDNA of 118 cheetah from different parts of Africa and southwest Asia, another author Niraj Rai said.

Genetic uniqueness

Mr. Thangaraj said that the museum specimen from ZSI and modern sample from NZP are of Northeast African maternal descent while the museum specimen from Mysore showed close affinity with Southeast African cheetahs. The results have been published in ‘Scientific Reports’.

CCMB Director Rakesh K Mishra said the the study provides evidence towards establishing the genetic uniqueness of Asiatic cheetah, and hence, merits their targeted conservation efforts. Cheetah vanished from the country just after independence and Africa today harbours the highest number of these cats, called the African cheetah. Asiatic cheetahs found in numbers as small as 50 in Iran.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/huge-evolutionary-divide-between-african-and-asian-cheetah-says-ccmb-study/article31092848.ece

In the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) threat, Sri Sitarama Tiru Kalyana Mahotsavam, the annual mega religious fete, will be conducted in a simple and customary manner by the temple priests in adherence to the temple traditions devoid of devotees on the occasion of Sri Rama Navami in Bhadrachalam on April 2.

A decision to this effect was taken by the State government in line with the public health advisories to avoid public gatherings including social, religious, and other mass congregations as a precautionary measure to prevent spread of the COVID-19.

Disclosing this to mediapersons here on Tuesday, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar said the government has issued orders to the temple authorities to stop sale of tickets in both offline and online modes for the ensuing Sitarama Kalyana Mahotsavam slated to be held in Bhadrachalam on April 2.

Money will be refunded to those who had already booked the Kalyanam tickets online, he added.

The Kalyanam will be conducted by a handful of priests in the presence of a limited number of temple staff in a customary manner on the occasion of Srirama Navami in Bhadradri on April 2, he said urging devotees to watch the celestial wedding on televisions in their houses in view of the public health advisories against mass gatherings to keep coronavirus at bay.

All the special buses allotted for Sri Rama Navami festivities have been cancelled and instructions have been issued to tone down the arrangements earlier planned for the fete in view of the prevailing situation.

There is no need for panic but it is imperative to follow the precautionary measures and extend cooperation to the administration help prevent the spread of the COVID-19, he remarked.

Responding to a query, he said the customary protocol will be followed in regard to presentation of mutyala talambralu and pattu vastrams on behalf of the State government on the occasion of Sitarama Kalyanam in Bhadradri temple by deputing a senior officer.

200,2020/03/17,TS urges Centre to sanction groundnut research centre,"Scope for promoting quality groundnut crop in State, says Minister

Telangana government has requested the Centre to sanction ₹50 crore for establishing a groundnut research centre in the State to bring back the glory to extensive cultivation of the oilseed crop, which was even exported.

In a letter addressed to Union Minister of Agriculture Narendra Singh Tomar, Telangana Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy explained the conditions suitable for quality production of groundnut in the State, particularly in Wanaparthy, Nagarkurnool, Jogulamba-Gadwal and Mahabubnagar districts.

Stating that improved irrigation facilities would further increase the quality, extent, production and productivity of groundnut, the Minister said the yield in the four districts was 1,611 kg per hectare and it was much higher than the national average of 1,486 kg per hectare. The area was known for both producing quality groundnut seed and crop without aflatoxin content suitable for exports.

Mr. Niranjan Reddy explained that with the help of improved irrigation facilities the farmers could grow even higher quality groundnut, provided quality seed was provided to them. As there was huge potential for export of groundnut without aflatoxin, there was need for establishing a research centre in Wanaparthy area to help and guide the farmers better, he stated.

Further, he took the notice of the Union Minister that the State government already had land for establishing the research centre and allocated it for the purpose, ₹50 crore would required for establishing the centre along with infrastructure including buildings and laboratories.

Mr. Niranjan Reddy has addressed another letter to Mr. Tomar requesting sanction of a mustard research centre and water management research centre to Telangana. He explained that water management research centre was necessary to prevent pollution of water with effective management of water for different needs such as irrigation, drinking and other purposes.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-urges-centre-to-sanction-groundnut-research-centre/article31092596.ece
201,2020/03/17,Crop loan waiver to be implemented with family as unit,"Guidelines issued for identification of beneficiaries

The crop loan waiver planned to be implemented by the State government from this month, as announced in the recent budget presentation in the Assembly, starting with farmers having debt, including principal amount and applicable interest up to ₹25,000, will be a family-wise benefit according to the guidelines issued on Tuesday.

Practically it would mean that if a family — family head, spouse and dependant children — would get waiver benefit of ₹1 lakh, even after putting together the loans taken from one or more banks, irrespective of the landholding of the family in different names and different loan accounts. Besides, the waiver amount would include both the principal and interest amount together. The waiver was promised by Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) before the December 2018 elections to State Assembly.

As per the extensive guidelines issued by Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, all crop loans sanctioned/ renewed on or after April 1, 2014 and outstanding as on December 11, 2018 are eligible for waiver. However, the waiver amount up to ₹1 lakh does not include processing charges, legal charges, insurance, inspection charges and any other such overheads.

According to Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy there are 5,83,916 farmers in Telangana who have outstanding loan up to ₹25,000. As the State government has decided to waive the outstanding loans up to ₹25,000 in one go, an amount of ₹1,198 crore has been provisioned to be released during the current (March) month itself.

The loan waiver scheme will cover short-term production loans and crop loans against gold given by scheduled commercial banks, cooperative credit institutions including urban cooperative banks and regional rural banks. The guidelines have also specified the loans (advances) which are not eligible for the waiver scheme.

Accordingly, advances against pledge or hypothecation of agriculture produce other than the standing crop, tie-up loans, closed crop loan accounts/written-off loans, loans to joint liability groups (JLGs), rythu mithra groups (RMGs) and loan eligibility cards (LECs) and the loans that are restructured and rescheduled.

The guidelines have also defined short-term production loan as loans given in connection with the raising of crops and to be repaid within 18 months. It will include working capital loan for traditional and non-traditional plantation and horticulture crops.

The guidelines further state that loan waiver in respect of those farmers who have outstanding up to ₹25,000 would be covered in the first phase and for other farmers, with the outstanding amount of more than ₹25,000 and up to ₹1 lakh the waiver would be done in four instalments. It has been estimated that the waiver of outstanding loans beyond ₹25,000 would require another ₹24,738 crore and an allocation of ₹6,225 has been made for 2020-21.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9qgabr/article31092533.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18SNIRANJANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/crop-loan-waiver-to-be-implemented-with-family-as-unit/article31092534.ece
202,2020/03/17,TS loans set to spiral to ₹3.19 lakh crore: Jeevan Reddy,"Government encouraging liquor sale, says Congress MLC

The State government will raise loans to the tune of ₹42,300 crore in the coming financial year pushing Telangana into a debt trap of ₹3.19 lakh crore, Congress MLC T. Jeevan Reddy argued.

At a press conference here, he said the budget figures submitted prove that a massive loan raising exercise is on and budget figures were inflated for this very purpose whereas the actual revenues were much lower. Pushing the State into a huge debt trap seem to be only work this government did, he alleged.

Mr. Reddy charged that the government’s growth was seen only in improving the Excise revenue ensuring people consume liquor ignoring the devastating impact it was having on the households and the rural incomes. Unfortunately, Telangana stands in the first place in liquor sales in the country.

He said at least 10 belt shops were functioning in every village and the government seems to be encouraging them consciously to raise revenues. He demanded removal of belt shops that were playing havoc with families’ economy in the villages and educated youngsters were being addicted to liquor.

Mr. Reddy said the IT sector in Hyderabad was employing 75% non-locals while Telangana youngsters were being denied their share. “When we question the government for IT jobs Finance Minister T. Harish Rao had replied that IT sector has provided catering jobs to our youngsters,” he claimed.

The Congress MLC demanded that 85% of jobs be reserved for Telangana youngsters in the industries that seek government concessions in their business.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cshnas/article31092387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18JEEVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-loans-set-to-spiral-to-319-lakh-crore-jeevan-reddy/article31092388.ece

204,2020/03/17,Uttam urges Centre to set up Turmeric Board,"Telangana has a surplus of 2.61 lakh MTs of turmeric

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) President and Nalgonda MP Uttam Kumar Reddy has demanded immediate intervention by Central government to help the turmeric farmers who are in distress.

Raising the issue during Zero Hour in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, he said the condition of turmeric farmers was distressing and reminded that Union Minister Rajnath Singh had given a specific assurance during elections that a Turmeric Board would be set up in Telangana .

“Today, lakhs of tonnes of turmeric is lying in markets with no buyers. We want the Central government to intervene and set an MSP of ₹ 10,000 per quintal and immediately purchase the produce,” Mr Reddy demanded.

He said the Central government, in its Agriculture Export Policy announced in 2018, had declared turmeric as focussed export. But now, no one is buying the produce forcing the farmers to commit suicide.

The TPCC chief informed that India ranks first, contributing 80% of the world turmeric produce and Telangana stands first in cultivation area and production as well. Turmeric is cultivated in an area of 1.33 lakh acres with a production of 2.81 lakh MTs, involving 1,07,506 farmers.

The estimated value of turmeric production in 2018-19 amounted to ₹ 1,687.25 crore and the cost of cultivation per acre is ₹ 1,19,000.

As per Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University (PJTSAU) survey, the per capita consumption of turmeric is 1.58 gm per day. Therefore, the total required for the Telangana (3.5 crore population) per day is about 55.47 MTs and about 20,245 MTs per year. It leaves Telangana with a surplus of 2.61 Lakh MTs valued at about ₹ 1,569.34 crore which is being exported to other States and countries.

In this scenario, Mr Reddy said turmeric farmers could not sustain unless the Centre sets an MSP of ₹ 10,000 per tonne, take measures to boost exports and this could be achieved only through formation of a Turmeric Board.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ddsrto/article31092452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18UTTAMKUMARREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/uttam-urges-centre-to-set-up-turmeric-board/article31092213.ece

206,2020/03/17,Citizens’ Group welcomes Assembly resolution against CAA,"Urges govt to halt house-listing exercise in State till Census exercise de-linked from NPR data collection

“Citizens against CAA-NRC-NPR”, a broad-based citizens’ group has welcomed the Telangana Assembly resolution passed on Monday against the CAA, NRC and NPR.

The group has been protesting and creating awareness in the State on the above issues. Addressing a media conference here on Tuesday, the representatives of the group said that the resolution was a major victory for the cross-section of civil society groups in Hyderabad and districts across the State against the “communally divisive, anti-Constitutional and oppressive Citizenship Amendment Act” and the nationwide implementation of National Registry of Citizens and National Population Register.

They urged the Telangana government to take immediate concrete steps to transform the Assembly resolution into action. The resolution brought to light that Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had been misleading the nation that NPR was a routine exercise which has nothing to do with NRC.

The Central government has issued directions to the States that the data collection for NPR should be done by States along with the House listing process for Census 2021 from April 1, 2020..

The citizens group demanded that a Government Order should be issued directing the officers that NPR data collection would not be taken up along with the house listing exercise for the census 2021 in the wake of directions issued by the Central government. Telangana government should halt the Census 2021 House-listing exercise until the Centre issued notification de-linking the Census exercise from any NPR data collection. The coronavirus crisis would also provide additional reason to halt the Census exercise until further notice.

The Citizens’group urged State government to file a petition in the Supreme Court against CAA challenging its Constitutionality in line with other States such as Kerala and Rajasthan. State government should also demand the Central government to repeal or amend the Citizenship Rules (2003) so that the legal basis for the nation-wide NRC and NPR would be removed. The MPs of all parties including TRS should take this up in Parliament.

Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao as announced should take the lead in organizing a meeting of Chief Ministers against CAA, NRC and NPR, and build common ground to reverse the recent measures by the Centre. They also urged the government to give instructions to the police not to stop any peaceful protests and community awareness activities on CAA, NRC and NPR.

A PIL seeking demolition of three temples, allegedly constructed on government land in Nagole of Uppal, was filed in the Telangana High Court.

The petitioner Vazeer Prakash Goud, a businessman and ex-corporator from Kothapet, requested the HC to direct the government not to allow any illegal constructions further on government land (survey no. 45) of Nagole revenue village. According to him, the temples Mahankalla Pochamma, Pochamma and Mahankallamma were built by some private persons by grabbing government land.

The seven private persons, the petitioner alleged, were threatening to eliminate people when questioned about the illegal constructions on government land. Mr. Goud stated in his petition that the Assistant Director of Survey and Land Records of Rangareddy district conducted a detailed survey of the land where the temples were erected.

In a letter dated April 1, 2016, the AD wrote to the government that the three temples were constructed by occupying government land. The land grabbers were trying to occupy some private patta lands as well, he charged in the petition.

The meeting of the top officials of the two Telugu States — Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — appears unlikely any time soon.

The Telangana administration has focused its entire attention on checking the spread of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) with Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar busy in continuous interaction with officials concerned and monitoring the remedial measures that are being taken at different levels. The neighbouring AP on its part is working out modalities for resuming the process for elections to local bodies which had been set aside by its State Election Commission amid COVID-19 concerns while it too had enhanced its preparations to counter the threat posed by the coronavirus.

The chief secretaries of the two States — Somesh Kumar and Nilam Sawhney — met on January 30 and held elaborate discussions for close to six hours. The meeting, though conducted in a positive atmosphere, ended inconclusively as the two could not arrive at a consensus on the key reorganization issues. But the officials on the two sides resolved to continue the dialogue as it was the only way to resolve the vexatious issues which had been pending since last six years.

Bhide Committee

The two sides, according to officials, had locked horns over the recommendations of the expert committee headed by retired bureaucrat Sheela Bhide relating to apportionment of assets and liabilities of 89 out of the 91 institutions listed under Schedule IX of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014. The Telangana government had expressed its reservations against the apportionment by the expert committee claiming that the manner in which it was made was “unilateral” and against the interests of the State.

The AP government had prepared the minutes of the January 30 meeting and circulated it to the TS government few weeks ago, but the latter has reportedly not examined the same. “The minutes of the meeting should be studied in detail so that there is clarity about the issues on which there is mutual agreement and the issues where differences still persist. Close examination of the minutes of the meeting helps in chalking out the agenda for the next meeting whenever it is held,” a senior official told The Hindu.

Officials opine that the next meeting between the two States is likely to be held only after addressing the concerns relating to COVID-19 fully and the two States would require time towards this end.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-concerns-push-bifurcation-issues-to-backburner/article31091740.ece
211,2020/03/17,COVID-19: Alert sounded in Singareni coal belt,"Singareni Collieries management closes its schools, clubs, functional halls etc; no biometric attendance for miners, only a register system, launches a slew of preventive measures

In order to check the spread of COVID-19 in the coal miners-dominated areas of the Singareni Collieries Company Limited, the management has sounded a high alert and launched several initiatives to control the spread of disease in the entire coal belt of the north Telangana region.

Already, the management had banned the use of biometric attendance system for miners and others at all places and started a register system. It had also announced the closure of all the Singareni schools and polytechnic colleges. Further, Singareni clubs, function halls, swimming pools and conduct of training classes by the Singareni Seva Samithi to women for self-employment in various trades in the entire coal belt region have been closed.

Anti-viral sprays

To avoid the spread of disease where miners assemble in large numbers at underground and open cast projects, anti-viral sprays were taken up by the management in coordination with the Singareni Hospital. Authorities were also distributing masks to the miners to attend to their duties and to protect themselves from the virus as well as dust pollution.

The Singareni management had also launched a special sanitation drive in the mines as well as miners’ colonies and is conducting door-to-door surveys and creating awareness about the importance of protection from the spread of COVID-19. The Singareni Area hospital had also opened a help desk and the doctors have launched awareness programmes by visiting the mines and residential areas.

Awareness and education

Several banners and posters have come up in the mines and residential areas educating people about the importance of measures to check the spread of COVID-19. People were being told to avoid handshakes and follow the traditional ‘namaste’ .

The management had also given clear instructions to avoid the usage of ACs in all its offices. With the financial year coming to close very soon, the authorities were taking all measures to ensure that miners attend to their duties and participate in achieving the the targeted coal production.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-singareni-pulls-out-all-stops/article31091105.ece

Though no one had any virus symptoms so far, we are taking all precautions and our people are monitoring their movements,” S. Chandrasekhar Reddy, Superintendent of Police, Sangareddy, told The Hindu.

The returnees came from Dubai, USA and Italy. Health officials are calling them every day and checking out their health condition.

Educational institutes like the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IITH), and GITAM had already announced suspension of academic activity till the month end.

213,2020/03/17,"No Naxal movement in Telangana, says DGP","Police got due recognition in the separate Telangana State; government had accorded priority for modernisation of police machinery to provide efficient services to the people, he said

Reiterating that there was no Naxalite movement in the Telangana State, Director General of Police (DGP) M. Mahender Reddy said they were keeping close tabs on suspected naxalite movement if any, and foiling their bid to retain a hold in the region.

“We are watching the Maoists’ movement and not allowing them to intrude and regain their hold in the State. If they arrive, we are ready to weed them out with an iron hand,” he averred.

The DGP, along with top level police officials including Additional DGP (Greyhounds) K. Srinivas Reddy, IG (SBI) Prabhakar Rao, IG (North Zone) Y Nagi Reddy visited the Ramagundam Commissionerate of Police on Monday evening. He conducted a high level meeting with the senior police officials and conducted a review meeting on policing of both Peddapalli and Mancherial districts at NTPC on Tuesday by interacting with the police officials personally.

Check on Maoist intrusion

Talking to newspersons, the DGP said police officials had shared information pertaining to intelligence sharing and the inter-State borders to check the intrusion of Maoists. Mr. Reddy said they were providing better services to the people through friendly policing. “We are planning for more citizen partnership in policing and invite suggestions from the people,” he added.

Further, the State police chief said they were also according priority to take measures to reduce road accidents. “Police got due recognition in the separate Telangana State, and the government had accorded priority for modernisation of police machinery to provide efficient services to the people,” he pointed out.

214,2020/03/17,COVID-19 scare has little impact at Basar,"There is no visible impact of the COVID-19 scare, at least so far, in Basar in Nirmal district, the abode of goddess Gnana Saraswati. According to officials, there was rush of students in the temple until Sunday which is an usual phenomenon if it is exam time.

“There was no rush today and less number of devotees will arrive even on Tuesday which again is normal for this time of the year,” pointed out an official in the temple management committee. Under normal circumstances about 3,000 devotees visit the temple on normal days and the rush increases to about 10,000 on Fridays and other holidays.

“The number of Aksharabhyasams (initiation of a child to the world of letters) also did not diminish until Sunday. On March 13, we sold as many as 96 Aksharabhyasam tickets of the ₹ 1,000 fee category and 128 tickets of ₹ 100 fee category.

“Similarly, the temple sold 126 tickets in the ₹ 1,000 fee category and 138 tickets in the ₹ 100 fee category. We have to wait for a few days more in order to assess if the COVID-19 scare has any impact on the temple town,” the official added.

The Godavari boatmen, however, say turnout at the ghats has declined. “None of the 40 boatmen who take visitors for rides in the river are touching the ₹ 1,000 per day income mark since the last few days,” asserted Tonduru Poshetti, the president of Basar Gangaputra Sangham.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-scare-has-little-impact-at-basar/article31085958.ece

At a time when the State government is taking all out measures to contain the coronavirus spread, a meeting on development of libraries, attended by Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav, is raising several brows.

The meeting was organised by the City Central Library on its premises on Monday, where the Minister attended as chief guest and spoke about the development of 82 libraries in the city limits. Mr. Srinivas Yadav said a total of 10 city libraries have been developed in the first phase using special funds of the district Collector. He issued directions for constitution of a committee to study various issues in the city libraries, and submit a report on the same by month-end.

The meeting was attended by about 150 to 200 people, with about 15 guests sitting crammed on the dais, which might go against the State government’s advisory.

When contacted, Mr. Srinivas Yadav said the government orders were issued against public meetings, and not against in camera gatherings.

Two buildings at GMC Balayogi Stadium too would be used to quarantine asymptomatic air passengers who come from seven countries. This is in addition to the existing quarantine centres at Haritha Valley view resort in Ananthagiri Hills, Vikarabad, Telangana State Forest Academy, Dulapally. Officials said that some more government buildings are being identified for the purpose.

The process of preparing the two buildings in the stadium at Gachibowli, for quarantine centre is under way.

Officials said that the building has capacity to accommodate over 240 beds. While people coming from the seven countries: China, Democratic Republic of Korea, France, Italy, Iran, Germany, Spain and who have symptoms are admitted in Isolation Wards at government hospitals, those who are asymptomatic will be quarantined for 14-days at the facilities immediately after landing in Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad. This is also applicable to people who come from the seven countries via Dubai, Abu Dhabi.

It was published in these columns that if any of them develops symptoms during the quarantine period, they will be taken to isolation wards in government hospitals, and samples will be collected to test for presence of Coronavirus.

Officials said that asymptomatic passengers are being quarantined so that if any one coming from the seven countries are carrying Coronavirus, its spread can be contained if they are quarantined in a building. According to World Health Organisation (WHO), the incubation period for COVID-19 ranges from 1-14 days.

After several countries started taking measures to contain spread of the virus, number of people who land at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad, from the seven countries has fell down to 30 to 40 people in a day.

“We are identifying more government buildings as the number of asymptomatic air passengers will increase as days pass by. Besides, we are also trying to trace people who have come to our State from the seven countries from March 1. They too would be quarantined,” an official said, adding that the 14-days incubation period is complete for people who have landed from March 1.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gachibowli-stadium-to-house-quarantine-facility/article31085910.ece
217,2020/03/17,Patients’ views sought on Gandhi Hospital facilities,"Feedback sent to superintendent

The views of three COVID-19 patients on the medical services, facilities, provided to them at Gandhi Hospital was sought by Health Minister Eatala Rajender who spoke to them over phone on Monday evening.

Their feedback was passed to the hospital’s superintendent Dr. P. Shravan Kumar.

Travel history

The three patients are a 24-year-old woman who returned from Italy, a 48-year-old man who came back from Netherlands, and a man in mid 40’s who has travel history to Scotland. The Health Minister, who spoke to their family members, too assured them that the three people will return home in full health.

Around 10-days ago, Mr Rajender visited Corona ICU at Gandhi Hospital to speak to the index (first) case when the person was still undergoing treatment there.

He was discharged on Friday.

He directed officials to maintain hygiene in toilets at isolation wards, and provide people admitted there with all facilities, including good food. The Health Minister, who met Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao at Telangana Legislative Assembly, explained to him measures taken for containment of Coronavirus, treatment provided to COVID-19 patients, quarantine facility at Gachibowli and other details.

He directed senior officials in Health department to procure essential resources such as N-95 masks, personal protection Equipment (PPE), gloves, and other resources without floating tenders.

218,2020/03/17,Tracking SARI patients holds the key,"For early detection of Coronavirus spread in Telangana, government and private hospitals were directed to report Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) or pneumonia cases to the Telangana Health Department on a daily basis.

If there were to be a spike in number of SARI or pneumonia cases in a locality, officials will investigate if Coronavirus is spreading in there.

This clinical surveillance will serve as early indicator of the spread.

Director of Public Health Dr G Srinivas Rao, who issued the directions, stated in a memo that this will be used as surrogate marker for COVID-19.

“A rising trend of SARI/Pneumonia cases will trigger the need for further investigation for COVID-19,” he said.

The criteria for reporting the cases are: 1) age above 15 years 2) fever 3) any respiratory symptoms -- severe cough or shortness of breath 4) hospitalisaiton. If a patient meets the four criteria points, the case should be immediately reported to State Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) teams.

“The reporting shall start retrospectively from March 8 2020 to understand the baseline admissions of the facility,” Dr Rao stated.

The clinical surveillance will be taken up at hospitals where majority of patients get admitted for severe respiratory problems identical to COVID-19.

Teaching hospitals, district hospitals, area hospitals, corporate and other private hospitals are being identified as sentinel sites for the surveillance.

219,2020/03/17,Door-to-door survey to identify foreign returnees,"13 suspected patients who arrived in Karimnagar from Indonesia referred to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad

To check the spread of COVID-19, district medical and health officials have decided to conduct door-to-door survey to identify the people showing symptoms of coronavirus and also those who have recently returned from foreign countries.

Initially, the survey would be conducted in Karimnagar town in all the six urban primary health centres (UPHC) limits. All the 30 ANMs, 30 ASHA workers and six supervisors would participate in the survey. After identification of the suspected cases, they would be shifted to the isolation ward at the district headquarters hospital.

Mass awareness

On this occasion, the medical team would distribute pamphlets on the measures to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. They would also be informed about quarantine measures for those showing symptoms such as cold, cough and fever.

The medical department has also decided to seek the participation of Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas (MEPMA) and women self-help groups to identify suspected cases in the town.

In the meantime, district medical and health officials have shifted the 13 COVID-19 suspects from Indonesia who arrived in the town by train on Monday, for treatment at Gandhi Hospital, Hyderabad. Their reasons for arrival is still not clear. After treatment at the isolation ward here, they were referred to Hyderabad, said DM&HO G. Sujatha, adding that there is no cause for alarm.

Anganwadi centres

District leaders of Telangana Vyavasaya Karmika Sangham have submitted a memorandum to Collector K. Shashanka here on Monday urging the State government to declare holidays for anganwadi centres too.

220,2020/03/17,Stepping up awareness with folk art,"Local artistes turn to Palle Suddulu to sensitise masses about personal hygiene

Joining hands to raise awareness on COVID-19 and prevent its spread, a group of town-based folk artistes launched a cultural campaign to educate masses on basic protective measures against the deadly virus.

Though entrusted with the task of spreading awareness on HIV/AIDS prevention under the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO)’s outreach initiatives, the cultural troupe led by noted folk artiste Poluri Ramu volunteered to conduct an awareness campaign through the popular folk art form ‘Palle Suddulu’ to help the administration tackle the COVID-19 threat.

The small troupe, comprising five artistes including Mr Ramu, staged a slew of cultural programmes at the ZP Centre, the District Headquarters Hospital premises and various other localities in the town on Monday.

The artistes highlighted preventive measures such as frequently washing hands with soap, wearing protective masks, avoiding mass gatherings and desisting from shaking hands to combat the spread of COVID-19.

“Apart from our regular HIV/AIDS awareness campaign, we have conducted a separate programme to sensitise masses on preventive measures and also to dispel misconceptions to protect themselves and others from COVID-19,” said Ramu, leader of the troupe.

Palle Suddulu is a popular folk art form that still holds sway over masses, he said, adding that their campaign was mainly aimed at educating labourers, farm workers and other toiling masses about hand hygiene and other protective measures against coronavirus.

221,2020/03/17,"Undeterred by COVID-19, pilgrims throng Vemulawada","Monday considered auspicious day, thousands participate in pujas and offer the traditional ‘kode mokku’

Even as the State government had instructed people to avoid huge public gatherings to check the spread of COVID-19, the rush of pilgrims was undeterred at Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada of Rajanna-Sircilla district on Monday, the auspicious day to worship the deities.

The pilgrims arrived normally to the temple shrine since Sunday evening and offered prayers to the presiding deities after taking a holy dip in the dharmagundam on Monday and formed serpentine queues. The devotees competed to offer traditional ‘kode mokku’ (tying of an ox) at the shrine.

Though the Devasthanam authorities had erected posters educating the people about COVID-19 and measures to be taken to avoid the spread of the disease, the pilgrims rush was normal. The temple staff was given masks to wear while discharging their duties. But, the pilgrims were visiting the temple without any masks and offering prayers. Only a few pilgrims were seen wearing masks and some others were covering their face with a handkerchief and ‘chunni’.

An ardent devotee of Lord Shiva, Vajramma from Shathrajpalli village of Vemulawada mandal said that she had come to offer prayers to Rajanna (Lord Shiva) and she does not know about COVID-19 disease. When informed about the advice not to attend huge gatherings as the disease would spread, she asked: “Why was the temple kept open for the devotees to come and offer prayers?”

The temple officials said that the pilgrims rush was normal and as expected on every Monday, which was considered an auspicious day. The day-long pilgrims rush at the shrine was around 20,000 to 30,000 on Monday, they said and added that they had accorded priority for sanitation by cleaning and spraying bleaching powder etc. They had planned to take up sanitisation of the queue lines, but failed to do so because of heavy pilgrims rush. The officials also said that the number of pilgrims had not declined during the recent Shiva Kalyanotsavam festivities and hoped that the pilgrims would be very high on Sri Ramanavami festival on April 2.

The Vemulawada temple shrine may witness around two lakh devotees to witness the celestial wedding of Lord Rama with his consort Seeta on Sri Ramanavami celebrations. Incidentally, Vemulawada is the only temple shrine in the country where the devotees including men, women and transgenders marry lord Shiva on the festival to seek fulfilment of their wishes and freedom from ailments.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/yrtxpi/article31085589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17EMULAADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/undeterred-by-covid-19-pilgrims-throng-vemulawada/article31085590.ece
222,2020/03/17,Warangal tourist places see thin crowds,"People avoid public places following government advisory against crowding

The government’s instructions against crowding of people amid fears of coronavirus spreading has discouraged people from frequenting temples and tourist places across the erstwhile Warangal district.

The crowds at the historic Bhadrakali and ancient Thousand Pillar temple in Hanamkonda thinned during the last two days after the appeal by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and consequent actions by the officials of various departments.

On an average about 2,000 people visit historic Bhadrakali temple daily while it was 5,000 to 6,000 on Fridays and Sunday. Speaking to The Hindu, chief priest B Seshu said,“The fear of coronavirus is growing and as a preventive measure, most prefer to stay away from crowds.” The chief priest of Thousand Pillar temple, Gangu Upendra Sharma said there was drastic fall in the number of people visiting this popular temple. According to him, about 5,000 people from different places, mostly tourists, visit the temple daily while it would be 10,000 on holidays and Sunday. During the last two days, people were hardly seen as the State government came out with a series of steps to prevent gathering of people such as closing of bars and restaurants, cinema halls and schools.

Meanwhile, the District Forest Officer Pradeep Shetty of Mulugu district said following the government’s instructions, they have closed down the popular Bogatha waterfalls in Wazedu mandal and Deer Park near Laknavaram lake. Ecotourism coordinator K Suman said the number of visitors to the Laknavaram lake dwindled considerably on Sunday when it was the time they witness huge crowds.

223,2020/03/17,The questions COVID-19 may be posing to corporates,"Do you wake up to the necessity of a business continuity plan only when a crisis looms on the horizon? Or, do you have one in place much before a contingency arises?

In 2015, when Chennai “went under” due to an unusual flood situation, many software companies, especially those functioning on its IT Corridor, were scrambling around to make arrangements to ensure that business operations continued without any break.

In most of the cases, the affected company shifted operations to any of other metros where it had an office. The crisis would have driven home to some companies, the importance of having a business continuity plan in place. The December Deluge, as it is remembered in Chennai, was not unusual in delivering this message. Following every crisis that disrupts regular business functions, there is bound to be some introspection, which however proves fruitful only if it translates into efforts to have a business continuity plan. It may be difficult to predict when a crisis will strike, but chalking up a broad spectrum of crises that can be expected and having back-up work plans should not be a challenge.

K.S. Raja Rajasekar, deputy general manager - HR, Kone Elevator, says that companies should have a basic business contingency plan; and during a crisis situation they should only be fine-tuning it, factoring in the unique aspects of the ongoing crisis.

That takes us to the question: What are the salient features of an effective business continuity plan?

Process simplification

Creating a template of regular processes with crisis situations in mind is an essential aspect of such an exercise.

This template simplifies the regular processes so that anybody down the totem pole can perform them, says Raja Rajasekar.

Process simplification, Raja points out, will enable employees of allied departments to perform the functions of a department that may be hard hit by a crisis.

Parallel workforce

In certain places, geographical and geo-political risks may be apparent, but there would be no telling when it would become a problem to be dealt with.

“Companies may venture into certain places despite apparent geographical and geo-political risks, as the benefits may outnumber the risks.

“However, the risks can’t be ignored, and these proactive companies will have a ‘parallel site’ elsewhere with a workforce trained to take up any ‘emergency’ work that may arise from ‘site A’. When there is no emergency work to attend to, this ‘parallel workforce’ will be going about its regular work in its own geographical space,” says Kamal Karanth, co-founder, Xpheno, a specialist staffing organisation.

Risk to people

From the viewpoint of day-to-day operations as well as larger organisational management, risk involving people can’t be swept under the carpet — usually, people readiness constitutes the major part of any response to a crisis. “Some companies ensure that the CEO and COO don’t travel by the same flight — that is a measure that factors in the extreme unpredictability-of-life quotient. There are organisations that will groom successors, who can step in quickly when there is a leadership-related crisis pertaining to either day-to-day operations or the larger management of the organisation.

“For the sake of keeping costs down, senior leaders may sometimes also perform functional roles, but this can come back to haunt an organisation when the unforeseen strikes.

“Companies also have to look at the span of control of a leader, restricting it to a manageable number of reportees, if necessary, so that there is no breakdown, when this person is faced with an emergency situation,” says Karanth.

Creative de-risking

There is no limit to how a crisis can be tided over, because each comes with its own challenges, and an effective response to one may not always just involve reorganising work patterns, but also effecting tweaks in the mundane aspects of organisational functioning. It may sometimes call for out-of-the-box restructuring of regular work. As part of its contribution to prevent the spread of COVID-19, WaterScience has introduced a work-from-home policy for all functions except for production. However, the production process is characterised by an interesting modification.

“We are in the business of manufacturing products and obviously, that is one function that can’t be performed from home: and so we have instituted a ‘contact-less manufacturing’ process that has been split into four steps — Releasing raw material, sub-assembly, full assembly and packaging,” says Pavithra Rao, co-founder and vice-president — Growth and Revenue at WaterScience. Only one of the four processes will happen at any given time and only four people will be in the 16,000 sq.ft facility at any point of time. “The facility is sanitised after every group of employees leaves and before the next group steps in. With this process, we ensure minimal contact and exposure, while ensuring our shower and tap filters get manufactured,” says Pavithra.

“In Bengaluru, as a response to the COVID-19 situation, a business major with 14 offices in the city has undertaken many measures beyond providing 50 percent of its workforce with the work-from-home option. In each of its offices in Bengaluru, it has shut down the cafeterias, but keeps the kitchens working.

‘‘Employees can’t congregate at the cafeterias and have food there, but the company has designed a system for people to order food from the kitchens and have it delivered at their desks. At each of its offices, the company has reduced entry to just one entrance, to pre-empt the possibility of laxity in monitoring at some entrances,” explains Karanth.

Be open to new ideas

Buildmet fibres, a Bengaluru-based packaging industry that employs nearly 1000 employees, has sought suggestions from its workforce to tide over the situation arising from the COVID-19 situation.

“The work-from-home option is not possible for us and we work round-the-clock including on Sundays. Besides following all the necessary precautions during the week, we set aside Sundays, when a large part of our workforce doesn’t work, for carrying out an extensive sanitisation exercise around our facility. We are interacting with companies from other industries to see if any other best practices can be followed. Meanwhile, we have asked our employees to come with new ideas,” says S. Ramakrishnan, managing director, Buildmet fibres.

Staggered work hours, teams that alternate between work-from-home and work-from-office systems are among various ways in which companies are functioning in these COVID-19 times.

An investment banking company has split its teams into ‘blue’ and ‘white’ teams where they will be working alternately from home and office.

Long-term planning

As we mentioned earlier, exigency planning should be hardwired into the DNA of an organisation. There should be many business continuity plans addressing a variety of situations placed in cold storage, and when a crisis strikes, the energy should be focussed only on enhancing the best-suited and relevant plan to meet the unique challenges posed by this particular crisis.

Karanth points out that any effective business continuity planning will involve all the stakeholders in a business ecosystem: “To give an example, supply chain de-risking is a key component of de-risking, but does not usually get the importance it deserves.

‘‘A company may find alternative ways of working to tide over a crisis, but it can still be in the danger zone if it does not factor in the risks faced by its suppliers.

‘‘And if it overly depends on one supplier, the risk increased manifold. So, proactive companies will work with multiple suppliers, and this applies to talent suppliers”",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/wglfc6/article31092470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18OPCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/the-questions-covid-19-may-be-posing-to-corporates/article31092472.ece
224,2020/03/17,Thoughts on canvas,"Women artists explore different themes at an ongoing show in Salar Jung museum

Salar Jung’s western block is bustling with a new energy. Visitors are drawn towards artworks echoing voices of women artists. It is a celebratory mood as artists — a mix of students and professionals — enjoy the spotlight. Sparkling with creativity and colours, the show organised by Hyderabad Art Society is a result of a three-day art camp. “It will be a month-long art celebration,” shares Society’s president Ramana Reddy. Fifty students from JNTU Fine Arts College, Sri Venkateswara Fine Arts College, Hyderabad Central University, and Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University have been part of the camp. “We had never conducted a camp for International Women’s Day. The intent was to provide a platform for women to present their narrative and they did very well,” he adds.

A painting titled Spring

Ana Smeeringer has always been fascinated with the attitude a woman’s face conveys. In her work, a woman looks boldly into the camera. “An Indian woman represents strength and her courage to to speak, get heard and not mistreated,” she says and recalls a story of a 12-year-old young girl who ran away from the village with her mother to Hyderabad. “The girl said she was being mistreated and she survived. I was moved reading her story on social media. And when I got a chance to be part of the art camp, I connected the dots.”

A journalist turned self-artist, Ana has travelled across countries due to her American husband’s work. Her work speaks the language of the country she has lived. Her previous stay in Holland created serious works. “It is a different country and feels a bit gloomy because of weather and seriousness of people. One could see that reflects in art works too.” Filled with acrylic colours, her canvas in India is bold, bright depicting women empowerment. She looks forward to April when she travels to Dubai and then to New .

Fourur women with different expressions gaze from Seluvu Kandukuri’s painting titled ‘Gaze’. The budding artist focuses on the discomfort that causes because of staring. She says, “I was disturbed with the way women passed comments and judged the woman veterinarian who was gang-raped and murdered in Hyderabad. A woman should be a pillar of support to another woman but not stare or judge because of her clothes and personality .” Her painting depicts how women stare and cause distress.

Standing in front of her painting ‘Flourishing Life’, Manasa Kachikayala calls it an ode to the fearless woman. She blends stitching and technology showing women have made inroads into different fields. Womb is the origin of life and two ovaries in the form of women take the shape of a tree branching out to new horizons. “Women are in every field today,” she says with pride. The colours — happiness for yellow, birth for green and white for peace play a significant role. She explains the process, “I was inspired by the switchboard in my room and created a sketch but I couldn’t make the texture of a tree. My mother suggested why not I stitch. I took her idea and stitched with needle and wool and finished the work in two days.”

225,2020/03/17,BJP-JJP regime pushing Haryana into debt trap: Bhupendra Singh Hooda,"Govt. should come up with a time-bound plan to control revenue deficit, says the former Chief Minister.

Leader of Opposition in the Haryana Assembly and former Chief Minister Bhupendra Singh Hooda on Tuesday questioned the fiscal management of the State, saying the official data indicated that Haryana was being pushed into a deep debt trap by the ruling BJP-JJP government.

“We demand that the government issue a White Paper on the increasing debt, which has reached ₹1.81 lakh crore and tell the State where all this money has been spent. When the BJP came to power in 2014, it had raised a massive hue and cry on the debts taken by the previous governments,” said Mr. Hooda, talking to journalists.

“Haryana was earlier counted among the rich States, today it is in the list of States in deep debt. The proportion of total government expenditure on loan and interest payments is increasing due to rising debt. In 2016-17, 18.51% of the total debt was used to repay the debt, which has now increased to 28.61%. The government is walking the dangerous road of partying with borrowed money,” he said.

The former Chief Minister said the government should come up with a time-bound plan to control the ever-increasing revenue deficit and cut fiscal deficit. Comparing the fiscal discipline during his term, Mr. Hooda said the fiscal deficit was 2.07% during his term in 2013-14 but has increased to 2.82% in 2019-20. Similarly, the revenue deficit which was only 0.97% in 2013-14 has increased to 1.76% in 2019-20.

‘Compensate farmers’

Mr. Hooda added that farmers in the State were falling into a debt trap due to the government’s indifference. “The government should compensate the damage caused by hailstorms and unseasonal rain at the earliest. The government should assess the loss suffered by farmers and compensate them by output and MSP of crops, not by the size of the landholdings as the farmers have lost standing crops,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/v2zabw/article31093577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17-HOODA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-jjp-regime-pushing-state-into-debt-trap/article31093578.ece
226,2020/03/17,Opposition slams Punjab govt.,"‘Claims of achievements nothing but a pack of lies’

The Opposition parties in Punjab have termed the claims of ‘achievements’ by the ruling Congress government on completion of three years in office as a pack of lies and accused it of failing to fulfil its election promises.

Former Deputy Chief Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Tuesday described the three years of Amarinder Singh-led Congress rule as “a period when Punjab remained a headless State with no government visible either in the civil secretariat or in villages, towns and cities.”

Mr. Badal said under the Congress regime the people of Punjab have got nothing except betrayal, indifference and neglect.

“As matter of fact, the last three years had witnessed an end to all pro-people measures launched by the previous SAD-BJP government, including making the State power surplus and novel healthcare measures like free cancer treatment,” he said.

‘No loan waiver’

Accusing the Congress government of not fulfilling any promise made to the people, Mr. Badal said: “Forget implementing a ₹90,000 crore farm loan waiver, the government has not even released one rupee to any farmer from the ₹3,000 crore allocated for loan waiver to farmers in last year’s budget.

Aam Aadmi Party MLA and Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema said the Congress government was painting a ‘rosy’ picture in the report card of its three-year ‘achievements’, but the truth was that the government had failed to fulfill its election promises.

The All India Students’ Union has demanded the release of two of its activists in Lucknow who were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police for protesting against the government in two separate cases.

AISA U.P. vice-president Nitin Raj was arrested on charges of allegedly rioting, defacing and damaging a heritage site and misbehaving, assaulting and looting foreigner tourists near the Hussainabad clock tower here on March 15.

Several hundred women have been staging a protest at the site against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act since January 17.

AISA said the charges against the two were fabricated.

‘Drop charges’

“We demand all political prisoners and people illegally arrested on fabricated and false charges be immediately released and all charges be dropped,” AISA said in a statement.

Mr. Raj was booked along with 22 others and 100-150 other unnamed protesters, who have been accused of raising provocative slogans while felicitating two persons who were released on bail in connection with last December’s violence.

Ashwani Yadav was arrested along with Congress worker Sudhanshu Bajpai on Saturday and booked for allegedly putting up posters displaying the ‘criminal records’ of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya and several other BJP leaders at different places in Lucknow.

‘Part of conspiracy’

Police alleged that the accused put up the posters allegedly to spoil social harmony and spread disaffection as part of a “conspiracy”.

As per the First information Report lodged at the Hazratganj police station, the posters carried objectionable and derogatory material and “malicious” words in an attempt to spread “disaffection” and hatred in society.

The 33-year-old man, a researcher at Universita degli Studi di Milano in Italy, was admitted to the Capital Hospital in Bhubaneswar last Saturday. His swab test report late on Sunday night showed positive for novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

Three ticket examiners, who are railway employees, along with a bedroll staffer and two catering staff – who are contractual employees – have been sent on self quarantine, the official said.

“They have been asked to be self quarantined and instructed to report to the railway medical authority in case they develop symptoms,” said J.P. Mishra, spokesperson, East Coast Railway.

Mr. Mishra said it was “pure luck” that the coach in which the infected patient was travelling was detached at Bhubaneshwar for routine maintenance work, thus restricting the possibility of the virus spreading on the return journey.

“So, it was lucky that no passenger travelled in the same coach as the COVID-19 patient from Bhubaneshwar to Delhi,” he said.

The official said the railways has already provided details of 72 passengers who travelled in the same coach as the COVID-19 positive patient to the authorities.

The government has identified 53 people, including the doctor and staff of a private clinic visited by the patient who have all been suggested home quarantine as a precautionary measure, State government officials said.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said the Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla's decision to not allow members from Tamil Nadu ask supplementaries was “unacceptable” and an “insult to the people of the State”.

Parliament proceedings as it happened on March 17, 2020

“The people of Tamil Nadu have every single right to defend their language, to believe in their language and to speak in their language and what is being done is absolutely unacceptable,” he told reporters as he walked out in protest.

Earlier, the House witnessed ruckus and members from the DMK, the Congress and the NCP staged a walk out on being denied an opportunity to ask supplementary questions during the Question Hour.

It started with BJP's Arvind Kumar Sharma saying Hindi should be made the official language of India. Opposition members were on their feet when Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai was replying to a question related to official language.

Mr. Gandhi intervened, saying it was an issue at the heart of the people of Tamil Nadu and supplementaries should be allowed. As the Speaker took up the next question during the Question Hour, DMK leader T.R. Baalu vociferously protested that they should be allowed to ask supplementary questions.

When the Speaker continued with the next question, members from various Opposition parties, including the DMK, the Congress and the NCP walked out of the House. Trinamool Congress members, however, did not join the walkout.

Addressing the media outside, Mr Gandhi once again referred to Monday's Question Hour when he claimed that he was not allowed a second supplementary to his starred question on 50 wilful defaulters.

“I am a Member of Parliament, I have certain rights and he can’t take away my rights. But today, our Tamil MPs wanted to ask a supplementary about the Tamil language... This is an absolute insult to the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said.

In a tweet, Mr. Gandhi called it a departure from established parliamentary practice.

“The people of Tamil Nadu were disrespected in Parliament today when the Speaker refused to allow a supplementary question on the #Tamil language. I strongly protest this injustice done to the Tamil people & the disregard for established practises & traditions of Parliament,” he said.

During the Zero Hour, leader of the single largest Opposition party, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, spoke about the hike in the Excise duty on petrol and diesel. He alleged that the government had cheated the common man.

236,2020/03/17,PIL plea filed against U.P. ordinance on damage to public property,"Petition wants order to be suspended

A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition has been filed in the Allahabad High Court seeking the suspension of or stay against the ordinance brought by the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government for the recovery of damage to public and private property during protests, bandhs or riots.

The plea filed by lawyer Shashank Tripathi prays the court to issue a writ order or direction declaring the ordinance “ultra vires” to the Constitution.

Also read | Anti-CAA protests: 28 in Lucknow told to pay ₹64 lakh for damage to property

“To evade from justifying itself from court of law, the State has played mischief upon the Constitution,” argues Mr. Tripathi in the plea, referring to the questions asked of it by the HC and the Supreme Court in the ‘name and shame’ hoardings episode.

The Uttar Pradesh government recently armed itself with a stringent new law to recover compensation from those who damage public and private property during protests and riots.

Claims for compensation will be decided by designated ‘Claims Tribunals’ that will be authorised to investigate complaints and assess the damage.

The State government on Sunday notified the ‘Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damage to Public and Private Property Ordinance, 2020, promulgated by the Governor, Anandiben Patel. The State Cabinet met under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday and approved the ordinance.

The PIL plea says that the ordinance under question is not consistent and is in contradiction and departure from the ordinance making power of the State provided under Article 213 of Indian Constitution.

Owing to the “quasi-judicial nature” of the tribunals provided in the Constitution, the ordinance talks about judicial activity but without procedural and functional safeguard required at law, the plea says.

It also contends that the ordinance under question has not been promulgated on. As such, the same has got no force as legislature and is redundant.

The ordinance in question, being in excess of competence, is unconstitutional, it further said.

As per the ordinance, the owner of any private property or the head of the office concerned, in respect of public property, may file claims for compensation within three months of any incident that causes any damage during public protests, bandhs or riots. The claim can cite as respondents those who “exhorted” or “instigated” or “committed” acts that caused the damage, as well as those named by the police.

Every order or award passed by the Claims Tribunal would be “final” and no appeal against such orders would be “maintainable” before any court, it said. Also, no civil court will have the jurisdiction to entertain any questions regarding the claims.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ektjj/article30868814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIACITIZENSHIPLAWPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pil-plea-filed-against-up-ordinance-on-damage-to-public-property/article31089618.ece
237,2020/03/17,"Rebels in Bengaluru speaking under duress, must be freed immediately: Madhya Pradesh Minister","Rajya Sabha nominations of Scindia, Solanki accepted despite Congress objection

Reacting to Congress rebels’ assertion that they are in Bengaluru of their own will, Madhya Pradesh Law Minister P.C. Sharma on Tuesday reiterated that they were making such remarks under duress, as all of them stood by the government just 10 days back.

Also read: Kamal Nath rules out floor test after meeting Governor

At a press conference at the Pradesh Congress Committee office here, workers played videos of three rebels, first removed as Ministers and whose resignations as lawmakers were accepted recently, to portray they vouched for the Kamal Nath government for keeping poll promises, publicised its schemes and even hit back at the BJP .

Parliament proceedings as it happened on March 17, 2020

“How could their minds change in just 10 days? This clearly shows they are speaking under duress. They must be freed immediately so that they can take a call on their political future on their own,” said Mr. Sharma.

In Bengaluru, the 16 MLAs pledged their allegiance to Jyotiraditya Scindia who recently crossed over to the BJP, but on the question of joining the party in tow, they said they would think over it.

'No family members present'

Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Speaker N.P. Prajapati also informed Governor Lalji Tandon that the MLAs, had written their resignations under duress, as neither they nor their family members had appeared before him during submissions.

“If the resignation letters were presented willingly, then wouldn’t have their family members, acquaintances or their workers been present? This confirms the apprehension that surely the letters have been written under pressure,” Mr Prajapati wrote to Mr. Tandon. “Isn’t this apparently a violation of the fundamental Right to Freedom under the Constitution?

As for the MLAs, pledging allegiance to Jyotiraditya Scindia who had switched over to the BJP, releasing videos on social media and holding press conferences to reassert they were in Bengaluru of their own accord, Mr. Prajapati asked: “Like other politicians of the State, are they giving statements before the press willingly in an independent atmosphere without fear?”

Earlier, the Speaker had served notices on 22 rebel MLAs, reportedly held hostage by the BJP at a resort, asking them to appear before him to attest their resignations that were submitted by BJP leaders. So far, Mr. Prajapati has accepted resignations of six MLAs, who were removed as Ministers earlier, claiming they were not fit to be members as they failed to appear on two occasions.

On March 15, the BJP made public letters ostensibly written by the 16 MLAs to the Speaker that given “the bad law and order situation” and “uncertainty” in the State, they would not be able to appear before him. They requested him to accept their resignation as he had done for the six Ministers.

Mr. Prajapati wrote to the Governor that despite directions to them under rule 276-1(B) relating to the functioning of the Vidhan Sabha to appear before the Speaker, they had failed to appear. And even during the session on March 16, they remained absent.

“Family members of some of them have even expressed concern over their security,” he wrote, “As the presiding Speaker of the Vidhan Sabha, I am extremely worried about these members going missing.”

He appealed to the Governor to ensure the return of the “missing MLAs”, to quell apprehensions of their family members and relatives.

Held in captivity, says Nath

Amid relentless demands of the BJP to hold the floor test, Chief Minister Kamal Nath has repeatedly stated before the Governor that there was no point to it if the MLAs continued to be “ held in captivity” allegedly by the BJP and under the protection of the Karnataka police.

Without these MLAs, Congress is left with 92 legislators, while two BSP, an SP and an independent MLA have backed the government in the past. On the other hand, the BJP has 107 MLAs in the 230-member house, where the effective strength is 222 and the majority mark is 112.

And the BJP accused the Congress government of “pressing, threatening and luring” families of rebels using government officials. Party vice president and former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “We are preparing a list of such officials, and want to make it clear they won’t be spared. It would be wise for them to stick to their administrative roles, and not immorally interfere in politics.”

On Tuesday, Returning Officer A.P. Singh accepted Rajya Sabha nominations of Mr. Scindia and Sumer Singh Solanki of the BJP after considering written objections of Congress nominees Digvijaya Singh and Phool Singh Baraiya, who sought the rejection of their nominations on Monday. While Mr. Digvijaya Singh claimed Mr. Scindia had not furnished details pertaining to cases pending against him, Mr. Baraiya contended that Mr. Solanki’s nomination must be rejected as his resignation as a lecturer at a government college was accepted only a day after he filed his nomination on March 13.

The BJP has rubbished Mr. Nath’s claim on Monday night that it had moved a no-confidence motion in the Vidhan Sabha, and the Congress-led government was ready to prove its majority.

The Congress government was employing all means to save itself now, BJP chief whip in the Assembly Narottam Mishra said. “They are spreading a new lie that we have brought a no-confidence motion. We didn’t bring any such motion. In a notice for it, there are accusations and proofs, and it’s altogether a different process.”

BJP’s affidavit

Instead, the BJP had filed an affidavit with the Speaker relating to the “wilful disobedience” by Mr. Nath of the Governor’s direction to hold a floor test on Monday, he said.

Mr. Nath called on Governor Lalji Tandon on Monday night to thank him for the address to the Assembly, as before a vote of thanks could be given earlier in the day, the Assembly was adjourned.

Speaking with reporters later, Mr. Nath said, “I have discussed the present political situation in the State with him, and informed him we were fine with everything under the ambit of the Constitution and law.”

After the address, Mr. Tandon advised members that given the turmoil in the State those with responsibility should “work independently” and “stick to Constitutional principles”.

Mr. Nath said, “The BJP is saying repeatedly that we don’t have a majority, and demanding a floor test. So, we told them if they believed so, they should bring in a no-confidence motion. Today, they have brought it, and given the proposal to the Speaker. We will prove our majority. And in addition, those 16 MLAs held hostage should also be brought, and made independent.”

Reacting, Mr. Mishra said, “Since those held hostage are from your party, why should we bring them back? Moreover, if you have a majority in the House, then what’s the problem with a floor test?""",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/article19140123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTHMINISTERNAROTTAMMISHRAREPORTCARDPRESSCONFERENCEBHO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/did-not-move-no-confidence-motion-in-madhya-pradesh-assembly-says-bjp-chief-whip-narottam-mishra/article31089368.ece
238,2020/03/17,Supreme Court tells M.P. govt to respond to Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s plea by March 18,"Former M.P. Chief Minister and nine other BJP MLAs had sought a vote of confidence

The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Kamal Nath government time till 10.30 a.m. on March 18 to respond to a petition filed by former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and nine other BJP MLAs seeking a vote of confidence to be held on the floor of the Legislative Assembly against the Congress ruling dispensation in the State.

A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta said the “urgency” of the situation demanded a hearing on March 18 itself.

“We will have to issue notice. The appropriate thing would be to issue a short notice and keep it for tomorrow,” Justice Chandrachud orally addressed senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi for Mr. Chouhan and nine other MLAs.

“Issue notice in view of the urgency of the situation and notice is returnable at 10.30 am at March 18. Liberty to serve the notice through email,” the Supreme Court ordered.

Also read: Ready for floor test, ball in Speaker’s court: Kamal Nath | Kamal Nath rules out floor test after meeting Governor

The court also gave liberty to serve notice to 16 MLAs have also tendered their resignations.

The petition has arraigned the Speaker of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Chief Minister Kamal Nath, Principal Secretary of Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly, State of Madhya Pradesh through Chief Secretary and the Governor as respondents.

Mr. Chouhan and his fellow BJP legislators, who approached the Supreme Court on March 16, wanted the floor test to be held immediately, possibly within the next 12 hours. They challenged the decision of the Assembly Speaker to adjourn the floor test to March 26. Mr. Chouhan informed the court that “horse-trading is at its peak” now in the State.

“Any deferment of the floor test will further encourage horse-trading and would be in utter violation of the directions issued by the Governor and the law laid down by this court and the spirit and basic structure of the Constitution,” the BJP leaders contended.

The demand for a floor test arose after the recent departure of Jyotiraditya Scindia from the State’s ruling Congress.

The petition said 22 Congress party legislators resigned on account of their dissatisfaction with Mr. Nath’s “non-fulfilment of promises made prior to elections”. They tendered their resignation to the Speaker on March 10.

It is believed that their resignations have reduced the present Congress government’s numbers in the House to a minority.

“Since the government appears to have lost the majority in the House and the Chief Minister had himself expressed willingness to conduct the floor test, the Governor, in exercise of his constitutional powers, by letter dated March 14, directed the Chief Minister to conduct floor test in the House and prove his majority on March 16, when the Budget Session of the Assembly begins,” the petition said.

However, despite the clear-cut directions issued by the Governor to the Chief Minister to seek vote of confidence and prove his majority on the floor of the House on March 16 after the address of the Governor, the confidence vote has not been included in the business of the House for the day.

“The direction of the Governor is, thus, intentionally and wilfully been defied. The Chief Minister and his party leaders have publicly declined to conduct the floor test,” the petition said.

Read: Political vacuum in Congress after Scindia’s exit

The BJP leaders’ petition reiterated that with the “lack of confidence and resignation” of the 22 MLAs, out of which the resignation of six legislators have been accepted by the Speaker, the Kamal Nath government has been reduced to a minority.

“It has no moral, legal, democratic or constitutional right to remain in power even for a single day. All possible attempts are being made by the Chief Minister to convert his minority government into majority by giving all possible threats, allurements to the members of the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha. The horse-trading is at its peak,” the petition said.

Whenever a situation has arisen where the issue of majority of a government in the House, the apex court has always issued directions for immediate conduct of floor test.

Both the Speaker and the Chief Minister have deliberately defied the Governor and violated fundamental rights.

239,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | Maharashtra Police suspends drunk driving test,"At 39, Maharashtra has so far recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country

In a bid to protect police personnel from novel coronavirus infection, Maharashtra Highway Police has suspended breath-analyser tests needed to check drunk driving, a senior officer said.

A circular in this regard was issued by Vinay Kargaonkar, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Maharashtra Highway Police, on Monday.

“Outbreak of coronavirus has been reported in the State. To contain the spread of the virus, the police personnel need to take precautionary measures accordingly.

“Hence, Traffic Police personnel in all police units should not conduct breath-analyser tests for alcohol consumption by motorists,” stated the circular.

The test would be resumed once the situation gets normal, he added.

Kargaonkar told PTI that that the decision was taken to prevent further spread of coronavirus infection.

He said police personnel are vulnerable to the infection because they have to place the breath-analyser apparatus into the mouth of motorists to check whether they are driving drunk.

240,2020/03/17,We are in Bengaluru at our own will: Madhya Pradesh rebel MLAs,"Rebel Congress MLAs from Madhya Pradesh holed up in Bengaluru interacted with media persons on Tuesday morning and clarified that they were “not kept captive” by anyone but were of their own free will. Several MLAs and ministers attacked Kamal Nath-led State government and its functioning, which they claim pushed them to resign.

The MLAs also claimed they were in Bengaluru because “they were not safe in Madhya Pradesh.”

This comes hours before petition by BJP leader Shivaraj Singh Chouhan seeking an immediate floor test will come up for hearing in Supreme Court. Chief Minister Kamal Nath has repeatedly alleged Congress MLAs have been held captive by BJP in Bengaluru.

Rajwardhan Singh, a rebel Congress MLA, said they were 23 MLAs together of which 22 were here in Bengaluru. “We are unhappy with the Kamal Nath government and have resigned. No one has forced us to do so. If as MLAs we are not able to work for our constituencies why should we remain MLAs and face the wrath of the people?” he questioned.

Tulsi Ram Silawat and Govind Singh, who were ministers in Mr. Nath’s cabinet also attacked the Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister. “Jyotiraditya Scindia took up issues of farmers and Kamal Nath asked him to take to the streets. Is this the way a chief minister functions?,” posed Mr. Silawat adding that Mr. Scindia was their leader.

When asked if all the MLAs in Bengaluru would also join BJP like Mr. Scindia, Mr. Silawat said they would discuss the issue and take a call whether to join BJP or not.

“In every cabinet meeting Kamal Nath used to only talk of Chindwara.

241,2020/03/17,COVID-19 | Odisha extends regulations to April 15,"State offers an incentive of ₹15000 to each person who registers after coming from abroad

The Odisha government has extended all regulations in force for COVID-19 from March 31 to April 15, while offering an incentive of ₹15000 to each person registering with the State on coming from abroad.

Odisha, the first State in the country to undertake this unique initiative, came up with online portal https://covid19.odisha.gov.in and toll free number 104 urging people to register. These foreign returnees will have to mandatorily give a disclosure about their health status and travel history within 24 hours of arrival.

Stating that arrival from foreign countries was a major source of infection, the government said the incentive was meant for undergoing home quarantine. The 48-hour window for those who entered Odisha on or after March 4 began from Tuesday morning.

According the government, this will help the State in tracking persons who are already in the State, sensitise them about home isolation and keep a watch on their health for effective monitoring of the situation and medical advice.

The government also threatened legal action against foreign returnees found concealing their health status and travel history soon after the first coronavirus positive case was detected in State.

“We have received information that foreign universities have been shut down. Students and professionals are returning home. The crisis is going to only multiply,” said Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy.

“The registration is mandatory for the sake of public health safety. There is no choice. We will enforce quarantine on those who are already in the State. If anyone violates the direction, relevant portions of CrPC and IPC will be taken recourse to,” Mr. Tripathy warned.

On Sunday night, a student who came from Italy tested positive for coronavirus. Through contact tracing, it was found that the student had come in contact with 53 persons including his family members and a private doctor and 76 co-passengers in the train he had travelled, said Subroto Bagchi, the State’s chief spokesperson on COVID-19.

On Tuesday, a fresh round of assessment was done in a locality of Bhubaneswar, where the student was staying.

Campaigning for the March 22 elections to zilla parishads, Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said all houses in the State will get electricity, toilets, and water connections by 2022.

Addressing a corner meeting at Succoro zilla panchayat constituency on Sunday, the CM said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was keen to usher in development. “Our government is committed to providing development to every village. We assure you that by 2022, all the homes in Goa will have toilets, light (electricity), and potable water connections,” he said, adding toilets would be provided to each household in the next two-four months.

Mr. Sawant said he had been working on crucial issues like sharing of water of the Mahadayi with Karnataka, mining crisis, and the upcoming Mopa airport. “I am not a magician; I am also a common person like you. I have been trying to work on these issues.”

The CM also said some NGOs are opposing the developmental projects in the State. “The government is looking into the role of instigators behind these NGOs, and action would be taken against them.”

Referring to greenfield airport at Mopa, Mr. Sawant said the first flight from the airport would take off in 2022. “The airport will create more than 20,000 jobs.”

The Chief Minister reiterated that the State government was working on a legislation to give 80% jobs to locals in private industries.

243,2020/03/17,Speaker rejects Gujarat Congress’s demand to put off budget session,"The ruling BJP had opposed the demand claiming the Congress was running scared due to five of its MLAs quitting ahead of the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls

Opposition Congress MLAs staged a walkout from the Gujarat Assembly on Monday after the Speaker refused to accept their demand to postpone the ongoing budget session in the wake of the novel coronavirus threat.

The ruling BJP had opposed the demand claiming the Congress was running scared due to five of its MLAs quitting ahead of the March 26 Rajya Sabha polls.

Congress MLA from Ahmedabad’s Danilimda, Shailesh Parmar, requested Speaker Rajendra Trivedi to put off the budget session, scheduled to end on March 31, and resume it when the virus scare dies down.

Backing Mr. Parmar’s demand, Leader of Opposition Paresh Dhanani said the session could be postponed as discussions on the budget had been completed, adding that the government had already ordered closure of schools, colleges, cinema halls, and other places attracting footfall.

He also cited the example of neighbouring Maharashtra where the budget session ended ahead of the schedule.

However, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani opposed the demand saying such a move would send a wrong message to people amid the coronavirus threat.

Mr. Rupani claimed the Congress was more concerned about the crisis arising from five of its MLAs resigning ahead of the RS polls, and, therefore, was making the postponement demand.

“We should stay back here and worry about the people of the State. If we run away scared, then what will happen to citizens? This is why, as public representatives, we should not be scared, but care about people,” the CM said.

“Their demand for suspension is more due to todona (break up) (play on the word corona and a reference to the quitting of MLAs) scare because of the upcoming RS elections.

Four hundred and two gram sabhas in 15 districts of Odisha have passed resolutions against the National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Campaign for Survival with Dignity (CSD), with the support of Odisha Nari Samaj and other social organisations in different districts, had motivated villagers against the “draconian” decisions of the Central government. “A memorandum on the basis of these resolutions has been sent to the Odisha Chief Minister and Collectors of the concerned districts,” said Narendra Mohanty, convening body member of CSD.

‘Anti-people laws’

Through this memorandum, the Odisha government has been urged to pass a resolution in the Odisha Assembly against “anti-people” laws of the Central government.

“Several States of the country have already passed such resolutions against the NPR, NRC and CAA. The Odisha government and State Assembly should also follow the voice against the regressive decisions of the Central government,” said Pradeep Sahoo, senior member of CSD’s convening body.

The CSD had planned a major demonstration against the NPR, NRC and CAA in Bhubaneswar on March 18, but the event had to be cancelled in view of the restrictions imposed by the Odisha government to check the COVID-19 threat.

The districts where gram sabhas have passed resolutions against the NPR, NRC and CAA are Ganjam, Gajapati, Sundargarh, Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Kandhamal, Bolangir, Bargarh, Keonjhar, Sambalpur, Kalahandi, Mayurbhanj, Jharsuguda and Jajpur.

245,2020/03/17,An inclusive goal for Manipur’s transgender football,"The northeastern State is now host to the country’s first team of transmen

Followers of football in India are unlikely to have heard of Nick, Silleibi and Lem. But they have created history by becoming the captain, goalkeeper and striker of arguably the first transgender football team in the country.

“Having a team of our own was beyond imagination. I am so happy,” said Nick after Ya All, an Imphal-based NGO, put together the team. The launch last week at an event named the Queer Games coincided with the onset of Yaoshang, Manipur’s version of Holi, the festival of colours.

“We wish to be a part of State, national and international level football tournaments under the transgender category. We hope other players come out so that we can compete, improve ourselves and create strong transgender teams,” said Chaki, the team’s vice-captain.

Coming out despite social stigma has been the hardest part for transmen, transwomen and other categories of queer people, Ya All’s founder-president Sadam Hanjabam said. The NGO works to empower youth and the queer community through life skills, and capacity-building.

“Given the popularity of football in Manipur, we have had transgender and non-transgender people playing in mixed groups. We tried to form a team of transwomen (male to female transsexual) but failed due to social factors. The team for transmen worked,” Mr. Hanjabam told The Hindu from Imphal.

Ya All sowed the seeds of the team two years ago by organising six-a-side football matches for the transgender community. Most of the members of the team are students of physical education and used to play football. The challenge now is to ensure a support system and bring coaches on board.

“It is difficult to get experts to improve the skills of our players. But we hope people will soon get over their prejudices,” Mr. Hanjabam said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1hfr9o/article31085408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200308123139,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/an-inclusive-goal-for-manipurs-transgender-football/article31085409.ece

251,2020/03/17,"Kamal Nath, Tandon spar over floor test","Chief Minister says he has majority; Governor regrets the ‘unparliamentary’ tone of the letter

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Monday wrote to Governor Lalji Tandon, alleging that the latter was overstepping his Constitutional powers and taking the BJP’s opinion to “prima facie” believe that the State government was in a minority.

Mr. Tandon shot back, expressing regret that the language and tone of Mr. Nath’s letter was “not in consonance with parliamentary propriety”.

The sparring began on Sunday as Mr. Tandon, after a BJP delegation met him, directed Mr. Nath to hold a floor test and prove his government’s majority in the Assembly “in any condition” on Monday, without attempting to stall the vote.

Question of majority

With the session adjourned on Monday, Mr. Tandon asked him to prove majority by Tuesday. “Otherwise, it will be held that in reality you don’t have a majority in the House,” he wrote.

Mr. Nath said he was surprised that the Governor believed prima facie the government had lost the majority. “It appears that you believed this based on information received from the BJP. In this relation, legal provisions are clear that the Governor cannot take notice of any such group separated from the main party which does not fulfil the parameters [two-thirds majority] laid down in Schedule 10. The reality is that in the present conditions, this group is in the clutches of the BJP. That is why it is inappropriate for you to reach such a prima facie conclusion.”

In light of the perspective given by the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, Mr. Nath wrote, the letter given by the Governor “appears to be beyond powers conferred on the Governor under the Constitution”.

Besides, he said, it was a matter of public concern the BJP had possibly “given bribes, lurements and restricted” several Congress MLAs, as he had explained in the previous letter.

He stated with “utter sadness” and “anguish” that far from finding a solution to the “illegal conducts like restrictions on my MLAs”, the Governor had not even mentioned it in his letter.

Mr. Nath further wrote that he was also surprised that Mr. Tandon believed that he had a say on matters pertaining to the Vidhan Sabha’s functioning, which fell in the domain of the Speaker.

“I hope and have faith that your honour will work according to law and the Constitution in the future,” he wrote.

Mr. Nath pointed out to the Governor that by holding several Congress MLAs “hostage” under the control of the police, the BJP was compelling them to make statements. “...In such a situation that there is no point in holding a floor test of any kind and doing this would be unconstitutional and undemocratic.”

Mr. Tandon said that when the question arose if a government had the trust of the House or not, the Supreme Court had established that the answer lay in the floor test.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4ayidb/article31085787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADHYAPRADESHSTATEASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kamal-nath-tandon-spar-over-floor-test/article31085788.ece
252,2020/03/17,"India’s First Class cricket as good as anywhere else, says Dav Whatmore","World Cup-winning coach Whatmore bats for DRS in Ranji

Dav Whatmore is one of cricket’s most successful coaches. He guided Sri Lanka to a stunning victory at the 1996 World Cup and played a key role in turning Bangladesh into a competitive side.

Also read: Ranji Trophy | Should strengthen our resolve, says Bengal coach Arun Lal

In his second innings as a coach, he took up the offer to train Kerala three years ago. He worked wonders, yet again. In his first season, he took Kerala to the knockout stage for the first time. The following year, the team reached the semifinals.

Disappointing season

This past season, though, was bitterly disappointing, as Kerala was relegated, finishing 17th among the 18 teams that made up the two top groups. Whatmore has also worked as a coach in English county cricket. So he has seen the First Class cricket, from close quarters, in countries as varied as Australia, England, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.

How does he rate the First Class cricket in India? “It is as good as in any country, including Australia and England,” Whatmore told The Hindu over phone from Singapore. He is impressed with the quality of cricket in the Ranji Trophy. “The BCCI has got it right with the format of the Ranji Trophy,” he said. “I am happy with the current system of five teams qualifying for the quarterfinals from the top two groups.”

WATCH: Ranji Trophy final wrap - Saurashtra wins maiden title

But he isn’t happy with the way the Plate Group is handled. “I am not sure if the present system of one team from the Plate qualifying directly for the quarterfinals is right,” he said. “The BCCI should also think about the obviously inflated statistics of the players from the Plate Group. Maybe those matches should not be considered First Class.”

Plenty of depth

He feels there is a lot of depth in India’s domestic cricket. “It is great to see so many new talents coming out of the Ranji Trophy every year,” he said. “I remember being impressed by Shubman Gill and Mayank Markande when I first saw them in the Ranji Trophy (during Kerala’s match against Punjab last season).”

Also read: Saurashtra wins maiden Ranji title

Looking back at Kerala’s dismal campaign, he admitted he was very disappointed. He believes the Ranji Trophy could do with the DRS. “I think it will come eventually,” he said. “It would be expensive, but if there is one organisation that could afford it, it is the BCCI.”

He said Chennai, where he spent three years, had a good structure. “You see cricketers making money from playing there. The city has great cricket culture.”

Whatmore’s association with Kerala may have ended, but he said that he would be returning to India before long. He did not rule out the possibility of coaching another team in the next Ranji Trophy.

253,2020/03/17,"Coronavirus | Thought it was a joke, says Richardson","Briefly quarantined after having one of the symptoms, his test turned negative

Australian pacer Kane Richardson, quarantined briefly for suspected COVID-19 before being found negative, said he thought it was all a joke at first.

“I was at risk because I’d travelled overseas within (the previous) two weeks and I had one of the four symptoms, so that was the reason I got tested,” said the 29-year-old. “I thought it was all a joke at the time, but (the team doctor) was adamant it wasn’t.” The fast bowler said he was not expecting a positive test result.

“He (team doctor) spoke to various people on the phone to make sure he was doing the right thing and got the biggest swab I’ve ever seen out and stuck it into the back of my nose and back of my mouth, so it wasn’t a pleasurable experience but that was the protocol so I was happy to go along with it.

“I wasn’t expecting a positive result and, thankfully, that’s what happened. I’m all good and I got the ok to go outside and in the fresh air again,” said Richardson.

Seventeen Australians, including Richardson, hold IPL contracts. The lucrative league was supposed to start on March 29.

“We’re just waiting to hear (on IPL). A lot of the blokes have opinions — ‘it’s going to get cancelled’, this and that — but again it can change in a day or a week, so I’ll just sit by the phone and get ready to play for the 15th of April at the moment — that’s what I’m thinking.

“(The Australia squad) were all sitting around chatting about it. It’s happened out of nowhere. A lot of us were going to be away from now till the end of the IPL, so to now be sitting at home with absolutely no idea when the next game of cricket is going to be for any of us, just shows how quickly this has grown.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vx8ueq/article31092601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18KANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/coronavirus-thought-it-was-a-joke-says-richardson/article31092602.ece

In the wake of overseas buyers cancelling or deferring orders, textile associations have appealed to the Central Government to extend financial support.

Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council chairman K.V. Srinivasan pointed out, in a press release, that with spread of COVID-19 in Europe, U.K. and the U.S., several buyers had put purchases on hold. If the situation did not improve in two to three weeks, exporters would have to cut production and go in for lay offs.

Hence, the government should:

extend the scheme for reimbursement of taxes and levies for cotton yarn and fabric exports

provide 3 % interest sub vention beyond March 31, including products such as quilts and cotton shopping bags for ROSCTL (Reimbursement of State and Central Taxes and Levies)

expedite GST refunds

According to T. Rajkumar, chairman of Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, banks should provide moratorium for repayment of principal and interest amounts and exempt at raw materials from anti-dumping duty and Customs Duty.

Apparel Export Promotion Council Chairman A. Sakthivel said, in a press statement, that:

banking and packing credit clearances should be faster

the packing credit period for existing orders should be extended upto a period of 360 days from the existing 270 days

existing limits for exporters should be enhanced 25%

Ashwin Chandran, chairman of Southern India Mills’ Association, said, in a press release, that the textile and clothing industry needed handholding from the government to overcome the current crisis. The banks should provide one year moratorium for repayment of principal amount and interest.

According to the Tiruppur Exporters’ Association president Raja Shanmugham, the foreign buyers are deferring payments for goods already shipped and some are not lifting the goods. In order to face the disruption in economic activity, there should be a reduction of interest rates. The government should announce a stimulus package and re-energise the market.

261,2020/03/17,Schools gear up to tackle COVID-19 scare,"Arrangements for hand washing made available at all board examination centres

With the State government announcing closure of schools till March 31 over COVID-19 scare, school education officials in Coimbatore are taking steps to ensure the safety of students who are currently appearing for public examinations and who will come back to schools once they reopen.

Education Department has advised the parents to sensitise the children to the need to stay safe with hygienic practices. In addition, the schools would be displaying dos and don’ts to protect oneself from COVID-19. In addition, students are insisted to wash hands using soaps at schools at frequent intervals. The effort also includes advising parents to avoid taking children on tours during holidays and to refrain from visiting crowded places such as places of worship, malls and cinema halls.

As schoolchildren and senior citizens are most susceptible to contract the virus, Mr. Kumar advised that parents and children must take adequate caution, although there was no need to panic. “The situation in Tamil Nadu is not alarming currently,” he said.

Echoing similar sentiments, R. Visalakshi, president of Tamil Nadu Private Schools Association, said that the guidelines issued by the education department were “more than enough”. “Awareness among the public has set in through television, and social media. Teachers in private schools have been instructed to isolate students exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 and to inform parents to keep such children at home and provide treatment,” Ms. Visalakshi said.

A Delhi court on Tuesday rejected the plea of Mukesh Singh, one of the four death row convicts in the December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, seeking quashing of his death penalty claiming that he was not in Delhi on the day of the incident.

In his plea, Mukesh said he was arrested from Rajasthan and brought to Delhi on December 17, 2012, and was not present in the city on December 16, when the crime took place.

Also read: Nirbhaya case | Delayed execution of convicts

The plea also alleged that Mukesh was tortured in Tihar jail.

The public prosecutor told Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana that Mukesh’s plea was frivolous and a tactic to delay the hanging on March 20.

The judge asked the Bar Council of India to give appropriate sensitisation exercise to Mukesh’s counsel M.L. Sharma. “The court is constrained to express its anguish regarding the callous manner in which the application has been moved. It is well-known that courts are overburdened. The duty to deliver justice expeditiously becomes more onerous when the court is dealing with the case of a death row convict, when one wrong decision would lead to fatal consequences. Therefore, the expectations of assistance from the Bar is more enhanced and intense... There cannot be any quarrel with the proposition that an advocate, to the best of his capabilities, is duty-bound to represent the case of his client before the court. However, the duty cannot be extended to the extent of procuring relief for the client by resorting to all kinds of schemes and stratagems,” the court said in its order.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh warrants, with March 20 at 5.30 a.m., as the date for the execution of Mukesh Singh, 32, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Akshay Kumar Singh, 31.

In another development, the National Human Rights Commission dismissed a plea by the mother of Mukesh Singh seeking its intervention to prevent the death sentence being carried out.

In a statement, the NHRC said Ram Bai wanted the commission to “prevent the unlawful execution of her son Mukesh Singh” on Friday.

Her complaint said all the men convicted of the gang-rape and murder had been falsely implicated and their execution, as ordered by the courts, would be a miscarriage of justice. “The matter is outside the purview of the commission. The complaint is therefore dismissed,” the NHRC said.

Meanwhile, Akshay’s wife filed a divorce petition in a court in Aurangabad district in northeastern Bihar.

“My husband is a convict in the Nirbhaya case but he is innocent… Now, I want to be legally divorced from him before he is hanged as I don’t want to live the life of a widow,” Punita Devi said in her petition filed at a family court.

All the accused are entitled to be given the benefit of doubt,” the court said in its order.

It also acquitted co-accused Satish and Subhash Shukla in the case.

The Sangam Vihar MLA was booked on June 23, 2016, for allegedly misbehaving with a group of women, who had approached him with a complaint regarding water crisis in their locality the previous night.

He was arrested under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) and 354C (voyeurism) of the Indian Penal Code.

He was arrested when he was addressing a press conference, triggering an angry reaction from Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of declaring an “emergency” in Delhi.

Dragged from his seat

Delhi Police told a court on Monday that it had to enter the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) campus on December 15, 2019, to contain the violence and rescue innocent students trapped inside as “rioters” had entered the university premises during anti-CAA protests and were pelting stones at the police and the public from inside.

The submissions were made in an action-taken report (ATR) filed before Metropolitan Magistrate Rajat Goyal during the hearing of a plea seeking registration of FIR against alleged police attack on students on the campus during the protests.

The court has put up the matter for further hearing on April 7.

The police said as it was not possible to distinguish between trapped students and rioters, who were found to be carrying petrol bombs earlier, and as a result all of them were asked to be evacuated with their “hands up”.

“With a view to contain the violence and maintain law and order, the police was constrained to enter the campus. The personnel were able to contain the violent activity by temporarily apprehending 52 persons under the Delhi police Act... The action was required in light of ongoing violence from within the university campus and to rescue innocent students trapped inside, and to ensure normalcy,” the ATR stated.

The police further submitted that the rioters had destroyed/damaged the lights within the campus, and it was difficult to distinguish between them and the innocent students.

Around 10 lakh international and domestic flyers, and around 25 lakh metro riders are frisked by the CISF personnel.”

He added that CISF personnel have been instructed to wear mask and gloves during duty hours.

A CISF person who frisk passenger should keep rotating frequently. At metro stations, we usually don’t touch passengers and frisk them with the hand help metal detector device. If pat down check is required then personnel have to take extra care.

The plea sought that Delhi Police should be directed to preserve CCTV footage of the riot-affected areas from February 23 to March 1 and should not remove debris without collecting evidence from the site.

“There are serious allegations of damaging the CCTV cameras installed in the riots-affected areas by the police which is evident from the videos surfaced and circulating in the social media,” the plea said, adding that the debris has been deliberately removed to destroy the evidence from the incident site.

It also claimed that FIRs had not been lodged against people responsible for the riots and alleged that the police were not accepting the complaint in which the accused are named and instead were insisting to give complaint against unknown persons.

At the Idgah relief camp here, it appeared that little help was available for riot victims to protect themselves from COVID-19.

In the name of measures, masks are being distributed and inhabitants are being asked to keep their surroundings clean.

Waqf Board official Mohammad Ovais said that in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19, riot victims at the camp were being given masks, adding that they also have medical camp at their disposal.

“We are trying to keep the place clean and distributing masks, but not everyone is comfortable wearing them. In case people complain of cough and cold, they can get medicines at the camp. In case of an emergency, there is also an ambulance standing right outside the camp to shift people to hospitals,” he said.

Paramedical staff at the camp said that people have been complaining of cough and cold – some of the COVID-19 symptoms – but that they were less in number. “There has not been a serious case so far. We are continuously telling people to use masks. Most people who come to us have skin rashes or minor injuries,” said a staffer who did not wish to be named.

A riot victim, identified as Shahnawaz, however, claimed that there was a scarcity of masks at the camp. “They have distributed masks but there are people who are yet to receive one. When someone sitting or lying next to us coughs or sneezes we get scared,” he said.

Due to the absence of hand sanitisers or wash basins at the camp, women said that they and their children could be at risk. “I have seen videos on WhatsApp. They say we should wash hands and use sanitisers but we are not being able to use sanitisers or wash hands properly and frequently,” said Nazia, a woman at the camp.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hikasg/article31087417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17IDGAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/scarcity-of-masks-no-sanitisers-at-idgah-relief-camp/article31086258.ece

Shama Parveen was stitching her fifth suit for the day on Monday at Idgah relief camp here and said she had five more to go. While her boutique back in Shiv Vihar was damaged in the recent riots a little corner at the relief camp is her new workplace.

“She is my favourite designer and I am her most loyal customer,” said Rihana, flaunting her bell-sleeve suit which Ms. Shama stitched for her.

The 26-year-old mother of three daughters is currently the in-house tailor of the relief camp and is approached by all the women who want their suit piece, which they receive as relief material, stitched or altered. “I have stitched 35 so far and have cut out 10 which are yet to be completed,” she said.

An NGO worker brought the first sewing machine about 15 days ago and now, there are four of them, including the latest being brought on Monday morning. “Others who know how to stitch also come and use the machines, but I have been given the responsibility of taking care of these,” she said, adding that she takes help from a few other women who are skilled in stitching.

She said she was not charging any money but has been told by the NGO worker that she would be paid a sum for it subsequently.

When asked how she learned the skill, she said it was a matter of time and practice.

“I had been running my shop in Shiv Vihar for nearly 10 years and had customers from Dehradun and Kanpur as well”. The shop with a board reading ‘Shama Tailor’ now stands vandalised.

Recalling when she fled her house on the night of February 24, she said that throughout the day, she was locked up in the house. Assuming that she would not survive, she called up people to ask them to forgive her if she had done anything wrong. Around 1.30 a.m., she and few other women managed to flee to Chaman Park to take shelter.

While the government is taking precautionary measures to deal with the COVID-19 epidemic, several residential associations in Delhi-NCR have ensured that their surroundings are safe.

Measures include segregation of elevators for residents and visitors, installation of infra-red thermometers, sanitisation of visitors at the entrance, deferring public gatherings, and creating public awareness.

“Delivery boys, maids and other visitors are not being allowed inside if their temperature is higher than normal, the residents are to come down to collect their parcels in that case. The ones being allowed are to use hand sanitisers placed at the entrance,” said Tarun Singh, general secretary of the Sunrise Green Society in Indirapuram.

Even though common spaces like swimming pools are shut and large gatherings are not allowed, important general body meetings are happening with chairs kept apart at a distance of three feet from each other with hand sanitisers being provided to the attendees.

Measures implemented

Measures have been implemented before Holi when the grand celebrations and meeting-greeting ceremony during the festival was called off. Mr. Singh said that majority of club house bookings for parties have been cancelled as well since past few weeks as a precaution.

Most common contact areas within elevators, play areas are being sanitised every two hours through outsourced teams and is monitored by the welfare association staff.

Director of Clean and Secure Facility Maintenance company Sharat Jha with his team is ensuring the services to almost 2-3 building associations in a day.

Despite being declared as essential commodities, shortage of masks and sanitisers continues in the market, said city pharmacists on Monday.

While demand has “increased again” over the last two days, limited supply is resulting in a shortage, they added. Uttam Nagar-based pharmacist Vinod Kapoor said: “There is no stock in the market. Whatever little supply is happening is limited and only six to 10 masks or sanitisers are being provided. Even though the demand is lesser than what it was earlier, the limited stock is also finishing fast.”

“As compared to last week, the demand of masks and sanitisers have reduced, but over the last few days there was a slight spurt. There has been no new supply,” said a representative of Vinayak Medicos.

A 45-year-old man, who was the first to recover from COVID-19 in the city said that people should not panic as “it is similar to a normal cough and cold with a couple of days extra to recover.”

“People are also panicking about isolation wards. They should not worry as the government has provided adequate facilities, at least at Safdarjung Hospital. People should not get scared and hide. Rather, with the onset of the slightest of symptoms, they should step out and get tested,” he said.

Food and Supply Minister Imran Hussain on Monday directed officials to take action against shopkeepers who overcharge customers for face masks, surgical masks, hand sanitisers and other commodities used for control and prevention of COVID-19. “The Minister has directed senior officers to depute all field functionaries to check instances of overcharging and to take necessary punitive action,” an official statement said.

Since sanitiser has been declared as essential commodity under the Essential Commodities Act, action can be taken against dealers involved in hoarding and black-marketing of sanitisers, according to the Delhi government.

Le Marche food store at South Point Mall in the upmarket DLF Phase-5 here on Golf Course Road has seen a sudden spurt in demand for groceries over the past couple of days.

The trend of panic buying of grocery items is not just confined to this store, but has been noticed in several parts of the Millennium City in the wake of shutting down of schools, colleges, cinema halls and gyms in Haryana due to COVID-19 scare.

Le Marche customer executives head Pawan told The Hindu that the demand for non-perishable grocery items, including rice, pulses, flour, vegetable oils, had suddenly gone up over the past two days.

“The demand went up especially after the news of shutting down of shopping malls in Mumbai. The customers are stocking up food items. The demand, in fact, is very high. Those usually buying 2 kg of rice are now buying 10 kg,” said Mr. Pawan. He said the customers had fears that essential item stores could also be shut down in the days to come if the COVID-19 situation worsens. Mr. Pawan said he spoke to a few customers to try to allay the fears, but they were not willing to heed to him.

Brisk business

Shri Ram, supervisor, FreshLee store in Sector 15 Part-II, said they had brisk business over the weekend. “In fact, we recorded good sale of groceries today [Monday] morning and the stock of pulses with us is already exhausted. A few customers even enquired whether there was any word on closure of the store,” said Mr. Shri Ram.

Rajesh Aggarwal, who runs a grocery store in Sector 15 Part-II HUDA Market, confirmed the trend saying that demand was akin to festival season. “Log Diwali ki tarah saamaan khareed rahe hain (People are buying like they buy during Diwali),” Mr. Aggarwal said, adding that his staff did not even have time for a tea-break and he had already received orders from 15 households for grocery on Monday before noon.

Grahini Store’s Pramod, a Sadar Bazar-based wholesale dealer of groceries to retailers in DLF areas, Sector 43, 49, 56 and along the Sohna Road, said that the demand was up by 25-30%. He, however, said there was no spike in demand from routine customers coming to Sadar Bazar, mostly catering to the regularised colonies and workers class.

Nikhil Agarwal of A.K. Mart in Sector 52 said that 3-4 customers had called him up demanding groceries in bulk on Monday.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xf9o0n/article31086203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DELPRIYAGURUGRAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/grocery-stores-in-gurugram-see-rush-amid-covid-19-threat/article31086204.ece
295,2020/03/17,Riot victim’s kin await charred body claimed a fortnight ago,"The DNA report of the body is expected within a day or two, say police

Over a fortnight after he claimed the charred remains of a body, which was just some part of a skull attached to traces of a spine, Mohammad Shehbaz’s brother Matloob still does not know if it belongs to his 22-year-old sibling.

Of eight instances in which the bodies or body parts recovered by them were in such a condition that they could not be visibly identified by their next of kin, Shehbaz’s remains, according to the police, are one of six cases in which DNA testing is required to conclusively ascertain the identity of a riot victim.

Fished out of drain

These remains, Mr. Matloob said, were fished out of from one of the drains in the vicinity of Shiv Vihar – one of the epicentres of violence that ripped across north-east Delhi for three consecutive days late last month – and claimed by him from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital mortuary four days after he last heard his younger brother’s voice.

“He was a welder by profession and, like most people engaged in the trade, needed routine medical attention to get debris which collected in his eyes during welding and soldering to be removed. He had gone to Guru Nanak Eye Centre for the same at 7 in the morning on Tuesday [February 25],” Mr. Matloob, a resident of Husain Vihar near Karawal Nagar, said.

“I spoke to him around 2 p.m. When the riot broke out, I called him up to tell him to stay safe... He assured that he would take care of himself and said he would take avoid going towards the main road. That is when the call got disconnected. It was the last time I heard his voice,” Mr. Maltoob said.

After unsuccessfully enquiring about Shehbaz’s whereabouts for several hours despite the violence unfolding around him, Mr. Matloob and his family began making the rounds of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital Hospital on February 26.

Like the next of kin of others, who could not identify their missing family members following the riots, Mr. Matloob said he and his family lost all hope.

They accepted the fact that only parts of Shehbaz’s body could be recovered after what he had gone through before allegedly being burnt to death.

“I first went to the hospital on February 26 morning. Then I just set up a camp there. I looked at all the bodies which were mostly recovered in one piece, but did not find my brother,” he said.

“On February 29, on the basis of what looked like the clothes he was wearing when he left the house, I wanted to see the body which those belonged to. I was shown a part of a human skull with some part of the spine attached to it. We claimed it as Shehbaz’s body. My father gave his blood sample for the DNA test, but there is no development since,” he stated.

According to a senior police officer, a DNA test was required for six of the eight bodies which were fished out from separate drains in north-east Delhi.

Five of the DNA reports have matched so far and the bodies have been handed over to their respective family members.

“The family is claiming the body but we want to be doubly sure and don’t want to take any chances. The report, based on blood sample collected from the family, is expected within a day or two. As soon as the report confirms that the body parts belong to Shehbaz, we will hand those over to the family,” Alok Kumar, Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) said.

A senior police officer associated with the investigation said, “In this [Shehbaz’s] case, we got the family’s sample a bit late. It was sent for examination to a laboratory. We will check the status and, if not completed soon, we will expedite the process and hand over the body to the family at the earliest.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/9l78nz/article31086246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17SHEHBAZ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/riot-victims-kin-await-charred-body-claimed-a-fortnight-ago/article31086186.ece

297,2020/03/17,"Over 1,400 beds to quarantine people in the Capital, says govt.","Kejriwal announces paid quarantine facilities at three city hotels near airport

To fight COVID-19, the Capital has a capacity of over 1,400 beds to quarantine people in different facilities run by the Central and Delhi governments, an official said.

This includes, quarantine facilities in hospitals, unused flats of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, police training schools, and under-construction hospitals.

“All put together, we have about 1,400 quarantine beds including, AIIMS, Safdarjung Hospital and other Delhi government facilities,” a Delhi government spokesperson said. “The Delhi government has about 900 beds for quarantine at this point and by midnight 250 more will be set up,” a Health Department official said.

The government on Monday announced that they will provide paid quarantine facilities at three hotels, which can be used by people who are not satisfied with the government facilities after paying the hotels.

“Many people who come from abroad are from affluent class and the quarantine facilities are not up to their expectations. We have booked some hotels. They can pay to stay there during quarantine,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a press conference on Monday.

“At this point, these many numbers of beds are enough. The CM is holding a review meeting everyday and at any point if we feel that more beds are needed we will scale it up,” an official said, when asked whether the number was enough.

People can choose from three hotels, Ibis, Lemon Tree, and Red Fox, near the airport for quarantine facilities. “Your facility has been identified as a suitable premise which could be made operational as quarantine facility at short notice, as discussed in the meeting held on March 15,” an order issued by the Delhi government to Ibis said.

For all the three hotels, a rate of ₹3,100 plus taxes for a day has been fixed by the Delhi government, which includes three meals and other basic facilities.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/over-1400-beds-to-quarantine-people-in-the-capital-says-govt/article31086134.ece

No religious, cultural or political gatherings of more than 50 people will be allowed in Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced here on Monday.

Nightclubs, gyms and spas will also remain closed till March 31 in the wake of the seven confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Capital. Schools, colleges and swimming pools have already been shut till the month-end. Wedding functions have not yet been included, but people are being requested to postpone the ceremonies if possible, he said.

The announcement was made despite Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal’s assurance that all local bodies in Delhi have initiated action to check the spread of COVID-19 by invoking the provisions of the Delhi Epidemic Diseases COVID-19 Regulations 2020 and provisions of Section 376 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.

Videoconferencing

“A videoconferencing was held at 11 a.m. today [Monday] with SDMs, DMs, Ministers and the department officials. We are taking all measures necessary to tackle the corona crisis. Delhi has witnessed seven cases to date, with the unfortunate demise of one patient. Two patients have fully recovered, and the remaining four are under treatment,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“The Delhi government is taking all precautionary measures to quarantine those who have been affected. We have sufficient resources. More than 500 beds are ready to be installed for immediate hospitalisation in case there is an outbreak. We are also advising people who have come in contact with those infected to home-quarantine themselves for a while,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal issued an appeal to all those people who have been quarantined at home to remain “cautious in their approach” and not contact or meet others till everything is under control.

The Delhi government, he said, has ordered restriction on social, cultural, family and political gatherings of more than 50 people. The SDMs and municipal commissioners have been directed to ensure that mobile washbasins with soap and running water are arranged at all major locations.

Mobile washbasins

All SDMs, Mr. Kejriwal said, will have to arrange for a specific number of mobile washbasins in their areas. Hand sanitisers will be provided to all staff working at public places.

“I want to appeal to the people to cooperate with the authorities... governments are doing whatever they can to contain the outbreak, but it is only with your cooperation that our efforts will be successful. Many countries have witnessed a major outbreak of the virus, which, fortunately, has not happened here. I will also request everyone to stop shaking hands,” he said.

“The people who have been quarantined and are not satisfied with the facilities at the hospitals or the isolation wards where they are being kept can pay to be shifted to a hotel for the same.

301,2020/03/17,Getting the hang of death penalty,"India is one of only 58 countries that have the death penalty on their statute book and have used it in the recent past. In 1967, the Law Commission had argued to retain capital punishment, but in 2015 it stated that ‘retribution cannot be reduced to vengeance’

In January, when senior advocate and human rights activist Indira Jaising urged the mother of the 23-year-old victim of the infamous December 16, 2012, gang rape and murder case to “forgive” the four death row convicts, there was a backlash — not just from the mother but the public as well.

This was despite Ms. Jaising making clear that she was with the mother in her pain, but “against death penalty”.

The debate over the death sentence is going on for a long time. Those in favour of capital punishment see it as a deterrence against such type of crimes while others opine that it has not had any such effect.

First initiative

In British India’s Legislative Assembly, the first time an issue was raised regarding capital punishment was in 1931, when one of the Members from Bihar, Gaya Prasad Singh, sought to introduce a Bill to abolish the death penalty for offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

However, this was defeated.

At the time of Independence, India retained several laws put in place by the British colonial government, including capital punishment for various crimes under the IPC.

A crucial change in the law was made in 1955 when the Parliament repealed Section 367(5) of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which until then mandated the courts to record reasons where it decided not to impose a sentence of death for offences where the death penalty was an option. The CrPC was re-enacted in 1973 where several changes were made, notably to Section 354(3) mandating judges to provide special reasons for why they imposed the death sentence.

Law Commission reports

In 1967, the 35th Report of the Law Commission had argued for retention of capital punishment in India.

The report stated that retribution should not be understood as an “eye for an eye”, but in its refined form as public denunciation of crime. It also stated that there are a category of individuals who are “cruel and wicked”, and are not capable of reform.

A major reason stated in the report for the retention of capital punishment was the unique condition of India, and the society then prevalent.

About half-a-century later, the Law Commission, in its 262th Report, highlighted that the death penalty does not serve the penological goal of deterrence any more than life imprisonment. The commission, in its report published in 2015, recommended that the death penalty be abolished for all crimes other than terrorism-related offences and waging war against the State.

Rarest of rare cases

The first legal challenge to the constitutionality of the death penalty came in the 1973 case of Jagmohan Singh vs State of Uttar Pradesh in which the petitioners argued that the death penalty was against the Constitution.

The Supreme Court, however, found that the death penalty was a permissible punishment.

This was followed by the 1980 landmark verdict of the top court in the Bachan Singh case where it upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty but confined its application to the ‘rarest of rare cases’, to reduce the arbitrariness of the penalty.

International scenario

Internationally, countries are classified on their death penalty status based on four categories: abolitionist for all crimes, abolitionist for ordinary crimes, abolitionist de facto, and retentionist.

At the end of 2014, seven countries were abolitionist for ordinary crimes. Only 98 countries were abolitionist for all crimes, and 35 were abolitionist in practice.

This brought the number of countries which are abolitionist in law or practice to 140.

At the same time, 58 countries are regarded as retentionist, who still have the death penalty on their statute book and have used it in the recent past. This list includes some of the most populous nations in the world, including India, China, Indonesia and the United States.

Neighbouring countries such as Nepal officially abolished the death penalty in 1990 and did not reintroduce it even in the aftermath of the civil war.

Sri Lanka, despite a long civil war, has maintained a moratorium on the penalty, the commission report said.

Recent executions

In July 2015, Yakub Memon was executed by hanging in Nagpur Central Jail for his role in the 1993 Bombay bombings.

Afzal Guru, who was convicted for his role in the 2001 Parliament attack, was executed in February 2013.

In November 2012, Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, was hanged at Yerwada Jail in Pune. The previous execution was carried out in 2004 of Dhananjoy Chatterjee for the crimes of rape and murder of a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

No clear data

Project 39A of the National Law University, Delhi, which publishes the death penalty reports has highlighted the difficulty in obtaining the exact number of prisoners under the sentence of death in India.

As per Project 39A, India has executed around 755 persons since Independence. Its report said that Uttar Pradesh carried out the highest number of executions at 366. Also, the Bareilly District Jail in the State has the distinction of carrying out 130 executions, the highest of all jails in the country, with the last execution being carried out on September 24, 1988.

Delhi’s Tihar Central Prisons carried out 25 executions, the last one of Afzal Guru on February 9, 2013.

“Though we at Project 39A have tried our best to collate data from various sources, it is an unfortunate truth that the prisons and other government departments do not have accurate records of the people they have executed,” Project 39A stated.

“Hence, we continue our struggle to get accurate data on the administration of the death penalty in India and are hindered by an absolute lack of coordination between different official sources,” it added.

A case for abolition

“The notion of “an eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth” has no place in our constitutionally mediated criminal justice system. Capital punishment fails to achieve any constitutionally valid penological goals,” the Law Commission, in its 262th Report had said.

It pointed out that even the Supreme Court has on numerous occasions expressed concern about arbitrary sentencing in death penalty cases. “The court has noted that it is difficult to distinguish cases where death penalty has been imposed from those where the alternative of life imprisonment has been applied,” it said.

The commission had stated that the constitutional regulation of capital punishment attempted in Bachan Singh case has failed to prevent death sentences from being “arbitrarily and freakishly imposed”.

The commission had put a case for abolition of death penalty, except terrorism-related offences and waging war, noting,“Retribution has an important role to play in punishment. However, it cannot be reduced to vengeance”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/getting-the-hang-of-death-penalty/article31086083.ece
302,2020/03/17,"For many victims, Idgah relief camp feels safer than home","They fear being picked up by police for no reason; others await relief to restart life

Abubakar, a 24-year-old resident of Shiv Vihar currently staying at the Idgah relief camp in Mustafabad, was allegedly picked up by the Crime Branch last week, interrogated and thrashed for over five hours before being released.

Three weeks since the communal violence in north-east Delhi, for Mr. Abubakar and other youths his age, the relief camp has become their “safe place”.

On March 10, Mr. Abubakar had gone to Shiv Vihar to take stock of his house when Crime Branch officers came looking for him. “They asked the neighbours for my name and then held me. They took me to their office and kept me there for six-seven hours. They slapped and punched me and showed me videos. They asked me to identify at least five people or they won’t let me go,” he alleged, adding that he wasn’t there in any of the videos the officers showed him.

“They beat me up especially after reading a chat with my girlfriend on the night of February 24 wherein I had written that I was standing with 40-50 people as a precautionary measure,” he said.

The Crime Branch officers told him they will release him after inquiring with the local police, Mr. Abubakar said. Senior Crime Branch officers remained unavailable for comment on the matter.

Standing a little ahead was a 20-year-old youth who said he had been told by his neighbours that policemen had come looking for him, his brother and father at their house. “They are picking up people from anywhere. We are scared and this camp is safe for us,” he said.

Wait for compensation

For many at the relief camp, fear is not the only reason for not returning home. They haven’t received any compensation to rebuild their houses and are unable to arrange funds on their own.

Nawab Khan, 45, said he fled his Shiv Vihar residence on February 24. His house was looted and set ablaze the next day. He still hasn’t received the emergency relief fund, let alone the final compensation. “The primary reason we are not going back is because we don’t have money and I haven’t received compensation from the government. I was called to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate’s office today and they said I’ll receive the money, but I don’t know when,” said Mr. Khan, a street vendor. He said he hid in an under-construction building near his house for three days before Rapid Action Force officers rescued him on February 27.

“House owners from Shiv Vihar are meeting Waqf Board officials today. We will share our problems regarding safety, security and rebuilding our houses. We’ll go back only if a concrete decision is taken,” said Mr. Khan.

For most women at the camp, the decision to return home is the men’s call to make. “We are not scared to go back, but people look at us in a certain way… the environment doesn’t feel right, but I’ll go when my husband says it’s safe,” said Shabana, a resident of Shiv Vihar.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hkzjcz/article31086016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16RIOTVICTIMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/for-many-victims-idgah-relief-camp-feels-safer-than-home/article31086017.ece
303,2020/03/17,The three gunas,"The whole of prakriti or nature is constituted of the three gunas, satva, rajas and tamas, and the Lord is the creator and controller of these. But He is not under their sway. Among them, Satva is superior to rajas and rajas better than tamas. People, the wealthy, the strong, the intelligent, are all bound by the gunas that are nothing but mental states, temperaments or thoughts. So, everyone is a necessary combination of the three gunas.

But human beings are blessed having been given a choice to improve and try to convert from tamas to rajas and then to satva, pointed out Srimati Sunanda in a discourse. The nature of satva is shown to be expressed as calmness, purity, tranquillity, harmony and a sense of equilibrium. When satva prevails, one is calm and serene and has noble thoughts. Rajas is seen as activity in desire, power and energy and so when rajas is dominant, one is hopeful, ambitious and so on. Tamas is seen as inertia and is expressed as dullness, laziness, weakness, etc. When under tamas, one tends to lack incentive. Moreover, the three gunas and their manifestations in the universe keep the people engrossed in the world to such an extent that they do not recognise the Paramatma, who is their cause, even as the sun is not perceived by people when it is hidden behind the clouds.

One should train oneself to identify the inherent predominant tendency in oneself that governs the nature of one’s thoughts. By practice of bhakti, vairagya, nishkama karma and so on, it is possible to shed the effects of tamas and rajas and maintain satva. But one has to learn to rise above satva too, says Krishna. Only then is he a Gunatita and is eligible to be established in atma jnana. As long as one is ruled by the gunas, one cannot hope for salvation.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/the-three-gunas/article31092233.ece

309,2020/03/17,CAT dismisses IPS officer’s plea challenging suspension,"AP govt. alleges misconduct with regard to procurement of security equipment

Central Administrative Tribunal-Hyderabad on Tuesday dismissed the petition filed by senior IPS officer of Andhra Pradesh State cadre A.B. Venkateshwara Rao challenging his suspension.

Mr. Rao, an officer of the rank of Additional Director General of Police, was suspended by AP government for misconduct with regard to procurement of security equipment. While the government alleged that he attempted to promote a firm belonging to his son, Mr. Rao refuted the allegation, charging that his suspension was political vendetta.

A bench of CAT chairman L. Narsimha Reddy and member B.V. Sudhakar heard the petition for the past few weeks. AP government engaged former Advocate General of Telangana High Court D. Prakash Reddy. High Court Senior counsel Vidyasagar appeared for Mr. Rao.

Mr. Vidyasagar contended that there was no specific evidence to initiate disciplinary action against the senior police officer.

Moreover, Mr. Rao was an All India Service officer and cannot be suspended without informing the Central government within 48 hours of suspension, the lawyer argued. However, Mr. Reddy appearing for the State government said there was evidence to prove that the officer played a role in short-listing his son’s firm, which had an understanding with an Israel-based company, for procuring the security equipment.

The bench of the CAT observed that at the stage of suspension the sufficiency of evidence cannot be challenged.

311,2020/03/17,GHMC teams shut down 66 premises,"These premises were functioning in violation of govt. order

Several bars, pubs, schools, gyms and institutions have been raided by GHMC teams on Tuesday, and sealed for functioning against the directives issued by the State government.

The Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing, which has carried out the inspections has announced through a statement that a total of 66 premises were found to have been functioning in violation of the order, hence sealed.

The sealed premises include 13 gyms, 34 coaching centres, three fitness studios, two swimming pools, two schools, a function hall, four bar & restaurants, five study rooms and two sports clubs.

In view of the coronavirus scare, the State government, on Saturday, issued a slew of instructions for closure of premises where large gatherings are expected.

Accordingly, educational institutions, and coaching centres are to be shut down up to March 31, while other crowded premises such as cinema halls, amusement parks, gyms, swimming pools, zoo parks, museums, sports stadiums, membership clubs, bars and pubs should be kept closed up to March 21.

For function halls, exemption has been granted for already fixed weddings alone, with a cap on the number of guests at 200. No fresh bookings are allowed up to March 31.

Besides strict implementation of these instructions, the State government has ordered action against violation under Disaster Management Act, 2005, and Epidemic Disease Act, 1897 to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19 virus.

The accused have been identified as Praful Kumar Nayak (25), Hemanth Kumar Nayak (28), Sujit Kumar Nayak (31). All are residents of Madhapur and hail from Odisha.

Police were acting on two complaints in which the complainants stated that cash was withdrawn from their bank accounts when they were present at their respective homes. The prime accused Praful, who used to work at pubs, allegedly bought a skimmer online and began to clone cards belonging to customers. He then allegedly asked Hemanth to help him clone cards and approached Sujit to withdraw cash from ATMs.

Police said Praful did not work in restaurants or pubs for more than 10 days so that his skimming and card cloning could remain undetected. The accused are said to have struck at ATMs from at least 31 Indian and foreign banks and allegedly siphoned off lakhs of rupees.

314,2020/03/17,"Cipla, CSIR-IICT join hands for COVID-19 drugs","‘It could take about six to 10 weeks to make two of the three chemical compounds’

Indian Pharmaceutical giant Cipla has voluntarily come forward to immediately manufacture three promising chemical compounds with anti-viral properties to treat COVID-19 and has sought the help of Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR)-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) to make the Active Pharma Ingredients (APIs) for the same.

IICT director S. Chandrasekhar and principal scientist Prathama S. Mainkar on Tuesday told presspersons that Cipla chairman Y.K Hamied has requested them to start preparing the chemical compounds — Favipiravir, Remidesivir and Bolaxavir — so that his pharma-biotech firm can start the next phase of trials, regulatory authority approvals and subsequent mass production of the anti-viral drugs “at any cost”.

Dr. Chandrasekhar and Dr. Mainkar said several anti-viral drugs were discovered in the past few years but were halted after clinical trails due to lack of demand. IICT scientists had narrowed down to about 15 such compounds which had passed toxicology reports and the above three are in that category.

“Favipiravir and Remidesivir have already undergone clinical trials and hence, we will not require much time to make them as the raw materials are readily available. It could take about six to 10 weeks to make them. We had proactively started making the molecules in our modern Kilo lab with scientists working in two shifts. Process to start Bolaxavir molecule will begin now,” they said.

The director explained that due to artificial intelligence, deep data mining and advanced computational and mathematical models, it is not that difficult to narrow down to the chemical compounds required. “We will be making about 100gm each to begin. Cipla will follow it up with bio-equivalence tests, on dogs and human trials before approaching the regulatory authority to manufacture the drug to cure coronavirus,” he said.

“Cipla will be investing substantial resources into the making of the drug which should be in the market in rthe next six months. We will get royalty and this is not the first time we are collaborating with the pharma giant as we had helped them make drugs for AIDS, cancer and others,” said Dr. Chandrasekhar.

315,2020/03/17,"Virus vs Vaayu, a corona tale for kids","An educative online comic book on COVID-19, up on the CBSE website, is getting attention from across the globe

Even though most of us seem to be talking about COVID-19 all the time, there is a lot of confusion among the general public. Especially children.

While schools declared holidays, netizens shared how some students seemed to be owing the holiday to ‘Corona tyohar (festival)’. In times like these, Ravindra Khaiwal, additional professor of environmental health, Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health PGIMER along with Suman Mor, Department of Environment studies Panjab University, Chandigarh brought out Kids, Vaayu and Corona: who wins the fight?. It is a comic, aimed at COVID-19 awareness.

In the 22-page online comic, Vaayu is a superhero. Dressed in white shirt and blue cape, he is also the narrator of the comic. He doesn’t just explain children about the virus but also tells them how one can be protect themselves from it.

The opening page tells us the need for such a comic. Aimed at children below 12 years, the comic explains why parents should take time to explain about the virus in detail. “But information must be accurate. Wrong information doesn’t just create confusion but also spreads a fearful environment for all. Our hero, Vaayu is a global citizen who lives in the foothills of Himalayas, India and works for better public health and environment. The children call for his help to fight against the global threat,” explains Ravindra.

The story in the comic begins with children watching ‘Breaking news’ on Corona virus, and turning to their parents to understand what it means. The parent postpones the chat with the children and so, the children turn to Vaayu for help. The comic talks about what the virus is, how it can spread and what it can do once it enters the human body. Well-supported by comic illustrations, it also explains symptoms and how one can minimise contact.

Ravindra explains that the comic was originally aimed at spreading knowledge about air pollution. The characters were all created for the same. “The moment Corona was announced as a pandemic we decided to use the strips for COVID-19. As a public health expert, me and my team did a lot of research to bring out the right information. We also sourced information on the virus as published by the Ministry of Health and World Health Organisation. The information to be used was vetted by the National Centre of Disease Control, New Delhi, following which the Ministry of Health published it on the CBSE website. It can be easily downloaded. The moment it was uploaded, we could trace the downloads not from just across India but from across the world,” adds Ravindra.

Helping the illustrators and graphic artists to make it children-friendly were Aditya and Lakshya Khaiwal. The team worked on their questions to build the script for the comic.

“There have been requests from the Government of Czech Republic, China, Japan, Canada and a few other countries for them to print and publish in their own languages. We were more than happy to share this comic with them for print with appropriate credit to our government and ministry of health,” adds Ravindra.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/vnfjf4/article31090312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17Corona-comic1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kids-vaayu-corona-who-wins-the-fight-dr-ravindra-khaiwal-dr-suman-mor-corona-virus-covid-19-ministry-of-health-cbse/article31090315.ece

The precursor to the action by the government was because of tweets sent to IT & Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao complaining about some schools continuing to remain open and asking teachers to attend despite the official orders to shut down.

Mr. Rao immediately replied to the tweet and requested Education Minister P. Sabitha Indra Reddy to direct all school managements to close down the institutions.

317,2020/03/17,Surveillance teams to visit houses of foreign-returnees,"Though preliminary health check-ups at airports may not have revealed anything amiss, the symptoms may start showing up during the window period

In view of the increase in COVID-19 cases in the city, which is causing concern across sections, the city administration is getting its act together to contain the spread. As part of the efforts to nip the contagion in the bud, special surveillance teams are being formed across the city at circle-level, with members drawn from all departments concerned.

The teams with either officials or staff from Health, Revenue, Police departments and GHMC, will visit the persons who have recently arrived from coronavirus-affected countries, and check upon their health status.

Though preliminary health check-ups at the airports may not have revealed anything amiss, the symptoms may start showing up during the window period, officials from the GHMC said.

So far, all the four persons who have tested positive for the coronavirus disease in the city, were found to have returned from abroad. The index case in the city/State was a person who had arrived from Dubai, though he did not land at city’s Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The second and third cases were persons who landed at RGIA from Italy and the Netherlands respectively, and passed the thermal screening test at the airport. Fourth and the latest patient arrived from Scotland. Though there is no evidence of the disease spreading locally from them to the others, including family members, officials are not leaving anything to chance, and all precautions are being taken in order to curtail the virus spread. For this to happen, all recent foreign-returnees will have to be revisited at their homes. Police department will help the teams to identify the persons, while Revenue and GHMC staff will zero in on their residences.

In case anyone is found to be suffering from the symptoms, they will be shifted to isolation wards by the Health officials, along with their family members. If tests for the infection are found to be positive for any such patients, their contacts since their return will be traced, and similar process will be carried out for them too. Visits by the surveillance teams have begun on Monday, and will intensify in the coming days, they said. Initially, details have been collected pertaining to about 150 to 170 persons, officials said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/s037pa/article31085942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17KNK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/surveillance-teams-to-visit-houses-of-foreign-returnees/article31085943.ece

South Central Railway (SCR) has decided to step up measures to control the spread of coronavirus by ensuring availability of liquid soaps and water in toilets of coaches and pantry cars.

All curtains have been removed from air-conditioned coaches with immediate effect and minimum temperature is being set around 25 degrees C.

Not a ‘blanket’ ban

SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya convened a meeting with all heads and medical officers on Monday where it was decided that blankets will not be given to passengers in AC two and three tier coaches with immediate effect.

However, some washed blankets will be kept to meet any kind of emergency, or for the elderly and the indisposed. Blankets with freshly washed covers will be made available for first class passengers on demand.

A training session was conducted through video conference for all the medical officials from Railway Board in coordination with Union Ministry of Health with regard to handling of coronavirus cases. Quarantine facilities have been set up with 1,019 beds at 27 locations across the six divisions — Secunderabad, Hyderabad, Nanded, Guntur, Guntakal and Vijayawada.

Railway medical officials are in regular touch with the government health and medical authorities to maintain coordination and handle the situation to prevent the spread of the virus. Comprehensive cleaning of coaches, including the toilets and pantry cars, along with proper disinfection at prescribed frequencies is being taken up. On-board housekeeping staff have been instructed to take up regular and proper cleaning of coach interiors like doors, latches, taps, handles etc., which are frequently touched by the passengers, said SCR chief PRO Ch. Rakesh.

Regular and frequent cleaning of stations, including waiting halls, seating arrangements, grab rails, hand rests, toilets, water troughs and any other areas which are susceptible to spread of virus, is under way.

319,2020/03/17,Knot a good time to wed!,"Police asking function hall managements to cancel bookings post April 1

The threat of COVID-19 has led to sudden cancellation of plans, leaving citizens confused.

Wedding halls do have the permission to go about their business till the end of March, even as the State government has recommended, but not mandated, trimming of guests to 200 per gathering. However, police officials across the State are conducting meetings with the managements of function halls, asking them not to accept any fresh bookings and to cancel events scheduled after April 1.

“At present, we are unable to implement the 200-persons restriction and there is no written order in this regard either. But, we have asked the convention centre owners to request their clients to restrict the duration of the gatherings so that the guests won’t stay for long hours,” a senior police officer told The Hindu.

With no clarity on how long the impact of the virus would last, forcing function halls to remain shut, people who have made bookings post April 1 risk losing their advance amount unless they fix a muhurtam for a later booking.

As far as cinema halls are concerned, they have put up notices about staying shut till the month-end.

Movie postponed

Other than Nani-starrer V, there were no big budget Tollywood movies running in theatres. Even Aranya, a multilingual movie starring Rana Daggubati which was slated to release on April 2, has been postponed indefinitely given the current circumstances.

However, shopping malls are still attracting a steady stream of shoppers while the footfall at restaurants has seen a dip.

There was an unprecedented rush at railway and bus stations across the integrated old district on Monday in the wake of the announcement of holidays for educational institutions till March 31 as a precaution against COVID-19. With cinema halls, bars, pubs, parks, gyms and swimming pools remaining closed, most vehicles stayed off the roads and autorickshaws were sparsely seen.

With people preferring to stay cooped up indoors, the roads wore a deserted look in the afternoon. Corporate business malls and small businesses were also affected. Sale of poultry products drastically reduced. Chicken was priced at ₹50-₹80 per kg while a dozen eggs were being sold at ₹42.

Srinivas, owner of Kwality supermarket in Subashnagar, said his business has dipped by almost 50% as schools and colleges have declared holidays. Sales at fuel stations, hotels and restaurants were also affected as a sizeable chunk of people have left for their native places.

Meanwhile, the number of devotees increased at certain important temples, given that Monday is considered auspicious. Venu, executive officer of the famous Kanteswar temple here, said they witnessed rush since early morning as holidays were announced.

321,2020/03/17,Tight security at quarantine centres,"Police personnel is guarding all government buildings where unusual guests and asymptomatic air passengers from seven countries would be quarantined for 14 days.

Protest by locals

Alongside the perimeter of Haritha Resorts in Ananthagiri Hills of Vikarabad alone, a ring of CCTVs cameras have been set up to capture the movement of people and additional force is deployed to protest the asymptomatic persons from the aggrieved locals, who are protesting against the facility in their area.

Measures are also being taken to ensure that the asymptomatic air passengers who arrived at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport from China, Republic of Korea, France, Italy, Germany and Spain, do not slip out of the resort.

In a few states, people who were isolated or quarantined had escaped from isolation wards. The security measures ensure that none of them escapes and mingles in the community before completing the mandatory 14-day quarantine period.

In a video conference with District Collectors, Superintendents of Police, Commissioners of Police and officials from other departments, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar also asked the police officials to deploy additional forces at the centres. “The objective is to protect the air passengers at the centres and make sure they don’t run away,” an officer told The Hindu.

Vikarabad police said 30 people who arrived at RGIA from those seven countries are quarantined at Haritha Resort in Ananthagiri, where their health condition will be constantly monitored. “Locals don’t have to worry, since those being quarantined are not COVID-19 suspects. We have merely kept them under observation,” Vikarabad SP M. Narayana said.

Meanwhile, Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar has asked their personnel to take precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19. “These are testing times for us. If we are healthy and properly protected, we can serve the community better,” he tweeted on Monday.

In another tweet, he said, “Hyderabad is witnessing good partnership between community and police to check coronavirus.

322,2020/03/17,Work from home option keeps IT firms going,"‘Companies given liberty to make their own assessment of the situation’

The State government, which earlier wanted IT firms to inform it before suspending operations or instructing staff to work from home in view of COVID-19 scare, has now left it to the judgment of the companies.

There is no direction from the government that they should close down and ask employees to work from home or vice-versa. “All IT companies have been given liberty to make their own assessment of the situation and respond in a prudent manner,” IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan told The Hindu.

With many of the firms having presence in Hyderabad headquartered in the U.S. and Europe, they get directions from their global offices. “We are not preventing them from implementing [such directions]; it is left to individual companies,” he said, adding the government shared bulletins, issued twice a day, by the Health department with the firms.

Noting that precise numbers of those working from home were not available, the senior official estimated 15-20% to have taken the option. IT and ITeS firms in the city employ around five lakh people. While some leading firms have given the work from home option, those that have not done so do not insist on employees feeling unwell to report to office.

Business continuity under the circumstances is not of paramount importance. Not risking people to any harm is more important, he said to queries. Stating that the clients IT firms served were also not unrealistic, he pointed out “people have that maturity and understanding”.

On how those part of the eco-system would manage, Mr.Ranjan said some firms may offer compensation like Swedish home furnishings major IKEA, which has its first India store in Hyderabad. For others dependent, there obviously would be an impact.

While IKEA was yet to decide whether to temporarily shut the showroom, it has decided to suspend the home installation service for the time being. In doing so, it decided to continue paying the workforce, whose earnings are linked to the number of installations they do, what they typically make every month, he said.

On the work from home aspect, Nasscom’s senior director Srikanth Srinivasan said every organisation is using its own matrix to provide the option.

In terms of work, there is no impact, he said, citing the 50:50 rule followed by some US firms that in other words involved half the staff working from home and rest report to office. Some firms flip it every week such that everyone gets to work from home and office.

Technically, there are no issues for those opting to work from home with the Union Ministry of Communications on March 13 granting relaxations up to April 30 in the terms and conditions of Other Service Providers.

The Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association estimated 30-40% of IT employees of multinational firms to be working from home. For other larger India service providers, it may be lower and there is no reliable data for the small companies. For those reporting to work, companies are using various measures like temperature screening, high degree of sanitisation, following laid down SoPs and closely monitoring the situation.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/work-from-home-option-keeps-it-firms-going/article31085598.ece
323,2020/03/17,A city shaped and reshaped by epidemics,"Built after a plague, Hyderabad has fought a slew of natural disasters, disease outbreaks

Inside the inner arch of Charminar, on the eastern side is the small image of a rodent that was the carrier of bubonic plague which wreaked havoc and killed lakhs and shaped the city of Hyderabad. “Epidemics and lack of water supply were one of the reasons for the 1591 move-out of Golconda and creation of Hyderabad,” says heritage activist Sajjad Shahid.

Every year, at the beginning of monsoon, women in Secunderabad dress up in festive finery and carry a bowl of food on their heads when they visit the Ujjaini Mahankali Temple. According to oral history, the temple is a tribute to the Goddess for deliverance from smallpox nearly 200 years ago that killed thousands.

Change in topography

A few hundred years after the creation of Hyderabad, the city was again visited by a virulent pestilence forcing another change in topography. While the 1908 flood is considered the reason for the big push to redesign the city, the unsanitary conditions were a key factor. Built after a plague, fighting against epidemics, transformed by pandemics, Hyderabad has been shaped and reshaped by diseases like the COVID-19 that is threatening the world. Between 1916 and 1918, an influenza epidemic named Spanish Flu killed 18-20 million Indians.

But the 1915 epidemic of cholera (called gattara in Telangana) led to another shift in the city. It led to the creation of a hospital that is still called Koranti, a corrupted version of the word ‘quarantine’. Officially, it is called Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases, named after a gentleman who discovered the link between mosquito and the malaria parasite on August 20, 1897 in Secunderabad. The quarantine facility was built on the outskirts of the city. Ironically, the area near the hospital is now a densely populated locality.

Places of refuge

At the time of these pandemics, the city’s gardens, temples and dargahs became places of refuge. “Part of what we now call Begum Bazaar was known as Mulla Khayali Bagicha. There were other gardens in the area and Hyderabad was developed away from the thickly populated Golconda,” informs Mr Shahid.

The biggest blow to the city was between 1916-18 when thousands of people died. Temple and dargah lands were turned into places of refuge and in course of time, the Chennakesava Temple that was controlled by Raja Bansi Lal family turned the grounds into a refuge for people afflicted by the plague. Now the area is called Chandrayangutta and the open space around it has disappeared.

Some of the refuge grounds were designated plague camps and they dotted the peripheral areas of the city. One of them was near Makbarah Tahawur Ali Khan and another was near Kunta Nandi Muslaigura. While the plague camp near Makbarah Tahawur Ali Khan has disappeared without a trace in the Karwan area, the Nandi Muslai Guda or N.M. Guda is but a name without the lake (kunta).

During the 1890s epidemics, camps were set up in areas that we now call Panjagutta, Basheerbagh and Irram Manzil. “During these epidemics, families were not allowed to take the bodies to their family graveyards and were buried in the nearest available one. The government banned the transport of dead bodies to limit the spread of the disease,” says Mr. Shahid.

But for a city with recurring encounters with epidemics, the City Improvement Board (CIB) changed everything.

In 1911, the first case of bubonic plague was discovered in Nampally area, according to Mohammed Ayub Ali Khan who discovered a document written by Muhammad Samdani about the outbreak. Another historian says “Nampally was a nursery of plague and disease”. This area was levelled to the ground and three types of houses were built there by the CIB for people of different economic strata.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kitm9c/article31085630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17charminar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/a-city-shaped-and-reshaped-by-epidemics/article31085592.ece
324,2020/03/17,From Bengaluru with love,"Bangalore Blues’ new album is a tribute to the city

Bangalore Blues is the latest album by Jazz vocalist and author Radha Thomas which is soon set for release. It all started in 2011 as a Google search for Radha who was looking for a piano player and found Aman Mahajan just two streets away in Cox Town. “A match made in musical heaven” she says as they have since been working together, composing and playing much music across India and Europe. While their music is rooted firmly in jazz, there are definite strains of India in the songs. But Radha, who grew up mostly in a boarding school in Panchgani, joined a rock and roll band and later lived in New York. Radha Thomas spoke with Metroplus about the making of her album.

Excerpts...

Is Bangalore Blues a melancholic tribute to the city?

The album didn't happen overnight. Aman (Mahajan) and me, have been writing and trying to perfect the music for almost ten years. It's only now that we felt ready to make an album. It's called ‘Bangalore Blues’ because that's the title track. This is a song I wrote a while ago, when I wasn't in this city, and missing it a lot, feeling all nostalgic about it. The song got completed after I met Aman and he added his magic to it.

The album is not so much an ode to Bangalore as it is a just a statement of fact. I think that missing Bangalore and writing a sad song about that is very different to living in the city and facing day-to-day issues. We have another song called ‘Load Shedding,’ which is all about the power cuts in town. So it's not all rosy and pink you know. Sometimes it's black and candle lit. We have a video for this song, which was actually shot entirely in candlelight by this gifted film maker, Sharath Holla. https://youtu.be/PMo6jDg5TEQ

Could you talk about the process of creating the album?

I wrote all the lyrics to all the songs. Two of the melodies were composed by Aman, ‘Leifmotif’ and ‘Load Shedding.’ All the others were mine, but with huge inputs from Aman in terms of chords and arrangements. So, it’s a huge collaborative effort. Aman and I tend to get the same ideas almost simultaneously.

Could you describe the songs?

‘The Morning After’ with Indian melodic influences and a jazz treatment, describes the after-effects of a night with supersized gin and tonics with a girlfriend in lower Manhattan. ‘Jailer’ is a waltzy song that talks about a terrible experience that I had years ago. Rather than tackling the abuser, it was happier to write songs about it. ‘Would I Lie for you’ is a funky tune used with a typical Mridanga korvai to suit the rap lyrics. The Indian influence is evident here, but the treatment is neo jazz.

‘Leifmotif’ a delicate composition by Aman is in seven beats for the most part. The buried origins of this song are in the raag Yaman, but with so many jazz substitutions, it is only felt and not heard. ‘Only Illusion’ has syncopating rhythms and changing time-feel..a meditative song of love and longing. The piano work is almost classical in nature. ‘Bangalore Blues’ talks of a snowy winter’s day in New York, when I longed for the jacaranda trees and greenness of home.

What made you choose artist Paul Fernandes to be associated with your album and video?

Paul Fernandes is a chronicler of Bangalore an he has a quaint, ironic and witty way of capturing this city in his art. He is really quite astonishing. I asked him if he would let me use his art for my album and to my utter joy he said yes. Not only that, we decided to use many of his artworks for a video for the title track.

After training in Hindustani how did you find the shift to Jazz cope with your timbre?

I studied Hindustani music a long time ago. And even then, I was already in a rock and roll band. I took lessons to help me sing better and also to be able to incorporate the improv techniques with my own singing.

Your huge break in the 70s is after you joined the rock ‘n’ roll band, Human Bondage?

I was auditioned by a very serious organisation called Jazz India, when I was about 18, singing at Chin Lung Restaurant in Bangalore. They said if they liked my singing, they'd help my career - if they didn't like me, I was out of luck. I guess I was good enough, because they paved the way for me to New York to meet some amazing musicians and perform and get myself a little experience.

The musical duo

Aman Mahajan says Radha and he have worked together for almost a decade now, playing all kinds of music with different groups, focussing mostly on jazz standards and original music. What sets Bangalore Blues apart, he says, is that “it's a collaboration in the truest and most basic sense – a completely stripped-down piano-voice duo version of songs by the two of us.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/hn46ca/article31091520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGM-RADHATHOMAS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/jazz-vocalist-radha-thomas-pianist-aman-mahajan/article31091521.ece
325,2020/03/17,Welcome to the Alexis Kings show,"The three-piece British rock band, who were in the country for the first time, talk about their start and whether India will be a part of their next song

“Oh no, we have the worst answer for this. We always say we should make up a story about it. There is no special reason behind the name; we just thought it sounded cool,” says Brendan Aherne, lead singer of Alexis Kings, when asked if there is a story behind the band’s name (say in the vein of Keith Moon suggesting Led Zeppelin or Mark Knopfler’s Dire Straits story).

The three-piece British rock band, comprising Brendan, Sam Privett (lead guitar) and Fabio Bocca (drums), were in Bengaluru last week to perform at Hard Rock Café, Whitefeld, as part of a multi-city India tour.

After completing soundcheck, which included a rendition of The Beatles’ ‘Come Together’, the friendly and unassuming Brendan and Fabio sat down for a chat with MetroPlus.

Growing up in St Albans, near London, Brendan and Sam, who were in school together, loved making music and played a handful of shows. Says Brendan, “After university, we decided to make a go of it for a year. So, we went away to Norfolk and made our first EP, Squire (2016). Then we met a relative of Fabio’s who introduced us to him. He was probably only 18 at the time. But he was unbelievable at that age. And that was kind of that really. We have been together since.”

The eponymous single off the EP — an addictive, summery tune — made it to the Top 10 of the Spotify UK Viral Chart. The band also garnered praise from top radio stations such as BBC Radio 1 and Radio X.

Seeing that their musical style has elements of various genres from rock to funk, how would they describe it? Brendan says, “The first EP was popular when it came out but it was a bit all over the place in terms of the sound. We are back to recording and producing all the songs ourselves now. One of the main things we want to do is create a sound so we are recognisable. So, we love being funky, we love having a good production behind the beat. Beats and bass are like the most important thing for us. We think we naturally have singalong choruses so I think we just have a reaction to our gigs. With our new songs especially, we want to have a sound running through all of them.”

What’s cooking? Brendan says, “Our next single, which we produced and recorded, is called ‘Cosmo’. We have been shooting a video ever since we got to India. We started in Mumbai and have been shooting at every gig we have. It will be really cool. Whenever we have these international tours, we always try and put a music video together. We might have an amazing feature on it which we can’t really talk about until it is confirmed. Hopefully, it will come out in the next month or so if we’re lucky.”

Says Fabio, “Yes, pretty much. It is like a new sound. It is a bit boring doing the same thing over and over again. I think for as long as we are going on, we will always be testing different stuff. Just doing what makes us happy and what we enjoy doing. That is the most important part.”

As for what they take inspiration from while writing the songs, Brendan says, “A lot of songwriters talk about themselves and their experiences but that is not too much with me. It is more about the people around me and their experiences or stories I have heard. The last two songs, however, have been personal, so I will probably tap into something different there. We are definitely going to be trying some different things with the new stuff.”

And though the band is visiting India for the first time, they do have an Indian connection as they are the ambassadors for a charity, Wells on Wheels. “We went to Nashik and we had no idea what we got ourselves into. There was a ceremony…” “It was incredible,” interjects Fabio, adding that the school children put up a dance for them. “We were on the news, dancing with the kids! We will be making a song from the experiences out here,” says Brendan.

On whether fans can look forward to a full-length album this year (the lyric video for the band’s latest song, ‘Surrender’, released on YouTube last month), Brendan says “I think when the time is right, we will release an album. I think we just want to keep releasing songs. I don't know how many albums are released because people have a short attention span. They listen to an album probably once or twice, then the next wave of music is out. A lot of effort goes into these songs, but they get lost.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/7c5nex/article31090615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16bgmalexiskings1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/welcome-to-the-alexis-kings-show/article31090618.ece
326,2020/03/17,Corpn. budget to bepresented on Saturday,"Spotlight on ways to increse revenue

At a time when the Kochi Corporation is straddling multiple loans and has done little to improve its sources of revenue, the local body is all set to present its annual budget on Saturday.

With local body elections due later this year, the current council is likely to leave crores worth of debt to its successor. “A loan worth ₹57 crore was taken from the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) to pay the local body share to PMAY-LIFE beneficiaries last year. Another bank loan worth ₹34.4 crore to pay dues to PMAY beneficiaries was recently sanctioned, besides an additional ₹10 crore to pay dues owed to contractors,” said V.P. Chandran, LDF councillor.

Despite plans in budgets from the previous two years to increase the Corporation’s revenue through value capture financing, strict tax collection and municipal bonds, they have not borne fruit, LDF councillors said. Creating systems for digital tax payments, which had been listed for implementation in the previous year’s budget, has not come through in the absence of an e-governance system.

Deputy Mayor and Finance Standing Committee chairperson K.R. Premakumar said that continued efforts would have to be made to increase the local body’s revenue. The Corporation has recently begun issuing long-pending revision of tax notices, besides placing a request before the government for additional bill collectors to ensure more stringent tax collection, he said.

Tax was also now being collected from buildings that the Cochin Port Trust had leased out – some of the companies functioning out of these buildings had been evading property tax payments for years, he added.

The budget should also ideally include measures to resolve urgent issues in the city like persistent water logging, a UDF councillor said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corpn-budget-to-bepresented-on-saturday/article31093344.ece

328,2020/03/17,COVID-19 | Municipalities take proactive steps,"The municipalities around the city have joined hands with the district administration in combating the COVID-19 issues arising out of people in home quarantine.

“We are giving house to house notices on the disease and what should be done in case they come in contact with people with travel history and how to be vigilant on keeping hands germ-free in public places,” said Rukiya Jamal, chairperson of Kalamassery Municipality.

“There are 31 under home quarantine in the municipality and for three of them some arrangement of food is being made too. A hand-wash awareness drive has been started at prominent public places in the town. We are also trying to dissuade the use of mask as much as possible as it creates unnecessary burden on waste management. There is no system to collect medical waste from houses,” she said.

In Aluva, municipal chairperson Lissy Abraham said that besides awareness creation at house-to-house level using ASHA workers, government logos and banners on COVID-19 would be displayed at public places. ‘Hand washing to break the chain’ (of germ transmission) is also being publicised, she said.

“We have given a notice to postpone social gatherings in Town Halls and have asked health clubs, parks, libraries and the Vyapari Mela at the Aluva Manappuram to close down to reduce interaction of people. Hotels have also been given directions for safe procedures,” she said.

A team of health workers on the ground level, including Kudumbashree, Anganwadi and ASHA workers, in coordination with the Health Department, is taking care of about 32 people in home quarantine in Thripunithura municipality. Except for one incident at Irimpanam where the neighbours made an issue of a woman who had returned from Pathanamthitta, there have been no other issues. Lack of awareness among people is the root cause of any such trouble, said a health worker.

The Ernakulam District Panchayat president Dolly Kuriakose said that panchayats had been given instructions on using their own fund or Plan fund for COVID-19 awareness. A meeting of representatives of 27 divisions of the district panchayat along with the Health officials would be held on Wednesday, she added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mbxjd9/article31096557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18KICORONA3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/coronavirus-municipalities-take-proactive-steps/article31092890.ece

330,2020/03/17,Diversion of more floodrelief fund unearthed,"Vigilance Court rejects bail pleas of first, sixth and seventh accused

The City C-Branch probing the scam involving the alleged diversion of money from the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) in the aftermath of the 2018 deluge has detected fresh misappropriation of ₹4.70 lakh, thus scaling up the scam to ₹27.73 lakh, which is nearly a two-fold increase from the initial estimated misappropriation of ₹10.54 lakh.

The fraudsters expended the illegally acquired money for diverse purposes from purchasing vehicles to investing in poultry farm.

Police revealed this in the remand report filed before the Muvattupuzha Vigilance Court when the bail petitions of the accused were heard on Tuesday. The prosecution opposed the bail of the first accused Vishnu Prasad, sixth accused N.N. Nithin and the seventh accused Shintu Martin citing that granting bail to the accused at this stage will adversely affect further probe. The court rejected the bail applications and remanded them till March 31.

The investigation team found additional transfers of ₹4.70 lakh made to various bank accounts of the first accused during the probe conducted after the court granted police five days’ custody on March 12. It was also found that he had bought a used SUV and brand new motorcycle during the period of the scam from last January to this January. In the meantime, the sixth accused had paid advance of ₹30,000 for a new hatchback car in the name of the seventh accused, his wife, only to cancel the booking as soon as the scam was unearthed. The first and the second accused, B. Mahesh, had invested for a poultry farm business in partnership.

They had allegedly transferred ₹1 lakh towards investment in poultry farm to the account held by one Ratheesh Sivan, who had served as web area network manager at the Piravom branch of the Union Bank till 2018. The account holder was allowed to take ₹20,000 as contribution towards his sister’s marriage while the rest he transferred to a rent account maintained in the name of the District Collector at HDFC Bank, which was later appropriated by the first accused.

The first accused also gave ₹60,000 as hospital expenses to one Chinchu Sunil who worked as a daily wage worker at the collectorate claiming that it was a credit which she should return once he arranges aid from the MP fund though in reality the amount was mobilised by the collectorate staff as contribution.

The first accused then transferred ₹60,000 from CMDRF to the account of Chinchu at the Mullakkal branch of SBI, which he then collected.

The investigation team said that the list of beneficiaries at the collectorate and the list of those who received aid through the treasury need to be compared to determine whether the accused had committed more such frauds. The number of beneficiaries runs into a lakh and details of each beneficiary need to be verified to determine the actual amount misappropriated from CMDRF.

331,2020/03/17,Opposition fumes over poor utilisation of Plan funds,"‘Of the ₹171 crore allotted, fresh projects worth only ₹60 crore were taken up’

At a council meeting held on Monday to discuss and approve Kochi Corporation Plan fund projects for the upcoming year, Opposition councillors staged a walkout protesting against the poor implementation of the current year’s projects.

Of the ₹171 crore that the State government has allotted for the Corporation’s Plan fund projects for the upcoming financial year, fresh projects worth only ₹60 crore could be taken up, said LDF councillor V.P. Chandran. “The remaining amount would have to be allotted to complete projects spilling over from the 2019-20 Plan, drastically reducing the number of new projects that can be taken up.”

Only a little over ₹60 crore had been utilised from the Plan fund this year, letting over ₹100 crore lapse, Mr. Chandran said. “Every year sees a few spillover projects, but failing to utilise such a large amount is a first.”

Opposition councillors attributed the delay in implementing several Plan fund projects to the recent rejig of standing committees.

As part of a prior agreement, Congress standing committee chairpersons had resigned, necessitating fresh elections. It had delayed important decisions, they said.

Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar said the reshuffling of standing committees could have delayed the process of placing projects before them for approval.

“The government’s treasury restrictions have also delayed project implementation,” he said.

Projects that the State government had directed local bodies to take up have not featured in the Plan fund proposals for the coming year.

Funds have not been set aside for projects announced in the State budget such as the Hunger Free Kerala project. As part of the project, local bodies were required to set aside funds to set up hotels for low cost meals.

Despite State government guidelines, projects to clean canals and rivers, construction of public toilets, welfare projects for the elderly and drafting a disaster management plan had not been included in the Plan fund projects for the year, said Mr. Chandran.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/opposition-fumes-over-poor-utilisation-of-plan-funds/article31086075.ece

Three people were arrested on Monday for having gathered at the Cochin International Airport late on Sunday evening to welcome reality TV show participant Rajith Kumar, despite warnings against public gatherings in the wake of COVID-19 crisis.

A case was filed on Monday morning against 79 people, including reality TV show Bigg Boss participant Rajith Kumar, to greet whom fans had gathered at the airport. The three arrested persons, identified as Nibhas, Muhammad Afsal and Pareekutty, were later released on bail. The Nedumbassery police said they were charged with unlawful assembly, rioting, disobeying orders of a public servant and causing danger to the public.

Suhas, who is also the District Magistrate, has used the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 to commandeer the services of medical and paramedical staff of various private hospitals and non-government institutions, who can be spared by the establishments without affecting their routine activities.

The services of the medical and paramedical staff made available would be helpful in containing the spread of COVID-19.

It is important to identify affected persons and quarantine them at their homes or hospitals depending upon the severity of infection. It would require additional skilled and qualified personnel as there is a huge shortage in the district, with the increasing burden on existing healthcare workers.

The District Police Chief (Kochi City), the Superintendent of Police, Ernakulam Rural, and Sub Divisional Magistrates shall contact hospitals and other agencies which can spare paramedical staff and utilise their services, in consultation with district health authorities.

The Collector has said that as a notice cannot be served individually to all concerned, the order was passed ex-parte.

The Collector also issued an order that whatever space deemed fit for people to be quarantined in the wake of COVID-19 spread would be taken over by the district administration for the purpose. The order said that the requirement of space for keeping people under quarantine was increasing every day.

The tourist was offloaded from an Emirates flight along with others on Sunday following the District Collector’s intervention.

The Health Department had traced the contact list of the tourist, who had visited various places including Munnar and Thrissur.

337,2020/03/17,Vacant plots breeding grounds of health hazards in Kochi,"Overgrown weeds and decaying waste on abandoned plots turning a scourge of the city

Vacant plots with overgrown weeds are worrying the city dwellers.

A large number of plots, all across the city, which have been left unattended by its owners are posing health risks to the city dwellers. Despite several complaints from the general public, the civic authorities are finding it difficult to tackle the situation.

Most of such abandoned plots would quickly become waste dumping sites in the city. People make use of these unused plots to dump the domestic waste including the biodegradable refuse. The decaying waste would also lead to several health hazards, pointed out an official of the Health Department of the Kochi Corporation.

The dumping of waste would invite rodents to the area. Stray dogs too survive by feeding on the waste that is thrown in to the compound. The overgrown weeds provide a safe haven for snakes and pests, besides causing annoyance to those living in the neighbourhoods, he said.

Usually, the Health wing of the Kochi Corporation responds to such complaints and takes steps for cleaning the plots, said M.B. Muralidharan, a councillor. Quick action would be possible when one could identify the owners of such holdings. The civic authorities would directly get in touch with them and issue directions to clean up the plots. Most of the property owners would willingly comply with the directions.

Two weeks ago, one such compound was cleaned up near Vennala Government High School by its owner after the issue was brought to his notice. However, there are also instances where the owners refuse to interfere and address the issue. In such cases, the civic body would serve them legal notice to do the cleaning. If they refuse to spruce up the property, the civic body would do it at its own expense and later initiate revenue recovery proceedings against the owner, he said.

Legal action

The Section 440 of the Kerala Municipalities Act empowers the local body to undertake such measures, pointed out a Health supervisor of the local body.

The section empowers the secretary of the local body to to issue directions to abate any nuisance caused to the general public. If the secretary is satisfied that “any act or omission, place or thing which causes or is likely to cause injury, danger, annoyance, disturbance or offence to the sense of sight, smell or hearing or to rest or sleep or which is or may be dangerous to life or injurious to health or property of any person or persons,” the official can issue directions to such persons who have caused the act to abate the nuisance within 48 hours. Any failure to comply with the directive within the specified time shall invite prosecution, according to the Act.

No database

The local body does not possess a database of such holdings as it does not have any legal rights over vacant plots. All that it can do is to invoke the provisions of the Act and ask the owners to clean up the plots, said the official.

According to M.J. Varghese, secretary of a residents’ association in the city, there have been a few instances where the owners of the holdings refused to clear the weeds despite being alerted about the public health issue caused by such plots.

The association has decided to take up the issue with the civic authorities. It will soon submit a memorandum to the Kochi Corporation seeking its interference, said Mr. Varghese.

On its part, the civic authorities felt that the difficulty in serving the notice on the owners of such holdings was the major hurdle in addressing the issue.

In a large number of cases, it was found that the owners of the plots were not known even to the neighbours. Though the name and other details of the owners were picked up from the revenue records, the notices could not be served as they were found not residing in those addresses. In some cases, the owners who purchased the holdings years ago might have settled abroad. It won’t be easy to serve them the notices, which is a mandatory legal provision for taking action, said R.S. Anu, Secretary, Kochi Corporation.

If the officials of the Corporation enter such compounds without issuing proper notice to its owners, such acts could be construed as unauthorised or illegal entry into the holdings. No one would be willing to take such steps fearing legal action, explained Ms. Anu.

In one case, an elderly woman, who was living alone in her house in the city, had to move the Kerala High Court to issue directions to the local body to interfere in the issue and to clear the weeds and waste from the compound. The civic authorities could not help the senior citizen as it could not serve the notice on the owner of the holding. Later, armed with the court order, the officials of the local body entered the compound and cleaned it up, she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/1tfr64/article31085672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17KIWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/breeding-grounds-of-health-hazards/article31085675.ece
338,2020/03/17,When they were caught in the web of ‘travel history’,"Kalamassery police come to the rescue of French woman and child

Having been caught in the web of their ‘travel history’ which included a visit to Varkala, a 27-year-old French national and her three-year-old son, were caught in a catch-22 situation amidst the COVID-19 scare here.

Even worse, Desmazure Fleurine lost her wallet at the airport. It contained ₹7,500, her credit card and driving licence. But help came in the form of personnel attached to Kalamassery police station.

She and her son Tao had gone to Cochin International Airport to see off her mother. While returning, health officials screened her and sought her travel history. On hearing of Varkala, where a foreign national was diagnosed with COVID-19, they sent her to the Taluk Hospital at Aluva and from there to the Government Medical College Hospital at Kalamassery.

Test results were negative and she was discharged, but she discovered that her wallet was missing. She and her son were cuddled on the hospital premises not knowing what to do, when someone informed the police that a foreigner was trying to ‘escape’ from the isolation ward.

“On coming to know of their situation, we purchased them food and informed their plight to the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) at the airport,” Raghu P.S., Civil Police Officer attached to Kalamassery station, told The Hindu. His stint with the Tourism Police helped him in this regard. The officials there contacted the French Consulate in Puducherry, who in turn sent ₹7,500 by money transfer.

Another concern of Ms. Fleurine, a journalist, was that being foreigners, she and her son would be detained for screening wherever they travelled in India, he said.

The police personnel helped her out here too, since her itinerary included visits to many other places, including Rishikesh. They contacted the RMO, who in turn forwarded a certificate that she tested negative for COVID-19. They also escorted her to Ernakulam Junction railway station, from where she boarded a train to New Delhi.

She said goodbye after promising to publish her experience once she returns to France, said Mr. Raghu, who had won recognitions from the Union Home Ministry during his stint with the Tourism Police for reaching help to foreign tourists.

339,2020/03/17,D Srinivasan and T Babu perform free plays in public spaces in Coimbatore,"Undeterred by rising costs and a decline in interest for theatre, D Srinivasan and T Babu’s passion for the stage drives them to perform free plays in public spaces

D Srinivasan and his friend T Babu recollect how they saved every paisa of their pocket money to buy themselves movie tickets at Kennedy Theatre, R S Puram. “It was only 55 Paisa for a ticket and Shivaji Ganesan was our hero. We would dance when he danced and cried with him. At school, we dressed up like him and enacted scenes from his movies,” remembers Srinivasan. The acting bug stayed on with them and they are now founders of Poonguil Kalai Mandram, a theatre group that has staged more than 50 plays. “We started in 1987 and our first play was called Oru Vidiyalai Thedigiron. It was about the life of a freedom fighter and it was staged at Kalai Arangam, R S Puram,” he says.

They present a new play once in three months. “Srinivasan is the script writer and I am the director. We are popularly known as Poonguil Srini and Poonguil Babu after our theatre group,” Babu says.

The pair brainstorms to come up with ideas and it takes Srinivasan one month to finalise the script. “My house doubles up as the office. We practise on weekends,” says Srinivasan. The actors have day jobs as painters, advocates, drivers and goldsmiths.

It is not all fun and games, though they do love theatre. The first staging of each play is stressful, admits Srinivasan. “The audience’s response will tell us if our jokes were really funny or if we conveyed the story well.

Till the end of the play, our hearts are racing,” Babu says. Their recent play Kalyana Galatta was performed for the first time at Gandhi Park two weeks ago. “It is a comedy and revolves around a girl who wants to get married. It was a great show and we had a good response from the crowd.”

Speaking of the unfortunate demise of theatre in the city, Srinivasan says, “The popularity of plays decreased due to televisions and computers. Auditoriums increased their rents and many local theatre troupes had to shut down. It was a difficult time and many of the theatre artistes had to look for other jobs. I now work as an assistant director in the film industry and Babu drives an autorickshaw.” This difficult time inspired them into presenting Viruthukal. “It was first performed in 1997 and has now covered 30 stages. It is about the lives of theatre artistes and is based on the tragic life of a friend who was an actor. As the number of plays decreased, he found it difficult to make ends meet. He ended up committing suicide. Such cases are very common among this field,” Babu rues. Viruthukal is one of their most popular plays. Most of Poonguil Kalai Mandram’s plays are staged in public spaces.“We cannot afford auditoriums. Our shows are non-ticketed and we believe that it helps to bring in more people. Our mission is to make stage plays popular again,” explains Srinivasan. In the last 10 years, they have performed in Chennai, Neyveli, Puducherry, Tiruchi and Thanjavur. “We found cheaper stages there. Most of our actors are volunteers. For others, we pool in our resources to pay them,” he reveals.

Srinivasan was honoured with the title ‘Kalai Choodamani’ by the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2006, for his contributions to theatre . “It was a proud moment and I never expected it,” he says.

The team has also done a short film called Marupakkam (The Other Side). It was released on YouTube in 2019. “My experience in the film industry helped me in its production. It was well received and now has more than 7,600 views,” he says.

Srinivasan and Babu are now working on their second short film. “It is a comedy and the shooting is in progress. We will release it online in the next few months. We have also recorded a play on cyber security for All India Radio and the first episode was aired last Saturday.” Srinivasan speaks for Babu too when he says, “We dream about making a feature film with theatre actors in the future”.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/kkce88/article31090201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/plays-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/d-srinivasan-and-t-babu-performs-free-plays-in-public-spaces-in-coimbatore/article31090202.ece

Six councillors of the Kozhikode Corporation, who were forced to return midway from their visit to Dubai, have been advised to remain quarantined at home for the next 14 days based on the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

The visit of the six councillors, all belonging to the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), to Dubai had already triggered a controversy against the backdrop of bird flu and COVID-19 scare gripping the district. “We had to cut short our visit in the wake of the controversy,” K.V. Baburaj, health standing committee chairman, told The Hindu on Monday. Since the councillors have been home quarantined, the budget session of the civic body has also been postponed to March-end. “We have not fixed the date. The budget has to be passed by March 31,” Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said.

Apart from Mr. Baburaj, two others — Mullaveettil Moideen and V.T. Sathyan — in the team are members of the health standing committee.

The others are M. Radhakrishnan, chairman of the standing committee on education and sports, M.P. Suresh, public works standing committee member and P. Bijulal, development standing committee member.

The councillors had left for Dubai from the Calicut airport on March 7 and were scheduled to return on March 15. But they had to fly back on Friday night.

“We had planned our visit much earlier. Our friends and relatives had invited us to Dubai. It had to be postponed on account of the floods last year. Unfortunately, it created a controversy now in the wake of bird flu hitting the district,” Mr. Baburaj said.

Special squads formed by government departments have increased the frequency of surprise inspections at medical shops in the district in the wake of complaints over unreasonable price hike of sanitisers and safety masks. So far, action has been taken against owners of six shops, which were selling masks at inflated prices.

Squads of Legal Metrology, Civil Supplies, Police and Health departments have sprung into action to track distributors who try to cash in on the unfair trade. Within the Kozhikode city limits, the Legal Metrology Department squad has already exposed three such shops and registered cases against the owners. “In our recent inspections, the medical shop owners were found selling masks which were not even having the mandatory MRP tag.

The inspection was conducted in the shops after we received confidential complaints,” said an Assistant Controller attached to the Kohikode Legal Metrology Department. He said more surprise inspections would be conducted on the basis of public complaints received through official helplines.

She instructed drivers and conductors of private buses to keep their vehicles germ-free by taking every possible measure to ensure health of their passengers in the wake of COVID-19.

She took sanitary workers to the autorichshaw stand in front of the new bus stand and asked them to spray the disinfectant on autorickshaws while asking the drivers to keep their vehicles clean always by sprinkling germicidal agents after dropping passengers.

Mr. Kannan said the corporation had deployed its sanitary workers to spray disinfectants at places where the public used to visit in large number like bus stands, places of worship, hospitals and other places. Parks under the corporation’s control have been closed.

All bars attached to TASMAC shops, clubs and hotels will remain closed till March 31. Following the closure of schools, colleges and Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, students started leaving their hostels since Tuesday morning while teachers reported for duty as usual.

“We never expected such a sudden closure even as we’re writing our public examinations. As the teachers coming to schools were taking care of ‘weak students’ with last minute fine-tuning, the closure has denied us an opportunity to get prepared by our teachers,” said a Plus Two student of a government-aided higher secondary school while leaving the hostel on Tuesday morning.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), Tirunelveli City, S. Saravanan led the awareness event organised at Armed Reserve Police ground.

All tourism spots on the foothills of the Western Ghats like Thalaiyanai near Kalakkad, Manimuthar Falls and Agasthiyar Falls have been closed for visitors.

Visitors are not allowed to visit Nambi Temple in the Western Ghats near Thirukkurunkudi.

In Thoothukudi too, parks were sealed on Tuesday to discourage the public especially holidaying children from visiting these leisure spots to spend time with their peer groups.

358,2020/03/17,COVID-19 threat: visitors restricted in prisons,"Health check-up made mandatory for those entering jails

MADURAI

Amidst COVID-19 scare, jail authorities have restricted visitors to all central prisons, district jails and sub-jails in southern districts. Besides, all jail staff and remand prisoners are being allowed into the prisons only after a health check-up and hands-and-feet washing.

Deputy Inspector General (Prisons) D. Pazhani said efforts were on to fix water taps at entry points of all prisons so that all visitors, including jail staff, could wash their hands and feet with soap. Thermal scanner would soon be installed in jails.

Madurai Range has got two central prisons (Madurai and Palayamkottai), a Special Women Prison in Madurai, six district jails and 30 sub-jails, where around 4,000 remand prisoners and convicts had been lodged.

“Regular interviews for remand prisoners and convicts that were allowed on five days a week have been suspended till further orders. Similarly, special interviews for convicts with good conduct with their family members on Sundays have also been suspended,” the DIG said.

Stating that only advocates would be allowed for interviews, that too during emergencies like meeting fast-approaching deadlines for court hearings and deaths reported in the families of convicts. “Even then, they would have to undergo a medical check-up. They should not have cough, cold and fever,” he added.

The interviewers would not be allowed to go closer to the prisoners and a minimum distance of six feet would be maintained.

Similar safety measures were also being adopted for the jail staff. They had been provided with masks and asked to wash their hands frequently, he said.

The prisoners being taken to courts and hospitals and new prisoners coming to jails would also undergo a medical check-up. “If they have any symptoms like fever, cough or cold, they would be referred to government hospitals,” Mr. Pazhani said.

On an average, 30 new prisoners came to Madurai Central Prison and 10 to the Palayamkottai prison every day, he said.

Efforts were being taken to extend remand for prisoners through video-conferencing to avoid outside contact. Prisoners had been asked to wash their hands properly before eating. Group activities like yoga and meditation had been suspended to avoid crowding in particular areas of the prisons, he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-threat-visitors-restricted-in-prisons-madurai/article31091755.ece

360,2020/03/17,"When will poll for Tirupuvanam Panchayat Union be held, asks HC","SEC asked to explain whether Collector had the power to cancel indirect election citing L&O problem

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday sought a response from the State Election Commission as to when the indirect election to the post of Chairman and Vice-Chairman to the Tirupuvanam panchayat union in Sivaganga district will be held.

The indirect election to the Tirupuvanam panchayat union was deferred by the Sivaganga Collector following a law and order problem. In his petition, S. Subbiah, a recently elected ward councillor sought a direction to the SEC to notify the election date to conduct the election to the panchayat union.

Apart from the date of the election, a Division Bench of Justices S.S. Sundar and T. Krishnavalli also sought a response from the SEC on whether the District Collector had the power to cancel the indirect election citing law and order problem and if an explanation from the Collector was sought.

The petitioner, S. Subbiah, complained that the election was being deferred to favour the ruling AIADMK party who were trying to win over candidates. When an earlier petition was filed alleging threat to the candidates, the High Court had passed a set of directions in this regard. The court had directed adequate police protection be given during the conduct of the indirect election to the panchayat union and further the entire election process was to be videographed. However, the election was deferred citing law and order problem.

The petitioner sought a direction to the SEC to notify the indirect election to the post of Chairman and Vice-Chairman to the Tirupuvanam panchayat union.

362,2020/03/17,Rajakoor flat residents against setting it up in their midst,"A group of people residing in flats constructed by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) at Rajakoor, petitioned the Collector here on Monday, requesting the district administration not to use one of the newly constructed blocks as a quarantine facility to monitor people coming from foreign countries as a measure to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

S. Pandiammal, a resident, said that on Sunday night officials from the Health Department and TNSCB inspected the newly-constructed block located on their campus.

“When we enquired, they said that the new block with 60 flats, will be used to isolate and monitor all people coming from foreign countries. When we heard about it, the residents immediately opposed this idea,” she said.

A Health Department official said that it was one of the locations short-listed for setting up the quarantine facility. However, talks were under progress and it had not been finalised yet, said the official.

On Monday, the situation at the Rajakoor flats remained tense as residents were apprehensive over the proposal. The residents even resorted to a road blockade at Rajakoor to voice their dissent.

“There are hundreds of residents, including children, living in this complex. The new blocks are present right next to our houses and hence we are worried about our safety,” said E. Pandiaraj, another resident.

Ms. Pandiammal questioned why the officials had short-listed this location despite knowing that there were hundreds of families residing nearby.

“They have short-listed this location only because we are poor and voiceless,” she said.

However, a senior health official said that there was no need for panic as those who show symptoms for COVID-19 would be immediately moved from a quarantine facility to Government Rajaji Hospital.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cmopmi/article31088090.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MACITY-RAJAKKOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/rajakoor-flat-residents-against-setting-it-up-in-their-midst/article31088092.ece

Speaking to mediapersons, the Collector said the State government had instructed that separate quarantine facilities should be set up to isolate and monitor people coming from notified countries.

“Currently people from these countries who are identified with symptoms for COVID -19 are monitored at their homes. Henceforth, all passengers from these countries, including those who do not show any symptoms of COVID-19, will also be monitored at the quarantine facility,” the Collector said.

A district-level epidemic control committee had been formed and all local bodies instructed about sanitation practices to be followed in view of COVID- 19 scare. All public spaces such as shopping complexes had been disinfected using sodium hypochlorite solution. Banners and posters had been erected to create an awareness of sanitation practices among the public, said the Collector.

As a preventive measure, schools had been shut for kindergarten and primary school students (Classes 1 to 5). No COVID-19 case had been reported positive in Madurai yet.

364,2020/03/17,Aluminium ash mound along the Vaigai causing pollution,"‘When it rains, stench from the mound becomes unbearable’

There is a huge mound of aluminium ash dumped along the southern bank of Vaigai river off Bethaniapuram in the city.

Residents complain that aluminium vessel manufacturing units have been dumping the ash along the Vaigai for the past 20 years. It has become a major cause for contamination of the river. This has also caused major breathing difficulties for residents living along the banks of the river, they say.

V. Pitchai, a long-time resident, says that over the years the number of functional aluminium vessel manufacturing units have shrunk and currently only two units are functioning. “After manufacturing aluminium vessels, these units dump the residue in the form of ash on the banks of the river. Though the quantity of aluminium ash dumped along the banks have reduced, the problem still persists,” he says.

Due to repeated dumping, the tonnes of aluminium ash currently looks like a solid grey hillock. The residents have made a small dent in the mound to allow the sewage from houses to drain into the river. When it rains, the stench from the aluminium mound becomes unbearable, says S. Kamatchi, another resident. “It is similar to the smell of burning firecrackers, but only worse,” she says.

Many residents of V.P. Sithan Street and NSK Street, who reside near the dump, have developed breathing difficulties, she says. “The children and the elderly are the worst affected. Every gust of heavy wind blows the ash onto the streets. Layers of dust are settled on walls and furniture at our homes,” she says. But the main problem is the pollution it causes to the river, says K. Muthu, another resident. “The mound has encroached upon the surface of the river. When there is water in the river, the ash dissolves and flows into the river, thus causing pollution,” he says.

Mr. Muthu also claims that the quality of groundwater has deteriorated because of the aluminium dump.

Mr. Pitchai says that aluminium ash is traded at smaller quantities for polishing vessels. It would be ideal if they clear these mounds of aluminium ash, he says.

A Corporation health official says he would inspect the spot and will order for eviction of the erring units.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/u5uwhh/article31088077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MACITY-ALUMINIUMASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aluminium-ash-mound-along-the-vaigai-causing-pollution/article31088078.ece
365,2020/03/17,HC-appointed guardian submits report,"Hearing the case of a boy from Tirunelveli who had come under the influence of a man with criminal antecedents, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday took cognisance of a report filed by the court-appointed guardian to the boy.

The boy who had lost his parents had come in contact with the man, who, along with his friends, managed to usurp the properties in his name, following which a habeas corpus petition was filed by a relative to secure the boy. The court-appointed guardian, Senior Counsel Veera Kathiravan, interacted with the boy currently under the care of Saranalayam in Tirunelveli, a home run for abandoned children. The court had ordered the custody of the boy to the Child Welfare Committee.

In his report, the Senior Counsel submitted that it was important to make the child understand the importance of education. Earlier, the boy had wanted to discontinue his studies. The boy must remain at the home and his maternal and paternal uncles be allowed to visit him so that he does not feel like an orphan. His condition must be reviewed by psychiatrist C. Ramasubramanian.

Following an earlier direction of the court, the men who tried to take advantage of the boy’s innocence and usurp his property were arrested and the property restored to the boy. The court had directed the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Palayamkottai, to keep the keys of the property.

Justice S.R. Bannurmath, former Chief Justice of Kerala and chairman of Karnataka Law Commission, said in Belagavi on Sunday that young lawyers should be driven by ethics and values, not just desire for success.

He called lawyers the flag-bearers of justice and agents of change for the better. “They should never forget their social responsibility while carrying out their profession,” he said. He was speaking at the valedictory function of the M.K. Nambyar national-level moot court competition held at KLS R.L. Law College.

He advised youngsters to use social media judiciously and not depend on online sources for enhancing their knowledge. “We should never lose the habit of reading books and interacting with others. This teaches us more than online search engines,” he said. Recalling that he was among the earliest participants in moot courts in India in the early 1960s, he asked students to aspire for international competitions.

Justice B.A. Patil of the Karnataka High Court asked students to treat victory and defeat equally and look at each event in their life as a lesson. “It is important to believe in yourself and work hard to unleash your true potential.”

Justice A.S. Paschapure, former judge in the Karnataka High Court, spoke of the virtues of simplicity. “Law is based on common sense and it should be interpreted in the simplest terms possible. The excellence of a lawyer lies in his ability to look for truth in the facts presented to him,” he said.

A special team constituted by Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa on Monday conducted raids on several medical shops here and initiated legal action for violation of the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules against two medical shops — Sunil Medical Stores, of Akkipete, and City Drug House, located near the City Bus Terminal. Sadashiv Marji, joint director of the Department of Food and Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs, assistant drug controller Mallikarjun, and Department of Legal Metrology assistant controller M.R.

Earlier, addressing presspersons, Ms. Deepa cautioned against creating shortage of masks and sanitisers and indulging in black marketeering in these products, taking advantage of the panic among members of the public. She said that special teams had been formed to monitor the situation and those indulging in black marketeering would lose their licence and also face stern legal action under the Epidemic Diseases Act. Similarly, spreading false information on COVID-19 on social media will invite the filing of criminal cases and award of imprisonment, she said.

Ms. Deepa also said special teams had been formed track foreign returns and they would be kept in isolation in their houses. If a large number of foreign returns arrive in the district, the administration, under the Epidemic Diseases Act, will take over resorts, forest training centre and police training centres, which are on the outskirts of the city, and transform them into quarantine centres, she added.

Train services on the Mangaluru-Mumbai line were disrupted between August 23 and 31 following landslips from hillocks adjacent to the track owing to torrential rains. Southern Railway’s Palakkad Division then faced the herculean task of clearing the muck and restoring the track.

All its attempts to remove the debris were going in vain every day as soil continued to come on to the railway track in slurry form, thereby delaying track clearance. As an alternative, the Railways laid a parallel track adjacent to the existing railway track for about 400 m and restored train services from September 1.

The SR restored the original track and operated services on it from November 1. Meanwhile, the Railways undertook permanent restoration and strengthening works on the affected areas. Permanent protection works included construction of Gabion walls along the affected stretch to prevent further landslips. It also included stabilisation of the slopes of the hillocks besides regularising the existing cuttings.

375,2020/03/17,Retired teacher booked under SC/ST Act,"The Belthangady police have booked a retired assistant teacher of a government school in Laila village of Belthangady taluk under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for allegedly leaving students belonging to Scheduled Caste communities out of a lunch offered by a private person.

In a complaint, Seena, a labourer, said his two children — one in Class 7 and another in Class 5 — were studying in the Government Higher Primary School at Padladi in Laila. On February 26, they were allegedly left at school while 52 students from Classes 5 to 7 were taken for a lunch offered by a person as part of his house warming ceremony.

On being informed by his children about this the next day, Seena brought it to the notice of the Belthangady Block Education Officer and sought disciplinary action against assistant teacher Uma Rao, who had held the charge of headmaster that day. Seena accused Ms. Rao of not only hurting the sentiments of his children, but also violating norms by sending children to a private function during school hours.

When the BEO failed to take any action, Mr. Seena filed a complaint with the police on March 12.

Ms. Rao retired from service on February 29.

The Belthangady police have registered a complaint against Ms. Rao under Section 3 (R) of the SC/ST Act. Valentine D’Souza, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Bantwal, is investigating the case. The police have taken the statements of the two children. As students belonging to ST communities were among the group of students who went out for lunch, legal opinion from the Department of Prosecution has been sought on the way to proceed under the SC/ST Act.

Deputy Director of Public Instruction Malleswamy said notice was issued to Ms. Rao and she claimed innocence. A departmental inquiry will be initiated following the police action, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/retired-teacher-booked-under-scst-act/article31086249.ece
376,2020/03/17,Railways confident of excavating Kulashekara tunnel in four months,"The construction wing of Southern Railway is executing the line doubling project between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur.

Notwithstanding the enormous delay in completing the Kulashekara tunnel work on the Mangaluru Junction-Jokatte section of the Mangaluru-Mumbai railway line, Southern Railway is confident of completing the entire doubling project of Mangaluru Junction-Panambur by March next.

The then Railway Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda had announced doubling of the railway line between Ullal and Surathkal in the 2014 Railway Budget, including the additional tunnel at Kulashekara. The tunnel passes beneath the Mangaluru-Moodbidri National Highway and has been a major link to New Mangalore Port as well as industrial clusters around Baikampady, besides accommodating the Mumbai line.

The construction wing of Southern Railway is executing the line doubling project between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur. Its chief engineer, P.T. Benny, said there was a delay earlier because of the slow execution of work by the contractor, who had deployed incompetent personnel. With a new contractor in place, the tunnel work is going on swiftly, Mr. Benny told The Hindu, adding that the tunnel excavation would itself be over in another four months.

SR’s Palakkad Division has already commissioned 17 km of double line out of 21 km between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur. The remaining 4 km includes the 600-metre tunnel work and its connecting links, and SR has announced that the entire double line will be commissioned by March 2021. The double line is expected to drastically reduce the time taken for operation of trains on the Mumbai-Mangaluru as well as Mumbai-Hassan/Bengaluru sectors.

Asked whether the conventional method of tunnel extraction could ensure its speedy completion, Mr. Benny replied in the affirmative and said the adopted method was best suited for the site. The region is full of rocks as well as underground streams, posing a challenge for construction.

Work on clearing debris and stabilising slopes too is going on simultaneously.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/uhnlr8/article31088887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGMANGRAIL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/railways-confident-of-excavating-kulashekara-tunnel-in-four-months/article31086232.ece
377,2020/03/17,Cement firms upbeat as A.P. to lift 12 million tonnes more a year,"State projects offer hope to makers hit by slowdown

Indian cement manufacturers are in an upbeat mood as the Andhra Pradesh Government has sought more than one million tonnes of cement per month for its projects for the next fiscal.

“The yearly consumption of cement by the Andhra Pradesh Government is about 18 million tonnes per year. If the State assures [it would] lift another 12 million tonnes a year, it would give a big boost to the cement industry, which had been affected due to sluggish demand,” said a top official of a cement company on the condition of anonymity.

Welcoming the initiative, the official said: “Almost all cement manufacturers have had a very bad third quarter due to the economic slowdown and stalling of major infrastructure projects by the Andhra Pradesh and Telangana governments. But, this is a good initiative as everyone will get a fair share,” he said.

At a joint review meeting held by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday at Vijayawada, he had asked the cement majors to supply cement in huge quantities for various government’s affordable housing projects.He also informed them that his State required over one million tonnes per month for various projects, including one for affordable housing and that the cement should be supplied at lower prices.

The meeting was attended by representatives of India Cements, Ramco Cements, KCP, Ultratech and JSW, among others.

They agreed to supply cement ‘at lower prices’.

“We also took part in the meeting. We are committed to supply about 40,000-50,000 tonnes per month and this would provide us some relief,” said another manufacturer.

According to them, the housing department required 40 lakh tonnes, Panchayat Raj Department 25 lakh tonnes, Water Resources Department 16.57 lakh tonnes and Municipal Department 14.93 lakh tonnes.

While releasing the company’s third quarter results, India Cements vice-chairman and managing director N. Srinivasan had said that all infrastructure projects ought to be implemented in order to bail out the industry from the turmoil it has been undergoing.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/geqeej/article31092996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUCEMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cement-firms-upbeat-as-ap-to-lift-12-million-tonnes-more-a-year/article31092997.ece
378,2020/03/17,COVID-19 will impact GDP growth by 90 bps: SBI report,"A blend of monetary and fiscal policy could be the best option

The spread of COVID-19, the deadly pandemic, which has impacted several sectors especially transport, tourism and hotel industries, could impact the economic growth of the country by 90 basis points, a report by State Bank of India said.

“On the demand side, inoperability analysis for three sectors, namely transport, tourism and hotels, shows significant impact on demand and hence output. On an aggregate basis, we estimate that the impact of a 5% inoperability shock could be 90 basis points on GDP from trade, hotel and transport, storage and communication segments, that could be spread over FY20 and FY21, with a larger impact in FY21,” the report authored by Soumya Kanti Ghosh, Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI, said. The report noted that while India had till date responded quite well to the COVID-19 crisis, the financial markets had been significantly impacted.

Since China is an important source of critical inputs for many sectors, the supply shock can lead to to higher price of inputs, which, in turn, could affect the price of all the commodities up the supply chain, it said.

The report also pointed out that a simultaneous demand and supply shock to the economy will also have implications for the banking sector. The demand side shock is expected to lead to an output loss of 1.2% in banking and insurance combined.

“We believe that in the current COVID-19 outbreak, a combination of monetary and fiscal policy could be the best option,” it said.

The report proposed additional revenue due to increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel, which is in the range of ₹35,000 crore to ₹40,000 crore, could be spent on providing relief to people of the lower strata, who will lose income because of shutdown of commercial activity in the States.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jv09r8/article31083609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDCOIMBATORE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/covid-19-will-impact-gdp-growth-by-90-bps-sbi-report/article31092975.ece

The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations on Tuesday said it has approached the Supreme Court to seek an extension of the March 31, 2020, deadline for the sale and registration of BS IV-complaint vehicle by two months, citing a ‘drastic’ drop in customer footfalls and retail sales due to COVID-19 scare.

FADA, on behalf of its members, has “filed an interlocutory application along with an application seeking modification in writ petition...whereby it has been directed that ‘...no motor vehicle conforming to emission standard Bharat Stage-IV shall be sold or registered in the entire country with effect from 01.04.2020.”

FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said, “Post our initial application, necessitated due to huge unsold BS IV inventory and slowing sales, getting rejected by the Apex Court on February 14, there has been a drastic change in circumstances in conducting business as usual.”

He added due to COVID-19 pandemic, in the past week, there has been a drastic drop in sales and customer walk-ins have “reduced to a trickle...counter sales has fallen by 60-70% across auto dealerships in these past few days.”

Mr. Kale said the situation has worsened in the past couple of days with partial lock down in many cities.

“Owning to situations which are beyond our control and the fact that many of our members may face dealership closures if left over with unsold BS IV stocks, FADA has once again approached the apex court with a request for permission of sale and registration of BS IV vehicles till May 31, 2020, and hopes to get an urgent hearing in the Supreme Court...,” he added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/fada-seeks-sc-nod-for-bs-iv-sales-till-may-31/article31092947.ece

381,2020/03/17,IATA: Airlines need $250-bn bailout,"Fall in crude prices not enough for airlines to tide over crisis

Global air travel demand is down by 94%, exposing airlines to a liquidity crisis as their revenues take a hit, while fixed costs and short term liabilities remain, IATA said on Tuesday, pegging the bailout package for carriers worldwide at approximately $200-250 billion.

“Border closure and travel restrictions have resulted in passenger demand falling to zero for many airlines. We had earlier estimated losses for airlines globally to be at $113 billion and we are already beyond that,” said Brian Pearce, Chief Economist at IATA — a trade association of the world’s airlines.

He was speaking at a global video conference with the press.

Mr. Pearce explained that fixed obligations (such as debt servicing) as well as short-term liabilities for airlines are driving the current liquidity crisis for the sector, in the absence of revenue.

At the start of the year, 75% of the world’s airlines had cash enough only for three months, “which is pretty much running out today,” he said. Alexander de Juniac, Director General and CEO, IATA, appealed to governments of the world to help airlines and lower airport charges, overflight fee, passenger taxes as well as security fees to “relieve airline costs”.

He estimated that a bailout package for airlines globally would cost $200-250 billion.

Oil slump inadequate

Even though crude oil has fallen significantly, resulting in savings of $28-30 billion in fuel, revenue losses are much higher.

“Time is of essence,” said Mr Juniac, adding that such a help extended to airlines will enable faster recovery after COVID-19 spread abates.

However, China has already showed signs of recovery and its airlines have reported 60% of passenger load factor or seat occupancy and flight schedules are on the rise.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/myj8r/article31092905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUIATA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/iata-airlines-need-250-bn-bailout/article31092906.ece
382,2020/03/17,ONGC declares 100% dividend,"Oil demand set to fall on COVID-19, it says

Amid falling crude prices, State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) has declared a 100% interim dividend.

The company also said it had sufficient funds to continue operations.

“The ONGC board approved the payment of an interim dividend of ₹5 per share (i.e. 100% of face value of ₹5 per share) to the shareholders,” said the ONGC in a statement.

The board had emphasised on the need to take a closer look at the emerging scenario and advised the company to adopt a balanced approach towards capital spending, according to the statement.

During the last few days, due to a sudden and sharp decline in crude oil prices, the share prices of oil sector entities have witnessed a lot of volatility, particularly, the share prices of upstream companies have been hit hard.

In addition, due to failure of talks of OPEC+ to arrive at an agreement on production cut, oil prices had declined drastically.

Key oil producers have since adopted a strategy of “fight to finish” and have, besides announcing an increase in production, have also offered huge discounts to Asian markets, making capturing of markets as key priority at this juncture.

All these major developments bring in some uncertainty for oil and gas sector and specifically, for oil and gas producing companies.

Outbreak of COVID-19Corona virus and its declaration as a pandemic by the U.N. has exacerbated the demand side and it is apprehended that, for the first time over the last two decades, oil demand may, in fact, go down in absolute terms.

It is very difficult to separately identify the extent to which the oil price decline is attributable to either of these factors, ONGC said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ongc-declares-100-dividend/article31092895.ece

384,2020/03/17,COVID-19 impacts demand for sugar,"Prices also affected, says ISMA

Sugar mills have been witnessing lower offtake for the last two weeks because of the impact of COVID-19, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).

“It is understood that sugar in the pipeline would have got sold in the wholesale and retail markets in the last couple of weeks,” the association said in a press release on Tuesday. It is expected that fresh buying from the sugar mills will take off soon and that should control sugar prices.

Sources in the association said that this was based on the market information and that actual offtake data was not readily available. The annual domestic consumption of sugar this season is expected to be 26.5 million tonnes. Though there is an impact now because of COVID-19, in the long run, consumption is expected to be at the expected level.

Further, the sugar mills have despatched nearly 30 lakh tonnes of sugar from their factories so far this season, which started in October 2019, for export against the MAEQ (Maximum Admissible Export Quantity) of 60 lakh tonnes.

“The current unprecedented situation due to outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted the global sugar prices also. However, the impact could be temporary,” the association said.

Till March 15 this sugar season, the sugar mills produced 215.82 lakh tonnes of sugar as against 273.65 lakh tonnes in the corresponding season last year.

In the case of exports, India exports mainly to West Asian countries, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and African nations. The export demand is also expected to revive as there is a fall in sugar production in Thailand, the sources added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/k7bslh/article30854032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THBUSUGARR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/covid-19-impacts-demand-for-sugar/article31092831.ece

In wake of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. auto major Ford has asked 10,000 employees in India, except those in business-critical roles, to work from home, a step which has also been taken up by Swedish luxury car maker Volvo.

A Ford India spokesperson said, in recent days, the company has concluded that the issue of coronavirus has taken on a different dimension.

The company is continuing to act in real-time to keep its “people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in communities where we live and work.”

“Therefore, starting Monday March 16, we have instructed much of our India workforce (over 10,000 people) including Ford India and Global Business Services — except those in business-critical roles that cannot be done away from Ford facilities — to work remotely until further notice,” the spokesperson said.

He further said, “The action will additionally help reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus while maximising the health of our business. All necessary safety measures have been deployed at Ford locations as well as our dealerships to ensure minimum inconvenience to customers.”

In a similar development, Volvo Car India, the wholly-owned arm of Swedish luxury car company Volvo, also announced work from home as a safety measure for its employees due to the rising number of coronavirus infections in India.

The company which has around 40 employees on its rolls in India said all of them have been asked to work from home with immediate effect while necessary IT infrastructure has been put in place to facilitate business continuity.

It, however, said access to the office remains open for any employee who prefers to work from office, after informing respective manager.

Enhanced sanitation measures have been taken to ensure hygiene at office premises.

The company had also suspended all domestic and international travel since February, to limit the exposure of our employees to the virus, it added.

Volvo Car India further said it is also working closely with dealers to ensure their facilities are hygienic.

“Guidelines to dealers include ensuring cars that visit workshops as well as dealer demo cars are properly cleaned before next use. In addition, all demo cars to mandatorily have hand sanitiser,” it said.

389,2020/03/17,A prediction model for COVID-19,"The SEIR model was helpful in making estimations in the case of Ebola and SARS

While it is impossible to estimate the eventual number of cases for the novel coronavirus, there was an exercise carried out earlier this year, aimed at projecting the numbers for Wuhan in China. In a recent article on Cell Discovery in Nature, a group of Chinese scientists attempted to estimate the eventual number of infections and deaths due to the disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan. An infectious disease dynamics model called SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Resistant) was used to model and predict the number of COVID-19 cases. The SEIR model proved to be predictive for a variety of acute infectious diseases like Ebola and SARS.

The model classifies the population into four mutually exclusive groups: susceptible (at risk of contracting the disease), exposed (infected but not yet infectious), infectious (capable of transmitting the disease), and removed (those who recover or die from the disease). A susceptible individual can become exposed only through contact with some infectious person. Susceptible individuals first enter the exposed stage, during which they may have a low level of infectivity; they become infectious thereafter. The infection rate represents the probability of transmission from an infectious person to a susceptible one. The incubation rate (the reciprocal of the average duration of incubation) is the rate at which latent individuals become infectious; and the removal rate is the reciprocal of the average duration of infection. The basic reproduction number (BRN) is the expected number of cases directly generated by one case. A BRN greater than one indicates that the outbreak is self-sustaining, while a BRN less than one indicates that the number of new cases decreases over time and eventually the outbreak will stop. Ideally, the BRN should be reduced in order to slow down an epidemic.

The numbers for Wuhan

Using Wuhan’s data, more than a dozen published studies provide the estimates of parameters. The mean incubation period is around 5.2 days in most of the studies. Also, the average hospitalisation period is calculated to be 12.39 ± 4.77 days.

The prediction for Wuhan was done in four phases: a) December 1-January 23; b) January 24-February 2; c) February 3-15; d) thereafter. On January 23, airplanes, trains, and other public transportation within the city were restricted and other prevention and control measures such as quarantine and isolation were gradually established in Wuhan. Phase II continued up to the extended spring festival holiday. More medical resources were provided from February 3. It is assumed that the prevention and control measures were sufficient and effective from February 16.

The decreasing BRN rates

In Wuhan, home to 11 million people, the initial number of cases was 40, estimated by a group of researchers led by Natsuko Imai of Imperial College. The number of exposed was assumed to be 20 times this number. The BRN in the first three phases was estimated to be 3.1, 2.6, and 1.9, respectively. In the Cell Discovery article, the BRN is assumed to have decreased to 0.9 or 0.5 in phase IV, based on previous experience in SARS. According to an article in Science in 2003, the BRN of SARS decreased from 2.7 to 0.25 after the patients were isolated and the infection started being controlled.

Following the model, the number of cases in Wuhan reached 17,656-25,875 in phase I, to 32,061-46,905 in phase II, and to 53,070-77,390 in phase III. The epidemic peaked on February 23rd or February 19th with 58,077-84,520 or 55,869-81,393 infections, according to the BRN value of 0.9 and 0.5, respectively. In reality, the number of daily cases in Wuhan has been reducing remarkably since February 16.

The BRN value for India is unknown due to inadequate data so far. However, it can be kept small by isolating patients and controlling infection by extensive checking at airports and other important places. With 110 ‘active’ cases as on March 16, a BRN value of 0.5 might not be alarming. Let’s hope that it will remain so.

390,2020/03/17,Miseries and masterstrokes,"Bihar has slipped further on human development as Nitish Kumar is busy pursuing opportunistic policies

There is resentment in Bihar about the Nitish Kumar government’s performance over the last few years. The people expected Mr. Kumar to do more on development; instead, they were offered political masterstrokes. Mr. Kumar sent mixed signals on the citizenship question: after his government’s leniency on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the Bihar Assembly passed a resolution against a National Register of Citizens, and his party voted to formulate a National Population Register in its 2010 format. In his attempts to placate the BJP’s central leaders, Mr. Kumar has disavowed the ideological purity he once boasted about. Unmindful of the State’s abysmal performance on the human development front, the Bihar Economic Survey 2019-2020 made some tall claims. The survey claimed the State has seen consistent development over the last decade. Clearly, the benchmarking was old and wrong parameters such as petrol consumption and growth in civil aviation were used.

Crime, illiteracy and maladies

As Mr. Kumar seeks a mandate for another term, it is imperative that his government looks at some real problems. First, the government needs to handle the grim reality of a growing crime rate. While Mr. Kumar successfully brought Bihar out of ‘jungle raj’ (lawlessness) in his previous terms, fears of a return to a jungle raj have resurfaced. According to news reports, a murder is taking place every third day in Patna, the State capital. The reported incidents of crimes against women, abductions and extortion portray the picture of a dismal state of the law and order situation.

Second, the State has not made much improvement in the social, economic and developmental parameters. According to the latest Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) India Index, Bihar was the ‘worst performer’ in 2019. Education and health, the two major criteria for mapping social progress, have a major impact on the economic performance of a State. With low allocation and lack of political will, the state of education in Bihar continues to be inadequate. While 70.43% of schools in India have a pupil-teacher ratio of less than or equal to 30:1, only 21.75% schools in Bihar meet the ratio. An obstinate disregard shown by the government to contractual teachers amplifies the problem further. Bihar has not only the highest percentage of dropouts at the secondary level, but also the lowest enrolment ratio in higher education at 13.6%. Similarly, it is ranked at the bottom in terms of gender parity in higher education. As a result, the State’s Female Labour Force Participation Rate is a dismal 2.8%, as against 17.5% in the country.

Coming to health, Public Health Centres (PHCs) are not properly functional in many areas of Bihar. District hospitals and medical colleges have not improved from the time when the system was near collapse. The percentage of children under five years of age who are stunted is at 42%. This shows that the government has failed miserably to ensure that children get proper nutrition. In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court last year, the government presented the shortage in figures: the State’s government-run hospitals and health centres are short of doctors by 47%; nurses by 70%; lab technicians by 72%; and pharmacists by 58%. However, the health sector has also witnessed prevalence of vested interests and flow of black money on an unprecedented scale. Doctors on the State government’s payroll, even in cities, flout rules and run their own clinics.

Brain drain

Third, when it comes to migration, according to a recent study conducted by Indian Institute of Population Sciences, more than half of the households in Bihar have been exposed to migration to more developed places. Not surprisingly, this makes a majority of households depend on remittances. However, the apathetic leadership is not bothered about improving connectivity, livelihood options, and market linkages.

Hence, the leadership in Bihar should reflect on opportunities foregone. Mr. Kumar has to attend to queries about his inability to spend the Centre’s funds. He is also answerable for inaction when it comes to getting a special package for the State.

But Mr. Kumar is also aware that the BJP unit in the State is deeply divided and cannot win an election on its own. His own Janata Dal (United), with no internal competition, is being run as a sole proprietorship firm. These factors perhaps boost his chances of retaining the chief ministership. This notwithstanding, ‘Battleground Bihar 2020’ will open a new chapter, with less room for personality-driven politics. This, perhaps, will give the State some much-needed breather.

391,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | A problematic testing strategy,"Kerala’s rationale for revising its COVID-19 testing guidelines could prove counterproductive

Even as the World Health Organization has been urging countries that have reported many laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases to become more aggressive in testing, India continues to have among the lowest testing rates in the world. In India, only those people with a travel history to high-risk COVID-19 affected countries or with close contacts to laboratory confirmed COVID-19 cases and with symptoms of the disease are being tested.

Also read: Coronavirus | Experts say India still in second transmission stage

Criteria for testing

If this does not instil confidence, Kerala, seen as a role model in India in containing highly pathogenic outbreaks, has further narrowed down the criteria for testing. On March 12, the Kerala Health Ministry issued revised testing guidelines based on current risk assessment. According to the guidelines, people with mild symptoms (low grade fever, mild sore throat, cough, rhinitis or diarrhoea) who have come from countries with ongoing COVID-19 local transmission and contacts of confirmed/suspect cases will not be tested for the virus.

“Testing is not going to change either the clinical course or management of the patient with mild symptoms,” the guidelines say. The rationale that testing people with mild symptoms that are non-specific would delay the testing of more deserving cases is problematic and may prove counterproductive.

According to Dr. Nivedita Gupta of the Indian Council of Medical Research, the maximum number of samples that the National Institute of Virology (NIV) unit in Alappuzha received in a single day was around 100. It is as low as 10 on some days. In a day or two, two more labs in the State will begin confirming cases without sending samples to the NIV unit in Alappuzha. One more lab is set to start screening samples early this week. Given that Kerala now has the capacity to test more samples each day, it is unclear why it has issued these revised guidelines. If this is an attempt to keep the numbers artificially low, it will prove counterproductive.

Also read: Explained | When can people transmit the novel coronavirus?

If the number of samples of people with mild symptoms to be tested each day is indeed delaying testing those with more severe symptoms at this early stage of the pandemic, it is worrying to imagine what the situation would look like if and when community spread becomes widespread in Kerala.

Since about 80% of those with COVID-19 exhibit only mild symptoms and recover without special treatment, not testing them would mean that a vast majority of cases will go undetected. This is wrong from the epidemiological point of view as the true case load will not be recorded. In fact, with the rest of the country looking up to Kerala in containing the spread of the virus, the State was expected to adopt a more expansive testing strategy — i.e., testing all contacts soon after being traced immaterial of clinical manifestation.

Fear of spread

As people with mild symptoms will not be tested now, the real danger of allowing them to spread the virus cannot be dismissed. A few studies as well as the experience of many countries show that infected people start spreading the virus even before symptoms show up. The infectiousness only increases when people start exhibiting symptoms. Though the guidelines say that contacts and people with travel histories should be under “strict home isolation”, the false sense of security when not tested might increase the likelihood of such people not following home isolation strictly. In fact, stricter quarantining would be needed for symptomatic people.

Also read: Coronavirus | India shares two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

When the State displays great rigour in tracing contacts and insists on home isolation for 14 days, not testing them when they show symptoms goes against the grain of the contact tracing strategy. There will be great danger of contact tracing backfiring when people who willingly self-isolate are not tested when symptoms show up. This is unethical too. Kerala cannot claim that there are no new cases and the pandemic is under control in the State when it does not test people in quarantine exhibiting mild symptoms.

392,2020/03/17,Closing the gender gap in science,"With few women in the field, the quality of science and advancement of society are both affected

India celebrates National Science Day on February 28 every year to mark C.V. Raman’s discovery of the scattering of light. For the last 33 years, on this day, research institutes and other academic centres in the country have been holding public outreach programmes or conducting meetings on select topics. This year, the theme was Women in Science. This is a timely and relevant theme, but it is also rather ironic given that Raman himself did not warm up to the idea of women in science. For some time, this prejudice meant that women candidates were refused admission to the Indian Institute of Science in the 1930s, during Raman’s tenure as director.

Lost opportunities

Despite his progressive political and philosophical convictions, Raman was a traditionalist. Like many others of the time, he imbibed the sexist views that were part of society then. Among his three women students, only Anna Mani was able to choose a scientific career, although she could not get a doctoral degree. Sunanda Bai was not awarded a PhD, and committed suicide for unknown reasons. Lalitha Doraiswamy left her studies and chose to marry Subramanyan Chandrasekhar, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983. Why did these talented women fail to get their due? It would be interesting to contrast their journeys with the story of Janaki Ammal. Ammal opted to pursue a Masters degree from the Michigan State University in the U.S. and continued her scientific career even after her return to India. The success of Janaki Ammal, who chose to leave India, versus the stories of the other women tells us about lost opportunities. The cultural and gender norms that engendered discrimination even during a renaissance of sorts in India was a major reason why the country lost out on an important opportunity to build a culture of including women in science during the pre-Independence days.

These stories of gender discrimination help in our understanding of the current discourse on the social and organisational conditions that regulate women’s participation in science education and research. How do male colleagues behave today towards women working in labs today? Have gender attitudes changed? It is true that a resurgent inclusive nationalism propounded by Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru and others during the struggle for Independence encouraged women, at least those who were part of the upper social strata, to break the familial and cultural shackles and enter the public space. But did this social transformation, however incomplete it may have been, help in narrowing the wide gender gap in professional careers? While cultural and social causes are considered the primary reasons for gender discrimination, at least in India, organisational factors have also played a big role in preventing gender parity in science. This can be changed if more women are given leadership positions. Lack of women leaders and women role models may be preventing more women from entering the field.

Compared to the pre-Independence days, one encouraging fact is that there is an exponential growth in the participation of women in the undergraduate and graduate levels. In the U.K., women account for 40% of undergraduate students who pursue degrees in the physical sciences and mathematical sciences and 14% in engineering and technology. In India, the corresponding figures are about 40% and 18%, respectively. More than 40% of PhD-holders in India are women. These figures, according to various estimates published in Current Science, show that social shackles are loosening.

The ‘leaky pipeline’ problem

However, the trouble starts after women obtain their educational qualifications. The percentage of women in faculty positions drops to less than 20%; only a few reach the top positions of institutes and universities. This is also the time when many of them become mothers, sometimes because of familial pressure.

The Indian Science Academies are aware of the problem. But the reform should start from their own backyard. In all the three science academies combined, only about 10% are women Fellows.

Including more women in science is not only important from the human rights perspective; it also impacts the quality of science and the advancement of society itself. This is not to say that the situation is hopeless. There have been changes that give us hope too. For example, India is seeing more women in engineering today than ever before. This is heartwarming as engineering was once seen as a ‘men only’ domain. The role of women engineers in the launch of the Indian Space Research Organisation’s second moon mission, Chandrayaan-2, is now legendary.

At the same time some recent reports should worry us. According to the Global Gender Gap Index 2020,a study covering 153 economies, India has slipped to the 112th spot from its 108th position in 2018. The report also says it would take nearly a hundred years to close the gender gap in various fields in India compared to the time it would take in other countries. This prediction should be proved wrong. For this, the Indian scientific community should act as a pressure group to build greater focus on the issue and push for concrete measures to address the problem. As a simple first step, India should relax certain norms for women. The expansion of maternity leave to 26 weeks from the previous 12 weeks shows that the present government is seized of the matter, but how this will affect the hiring of women workers is yet to be seen.

The history of science shows that many revolutionary discoveries were made by women scientists. The most famously known woman scientist is Marie Curie. But contemporary times are full of examples: Rosalind Franklin, Barbara McClintock, and Jennifer Doudna, to name a few. There are many in India too, whose contributions we must highlight in textbooks.

Women across the world face the ‘leaky pipeline’ problem. Without supportive institutional structures in place, women, when they are pregnant, worry about gaps in publications, how they will do fieldwork, whether they will get promotions. Productivity concerns are high for women, especially in academia where the number of papers you publish is a marker of productivity. In India, we have many examples of women researchers who are involved in exciting scientific experiments. It is imperative that we understand and remove the sexism and institutional obstacles that prevent more women from entering the scientific field.

393,2020/03/17,A crisis-hit Iran at the crossroads,"The coronavirus pandemic creates fresh possibilities for cooperation between the West Asian nation and its neighbours

Iran, the hardest-hit among the West Asian countries in the global pandemic, is on the front line of the battle against the coronavirus that causes the causes coronavirus disease, COVID-19. With nearly 900 deaths and over 14,000 cases of infection, its health-care system is reeling under the combined effect of the pandemic and American sanctions.

The new challenge for Iran comes about two months after the killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander General Qassem Soleimani, in January. In end-January, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had condemned U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan for Palestine and had vowed to support armed Palestinian groups.

Also read: Analysis | The importance of Qasem Soleimani

Mr. Khamenei had said in November 2019 that Iran’s main strategy was to inure itself from the effect of sanctions and to emerge resilient. The masses thronging the streets some weeks ago may have receded out of fear of both the coronavirus and the wrath of the regime, but there is a possibility of social unrest resurfacing if the government’s response to the spread of the virus is ineffective and shortages are exacerbated. Iran has already approached the International Monetary Fund for $5-billion in emergency funding to combat the pandemic.

The U.S. Treasury had announced in end-February that it was lifting some sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran to facilitate humanitarian trade such as the import of testing kits for COVID-19. Clearly, Iran thinks this is inadequate.

Nuclear policy

May 8, 2020 will mark the second anniversary of the U.S.’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or the “Iran Nuclear Deal”. Following the U.S.’s decision to jettison the deal, Iran had announced that it would resume its nuclear activities but had agreed to respect the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and enhanced monitoring as part of its obligations under the additional protocol.

The JCPOA limited Iran to enrich uranium only up to a 3.67% concentration and its stockpile to 300 kg of UF6 (corresponding to 202.8 kg of U-235), and further capped its centrifuges to no more than 5,060, besides a complete cessation of enrichment at the underground Fordow facility. It also limited Iran’s heavy water stockpile to 130 tonnes. However, since July 2019, Iran has lifted all restrictions on its stockpiles of enriched uranium and heavy water. It has been enriching uranium to 4.5%, beyond the limit of 3.67%. Moreover, it has removed all caps on centrifuges and recommenced enrichment at the Fordow facility. As of February 19, Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile totalled 1,020.9 kg, compared to 372.3 kg noted in the IAEA’s report of November 3. In a second report issued on March 3, the IAEA has identified three sites in Iran where the country possibly stored undeclared nuclear material or was conducting nuclear-related activities. The IAEA has sought access to the suspect sites and has also sent questionnaires to Iran but has received no response.

The United Kingdom, France and Germany had invoked the JCPOA Dispute Resolution Mechanism (DRM) as early as in January this year. With the next Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) set to take place in New York from April 27 to May 22, 2020, Iran’s threat to abandon the NPT if the European Union takes the matter to the UN Security Council (UNSC) may yet only be bluster, but the failure of the DRM process would certainly put Iran on a collision course with the UNSC. A sympathetic China, which holds the rotational presidency of the UNSC for March, should diminish that prospect, albeit only temporarily. As things stand, the terms of UNSC Resolution 2231, which had removed UN sanctions against Iran in the wake of the JCPOA, are reversible and the sanctions can be easily restored. That eventuality would prove disastrous, compounding Iran’s current woes.

While recognising that cocking a snook at the NPT in the run-up to the NPT RevCon and the U.S. presidential elections will invite retribution, Iran may use the global preoccupation with the pandemic to seek a whittling down of sanctions and to continue its nuclear programme. In the event that the NPT RevCon is postponed due to the prevailing uncertainty, Iran may yet secure some more breathing time.

Ties with China

Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to implement its “maximum pressure policy”. China remains the only major country that continues to defy U.S. sanctions and buy oil from Iran, apart from a small quantum that goes to Syria.

The sale of oil to China, however, does little to replenish Iran’s coffers. China is eschewing payments in order to avoid triggering more sanctions against Chinese entities. According to reports, Iran uses the credit to service its debt to China Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) for the development of Iran’s super-giant Azadegan and Yadavaran oil fields.

When seen in the context of the trilateral naval exercise between China, Iran and Russia in the Strait of Hormuz in the end of December 2019 codenamed “Marine Security Belt”, these developments suggest a further consolidation of Sino-Iran ties in a region of great importance to India. Over time, this could expand into a “Quad” involving China’s “all-weather friend” Pakistan in the Indian Ocean and the northern Arabian Sea, with broader implications for India as well as the “Free and Open” Indo-Pacific.

The first round of Iran’s parliamentary elections in February showed that the hardliners are firmly ensconced. The fundamental underpinnings of Iran’s foreign policy are likely to remain unchanged. Yet, the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the region creates fresh possibilities for cooperation between Iran and its neighbours, if regional tensions are relegated to the back-burner. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative to develop a coordinated response to the pandemic in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation framework, indeed, sets a laudable example. Much though will depend on Iran’s willingness to rein in its regional ambitions and desist from interference in the domestic affairs of others.

394,2020/03/17,Fight for the finite: On budgetary allocation for health,"Health budgetary allocation must go up if India is to prepare for an unpredictable epidemic

It is an incontrovertible truth that material resources are finite. Demand in most sectors will continue to exceed supply in times of a pandemic. With the number of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases on the rise, and the number of deaths going up as well, the question is whether national and state health systems will be able to cope with ever-rising demands — for testing kits, for hospital beds, ventilators, why, even masks and hand sanitisers. This extraordinary demand has traditional production and systems of delivery choking and most often, unable to match supply to demand. Health-care resources, limited to begin with, are even more so when under stress. At a time when the disease did not have a name, and much less by way of character, in mainland China, the rapidly climbing numbers went far beyond the capacity of the country’s renowned industry (where a hospital was built in record time), and the health systems struggled to cope. Reports indicate that in Italy, which has emerged the hub of the epidemic outside of China, the strain on health systems is massive. With India crossing 100 positive cases, it is impossible to ignore the question about whether the health system is robust enough to meet this emergency. What is known, however, does not inspire confidence.

Also read: Coronavirus | No move yet to impose Sec. 144 in Pune

For years, India’s health expenditure as a percentage of GDP has been abysmal at about 1%. As per the National Health Profile, 2019, collated by the Central Bureau of Health Intelligence unit of the Directorate General of Health Services, there has been no significant change in health-care expenditure since 2009-2010. The highest it has been in the decade is 1.28 % of the GDP, and hit the nadir at 0.98 % in 2014-2015. The report does record that per capita public expenditure on health in nominal terms went up from ₹621 in 2009-10 to ₹1,112 in 2015-16. A WHO bulletin of 2018 records that out-of-pocket payments remain common in India, which in 2014, was estimated at 62% of total health expenditure. While questioning whether these incremental efforts are sufficient, one needs to factor in the substantial skew in different States in terms of public sector health infrastructure and wherewithal. There is evidence to show that increased public spending on health care has resulted in less financial hardship for communities and better health outcomes. Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a promise to increase public health spending to 2.5 % of GDP by 2025. His government would do well to treat this epidemic as an opportunity to drastically scale up budgetary allocations for health to facilitate expansion of capacity. Epidemics are known to change the course of history; India must steer this one to harness finite resources optimally for the benefit of all.

395,2020/03/17,Back to SAARC: On Modi's video conference with leaders,"PM Modi did well to engage with leaders of South Asia on combating COVID-19

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to convene a video conference of leaders of the eight-member SAARC on Sunday represents a much-needed “out-of-the-box” thinking as the world faces the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Pandemics do not recognise political borders, and in times of trouble, reaching out to neighbouring countries is the most obvious course of action. To that end, the hour-long discussion with the leaders of Afghanistan, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Bhutan Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Special Assistant on Health to the Pakistan PM, came up with shared and unique perspectives in dealing with the virus that has affected 1,75,250 people and claimed over 6,700 lives worldwide. The meeting saw Mr. Modi’s proposal for a COVID-19 emergency fund — India will contribute $10-million — as well as a decision on technical task forces. Afghanistan and Pakistan have specific challenges as they share long borders with Iran, which has emerged, after China and Italy, as a major hub of the virus. Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka worry about the impact on tourism, which is a mainstay of their economies. Another concern is of an escalation in the virus’s spread in the subcontinent. With close to 300 positive cases, South Asia has seen a much lower incidence globally, but given its much higher population density, it is clear that any outbreak will lead to far more casualties. Other concerns are about under-reporting, as fewer people are being tested in much of South Asia, and whether public health services can cope. It remains to be seen how closely the SAARC countries will cooperate to deal with the virus.

While speaking to his counterparts was a part of Mr. Modi’s message, it was, however, certainly not the whole. The fact that he decided to make the video conference available live indicates his desire to also reach out to and reassure the public in the SAARC region. Beyond this is the message sent out by deciding to engage with the more or less moribund SAARC neighbourhood grouping, rather than other organisations the government has preferred to engage with recently such as BIMSTEC, BBIN and IORA. In fact the virtual summit is the first high-level SAARC meet since 2014, and comes after India’s pulling out of the 2016 summit following the Uri attack; it was to have been hosted in Islamabad. Pakistan too has made its concerns over Jammu and Kashmir a sticking point in re-engagement, and PM Imran Khan’s absence on Sunday, and his nominee’s attempt to raise the issue of restrictions in Kashmir indicate that this attitude persists. Clearly, reviving the SAARC initiative, which countries in the region including Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan have advised, will not be easy, given poor ties between SAARC’s two largest members, India and Pakistan. But it is significant that New Delhi seems to be willing to try to put politics aside when dealing with the pandemic that confronts all.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/back-to-saarc-on-modis-video-conference-with-leaders/article31085131.ece

Students who are part of exchange programmes or have got admission to universities in other countries are choosing defer enrolment by a semester in the wake of COVID-19 spreading across the world. Several Indian students pursuing their education abroad have chosen to return to India as their universities are conducting online classes and postponed examinations.

An economics student who studies in Hong Kong said she came back to India towards the end of last month. “Although our university was very vigilant, I wanted to be there with my family. We have online classes and examinations, so our academic work is not affected,” she said. Although she was concerned about transmission of the virus at the airport, she said she took the necessary precautions such as wearing the mask.

Another student, who too studies in London, decided to come back to Bengaluru. “During such times, it is always best to be with the family,” said the students.

An undergraduate student who was looking forward to studying in Singapore in March has decided to defer his enrolment date. “I thought I would stay back with my family and do an internship in India, but the situation seems to be getting worse here as well,” he said.

However, some Indian students in Europe have decided to stay back and hope for the best. Mitsi Verghese, whose younger daughter is pursuing an undergraduate programme from Erasmus University, Netherlands, said that everyone there is largely confined to their homes and are not allowed to travel anywhere until April 15.

Another parent whose child is pursuing his M.Tech. from Delft University of Technology in Netherlands stated that the university was taking good care of their students and were conducting online classes. “I was planning to meet my son there, but have decided to cancel the trip,” she said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/many-indian-students-abroad-returning-home/article31092928.ece

Residents of Mahadevapura, Panathur, Varthur, Bellandur and surrounding areas can heave a sigh of relief as the Bengaluru East Private Water Suppliers’ Association has temporarily called off the strike. People living in these areas are largely dependent on water tankers.

This decision was taken after a discussions between representatives of the water suppliers' association and officials of the BBMP, BWSSB and traffic police.

Several areas in Mahadevapura did not have adequate water as the tanker water suppliers had launched a strike following an order by the Hosakote tahsildar that prohibited them from drawing water from borewells in three villages -- Koturu, Harohalli and Muthsandra.

The association had sought a relaxation of the prohibition order. R.V.N. Babu, association president, said: “We have withdrawn the strike temporarily. BBMP and BWSSB officials have assured us that they will look into our demands. If an amicable solution is not found in three days, we will be forced to go on an indefinite strike.”

According to Varthur Rising, a citizens’ group that attended the meeting, the BWSSB said it was ready to provide water to the private tankers at Hoodi GLR (ground level reservoir), A. Narayanapura GLR, and 17th Main Koramangala GLR. While clarifying that this was an interim solution that will not be extended beyond March 31, BWSSB officials said they would charge ₹60 per 1,000 litres.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/water-tanker-strike-temporarily-called-off/article31092504.ece

401,2020/03/17,"Protecting wild canids, hyenas can help expand conservation enterprise: Study","Protecting wild dogs or dholes, jackals, wolves, foxes and hyenas offers “incredible potential” to expand the conservation enterprise in India, a new study has found.

Scientists from Wildlife Conservation Society–India, University of Florida (USA), Ashoka Trust for Ecology and the Environment, Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Centre for Biological Sciences, and James Cook University (Australia) found that though India’s focus on large carnivore conservation has mostly centred on forested national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, the non-protected areas support many carnivores representing “unique and under- valued” habitats and ecosystems.

The paper, titled “Opportunities for prioritising and expanding conservation enterprise in India using a guild of carnivores as flagships,” has been published in the international scientific journal, Environmental Research Letters.

According to a release, the scientists undertook a multi-pronged approach to gather information on wild canids (dhole, golden jackal, Indian wolf, Tibetan wolf, Indian fox, red fox, desert fox, Tibetan fox) and striped hyenas across India using citizen-science surveys, social media and literature surveys.

Combining these with statistical models to map their distribution patterns, the authors conducted a prioritisation analysis and identified taluks/ tehsils across the country that need to be protected as ‘Canid Conservation Units’ to save wild canids, hyenas and their habitats.

The findings suggest that States like Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, which rank high on the priority scale, should invest efforts towards conserving these carnivores and their habitats, the release said.

“Our assessment focuses on hitherto overlooked carnivores of India, which represent some of the most imperilled habitats like grasslands, scrublands, open barren lands, deserts and ravines. The study also combines ecological requirements of these carnivores, with human population densities, poverty levels, budgetary allocations by states for forest/wildlife conservation, and potentially detrimental infrastructure projects,” Arjun Srivathsa, the lead author of the study, was quoted as saying in the release.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/protecting-wild-canids-hyenas-can-help-expand-conservation-enterprise-study/article31092287.ece
402,2020/03/17,COVID-19 | Restrictions hit blood donations,"Patients who require regular blood transfusions for survival are the worst hit

With mass gatherings banned to contain the spread of COVID-19, blood donations have been hit across the State.

Most blood banks are running short of blood and blood components and are now ready to arrange for blood collection even if there are 10 donors from a particular community. The State has 230 blood banks, including 43 government banks. Usually, blood camps are conducted when there are at least 50 or more donors.

Blood banks that usually have a stock of 3,000 to 4,000 units a month now have hardly 80 to 100 units with them. While this has affected patients needing blood during emergencies such as accidents and surgeries, those patients suffering from severe blood disorders (such as thalassemia) and who require regular blood transfusions for survival are the worst hit. Thalassemia patients need at least two units of blood every 15 days.

Camps cancelled

Compounding the problem is closure of colleges and universities and IT employees working from home. “Almost all our scheduled camps in the last fortnight have been cancelled as most colleges and universities have been closed and IT companies have permitted their employees to work from home. COVID-19 fear has kept away even our regular voluntary donors although we have been trying to explain to them that we will take utmost precautions while collecting blood,” Latha Jaganathan, Medical Director and Managing Trustee of Rotary TTK Blood Bank told The Hindu on Monday.

“We supply blood to major hospitals, 27 blood storage centres in the districts apart from catering to the regular patients. Over 100 thalassemia patients get blood transfusion through our bank and shortage is going to hit them the most. As of now we are providing them blood on priority. If the situation continues, we will be forced to ask patients and hospitals for replacement,” she said.

Dr Jaganathan, who is also part of the State Blood Transfusion Council, said Rotary TTK has also asked major hospitals where they supply blood to postpone non-emergency surgeries for sometime.

Prashanth Chandrashekar, General Secretary of Indian Red Cross Society’s Karnataka chapter, said the society was managing as of now as the collection had been good during the last two months. “But if the situation continues, we will be heading towards a stock out,” she said.

Namitha A. Kumar, a thalassaemic who is part of the Open Platform for Rare Diseases, said there is a need to raise awareness on safety of blood donations during such times to avoid issues. “Small blood camps can be organized with just 3 to 4 people. Blood bank personnel will screen and ensure no one with fever, cough, cold or flu like symptoms will enter the camp. These precautions ensure donor safety and can be easily implemented,” she said.

Megha Badarinath, a consultant dento-maxillofacial radiologist who is a thalassaemic herself, said she along with Namitha and other volunteers have been coaxing their relatives and friends to go to a nearest blood bank and donate individually. “We have managed to coax nearly 50 people to donate in the last two days,” she said.

However, D. Jayaraju, State Deputy Director (Blood Safety) said blood banks can appeal to individual donors from their registry to donate. “There will be some hiccups in such times of an health emergency. But the situation will improve in the next few days,” he assured.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/i2z0pz/article31088733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGBLOODDONATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-restrictions-hit-blood-donations/article31088738.ece

The tenth patient is a 60 year old male who is tested positive had come in contact of with the Kalaburgi patient who passed away on March 10. The 60 year old patient is admitted in designated isolation hospital in Kalaburagi.

Intensifying its surveillance, the Health Department has been able to contact 42,000 passengers, who landed at Kempegowda International Airport and have submitted declarations with their phone numbers and email ID, on a single day through Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS).

“We used the phone numbers of passengers provided in the declaration forms and through IVRS have been able to contact them all on a single day on Monday. Through IVRS, they have been asked to strictly be under home isolation,” Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey said.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa who had a video conference with Deputy Commissioners on Monday reviewed surveillance measures in districts. He also reviewed the implementation of the orders issued by the State to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

He said entry is prohibited to tourists in Mandya, Mysuru, Vijayapura, Ballari, Koppal, and Kodagu districts.

“While homestays are under scrutiny, foreign tourists and people who have returned from foreign tours are being screened thoroughly,” he said.

“Help desks will be set up in railway stations, bus stands and check-posts at the border areas of the State and screening will be undertaken here too. As people visit temples in large numbers, all shanties and jathras have been prohibited as a precaution,” he said.

Stating that super markets have been permitted to open doors to facilitate purchase of essential commodities, the Chief Minister asked officials to ensure that people are not put to hardship due to the precautions.

404,2020/03/17,COVID-19 | Karnataka advocate under ‘self-isolation’,"He had met a client who later “tested positive” for COVID-19

Advocates and others present in the Chief Justice’s court hall of the Karnataka High Court were in for a shock on Monday afternoon when an advocate, representing the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), who came wearing a face mask, made a self-declaration before a Division Bench that he was under “self-isolation” as he had met a client who later “tested positive” for COVID-19.

Following this the Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi, told him that “he should not have been in the court” in such circumstances.

“Though we are informed by the Health Secretary that the chance of spread from droplets of a COVID-19 infected person is high only when distance is less than a metre, you should not have been here as per the health advisory... ” the Chief Justice said, while permitting him to leave the court hall immediately, saying that the Bench would pass orders in his absence as his junior was present in the court.

However, many advocates, including Additional Advocate-General Dhyan Chinnappa and other advocates representing the government, said that he should not have come to the court at all. “Oh, no...” was how some of those present in the court hall reacted when the advocate declared that he met a person who later tested positive for COVID-19 while some other advocates pointed out to their colleagues that he was in the court hall since morning.

After hearing of the cases related to the KSPCB, the Chief Justice told the junior advocate to ensure that his senior was quarantined for at least 15 days as per the health advisory. When some advocates said that he was waiting outside the court hall, the Chief Justice requested government advocates to tell him to leave the court premises immediately and quarantine himself.

Advocate clarifies

Though the advocate told the Bench that his client “ tested positive” after he met him, the advocate sent messages to his colleagues and media representatives through WhatsApp later stating that his client, who came from Germany and met him at his office last week, was at present in the testing ward of suspected COVID-19 in Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases in Bengaluru, and the test report was awaited.

When some advocates told the Chief Justice that it would be better if the summer vacations were advanced instead of hearing urgent cases every day, the Chief Justice pointed out that the Chief Justice of India, at a videoconference with Chief Justices of all the high courts on Monday afternoon, had made it clear that the courts could not be closed down and asked us to wait for a week or two to assess the health scenario.

What would happen if the summer vacations were advanced now and the prevailing health scenario continued for four to five weeks, the Chief Justice said, while pointing out that the existing guidelines of relaxing rules for taking up only urgent cases were issued after taking into consideration several aspects, including advancing of summer vacation.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/x2lsnv/article30878051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-advocate-under-self-isolation/article31088422.ece
405,2020/03/17,Nalapad booked for assaulting party worker,"The incident occurred at Gayatri Devi Park on Sunday night

Mohammed Nalapad, son of MLA N.A. Haris, has been booked by the Vyalikaval police for allegedly assaulting a party worker on Sunday night.

Based on a complaint filed by Sachin Gowda, the police charged Nalapad and his gunman under assault and criminal intimidation. Nalapad has also filed a complaint, but it is being treated as a non-cognizable report, a senior police officer said.

The incident occurred at Gayatri Devi Park, where a debate programme was organised by the youth Congress under the aegis of Telugu Vignan Samiti.

When Sachin noticed that the son of another MLA was seated in the audience, he asked the organisers to allow him to sit on the dais. But the organisers ignored his request, following which Sachin raised the issue with senior Congress leaders.

Heated arguments ensued when the organisers accused Sachin of creating a ruckus. In the melee, Nalapad allegedly assaulted and threatened Sachin and his gunman joined him. Others intervened and rescued Sachin, who later filed a complaint.

While Nalapad’s complaint alleges that Sachin threatened and abused him, Sachin accused Nalapad and his gunman of assaulting him. The statements made in the complaint will be subjected to investigation for verification, Chetan Singh Rathore, DCP, Central Division, said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/k7wjgl/article31088319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGNALAPAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nalapad-booked-for-assaulting-party-worker/article31088320.ece
406,2020/03/17,Farming along polluted waters of the Vrishabhavathi,"Industrial effluents and plastic choke our river. Our future is increasingly looking bleak, say farmers who live along the course of the river

On a hot weekday afternoon, in Bannigere, two people are sitting on the bank of a small stream that runs through an agricultural field, and fishing in the grey waters. Behind them, a herd of goats is grazing as Chethan, 30, watches over them.

For most people familiar with the pollution that is choking the Vrishabhavathi river, it is hard to imagine going anywhere close to its waters. But for villages that the river flows through on the outskirts of Bengaluru, life goes on despite the river water losing its potability a few decades ago.

“The goats graze along the banks of the river and seem to not be affected by the water. Many people come here to fish. Earlier, they used to find big ones. But now, they find smaller ones. They have no problem eating it. I think they are used to it,” said Mr. Chethan, who decided to quit his job in Electronics City in Bengaluru after a year of long travel got to him and he decided to stay home and manage their goats. He remembers seeing the river during its better years when he was a child.

BENGALURU - KARNATAKA - 16/03/2020 : Farmers uses a pipe for letting out frothing water into a field, along the course of Vrishabhavathi river, at Erepalya near Anchipura, in Bidadi taluk, near Bengaluru. Illegal plastic segregation units segregated and burnt at Kambipura polluting the water and air, along the Vrishabhavathi river bed, a tributary of Arkavathy river, the erstwhile fresh water stream, today carry huge quantities of industrial, agricultural and domestic effluents from the western and southern part of Bangalore metropolis.

Once a pristine river

Eighty-year-old Madhaiah, who joins in the conversation on his way home after work on the field, says he has seen the Vrishabhavathi run its full course — from providing drinking water to its present state — where multiple runs of cleaning up by sewage treatment plants cannot bring back the old days.

“We used to drink the water straight from the river. I have two acres of land and we used to grow watermelon among other things. Now I manage ragi with difficulty. It is at best enough for our consumption. My wife is unwell and I cannot afford to dig a borewell for irrigation,” he said.

Most farmers, along the course of the river, have similar stories to tell. At Erepalya near Anchepalya, a pipe is letting out frothing water into a field. A little away is 32-year-old Puttananjaiah’s farm. He owns 15 acres and grows maize, ragi and some vegetables. “There is no water in the kere and the water from Vrishabhavathi cannot even be used for irrigation. I spent ₹4 lakh on getting a borewell dug up and I am managing to grow what I can with that water,” he said, as he was readying his field to plant baby corn. On to his right is an acre-and-a-half of bottlegourd vines. The gourds are ready to be harvested but find themselves on the ground instead, many run over by tractors. “Vegetable prices have crashed. I used to get ₹400 for a bag (around 30 fit into one). Now, they say it will fetch me ₹50. That does not even cover my transportation cost. So, I decided to let it rot here,” he says, visibly dismayed.

Mr. Puttananjaiah says their future is increasingly looking bleak. “No one cares about farmers or nature. No one even visits us. Twenty years ago, we got water from the river. Now, industrial and plastic waste are choking it. The same water goes into the ocean at some point. Where do we go next?” he asked.

Not far from his farm, behind the frothing waters of the Byramangala dam in Bidadi, work is on to construct a separate channel for treated water. Workers at the site said the canal will carry the treated water which can be used for irrigation purposes, and the rest will be let out. Tushar Girinath, Chairman, Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), said 100 MLD of treated water from the Doddabele plant will be picked up in the canal, while the rest will be diverted and allowed to flow down.

Referring to the World Health Organisation’s sanitation safety planning, a risk mitigation strategy to understand who is at risk, water conservationist S. Vishwanath said there are two categories here: consumers of these products, and the farmers and farm workers. Non-edible crops eliminate consumers from the risk category, while better cultivation practices such as drip irrigation puts farmers and farm workers at a lesser risk.

BENGALURU - KARNATAKA - 16/03/2020 : New Canal being built for the flow of treated water, by the side of Vrishabhavathi reservoir (Byramangala lake), at Byramangala, in Bidadi taluk, Ramanagara district.

He said caution should be exercised is to not use the water at present to grow edible crops like root crops. “It is okay to grow non-edible crops like flowers or mulberry — which is what 40% of the farmers there grow. Now many farmers are shifting to growing other crops like baby corn. We should look at how often the food being grown is eaten. Baby corn, for instance, is not in the regular diet of most people. But this does not mean we don’t invest in cleaning up especially the industrial effluents,” he said.

On the plate

But T.V. Ramachandra from the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, said the contamination is going to land on everyone’s plate. “It will come back to us. Our ongoing study shows that heavy metals in food are being transferred to us from food grown in K.C. Valley and Vrishabhavathi Valley. Dyeing industries have resurfaced near Vrishabhavathi, which is worse off than Bellandur and Varthur lakes. Food chain contamination is a serious issue and we need to raise their voice against it,” he said.

407,2020/03/17,COVID-19 | AC supermarkets to remain open,"Chief Minister orders them to be kept open hours after a BBMP directive to shut them

For a few hours, there was confusion over whether air-conditioned supermarkets in the city would be allowed to function. While chairperson of BBMP’s Standing Committee for Health G. Manjunath Raju stated that from Tuesday, no AC supermarkets would be allowed to function, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa directed that all markets should be allowed to function.

Addressing reporters on Monday, Mr. Raju said he had recommended closure of all air-conditioned supermarkets in the city from Tuesday. He claimed that with the temperatures set at around 20 degrees Celsius, the environment within the supermarkets were conducive for the spread of viruses.

That apart, he claimed that many supermarkets were offering discounts, resulting in many citizens thronging supermarkets to stock up. “Depending on the situation, we will take a call on when it is safe for supermarkets to function again,” he told The Hindu. However, within a few hours, the decision was revoked. A release issued by personal secretary, Standing Committee for Health, stated that directions issued by Mr. Yediyurappa on allowing the AC supermarkets to function would be followed.

With conflicting directions, the BBMP personnel and police were found closing down AC supermarkets in Yelahanka and on Kanakapura Road.

Sources in BBMP maintained that closure of supermarkets would create unnecessary panic among citizens, apart from hoarding and creation of artificial scarcity. “Citizens are already scared to step out. There is also panic buying of staples and commodities such as sanitisers and masks. IF they start closing down supermarkets as well, the situation is likely to get out of hand,” said Sneha Bharadwaj of Malleswaram.

Information cell

Meanwhile, the BBMP is all set to launch a GIS (geographical information system)-based information system for public health. Through the system, citizens can see where the different cases of COVID-19, cholera, gastroenteritis and other communicable diseases have been reported in the city.

Speaking about the system – GIS Public Health Epidemiological Information Cell, Mr. Raju said the system would be launched on Tuesday. “We will publicise a helpline number, which the citizens can call and give information about the communicable diseases reported,” he said and added that all the government and private hospitals had been geo-tagged.

Training in Town Hall

Several BBMP officials on Monday gathered at Town Hall for a training programme on census. Ironically, just a few days ago, the BBMP had prohibited large gatherings, even going on to restrict number of guests at weddings to just 100. These precautions, BBMP maintained, were necessary to check the spread of COVID-19.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar admitted that the meet was held in Town Hall and added that further events had been cancelled.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ppwb61/article31088281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGCORONASUPERMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-ac-supermarkets-to-remain-open/article31088282.ece

Taxi aggregators Ola and Uber too have issued advisories to drivers and passengers on taking precautionary measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Both aggregators have asked driver partners to remain off road if they are sick.

Ola, in its advisory, has asked its passengers to approach the customer care or the government helpline if they had taken a ride in the last seven days and tested positive for COVID-19 or displaying symptoms.

In addition to this, customers have been asked to approach the customer care via phone or use the app support button if they feel that they came in contact with driver or customer displaying symptoms . The passengers have also been asked to sanitise and wash hands after the ride.

“Our partner care teams and safety response teams are available 24x7 for any concerns that may arise for driver partners and customers respectively. We encourage everyone to proactively report any instance that may be symptomatic for us to help action and guide appropriately,”states a release from Ola.

Anuradha, a passenger, said, “The aggregators should educate drivers about maintaining cleanliness and using disinfectant. Taking proper precaution will help both passengers and drivers. Same should be applied to autorickshaws attached to mobile app based taxi aggregators as people have started opting for autos now to avoid AC cabs.”

Efforts by airport, railways

The Kempegowda International Airport has said that based on the directive of the authorities the airport has taken various measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. A press release stated that all facilities at the airport, including terminal and kerb, are sprayed with disinfectant every 12 hours.

High-traffic touch points such as the arms of chairs, railings, lift buttons, doorknobs, touch screens etc., are sanitized – manually – with a cloth and disinfectant every four hours. The hand baggage trays at security screening (domestic & international) are sanitized in a continuous process – after every use.

The release further states that alcohol-based hand sanitises are available at 450+ locations within the airport such as security hold area, departure and arrival gates, offices, check-in counters, information desks, boarding gates, scanning areas, desks, bus lounge boarding gates and others.

410,2020/03/17,Burning of garbage in Pozhichalur causes difficulties for residents,"Residents say they are facing health problems, and that motorists are also affected by the smoke from the burning garbage

Several residents in Pozhichalur are facing hardship because of the dumping and burning of garbage in the locality.

Pozhichalur, located behind the Chennai Airport, has a lot of residential areas including Sudharma Layout, ECTV Nagar, Ranga Garden, Prem Nagar, and Commissioner Colony. Residents of these areas are faced with mounds of garbage being dumped in vacant plots along the Adyar river, causing inconvenience and health issues.

Varun Roy, a resident of Cowl Bazaar, said the residents in the locality are facing health issues because the garbage is being dumped regularly and also burnt, particularly during the night. The residents are unable to venture out because of a nauseating smell from burning of the garbage, he said.

The residents of the area ask why the Pozhichalur panchayat authorities are allowing garbage to be dumped near an important river, and said the garbage is also causing ground water pollution.

Moreover, motorists using the Pallavaram Road are affected by the smoke caused by the burning garbage. The Pallavaram Road is an important arterial road connecting several localities to the GST Road.

T. Yogesh, a resident of Pammal Sankara Nagar, said hundreds of motorists bound for Porur use the Pozhichalur Main Road and Pallavaram Road to escape from traffic on Kundrathur Main Road. The burning of garbage causes severe eye irritation and breathing problems to motorists regularly using the road, he said.

The residents in the locality have made several complaints to the Kancheepuram District Collector to take steps to stop the dumping of garbage.

A senior official of the Kancheepuram district said the officials of the Pozhichalur Panchayat have been directed to take steps to prevent dumping of garbage.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dvk1pm/article31089147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MARTH-GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/burning-of-garbage-in-pozhichalur-causes-difficulties-for-residents/article31089149.ece
411,2020/03/17,IIT-M to reskill women in artificial intelligence,"The Indian Institute of Technology-Madras is offering 150 hours of training to reskill women who have taken a break from their career.

The certification course includes artificial intelligence, machine learning, cyber security data science and big data.

The Career Back 2 Women is an initiative through the Institute’s Digital Skills Academy. Candidates can choose the level of training.

The institute has tied up with the Forensic Intelligence Surveillance and Security Technologies to offer the programme.

IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthi said, “In the IT field, the technology changes are so rapid that they [women who take a break] are unable to get back to their careers as their skills are probably outdated. Despite this, their industry experience and knowledge about IT are immense and can be useful to many IT companies if they can fit into current requirements immediately. IIT-Madras is happy to pioneer this programme to help them get back to work and retrieve their careers.”

Women who complete the advance module in select tracks would also receive assistance in job placement.

Digital Skills Academy, IIT-Madras, also plans to offer more courses at various levels for students and working professionals in association with NASSCOM and in partnership with training companies incubated at IIT Madras Research Park and industry partners.

K. Mangala Sunder, Head, Digital Skills Academy, said, “IIT-M works with NASSCOM IT-ITeS Sector Skill Council to ensure that right industry partners are involved in training. Faculty from premier institutions provide fundamental knowledge to all learners.”

413,2020/03/17,Tasmac instructs its staff to take precautions,"The Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac) has instructed its employees to wear masks while at work and keep hand sanitisers at all outlets and bars. It has sent a circular regarding the same to managers of all its outlets across the State.

Instructions have also been issued to keep the shops, bars and the surroundings clean.

The manager of an outlet in T.Nagar, said, “We have got the instructions but we are wondering where to go and buy the sanitisers. There is no stock anywhere in this locality. It would be good if the State procures sanitisers in bulk and distributes it to us,” he said. Ditto was the response from the manager of an outlet in Kodambakkam.

To a query on whether sales has dipped because of the Coronavirus scare, the managers at the outlet said that it was business as usual for them.

Tasmac, on an average, sells liquor worth ₹78 crore to ₹80 crore per day. During weekends and festive season the sales numbers cross the ₹100 crore mark.

414,2020/03/17,Padma Shri awardees felicitated at MSSRF,"Padma Shri awardees Manohar Devadoss and S. Ramakrishnan were felicitated at a function held at MSSRF in the city on Monday.

M.S. Swaminathan, founder, MSSRF, said that it was a great occasion to be seated with two people who hold a value system which they stand for. He said that despite Mr. Devadoss’s fading vision, his drawing of the Madurai Meenakshi Temple was remarkable and such a piece may be difficult to find even among skilled architects.

N. Ram, Chairman, THG Publishing Private Ltd., heaping encomiums on Mr. Devadoss and Mr. Ramakrishnan, said though the award had come late, it was symbolic in recognising the work done by both of them. He added that Mr. Mano had to undergo two major set backs in life — his eyesight and his wife Mahima suffering from paralysis — but he has carried on, to achieve great things through his drawings. He said: “I came to know that Mano spends more than 100 hours per sketch putting great efforts in the exquisite drawings.”

Mr. Ram lauded Mr. Ramakrishnan, founder president of Amar Seva Sangam, for doing meaningful work among the marginalised sections in the rural areas overcoming several obstacles by partnering with the State government.

Mr. Devadoss thanked Mr. Ram for the long friendship and acknowledged the latter’s role in his book on Madurai.

Mr. Ramakrishnan said that the Padma Shri award was a recognition for the tireless work of S. Sankaraman who is the secretary of the Amar Seva Sangam.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qrbjtg/article31086447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THMSSRF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/padma-shri-awardees-felicitated-at-mssrf/article31086448.ece

417,2020/03/17,Corpn. to reclaim Perungudi land,"Skywalks planned at seven locations

Chennai Corporation will retrieve 200 acres of land in Perungudi dumpyard by reversing the environmental damage caused by dumping of waste in the past three decades.

In the Assembly, on Monday, Municipal Administration Minister S.P.Velumani announced that the work on bio-mining in the Perungudi dumpyard will be taken up under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

Waste from Teynampet, Kodambakkam, Valasaravakkam, Alandur, Adyar, Perungudi and Sholinganallur zones are being dumped in the Perungudi dumpyard in the vicinity of Pallikaranai marshland.

Residents have been protesting against the pollution in the area for years. Work on reversal of the environmental damage in the marshland is expected to be completed as part of eco-restoration of the marsh, he said.

Chennai Corporation generates 5,100 tonnes of municipal solid waste, transferring the waste to Perungudi and Kodungaiyur. “In order to reduce the burden on landfill, Chennai Corporation has also established decentralised processing units like composting and biomethanization plants. At present, 550 tonnes of biodegradable waste is being processed at decentralised units. Work on bio-mining of 37,510 cu.m of waste in old dumpyard in Pallikaranai is under way,” said Mr.Velumani.

Bio-mining in Athipet and Sathangadu dumpyards has started to recover 37.89 acres of land. The Corporation has also banned “one time use and throwaway plastics and seized 316 tonnes, collecting a fine amount of ₹1.18 crore”.

Beating congestion

Chennai Corporation will also develop skywalks to help pedestrians in seven congested locations across the city. Mr.Velumani said that seven projects will be developed at an estimated cost of ₹45 crore to help pedestrians cross Luz Church Road at Luz Corner, LB Road at Adyar depot, Sardar Patel Road near Anna University, Arcot Road near Vijaya Forum Mall, Anna Nagar Second Avenue near Ayyappan Temple, Anna Nagar Third Avenue near Kandasamy College and Purasawalkam High Road near Abirami Mega Mall.

The civic body will also redevelop 153 shopping complexes, with facilities for entertainment. “A feasibility study will be done shortly,” said Mr.Velumani.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corpn-to-reclaim-perungudi-land/article31086420.ece
418,2020/03/17,"Quarantine facilities near airports soon, 24-hr. helplines set up","Govt. warns against spreading false information or causing panic

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday said that as far as possible facilities would be established near the international airports at Chennai, Coimbatore, Tiruchi and Madurai to quarantine Indians who returned from the 14 countries, arrivals from which had been banned by the Central government.

The government said that its 24-hour helpline could be accessed on the phone numbers 104, 044-29510400, 044-29510500, 9444340496 and 8754448477.

The government warned that those spreading false information or causing unwarranted panic over COVID-19, either in the form of news or on social media or any other form, would be prosecuted under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code and Disaster Management Act, 2005.

Anganwadi centres would also be closed in Tamil Nadu till March 31 but dry rations for children in the anganwadis would be handed over to their parents.

“Other than those mentioned, all other essential and necessary activities would continue normally,” a release specified.

Work-from-home

Noting that many private companies had extended work-from-home options to their employees and since educational institutions would be closed, the Chief Minister said the people should not use the opportunity to go on tours or picnics.

Asked if the government would urge private companies to offer a work-from-home option to employees, a senior official said it was for the respective establishments to decide, depending on the nature of work. “Since the option would not be feasible for companies in manufacturing and other sectors, it is up to them,” he said. “Health experts are advising against gathering in large numbers at social functions and events. I request the general public to follow the advice,” he said.

Thermal scanners

Mr. Palaniswami instructed officials in health, transport, police and district administrations in border districts to screen passengers with thermal scanners at toll plazas.

He also wrote to the Railway Minister to advise the General Manager of Southern Railway to ensure cleaning of railway coaches and premises. He instructed the Commissioner of Revenue Administration (CRA) to ensure screening and precautionary measures in all border districts to check spread of the pandemic from neighbouring States. Places with central air conditioning are to be cleaned at least once a week.

Further, the Higher Education department has announced that all colleges, universities and other training institutes under its ambit will be shut till March 31.

While the faculty of these institutions have been asked to come to work, the department announced that university exams, practical exams and entrance exams will go on as scheduled.

“The temples can be closed in the event of mahamari (epidemic), fire, earthquake and invasion. Invoke the presiding deity in tharpai (grass) and worship it from a private place,” Mr. Nagaswamy told The Hindu.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has also advised devotees not to throng places of worship.

Mr. Nagaswamy said temples in Tamil Nadu had done it in the past when it was invaded by Malik Kafur and during epidemics. “To save bronzes from attacks, temple authorities and priests buried them inside the temples or in safe places. The bronzes unearthed in many places were actually buried during invasions,” he said.

421,2020/03/17,Over 180 flights cancelled this month,"Over 180 flights have been cancelled at Chennai airport this month and there may be a nearly 50% dip in international passenger traffic.

Airport sources said that nearly 100 flights have been cancelled this week alone.

On Monday too, several flights to destinations, including Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, were cancelled by several airlines. Sources said that international traffic, that was around 8,000-9,000 passengers till last week, has fallen further. “Though we are yet to get an exact estimate of the passenger traffic, from the initial estimates, only 4,000-5,000 are travelling now. This may even fall further in the coming days as more and more flights are being cancelled,” a source said.

In the first 11 days, about 90 flights were cancelled. While all airlines that cancel don’t necessarily say it is because of COVID-19, sources said, a majority of the cancellations are due to the impact of the pandemic.

Domestic passenger traffic too may be impacted but not to the extent of international traffic, sources said. The screening of passengers has been on and 1,80,062 passengers have been screened at Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore airports till date.

Many passengers have been cancelling their flights, both domestic and international.

Some carriers like Singapore Airlines have been offering fee waivers and flexible rebooking for all customers. In a statement, it said: “Singapore Airlines is waiving all rebooking fees for tickets issued on or before March 15, 2020, for travel up to May 31, 2020, with immediate effect.

After testing a little over 90 nasal, throat swabs and blood samples for over a month and a half, Tamil Nadu’s Health department lifted 32 samples — the highest number on a single day — from persons with symptoms of COVID-19 on Monday. In addition, the department lifted 22 random samples from patients with other viral infections and H1N1 influenza, and all samples tested negative for COVID-19.

“Many persons with a travel history to COVID-19 countries are approaching us for testing. So, we are considering such persons, that is those with symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty in breathing along with travel history or contact history, as they are anxious. So, we have lifted more samples today; 32 from Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital alone. A total of 128 samples have been lifted,” Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar told reporters after inspecting the Chennai Port Trust hospital.

Going by the book

Apart from this, the department did a random check among patients who were admitted to various hospitals for different reasons such as fever or H1N1 or other viral infections, he said, “Such random checks are important and are part of the guidelines for COVID-19. We lifted blood samples from 22 such patients, who had symptoms and recovered. All have tested negative for COVID-19,” he said.

This, officials, said was to check if there was community transmission of COVID-19.

As on Monday, 22 persons were under hospital isolation in the State, a bulletin said. This included 11 at RGGGH.

Another 20 persons, who were asymptomatic but arrived from seven highly-affected countries, are under quarantine at the Institute of Public Health, Poonamallee. A total of 2,221 persons were under home quarantine in the State.

The Minister said they were increasing the bed strength in quarantine facilities in every district. “Already, we have increased the bed strength in isolation wards from 330 beds to 1,120 beds in the State,” he said.

The Minister added that as of now, each diagnostic facility for COVID-19 can test up to 100 samples a day.

On screening at railway stations, he said there were 79 trains and the Chief Minister has made it clear that the railway authorities should compulsorily conduct screening at the stations, and restrict special trains from other States. At the Chennai port, officials have screened 1,600 persons who had arrived in 71 ships.

423,2020/03/17,HC swings into action to insulate court campuses from COVID-19,"Top seven judges hold meeting with Chief Secretary and Health Secretary

The Madras High Court administration on Monday swung into action to insulate all court campuses in the State from the the coronavirus pandemic. Its Administrative Committee, comprising the top seven judges, including Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, held a discussion with Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam and Health Secretary Beela Rajesh in the court buildings to ascertain the COVID-19 situation in the State.

According to informed sources, the meeting was convened after Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde addressed the Chief Justices of all High Courts in the country through video-conferencing and impressed upon them the need to take effective steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The Chief Secretary assured the High Court of all possible assistance and agreed to sanitise the court campus twice a day.

Justices Vineet Kothari, R. Subbiah, M. Sathyanarayanan, N. Kirubakaran, M.M. Sundresh and T.S. Sivagnanam attended the meet, apart from Advocate General Vijay Narayan and office-bearers of all Bar associations. They discussed the possibility of restricting the functioning of the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai, its Madurai Bench as well as the lower courts in the State to only admission and urgent cases for the next three weeks.

In order to avoid crowding of court halls such as those where bail and anticipatory bail petitions were heard, the judges discussed whether such portfolios could be divided amongst many judges so that the crowd gets split to different court halls and a minimum of one-metre distance is maintained between two individuals. The possibility of asking the court staff to work in two shifts was also taken up for discussion.

The discussion also revolved around preventing the entry of litigants into the court campuses for the next three weeks, closing down the mediation and conciliation centre temporarily, shutting down the canteens and Cafeterías on the court campuses until the situation improves, not allowing lawyers to use the Bar association premises for any kind of congregations but for utilising the libraries and avoiding crowds on the campus.

Subjecting all entrants to the High Court to thermal screening and denying entry to those with high body temperature were also among the possibilities discussed. Immediately after the meeting, Chief Justice Sahi and Justice Sivagnanam flew to the Madurai Bench and held discussions with the Bar members there, in the presence of the Madurai Corporation Commissioner and the dean of the Government Rajaji Hospital.

Madurai Bench of Madras High Court Bar Association (MMBA) secretary N. Ilango said the Bar members agreed to support all initiatives taken by the court administration to prevent the spread of the contagion. Further, the court officials stated that the Chief Justice would return to Chennai on the same day, consider all the issues discussed at the meetings and issue a comprehensive circular on Tuesday for implementation of the new regulations from Wednesday.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-swings-into-action-to-insulate-court-campuses-from-covid-19/article31086064.ece

425,2020/03/17,"At a time of scarcity, RGGGH sits pretty with in-house sanitiser","At a time when hand sanitisers have become essential commodities, the city’s largest government hospital — Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) — has become self-sufficient with its own formulation. It has not only stepped up its production capacity to meet its in-house requirements, but has also shared the know-how with a number of other government medical college hospitals in the State.

The College of Pharmacy (Madras Medical College) started manufacturing hand sanitisers in May 2018. With the in-house product, the hospital had then estimated that it would save at least ₹30 lakh every year.

“Sanitisers are very important in a hospital set-up. Manufacturing our own sanitisers on a small scale has become a boon for us, especially at a time like this. Now, there is an increased need for sanitisers and we have almost doubled the production capacity. These sanitisers are available on every corridor, near all lifts and in all wards. We have kept the sanitisers in the isolation facilities too,” said R. Jayanthi, dean, RGGGH.

She added that with sanitisers being a “precious commodity”, they were extremely judicious in using them without compromising on hygiene. “We are also applying for a drug license to take up large-scale manufacturing and marketing of the hand sanitisers,” she said.

The RGGGH has taken a step forward and shared the know-how with other government medical college hospitals in the State. For instance, representatives of the Government Tiruvannamalai Medical College Hospital visited the institute on Monday for learning the processes involved.

Jerad Suresh, principal, College of Pharmacy, MMC, said they have a capacity to manufacture two batches of 285 litres each per day. “So, we are manufacturing nearly 570 litres per day. This translates to nearly 1,040 bottles of 500 ml each. When we started, each 500 ml bottle cost ₹83 or ₹84. Now, the cost is ₹100. However, the commercially available products cost ₹550 to ₹650. So, we are saving a lot,” he said.

He mentioned that the Department of Dermatology had tested the sanitiser for its effectiveness as an antimicrobial, while the Institute of Microbiology tested its allergenicity.

Dr. Jayanthi added that they have placed orders for 5,000 bars of soaps from Khadi outlet and this would be available at all wards, toilets and out patient rooms.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/at-a-time-of-scarcity-rgggh-sits-pretty-with-in-house-sanitiser/article31085970.ece
426,2020/03/17,From virtual conferencing to real leadership,"New Delhi has a chance to step up the SAARC video conference — as its assertive expression to stabilise the region

After lying moribund for years, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has suddenly acquired a new lease of life since last Sunday. Through a dramatic counter-intuitive initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, SAARC, has become the ‘virtual’ platform through which leaders of the eight countries of our troubled region agreed to work together to combat unarguably the greatest immediate threat to the people: the COVID-19 health pandemic.

All eyes on India

The success of the Modi-SAARC initiative will largely depend on India — the dominant power of the region, in every sense. Once New Delhi demonstrates that it has the capacity, the political willingness to institutionalise and to lead a mutually beneficial cooperative regime in the region, Pakistan’s “churlish” behaviour will become marginal to SAARC. Various international relations theorists view this as a function of “hegemonic stability”.

What therefore is at test is India’s leadership, not Islamabad’s follies. The initial steps announced by Mr. Modi are laudable, including the proposal to set up the COVID-19 Emergency Fund for SAARC countries, with India making an initial non-trivial offering of $10 million; and the formation of a Rapid Response Team (of doctors, specialists, testing equipment and attendant infrastructure) to be put at the disposal of the SAARC, at this moment of grave peril.

But much more will need to be done by New Delhi to establish that the video conference was not a mere event, but the assertive expression of its new willingness to stabilise the region through cooperative mechanisms, for our common future, without being distracted by short-sighted disingenuous ploys of a troubled Pakistan or being put off by its grandstanding. This is a moment thus of a rare opportunity for India to establish its firm imprimatur over the region; and to secure an abiding partnership for our shared destiny.

Also read: India, Pak. enmity main reason for SAARC not prospering: Bangladesh Minister

The spark of South Asia

SAARC was born at a moment of hope in the 1980s; the idea was initiated by one of the most inscrutable leaders of the region, General Zia Ur Rehman of Bangladesh, who, met many of the other leaders personally and dispatched special envoys to the capitals of the countries of the region. Dhaka’s persistence resulted in the first summit of the seven leaders of the region in 1985. Afghanistan joined in 2007. In the nearly 35 years of its existence, even its champions will concede however that SAARC has, to put it euphemistically, not lived up to the promise of its founder.

South Asia is the world’s least integrated region; less than 5% of the trade of SAARC countries is within. A South Asian Free Trade Zone agreed on, in 2006, remains, in reality, a chimera. The last SAARC summit, scheduled to be held in Islamabad in November 2016, was postponed after the terrorist attacks in Uri; none has been held since then, and until Mr. Modi’s initiative, no major meeting had been planned. A quick look at some of the questions posed in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on SAARC, in the last years, suggest that Indian MPs seek answers on why India is still a member of SAARC and on the strength of other organisations such as the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) that India is engaged with. Thus SAARC had become almost marginal to our collective consciousness.

Bright spots

There have been some sunny moments in SAARC’s dismal and dysfunctional history. During the tenure of Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, who had been fed a sumptuous diet of the possibilities of cooperation on the Track II circuit before he became Prime Minister, there was movement. At the Male Summit in 1997, for instance, a Group of Eminent Persons was set up to provide a vision for SAARC 2020. Equally, I.K. Gujral often confided that it was at Male that Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had told him in Punjabi: “I know you cannot give me Kashmir; and you know I cannot grab it from you; but let us just talk and move on.” But these moments of candour that could have injected practical common sense, remained few and far between.

The fadeout and a revival

The reasons for the failure of SAARC have been enumerated several times as well. Clearly, most of the smaller states and external players believe that the India-Pakistan conflict has undermined SAARC. Bilateral issues cannot be discussed in SAARC but since the organisation relies on the principle of unanimity for all major decisions, Pakistan has often undermined even the most laudable initiative lest it give India an advantage: relative gains by India are more important for Pakistan than the absolute gains it secures for itself. For India, Pakistan’s use of terror as an instrument of foreign policy has made normal business impossible.

But the world is suddenly being transformed. Not since the influenza pandemic of the Spanish Flu of 1918 has South Asia’s health been more in danger. Laura Spinney’s masterly account of the Spanish Flu reminds us of the memoirs of the great poet, ‘Nirala’, Surya Kant Tripathi, and what a tragedy was inflicted even on ordinary people by the flu.

Nirala wrote : “I travelled to the riverbank in Dalmau and waited…[t]he Ganga was swollen with dead bodies. At my in-laws’ house, I learned that my wife [too] had passed away. This was the strangest time in my life..[m]y family disappeared in the blink of an eye.”

There is no doubt that the impact of COVID-19 will be unprecedented, in terms of those it targets and the way we live. It is too early to judge the consequences , but it will take years for the world to return to the old and familiar. Strategies to cope with this new insidious, scheming and diabolic strain of the coronavirus have to be dynamic and ad hoc. In the United Kingdom the idea of letting low-risk residents being infected by the virus as a way of generating immunity (the herding principle) seems to have been misplaced and disastrous . Containment and the possible prevention of community transmission are the only two principles that are firmly tested. If community transmission occurs and cannot be contained, the consequences will be calamitous. This is indeed a time for SAARC and the experts of the region to think and act together and India can lead this effort.

It is evident that Mr. Modi is an out-of-the box lateral thinker, especially on foreign policy. In 2014, Mr. Modi surprised the world by inviting all the SAARC leaders for his inauguration. In December 2015, he was even more audacious by almost living the dream of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh by spending his morning in Kabul, afternoon in Lahore and evening in Delhi. More important, the tragedy of COVID-19 may provide an opportunity for India to demonstrate its compassionate face to secure a region at peace with itself. India cannot afford to not to harvest this opportunity, after having sowed the seeds of a New South Asia.

Krishna Kumar’s article, “When every line in the book is violated” (Editorial page, March 16), has raised an overwhelming question: on what teachers will have to say to the volley of questions students of Delhi schools might raise following the riots. The children are bound to have been taught to be proud of the pluralism of this great country, the secular values enshrined in the Constitution and the sense of tolerance preached by iconic leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. The shocking images of the destruction, visible and invisible, would have confused the young minds as to what is right and wrong. The fury of the mob with hatred writ large on their faces, the Delhi police watching the mayhem in stoic silence and the ineptitude of the Delhi administration to stop the violence are scenes that would have left indelible impressions on the minds of the children.

The doubts, fears and worries of the children about the ugly incidents have to handled with malice to none. Now is the onerous responsibility of teachers to offer them convincing replies. Let them inculcate once again in these children the greatness of our Constitution that ensures a secular, socialistic, and democratic Republic and, above all, one that values human life. They must have the courage and conviction to tell their students that differences can be sorted out only through dialogue and discourse.

Tackling COVID-19

As there is no specific drug for COVID-19, I do not understand on what basis the Minister of State for Home Affairs, G. Kishan Reddy, said on Sunday that “the government will waive taxes for manufacturers of medicines for COVID–19” (Telangana, “Tax waiver for COVID-19 medicine manufacturers”, March 15). It is all symptomatic management, and about maintaining vital data and preventing complications. Some experts say some combinations of drugs might have a good response but this has not been confirmed. As far as preventive measures are concerned, it is better if the Central and State governments ensure that masks are supplied free to those in high-risk areas and also regulate the prices of masks. The prices of hand sanitisers should also be kept in check.

The pandemic has already besieged the globe with no effective medicine or vaccination in sight as yet. In such a context, when a German company is conducting research to find a vaccine, it is the responsibility of a world power such as the United States to recommend to the WHO, funding for the research being done by the German firm and to work in liaison with Germany to ensure the successful completion of the project. The need of the hour is to contain the spread and stop corona-phobia. It is shocking that the U.S. is acting in an ugly and shameful way by reportedly wanting the vaccine only for the United States (‘World’ page, “Germany trying to stop U.S. from luring away firm preparing vaccine”, March 16). What is at stake here is global welfare.

Dalit uplift

I believe the last part of the article, “Kanshiram’s legacy of Dalit empowerment left adrift” (Editorial page, March 16), on a growing void as far as addressing Dalit issues, is not completely true.

There are pioneers like K.S. Bhagya Rao (Sneha Club), and N. Siddoji Rao (Helpdesk for Underprivileged) who are helping to uplift the backward castes. Bhagya Rao started a news channel, broadcast in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, creating an awareness on SC/ST issues. His NGO (Sneha Club, established in 2001) has motivated over 10,000 SC/ST officials in various government ranks to serve the poor in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, realising the concept of payback to society. I believe there are other such inspirational people trying their best to fill the void.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started stamping the hands of those advised to undergo home quarantine for Covid-19 to prevent them from mingling in public.

As on March 15, 528 persons had been advised self-quarantine. These are people who do not have any symptoms of coronavirus but have recently returned from a foreign country. They are supposed to self-quarantine or home quarantine for 14 days, wherein BMC will monitor their symptoms.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Monday that this decision had been taken to instil a sense of responsibility among them.

Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Monday, “If such people go out, they will be identified as home quarantined. This is being done so that patients strictly follow self-quarantine.”

From Monday onwards, BMC started putting a stamp on the back of their left hands stating, “Proud to protect Mumbaikars. Home quarantined.” The stamp is made of indelible ink similar to the one used to mark voters and the stamp also has a date until which the person is supposed to be quarantined.

BMC has also issued detailed guidelines for those undergoing home quarantine.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xr7yz1/article31089072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mumbai-quarantine-stamp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-mumbai-corporation-begins-stamping-hands-of-those-under-home-quarantine/article31089073.ece

430,2020/03/17,Three-year-old among 6 new COVID-19 cases in Maharashtra,"Her father had travelled to U.S.; State tally up to 39

A three-year-old girl from Kalyan and her 33-year-old mother are among the six new patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 in Maharashtra on Monday, taking the total count in the State to 39.

The child’s father, who had travelled to the U.S., had tested positive earlier. The other patients who tested positive on Monday include two Philippines nationals, aged 47 and 42, who had come to Navi Mumbai, a 44-year-old woman from Mumbai with a travel history to Lisbon in Portugal, and a 51-year-old woman from Yavatmal who was part of the Dubai tour group.

Health officials said the Philippines nationals were part of a group of 10 visitors. “While three (including these two) have tested positive so far, the others have tested negative. They are in isolation,” officials said.

The woman from Yavatmal is the 15th person to have tested positive from the group of 40 people who had travelled to Dubai. While two others from Yavatmal who were part of the group tested positive on March 14, the woman had tested negative even though she was showing symptoms. She is the mother of the IT professional who went to Pune after the trip and has tested positive. “Since she had symptoms, we had kept her in isolation at the hospital. Her repeat test was positive,” said Dr. Milind Kamble, dean of the government medical college in Yavatmal. He said 33 contacts of the positive patients have been advised home isolation and are under watch.

On Monday, 31 people suspected of exposure to the virus remained admitted to various isolation facilities.

432,2020/03/17,Complaint against ISKCON for using gaumutra as sanitiser,"Violation of human right, says Ernakulam Congress leader

A Kochi resident and Congress party office-bearer on Monday lodged a complaint with the police after his hands were sprayed with gaumutra (cow urine) instead of a hand sanitiser by staff manning the gates of ISKCON temple in Juhu.

Raju P. Nair, general secretary, district Congress committee, Ernakulam, in a letter to Mumbai Police Commissioner Parambir Singh, sought filing of a criminal case against the temple authorities. He said the incident took place on Sunday, when he and a friend visited Govinda’s Restaurant in the temple complex. Mr. Nair, who first tweeted about the incident on Sunday night, in his complaint said it was a threat to the public as a whole since it was in violation of the COVID-19 protocol.

“We walked into the compound and the security asked us to go through the check. Eventhough we told them that we are going to the restaurant and not temple, we didn’t object to the frisking. After my friend was frisked and a lotion was sprayed on his hands, I went through the same. I had extended my hands as a responsible person appreciating sanitising the hands in this emergency situation where the pandemic COVID19 is being spread. However, once they sprayed using a normal sprayer commonly used in barber shops and not clinically, I smelled my hands and it had a weird smell,” the complaint said.

Mr. Nair’s complaint says he asked the security if they sprayed cow urine on his hands, and they said it was. “I took objection that they should have told me that it is cow urine and should not have done so without my consent. Even an elderly lady who looked like ISKCON follower also told them they should not have done without consent,” it reads.

Being a Kochi resident, Mr. Nair could not stay back in Mumbai for the proceedings and has authorised advocate Mathew Antony to represent him. “This is a violation of human rights and criminal to spray animal waste on someone. I take strong objection to this since this is against my scientific temper and an attack on my self-respect. This is also a violation of the protocol declared by the government in dealing with the pandemic COVID19 and hence puts normal people’s life at risk and hence I view this as a social issue that affects hundreds of people who visit there,” his complaint said.

Temple council member Sura Das said anyone entering the premises was given soap-based sanitisers. “Ayurveda has shown that gaumutra is of the finest and among the best of sanitisers and we sell it at our store. There are all sorts of people coming to our movement and so we cannot be particular about using it,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/99x16u/article31086326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bmISKCON-gaumutra,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/complaint-against-iskcon-for-using-gaumutra-as-sanitiser/article31086327.ece

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials have started door-to-door visits as a measure to tackle the novel coronavirus pandemic. Officials have visited more than 10,000 housing societies to check for people with any history of foreign travel, anyone with COVID-19 symptoms and also tracking those discharged after showing no symptoms.

The BMC is taking other steps to deal with the outbreak. A doctor has been made part of the disaster management control room round-the-clock to provide telephonic advice, and Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar has also appealed to people not to panic.

This is apart from the screening, testing and quarantine efforts being taken by the civic body.

As part of the community surveillance, 1,067 BMC teams have visited 10,027 housing societies and 254 individual houses. The objective is to look for any patients with travel history or similar symptoms, create awareness about coronavirus, dispel myths and make people aware about precautions.

Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward, said, “This is an awareness-cum-surveillance drive. Our staff speaks to either the society chairperson or individual house owners. They are informed of the symptoms and asked if any resident has them. If there is such a person, we can move them into isolation. We also ask if anyone has travel history, and ask them to home quarantine for 14 days.”

Vinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner of H West ward, said, “For Category C patients — those who have returned from abroad but did not have symptoms — we have to track them even after they test negative to check if they are following all rules of home quarantine. We also have to check if they develop symptoms later. We have to stay in constant touch with them for 21 days.”

Mahesh Narvekar, chief officer of the disaster management control room, said after getting several queries from anxious callers about symptoms, a doctor was added to their team. “The doctor asks them about their symptoms and if needed, advises them to go visit their local physician.”

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on Monday decided to quarantine people arriving from affected countries but show no symptoms of the novel coronavirus.

Dr. Balasaheb Sonawane, NMMC’s chief medical officer, said, “We have identified an NMMC building at Sector 14 in Vashi where we plan to quarantine people. Even infected people don’t show symptoms initially, so it is important that everyone who arrives from an affected country is quarantined.”

So far, three people who have tested positive from Vashi have been placed in the isolation ward at Kasturba Hospital. The trio, including a Filipino, had visited a mosque in Vashi.

“They are not residents of Vashi, but were in the locality from March 4 to 12. After one of them tested positive, the other two visited another mosque in Mumbai. After health officers in Mumbai quarantined them, their tests also turned positive,” Mr. Sonawane said.

Meanwhile, the Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has quarantined 35 asymptomatic people at Gram Vikas Bhavan. Among them are sportspersons who went to Dubai to play a match. “We are transporting them from the airport and getting them screened again at Panvel district hospital. They are then quarantined at Gram Vikas Bhavan,” PCMC commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh said.

Mr. Deshmukh said the staff at Gram Vikas Bhawan, who had fled from the premises in panic on Sunday, returned to work on Monday. “We now have 25 staff members taking care of the people who have been quarantined,” he said.

On Sunday, 16 passengers from Dubai refused to get quarantined and insisted on going home.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started categorising travellers arriving in the city into three groups to ease the process of quarantine and testing for COVID-19.

According to BMC health officer Dr. Daksha Shah people coming from affected countries and showing symptoms like fever, cough and cold are being classified as Category A and sent directly for isolation and testing to Kasturba Hospital. Those with no symptoms but having co-morbid conditions or who are senior citizens are classified as Category B, while those with a travel history but no symptoms are Category C travellers.

At present, Marol’s Seven Hills Hospital, which has been designated a quarantine facility, has 11 Category B patients. Dr. Shah said, “We are admitting Category B patients to the quarantine facility and taking their swabs. The Category C people are screened and home quarantined after necessary counselling.”

She said 24 doctors have been posted in three shifts at the Seven Hills facility to monitor those in quarantine. “We urge those who are advised home quarantine to be responsible and follow the advise thoroughly for their safety as well as that of their loved ones and society,” she said.

Meanwhile, after pictures of unhygienic conditions in the isolation facility at Kasturba Hospital were circulated widely on social media, the BMC appointed a cleaning agency and posted pictures of the spruced up areas. Dr. Shah said similar measures of cleanliness have been taken up at Seven Hills Hospital. “Seven Hills was defunct and we have started it in a span of 12 hours. We are working to improve the facility,” she said.

On Monday, police bandobast was stepped up at Kasturba Hospital as the rush in the COVID-19 outpatient department (OPD) increased. Till evening, the OPD saw more than 300 people queuing up.

BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi later held a meeting with civic officers.

While the officials decided to shut down pubs and clubs situated in mill compounds, no decision was taken on closing restaurants. Public gardens will stay open, but permission has been denied for gatherings such as laughter clubs.

After the meeting, Mr. Thackeray tweeted, “What is most crucial is citizens/ establishments follow the guidelines issued by the Central and State Governments to the fullest. The circumstances demanding, the state will intervene for its implementation. No establishment must take this situation lightly.”

Meanwhile, the BMC has decided to rope in private hotels located near the airport to quarantine foreign travellers. “Thank you Mirage Hotel, Mumbai and ITC hotel, Mumbai for opening up your doors to incoming travels that will be compulsorily isolated for 24 hours on arrival in Mumbai, as requested by BMC, since yesterday,” Mr. Thackeray tweeted.

A BMC official said foreigners tourists without symptoms can choose between being placed in isolation at Seven Hills Hospital or quarantined in hotels at a nominal price. He said, “Seven Hills Hospital has limited capacity and is for people with symptoms to undergo tests.”

The BMC has also decided to provide food from private establishments to patients at Kasturba Hospital.

438,2020/03/17,Mumbaikars turn up for work despite virus fears,"Thousands hop on local trains, buses to reach offices; dabbawalas worried about future with companies asking employees to work from home

Maharashtra recording the highest number of novel coronavirus cases in the country and the State government issuing directives calling for a shut down of all public places did not have a bearing on passenger traffic on local trains as thousands of Mumbaikars hopped on the city’s lifeline to reach their workplaces on Monday.

Sameer Alam, a food vendor at Andheri station, said, “The crowd was a bit less than usual, but we haven’t seen a major difference.” According to the Railway Protection Force personnel deployed across stations, there was little or no difference in passenger traffic during rush hours, but it thinned out in the non-peak hours.

Railway officials said suburban passenger traffic on the Central Railway (CR) and the Western Railway (WR) has witnessed a drop in March. Data accessed from both CR and WR shows a year-on-year decline of 9% in passengers on WR and 11% on CR from March 1 to 15.

Though most colleges and schools in the city remained closed, many offices stayed open. A few offices allowed employees to work from home and only those who had to attend meetings were expected to report for work. “We have been asked to work from home from Tuesday for two weeks, subject to client meetings. We underwent a drill last week to understand how to manage work from home,” Vaibhav Shah, an investment banker with a U.S.-based firm, said.

Many commuters said their nature of work is such that it is not possible for them to work from home. Subiya Siddiqui, a medical representative at a pharmaceutical company, said people with desk jobs have been allowed to work from home. She said, “Our work involves being on the field and that requires us to leave our homes.” Prashant Shinde, who works for a courier company in Saki Naka, said, “My company has not yet issued any directive. But in housing societies we have been asked to hand over packages to security guards.”

Dabbawalas also expressed concern over the future of their livelihood with offices asking employees to work from home. “Our business is entirely dependent on people going to work. If that stops, it will have a direct impact on our livelihood,” Sunil Navare, a dabbawala, said. Mr. Navare, who delivers food in Ghatkopar, Kurla and Bandra Kurla Complex, said he has noticed a 10% decline in orders.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hdtszo/article31086180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMTRAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbaikars-turn-up-for-work-despite-virus-fears/article31086181.ece

The Union Territory on Tuesday reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 with a 68 -year-old woman in the enclave of Mahe testing positive for the virus.

The patient had been under observation at the Government General Hospital, Mahe, since her return from Umrah in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. After her arrival at the Calicut airport on March 13, she reported to Mahe GH for a mandatory check-up. As she was asymptomatic, doctors advised her to be quarantined at home, said a senior doctor at the GH.

On the same day evening, the woman developed uneasiness and was taken to the Government Beach Hospital Calicut. But she returned on her own to GH Mahe, the doctor said.

Throat swab samples were sent to Calicut Medical College and National Institute of Virology, Kerala unit at Alappuzha on the same day for testing.

Two constables attached to the Grand Bazaar Police station and India Reserve Battalion have been dismissed from service after a preliminary inquiry against them revealed their involvement in extortion of money from a couple.

“Since a case has been registered against the duo for their involvement in an offence amounting to moral turpitude in a disciplined force, they were dismissed from service with immediate effect,” Senior Superintendent of Police (Law and Order) Rahul Alwal said in a release on Tuesday.

The constables, Sathish Kumar and Suresh K. have been booked under section 384 (punishment for extortion) read with 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

If they are found guilty of the charges, the constables could be punished with imprisonment of either description of a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both, said a senior officer.

Last week, the Grand Bazaar station assigned the duo to investigate an altercation reported in a guest house on Ambalathadayar Street. The constables, during the inquiry, found an unmarried couple staying in one of the rooms. The constables let them off after taking ₹5000 from them, police said.

The constables reported back to their seniors that there was no altercation in the guest house. When Sub-Inspector R. Mouttoucoumarane inquired about the incident, the extortion incident came to light, the officer said.

446,2020/03/17,IDA representatives meet Narayanasamy,"Panel seeks end to the practice of dual registration for dental clinics

Representatives of the Indian Dental Association (IDA), Puducherry, met Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy seeking an end to the practice of dual registration for dental clinics.

In a memorandum, the IDA sought his intervention in doing away with the norm for establishments having to register with both the health department and the municipality.

The IDA pointed out that several States had already exempted private healthcare facilities, including dental clinics, from obtaining trade licences from corporations/municipalities on the grounds that these facilities were not engaging in a trading activity but were serving the community.

According to the IDA, dental clinics in Puducherry are registered under the Clinical Establishment Act and in addition to paying an annual fee, had also been brought under the Trade Licence Act that required another fee.

Under the existing practice, dental clinics and other healthcare providers such as diagnostic centres, which are registered under the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act, have to obtain a trade licence from the civic agency. This system subjected clinics to inspections by both health and civic authorities apart from them having to shell out substantial amounts for biomedical waste management.

448,2020/03/17,Coordinated efforts are on to contain pandemic: Minister,"₹7.5 crore allocated to Health Department, 400 hospital beds ready

Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao on Monday said the government had launched joint and coordinated efforts with private medical colleges and universities in Puducherry to contain the spread of COVID-19 in the Union Territory.

Talking to newsmen at the end of a review meeting with officials of Health and other line departments here, the Minister said that although there had not been any reports of suspected cases in the Union Territory, the Health department was on high alert.

451,2020/03/17,Muslim wedding sets example in promoting communal harmony,"Prominent leaders of Hindu, Christian faiths join Moulana in solemnising event

In these testing times of rising religious intolerance and sectarianism, a Muslim wedding in the city has set an example in secular praxis by inviting prominent leaders of Hindu and Christian faiths to join the Moulana in the solemnising ceremony.

Liaqhat Ali, the father of the bride, says he wanted to have progressive religious heads from other faiths to partake in his daughter’s marriage to send out a message of communal peace and harmony.

“I thought propagation of the secular idea was important in the extremely divisive times we are going through,” said Mr. Ali.

On Sunday, his second daughter Fahmida Meher, a chartered accountancy student, married Mohammed Tasleem, an aerospace engineer with Siemens in Andhra Pradesh.

On the dais with Moulana Kanchi Abdur Rauf Baqavi, scholar, who solemnised the wedding, were Sivagnana Balaya Swamigal, the 20th Guru Maha Sannidanam of Mailom Pommapuram Adhinam and Pichaimuthu Adigal, Parish, St. Lourdes Lady Church, Villianur.

“I believe that marriages, which are attended by people of different faiths, provide an ideal platform to spread messages of communal harmony,” said Mr. Ali, who chose leaders who were known for their progressive world view.

Mr. Ali, who works as general secretary at the Anjuman Nusrathul Islam Public Library in Kottakuppam — a treasurehouse of rare Islamic literature — feels that many people these days are less nuanced in their evaluation of a person. It is blind like or dislike.

No opposition

On whether there was any resistance from within the community to his idea for his daughter’s wedding, Mr. Ali says that his own reputation for holding progressive views might have something to do with the lack of opposition. “It could be either of these...people may have given up on shackling me to orthodoxy as they think I am irredeemable or it could be that my fellowbeings, at least a few of them, have actually undergone a change in mindset,” said Mr. Ali, who has also authored a book based on comparative studies on religions and is an active presence on the social media.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/67ozhu/article31085905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17PONDYWEDDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/muslim-wedding-sets-example-in-promoting-communal-harmony/article31085906.ece
452,2020/03/17,Bijal Vachharajani’s award-winning book is about children who want to change the world,"Making of a climate champion

Bijal Vachharajani’s novel for children, A Cloud Called Bhura, weaves a familiar tale of children turning into ‘climate champions’ to rid their city of a huge brown cloud of pollutants and noxious gases, as community togetherness and friendship are put to the test. Published by Talking Cub and illustrated by Aindri C., the 243-page book that released late last year is both a humorous and thought-provoking read, and a great way to get young ones familiar with what climate change is all about. Vachharajani won the Best Author – Children Award at the Auther Awards 2020.

Weaving a tale

The germ for this story of “Bhura Cloudus,” (as the big brown enemy is termed by the media persons in the book) originated when Vachharajani was studying climate in Costa Rica for a year during her masters, where she learnt about the brown cloud phenomena. “I was fascinated by the fact that we were seeing something so tangible, and yet there was very little political build or media reportage about it,” she explains. Learning about environmental issues made Vachharajani realise that climate change is defined less by the science behind it and more by what people think of it, so she wanted to explore these different perspectives and tie them together in some way.

And so the story of Amni and her three friends, Tammy, Andrew and Mithil came into being, that follows the four mates in their struggle to get help, and political and public attention onto Bhura, trying to find ways to eliminate it from their beloved city of Mumbai. The city – where she grew up – was one of the main inspirations for her book, the other being the children that Vachharajani has met over the years. “I’ve worked at Sanctuary Asia, TimeOut, with Disney Adventures– and even now at Pratham Books, I’m constantly interacting with children. They are amazing in what they do. You talk to kids and they ask questions like ‘How can we change the world?’ and ‘What can we do to help?’” says the Bengaluru-based writer, who is senior editor at Pratham Books.

Cast of characters

Does Vachharajani see herself in Amni, who always stands for what is right no matter what the consequences? “I think Amni is way smarter than I am, any day! She is a little bit me, though. As a child, my head was filled with trivia but like Amni, I could never really say it. When I go to classrooms, I find that there are children like her who are intelligent, but are also awkward and shy. They aren’t always comfortable raising their hands and answering questions. I wanted Amni to be like that. As one of my friends has said, she’s a little too good!”

Featuring other characters that Indian children would be familiar with, from Mota Bhai the cunning politician to Vaatodiyo Bahuche the screaming TV anchor, and even focusing on caste issues and giving readers glimpses of the Ambedkarite movement, A Cloud Called Bhura is equal parts informative and entertaining. Explains the author, “When I first started writing the book, the main protagonist was Amni. But as I read more, and had discussions with my late partner Abhiyan, I realised that for a lot of environmental issues, inequality is perhaps one of our biggest dividers. It’s a big reason for vulnerability. It was through conversations with Abhiyan on the Ambedkarite movement, and by meeting people who are invested in it, that I realised that it’s something that children really should know about and it should be talked about.”

Starting small

Vachharajani, whose next book (co-authored by Radha Rangarajan) is a series of interviews with environmentalists and wildlife activists from India, hopes that Amni and Tammy’s story urges both kids and adults alike to continue the conversation around the topics in her novel and give them some steam.

How can kids become ‘climate champions’ like Amni and her classmates? Vachharajani suggests that they can start in small ways, by changing their habits and attitudes towards the environment and educating their families on the topic too, and then slowly graduate to participating in larger initiatives like Fridays for Future (environmental activist Greta Thunberg’s brainchild that involves skipping school to demonstrate against global warming and climate change). “Knowledge is power. Children of today have so much more access to information than we did growing up. Just learning about the topic, being able to have informed discussions in classrooms, demanding a better environmental education curriculum – just give them a little nudge and children will run with it,” emphasises Vachharajani.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/books/if4k4t/article31092098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/A-Cloud-Called-BhuraFront-Cover,https://www.thehindu.com/children/making-of-a-climate-champion/article31092100.ece
453,2020/03/17,Ample options,"Countless choices of words to make your sentences sound impressive...

What are ‘good’ and ‘fine?’

They are synonyms. Words that have similar meanings are called synonyms. However, they need not necessarily share the exact meaning, but can be nearly the same.

For example, the synonyms for ‘good’ would be ‘fine,’ ‘okay,’ ‘all right,’ ‘perfect,’ ‘so-so,’ ‘not bad’, and so on.

When do you need to use a synonym? You need a synonym when you are not happy with the word you already have. For example, you are writing an invitation to a party and you want to mention that there is parking space available. You have already written a line that reads ‘There is a big parking space.’

But you are not happy with the word ‘big’. You want to use another word instead of ‘big.’ So, you look for a synonym.

Some synonyms are large, huge, gigantic, expansive, great and ample.

Ah yes, ample! That would be a nice word to use. Now your line sounds much better.

But, where will you find synonyms when you can’t find them by just racking your brain?

We’ll talk about that next time.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/ample-options/article31088976.ece
454,2020/03/17,e-vehicles on hire for govt. departments,"Dry or Wet lease vehicles from EESL gets the nod

Giving a push to e-mobility in the State and to curb spending on vehicle use, the State government has directed all departments to hire electric vehicles from April 1 instead of purchasing new vehicles.

The government departments could hire the electric vehicles only from the Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), a Central government institution under Ministry of Power, through Agency for Non -Conventional Energy and Rural Technology (ANERT).

The heads of all departments had been asked to opt for electric vehicles by replacing the already hired fossil fuel vehicle from April 1 in view of the cost savings to exchequer, official sources said. EESL is a joint venture of the NTPC Limited, the Power Finance Corporation, the Rural Electrification Corporation and the POWERGRID to facilitate implementation of energy efficiency projects.

The EESL has suggested three schemes through director of ANERT for the introduction and gradual transformation towards electric vehicles. The Additional Chief Secretary, Finance, while issuing the formal orders for the government, has avoided outright purchase of e-cars from EESL by payment of upfront cost. Instead, the government has opted for the dry lease (car without chauffeurs) and wet lease (cars with chauffeurs) suggested by the EESL.

The initiative is part of the announcement made in the 2020-21 budget by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac and also the government’s Electric Vehicle Policy (EVP) aimed to foster green mobility, check the spiralling increase in vehicle population in the road corridors, solve present and future mobility issues, and bring down the mounting number of road accidents.

On hiring electric vehicles by the departments and agencies, the government has estimated that up to ₹7.5 crore per 1,000 vehicles can be saved, besides the positive externalities generated in the form of lower pollution and other environmental benefits.

The government has already set an ambitious target of putting one million EVs on the road by 2022. A ‘pilot fleet’ of 2,00,000 two-wheelers, 50,000 three-wheelers, 1,000 goods carriers, 3,000 buses and 100 ferry boats will begin to ply by 2020.

The government has asked the departmental heads to arrange an ‘initial hiring phase of six months’ from April 1, 2020, after which an evaluation can be made on cost savings.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/e-vehicles-on-hire-for-govt-departments/article31091057.ece
455,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | SCTIMST goes into damage-control mode,"Patient care grinds to a near-halt following infection threat

The Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST), where patient care was nearly grounded to a halt after doctors and other health-care personnel were exposed to COVID-19 from one of the doctors working in the institute, quickly went into a damage-control mode on Monday to assuage the fear and anxiety the developments had caused amongst staff and patients.

Several senior doctors, including the heads of crucial departments, had gone into self-quarantine in their homes on Sunday itself, creating an unprecedented crisis in the institution that does innumerable life-saving cardiology and neurology procedures through the year.

OP section

With a total of 76 hospital employees, including 43 doctors, 18 nurses, 13 medical technicians, and two administrative staff (identified as primary contacts) asked to self-isolate in homes, the outpatient division did not function and all surgeries except emergencies had to be postponed.

A number of patients who had turned up at the SCTIMST in the OP division were turned away.

As of now, OP care and surgeries, except emergencies, at the SCTIMST remain suspended for two weeks. Sources said the entire department of Neuro Anaesthesia had been shut down, as all team members had been quarantined.

Panic

The fact that they had been inadvertently exposed to the virus seemed to have triggered some panic in the institution, and apart from those who were asked to go on home quarantine, a lot of residents who complained of uneasiness were also asked to stay at home to set their minds at rest.

The entire hospital is being disinfected and fumigated. An official release issued by the District Collector said that efforts were on to trace the co-passengers of the doctor on flight QR 506 from Doha so that their risk assessment could be done.

Helpline

The public health wing of the SCTIMST, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies, has stepped in to set up a Public Health Cell at the institute.

A helpline for employees has been set up now.

It has also been decided that a questionnaire on the health status of employees would be issued every two days so that anyone with any health issues could be advised appropriately.

Hope for normalcy

While the damage-control measures had been adopted, some senior doctors said that they were beset by a sense of insecurity and that many were beginning to feel socially ostracised in their neighbourhood and in the community.

“It is a sad and unfortunate incident. We are trying to put this behind and limp back to normalcy,” a doctor said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bzblo0/article31005321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BMCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/sctimst-goes-into-damage-control-mode/article31088259.ece
456,2020/03/17,Focus on land acquisition for NH 66 widening again,"3A notification for Kazhakuttam-Kadampattukonam stretch

The much-delayed four/six-laning of the National Highway 66 stretch from Talapady in Kasaragod to Kazhakuttam in Thiruvananthapuram is in the limelight again with the issue of 3A notification under the National Highway Act of 1956 for the last stretch from Kazhakutam to Kadampattukonam.

The 3A notification has been published for the 30-km corridor that comes under the 172.8-km Cherthala-Kazhakuttam corridor of the NH 66 that is to be developed with a 45-metre right of way (ROW).

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) needs 93.418 hectares in the Kazhakuttam-Kadampattukonam stretch and this comes under the taluks of Chirayinkeezhu, Varkala and Thiruvananthapuram. Landowners have been given 21 days to raise objections, if any, to the Competent Authority, Land Acquisition, NH.

Boundary stones

A top NHAI official told The Hindu that boundary stones have been placed in most of the places to be acquired. After 21 days and inquiry under 3C, the 3D notification under the NH Act would be issued. The 3(D) notification is issued when the entire details of land to be acquired such as area, name of landowners, etc., are published after completing the survey. The next stage of land acquisition, 3(G), would be to award compensation to the landowners.

The compensation for those surrendering land would be as per the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013. The NHAI, the executing agency, has set December 2020 as the deadline for completing the NH 66 four/six-lane works.

Kerala has already given ₹330 crore to the NHAI as the first tranche of the 25% cost of the remaining land to be acquired for six-laning of 526 km of NH 66 as demanded by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH). The State’s share is being provided by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) tasked to make available ₹5,200 crore, 25% cost of the remaining land to be acquired in the State. The funds will be made available from the ₹14,000 crore earmarked by KIIFB for land acquisition for development projects.

The draft Detailed Project Report is being worked out by the consultant for the NHAI. The work would be tendered once the land was acquired and handed over, an NHAI official said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/focus-on-land-acquisition-for-nh-66-widening-again/article31085831.ece
457,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | An SOS call from four Indians stranded on Iran's Kish island,"Four Indians stranded in the remote area after COVID-19 reports stalled life

For the past two weeks, Johnson Ouseph from Alappuzha and three of his friends from Kerala have been huddled inside the staff quarters of Tubestar oil and gas services in Kish island in Iran.

They were relentlessly contacting the Indian embassy in Tehran to find a way back home. With the Kish International Airport closed down, and reports of COVID-19 in the island leading to some of the shops also being closed, the four of them are scared of being stranded in the island for a longer period.

Speaking to The Hindu over phone from Kish island, Mr. Ouseph said at least 500 Indians were employed in various companies in the small island, spread over an area of 91.5 square kilometre and located more than 1,000 kilometres away from Tehran.

“The airport here was closed down on February 27. Ferries have also been shut. Since March 1, we have been staying indoors and not been going to work, as COVID-19 cases have been reported. We have been in touch with the Indian Embassy in Tehran regularly. Initially, they told us that a medical team will come to Kish to carry out COVID-19 tests and take us from here, or they will make arrangements for us to go to Tehran. Last night, we got tensed, as shops were closing here due to the virus scare and contacted them again.

They told us that it is better to contact their consultant in Bandar Abbas, as that is our province. The consultant told us today morning that they are helpless as of now,” says Mr. Ouseph, hailing from Alappuzha.

When they contacted NoRKA Roots, the officials there also communicated their plight to the Indian embassy.

The four of them had also got in touch with 21 other Keralites who are working at a shopping mall here.

“Since this is a small island, which is cut off from outside, there is always the fear that once the virus spreads, it would be too hard to control it. We do not have much of an idea about the news from outside. We do have enough stock of food, but if the shops remain closed, we could face a crisis. The visas of two among us are also set to expire soon,” says Sachin T. Sabu from Kollam.

A NoRKA official told The Hindu that the Indian embassy had taken up the issue as a separate case along with that of the 400 others stranded there.

Last week, India had evacuated 58 of its nationals from Tehran in a C-17 Globemaster aircraft of the Indian Air Force (IAF).

458,2020/03/17,"Put off surveys in some areas, NSO staff told","Several surveys being held in State

The State unit of the National Statistical Organisation (NSO) has asked its field staff to put off sample surveys in certain areas of the State in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The surveys have been progressing in the State amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

The NSO (Field Operations Division), Kerala and Lakshadweep, has also written to New Delhi regarding the situation.

So far, the NSO headquarters has not come out with instructions on whether to postpone the surveys altogether or not.

Oral instructions

“We have given oral instructions to our field staff to postpone collection of samples in affected places such as Ranni and its neighbourhood, for instance. We have asked them to concentrate on other areas for the time being. We have communicated to our headquarters regarding the situation,” N.N. Reji, Deputy Director, NSO Kerala, said.

The NSO is conducting a number of surveys in the State including the periodic labour force survey, the seventh Economic Survey, the 78th round of Socio-Economic Survey focusing on domestic tourism expenditure and multiple indicators, and the Annual Survey on Unincorporated Sector Enterprises.

Non-cooperation

As it is, the NSO surveys have been faced with non-cooperation from the public in parts of the State due to the fear that they were linked to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

In February, Sunitha Bhaskar, Deputy Director General, Field Operations Division, NSO (Kerala and Lakshadweep), had issued an appeal to the public to cooperate with the NSO sample surveys.

She had pointed out that the NSO sample surveys were unrelated to the population census or the National Population Register (NPR) and there was nothing to be wary of.

A change in the attitude towards foreign tourists is needed in the wake of the reporting of the COVID-19 cases in the State, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran has said.

“The foreign tourists are our guests. They are not here to spread the virus and such attitude and whispering by the locals should be avoided,” the Minister said.

Review

The Minister issued a directive to post more health workers in the CHC and to take steps to clean and sanitise SR Hospital, Varkala, for keeping the persons quarantined. The elected representatives were asked to take steps for surveillance, as Varkala attracts lot of holidayers. Food and other facilities should be made available to those being isolated in the houses.

This year's Copa America has been postponed until 2021 due to fears over the spread of the coronavirus, the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) said on Tuesday.

The 12-team tournament, which had originally been scheduled to take place from June 12 to July 12 in Colombia and Argentina, follows the Euro 2020 championship in being pushed back by a year with global sport being brought to a virtual standstill by the coronavirus outbreak.

“This is an extraordinary measure for an unexpected situation and responds to the fundamental need to avoid the exponential evolution of the virus,” said CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dominguez.

Dominguez said the rescheduled tournament would be played between June 11 and July 11, 2021.

“It wasn't easy to take this decision but we must safeguard at all times the health of our players and all those who form part of the big South American football family. Have no doubts that the oldest international tournament in the world will be back stronger than ever in 2021.”

The Copa America is one of the biggest draws on the football calendar, with players such as Lionel Messi, Neymar, Sergio Aguero, Luis Suarez, and James Rodriguez all expected to take part.

The Euro 2020 finals, which was due to take place over the same dates across 12 countries in Europe, was also postponed for a year.

This years Copa was due to be held in two countries for the first time in its 104-year history, with a northern group set for Colombia and a southern group due to be played in Argentina.

In addition to the 10 South American nations, Australia and Qatar were also invited.

The northern group comprised Colombia, Brazil, Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Qatar. The southern group featured Argentina, Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile and Australia.

The tournament was scheduled to kick off in Buenos Aires on June 12, with the final in Barranquilla, Colombia on July 12.

The 2020 edition was set to be the fourth in six years but the haphazard organisation that saw it played so frequently was about to end as CONMEBOL try to bring it into line with the European Championship.

This year’s tournament was supposed to be the last until 2024 as it becomes a regular quadrennial event.

463,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | UEFA postpones Euro 2020 by a year,"UEFA said the new proposed dates for the tournament were June 11 to July 11 next year, as Euro 2020 becomes Euro 2021.

The European championship, due to be played in June and July this year, has been postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, European football's governing body UEFA said on Tuesday.

Also read: Copa America postponed to 2021, says CONMEBOL

UEFA said the new proposed dates for the tournament were June 11 to July 11 next year, as Euro 2020 becomes Euro 2021.

It said the postponement would ""will help all domestic competitions, currently on hold due to the COVID-19 emergency, to be completed"".

The announcement comes after UEFA held crisis talks with its national associations as well as clubs and players bodies via videoconference, as the continent fights to deal with the health crisis.

""The health of all those involved in the game is the priority, as well as to avoid placing any unnecessary pressure on national public services involved in staging matches,"" UEFA said in a statement.

Most of Europe's domestic leagues have ground to a halt over the last week as football confronts its biggest issue in modern times.

Europe has become the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, with France on Tuesday joining Italy and Spain in applying strict lockdown measures and European leaders also planning to ban all non-essential travel into the continent.

More than 2,100 people have died in Italy, which was supposed to host the opening game of Euro 2020 in Rome.

The UEFA Champions League and Europa League competitions for clubs have been suspended, with both still in the last-16 stage, but postponing the European Championship means they, along with national leagues, will have the chance to be completed, assuming travel restrictions are lifted in time.

- 'Full support' for changes -UEFA has set up a working group involving leagues and clubs which will try to come up with a new match calendar to allow for the season to be completed.

Twenty of the 24 nations set to take part in the Euro have already qualified, but play-offs to determine the final four participants, due to be played this month, have been postponed.

UEFA said those matches, and other scheduled friendlies, would now be played in June ""subject to a review of the situation.""

South America's equivalent of the Euro, the Copa America, also scheduled for this June and July, has also been postponed by a year, ensuring European-based players will be free to finish the season with their clubs.

The move was welcomed by national associations in countries currently battling the pandemic.

""People's health and well-being has to be the primary concern for us all, so we fully support UEFA's decision to postpone EURO 2020,"" said the English FA's CEO, Mark Bullingham.

Meanwhile, French Football Federation (FFF) president Noel Le Graet gave the postponement his ""full support"", calling it a ""wise and pragmatic decision"".

- Knock-on effects -Euro 2020 was due to be held in 12 countries. There is no suggestion the format or number of venues will change.

The semi-finals and final are supposed to be played in London and there will be considerable knock-on effects from the postponement -- the women's European Championship is scheduled to run from July 7 to August 1 next year in England, with the final at Wembley.

UEFA also planned to stage an Under-21 Euro in Hungary and Slovenia in June next year.

Moving the Euro by a year also puts UEFA on a collision course with football's world governing body FIFA, whose president Gianni Infantino has planned to stage the inaugural edition of his highly lucrative Club World Cup in June and July next year in China.

However, Infantino indicated in an open letter on Monday that FIFA will ""look to find in due course solutions in a spirit of cooperation, taking into account the interests of football at all levels"".

UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin thanked Infantino for his intervention and for saying FIFA will do ""whatever is required to make this new calendar work"".

""In the face of this crisis, football has shown its best side with openness, solidarity and tolerance,"" Ceferin said.

As for its club competitions, UEFA could still come to a decision to try to complete the Champions League and Europa League by curtailing the competitions, meaning ties up to the semi-finals could be decided in one-off matches.

Reports on Tuesday indicated both tournaments could conclude with a 'Final Four' meeting in the scheduled host cities -- Istanbul for the Champions League and Gdansk in Poland for the Europa League.

The Union Sports Ministry on Monday sanctioned an amount of ₹4 lakh to ailing sports commentator Novy Kapadia to meet his medical expenses.

It had came to notice of the Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju that Kapadia had not been receiving his pension from Delhi University, where he taught for 40 years.

Speaking about the one-time financial assistance, Rijiju said, “Novy Kapadia has contributed to Indian sports for decades.

“When I got to know that his pension from Delhi University is pending and he is suffering from a rare autoimmune disease and needs urgent medical attention, we decided to give him immediate relief with this money.

“We are also following up with the Ministry of Human Resource Development to ensure that his pension comes through soon.”

Kapadia has been given the financial assistance from the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay National Welfare Fund for Sportspersons.

“The earlier guidelines of the fund to provide financial assistance were rather restrictive.

“We have now made amendments so that assistance can be extended to more people who have served in the area of sport. Mr. Kapadia is one of the first beneficiaries of the new guidelines,” added the Sports Minister.

466,2020/03/17,Kallikudi market turns into quarantine zone,"The State government has begun the work of converting the Integrated Market for Vegetables, Fruits and Flours at Kallikudi, which has been unused for more than two years, into an isolation area for quarantining passengers from listed countries landing at Tiruchi airport.

The market, constructed at an estimate of ₹77 crore with the financial support of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), was originally meant for shifting the wholesale traders of Gandhi Market in the city. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami inaugurated the market in September 2017.

But, it still remains unused as the traders refused to move to the new market, citing long distance from the city.

The market, which has 830 shops with lift and spacious parking facilities, has come in handy for the State government to quarantine the passengers landing at Tiruchi airport from those countries that are badly hit by COVID 19.

After inspecting the market along with the officials of the Public Health and Family Welfare and Rural Development, Tiruchi Collector S. Sivarasu has sent a note to the Agricultural Marketing Committee, which controls the Kallikudi market, asking its approval for converting it into an isolation area.

Confirming the development, a senior official told The Hindu that the facility at Kallikudi was found to be ideal to quarantine the passengers from listed countries.

Since it was located very close to the Tiruchi airport, the passengers, suspected with COVID-19 virus, could be transported to the isolation area. They could be given proper medical support.

Preliminary steps for converting the market complex into an isolation area have already been initiated, the official added. The entire facility has been cleaned up.

Five checkposts guarded by police personnel have been established by Nagapattinam administration at the district borders to maintain round-the-clock surveillance to check spread of novel coronavirus.

District Collector Praveen P. Nair chaired a meeting of senior officials and said medical teams will screen visitors to the district all through the day.

Thermal screening devices have been provided to the medical teams to determine if the visitors to the district have been afflicted by the virus. Those with signs of the ailment will be immediately shifted to the hospital, he said.

Self-quarantine for those who had visited other countries was being monitored, the Collector said, seeking to explain that mere cough and running nose cannot be construed as symptoms of coronavirus.

But, if cough, running nose and fever persists along with breathing difficulty, the affected people must approach the Government Medical College and Hospital at neighbouring Tiruvarur district where arrangements for quarantining such patients are in place, he said.

Isolation wards have also been created in the government hospitals at Nagapattinam, Vedaranyam, Sirkazhi and Mayiladuthurai, and manned by experienced medical and para-medical staff.

Additional checkposts will function round-the-clock at Velankanni and Nagore Dargah. At Tirukkadaiyur and Vaideeswarankovil, checkposts will be functional from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.

Instructions have been issued to government departments and private organisations for creating awareness on wearing masks and using hand sanitisers for precaution.

Sticking to self-hygiene alone will help in containing the ailment in locations of public confluence, he said, adding that awareness will be created among travelling public by staff of local bodies at bus stands and railway stations.

Information about those indulging in profiteering through sale of masks and those spreading false rumours could be brought to the notice of the district administration through the tollfree number 1077, he said.

Karaikal

Licensees of arrack, toddy and liquor shops in Karaikal district have been instructed by the Deputy Commissioner (Excise) to thoroughly disinfect retail counters, bar areas, tables, chairs, and any surface in the premises thrice daily with freshly-prepared sodium hypochloride solution or any commercially available detergent of good quality.

The order issued by M. Adharsh, Deputy Commissioner (Excise), said glasses, tumblers and canteen areas must be cleaned with cleaning agents, and that arrangements must be made for washing of hands with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizers.

The licensees are also required to clean and sanitise toilet facilities, and desist from permitting overcrowding of the premises or retail counters.

Any violation of this direction will lead to immediate cancellation of licence without any notice. Violation will also invite action under section 188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860, the order said.

The section entails punishment of the offender with simple imprisonment for one month or fine up to ₹200 or both.

469,2020/03/17,COVID-19 fear: hotel industry bears the brunt,"Meetings and conferences planned at hotels have been put off

The COVID-19 virus scare has directly impacted the hotel industry in Tiruchi with bookings declining drastically. Several hotels are witnessing a flurry of cancellations and the downtrend has been increasingly noticed over the past one week at many hotels in Tiruchi and in the temple town Srirangam, according to the hospitality industry circles here.

The drop in room bookings ranges from 25% to more than 50% since travellers are scared of venturing out to other destinations. The cancellation of several incoming international flights to Tiruchi from Colombo and Kuala Lumpur has restricted movement of foreign nationals to the rock city housing famous temples.

With government advising people to keep away from mass gatherings, there is a lot of uncertainty prompting tourists to cancel and defer their travel plans for the time being, say industry sources. Private meetings and conferences that were to be organised in hotels have also been cancelled impacting business further.

The COVID-19 impact began to be felt from March first week onwards as a result of which bookings have dropped significantly with many cancellations also happening, says C. Murali Krishnan, Executive Director, Sangam Hotels, Tiruchi.

“People are hesitant to travel owing to COVID-19 scare. Coupled with this is the travel restrictions which has hit hard the hotel industry”, says Mr. Murali Krishnan.

Echoing the same view, another senior executive of a leading hotel in Tiruchi says the bookings have come down drastically.

The impact has been felt more acutely in the last three days as travellers are fearful to venture out.

The bookings have nosedived by nearly 50%, says a senior official of yet another prominent hotel near the Central bus stand adding that the drop began to be felt from March 10th onwards.

Bulk cancellations

The downfall in occupancy percentage has been nearly 60% which has been noticed over the last two days, says a senior executive of SRM Hotel, Tiruchi.

The group bookings made by domestic and international tourists a couple months in advance have been cancelled.

The hotel which is in close proximity with the Tiruchi international airport has shut its bar, banquet, swimming pool and gymnasium. All business meetings have been cancelled, the executive said adding that this was unprecedented scenario for the industry.

Murugesh Narayanan, General Manager of Vignesh Residency, functioning at Srirangam which is otherwise abuzz with movement of devotees all through the day, laments the loss of business caused by bulk cancellations.

“The bookings have come down by 30 to 40% impacting our business”, adds Mr. Murugesh Narayanan.

A front office manager of another prominent hotel at Srirangam says that Non-Resident Indian group bookings at the hotel used to be good until recently.

But, the situation has completely changed now and group bookings have come down sharply due to COVID-19 scare.

Cancellation of overseas flights at Tiruchi airport has added to it, he said.

The hospitality industry circles apprehend that the current situation could continue till this month-end. “We hope that things will settle down soon”, says Mr. Murali Krishnan.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/395lpb/article31091574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY18HOTELTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/covid-19-fear-hotel-industry-bears-the-brunt/article31091575.ece

473,2020/03/17,Battle of the mothers,"Author Kunal Basu dwells on his book ‘Sarojini’s Mother’, in which the protagonist’s search for her biological mother is also a psychological quest

In Kunal Basu’s novel Sarojini’s Mother (Penguin; ₹599), Sarojini-Saz-Campbell travels from the UK to Kolkata in search of her biological mother, and takes the help of Chiru Sen, a musician who models himself on Elvis Presley. Two contenders claim to be Sarojini’s mother — Jamuna, a housemaid, and Urvashi, who lives a life of luxury. Traversing Kolkata, Sarojini tries to make sense of the battle between the mothers.

Edited excerpts of an interview with the author:

Did Sarojini’s Mother emerge as an offshoot of you meeting travellers to India in search of their parents?

While flying to the U.S. from India for my graduates studies a few decades back, I’d seen rows of infants chaperoned by a nurse in the economy cabin. They were orphans I was told, adopted from India by foreign parents, travelling to their new homes. The crying babies kept the plane awake, and made me wonder about the enormity of such a passage. Perhaps they’d return some day like sea turtles, swimming back across oceans to their motherland, I thought. But would the continents have shifted by then, offering mere shipwrecks instead of sandcastles? The fleeting thought had stayed with me, and grew bit by bit as I confronted the dementia that plagued my mother in her final years. The idea of motherhood consumed me… the complexities of the relationship between mother and child, and the role of memory in shaping that bond. What if I were an adopted orphan, returning home to search for my mother? What would I be searching for, within and without? Sarojini’s Mother was born out of such musings.

How would you define a complex character like Sarojini?

Sarojini – Saz – Campbell is a normal young lady in many ways — bright student, who’s understandably rebellious against her hippy adoptive mother. Like other adoptees, she’s keen to find the missing piece in the jigsaw of her life, but there is a deeper wound that she seeks to heal. Her journey to Kolkata is thus a journey into her soul.

What went into the making of Chiru Sen, the Elvis Presley lookalike musician in Kolkata?

Since the 60s, Kolkata has been the epicentre of Western popular music in India. Bars and nightclubs like Trincas and the Blue Fox were melting points frequented not only by the affluent but the middle-class. The culture of hippies and flower children in the West found eager footprints, and it was fairly common to find local versions of the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and other rock stars. Elvis, in this novel, is someone whose body lives in Kolkata, while his heart and soul inhabits the world of his idol Elvis Presley. He belongs here, and yet he doesn’t. Music transports him to an altered reality, which makes him ideally suited to enter the minds of foreign visitors. Just as Sarojini is an outsider-insider, Elvis is the insider-outsider.

Did you revisit certain areas of Kolkata for this story, like the planetarium?

I’d like to think of myself as a thoroughbred Kolkatan, but I wished to see the city through fresh eyes in writing this novel. This included taking a slow ride on the number 36 tram on a blisteringly hot afternoon, revisiting the Egyptian mummy at the Indian Museum, enticing a friend for an invitation to tea at the classy Bengal Club, spending a watchful hour at the sleazy Ghalib bar, and of course, closeting myself with an army of lovers at the Planetarium. I wished Kolkata to burst through the cracks of the novel and add flavour, but never to drown out the story.

Is the search itself a journey of self-discovery for Sarojini than its result?

My novels, somehow or the other, turn out to be tales of search. The passion that fuels such — be it the quest to cure syphilis as in The Yellow Emperor’s Cure, or solving the scientific riddle of racial difference as in Racists — perhaps illuminates what I consider worthiest of all human endeavours — the intense drive to understand our world as well as ourselves. The narratives that I fashion bring these two to an apex. There is indeed a practical angle to Sarojini’s search — the tangibility of finding her biological mother — but also a deep psychological quest, which could teach her how best to live a life despite the trauma of loss.

The women in the story — Sarojini, Jamuna, Urvasi and Elvis's mother — are well defined and have their own little quirks. Are they drawn from women you've observed?

Writing women constitute a key excitement for me. Not only are women multi-layered in personality, but also belie routine expectations. There are nuances to explore and distinctive quirks that illuminate character. Raised by a novelist mother (Chabi Basu), I was subconsciously trained to hone into tone and inflections, gestures and subtle psychological interplays, which have informed my writing. I don’t model my characters directly to resemble people I’ve known, but perhaps they take the circuitous root of filtering through memory to infect my pen.

How long did the book take, from conception to completion?

Conception started much earlier than the act of execution. Even while I was busy writing my previous novel (in Bengali), Sarojini kept visiting me and made a strong case to be written. I had postponed this story for future action, but she jumped the queue and invaded my desk. Once I started, it took about eight months to write the first draft. I wrote two more versions that stretched the whole process to about 16 months. I am a compulsive revisionist, and find much solace in what John Irving said about writing … “Half of my life is an act of revision.”",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/v07bzo/article31090278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kunal-Basu,https://www.thehindu.com/books/author-kunal-basu-dwells-on-his-book-sarojinis-mother-in-which-the-protagonists-search-for-her-biological-mother-is-also-a-psychological-quest/article31090282.ece
474,2020/03/17,Coimbatore District Cricket Association gears up to host the upcoming TNPL,"There will be more matches in the city promises Coimbatore District Cricket Association’s president D Lakshminarayanaswamy as the city gears up to host the upcoming season of TNPL

“Coimbatore is starved of quality entertainment in sports,” says D. Lakshminarayanaswamy, Managing Trustee of SNR Sons Charitable Trust. We are at the newly inaugurated turf wicket cricket grounds of Coimbatore District Cricket Association at Sri Ramakrishna College of Arts and Sciences.

The facility, approved by the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association and the BCCI, will host the upcoming edition of the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL) matches, a first for Coimbatore. The ground has five centre wickets and a 73-metre boundary line as per international standards. The ground with G2 Bermuda grass is maintained with treated water from the institutions. “It needs a lot of watering. We wanted to ensure that we don’t use up the ground water, not even a drop of it,” he says.

There is a pavilion for the teams, rooms for umpires, third umpires, match referees, and other officials. A temporary pavilion for nearly 10, 000 spectators is coming up. Work is progressing at a good pace to ready the ground in time for the TNPL.

The Tamil Nadu Cricket Association is keen to develop cricket outside Chennai, says Lakshminarayanaswamy adding that the TNPL inauguration ceremony will be held here. The first seven matches are scheduled to be played here. The flood lights, camera stands, and so on are getting ready. “We have prepared sporting wickets and three board matches have already been played here,” he says. There was rain during one of the matches and to the relief of the organisers, the water completely drained out as the rainwater harvesting systems are in place.

The matches were held after the BCCI cleared the ground as being suitable. A little away is the nets complex with six turf wickets. “This will ensure that even while a match is going on, other teams can have their practice sessions. The complex is used by over 50 youngsters every day for training. The space is also used for selections of district teams (from under-14 to senior categories).”

Former Indian wicket keeper, Kiran More has given a positive feedback to the facility. He was here recently to select teams for Gulf Oil. “Kiran More selected 15 members from a crowd of 600. After the selection, he commented that it is one of the finest facilities he has seen in the country,” he says.

More on CDCA Coimbatore District Cricket Association (CDCA) was founded in 1958 by G. K. Sundaram and R. Krishnaswamy. It has seen tremendous transformation over the years. It is one of the district associations in the State to hold league matches from June to March

Recalling his 25-year association with CDCA, Lakshminarayanaswamy says top players like Sachin Tendulkar , Kapil Dev, Manoj Prabhakar and Srikanth have played zonal matches in Coimbatore in the 90s. “ Now, they are eager to come and have a look at our facility.”

Every year, CDCA conducts camps, league matches and as many as 10 tournaments for all age categories. They have exclusive tournaments in which over 40 schools participate. They also provide coaching support

CDCA conducts six division league matches. There are 10 teams in each division which makes it 60 clubs. Over 3000 people are actively playing the sport in the district. To know more, call: 63809-43877 or e-mail: cricketcdca@gmail.com

Lakshminarayanaswamy who is also the president of the Coimbatore District Cricket Association says they want to see more cricket here in the coming years. Board matches, Ranji trophy... are all on the anvil. “We want to give a fillip to women’s cricket. We already have about 15 to 20 girls, mostly from the neighbouring schools, who train here at the nets regularly. Our vision is to create a woman’s cricket league. With the Indian women's team doing well abroad, girls are inspired. We identify and coach talent in a scientific manner.”

It took them six months of intense work to develop the facility. “N. Srinivasan, former ICC Chairman inaugurated it and the first question he asked was if we could host an IPL match here. We want to have one IPL match every year. As the space is within the city, it is easy for the crowds.” Lakshminarayanaswamy likens the maintenance of the ground to raising a child. He says the ground requires constant care.

Many industrialists from Coimbatore chipped in with funds. “Other sporting associations should tap into CSRs and get funds to host sporting events. Also, develop infrastructure as it is important to prepare the students for the national and state level. There is enough and more opportunities in sport, be it table tennis, shuttle, badminton, hockey, football or kabaddi. We want to work on it.”

Public support is important, he insists. “We are looking forward to the TNPL matches. We want the people to have a good time. Parents are keen now to encourage their children in sports. Students should continue playing sports, beyond their college days to keep themselves fit. There is a career in sports too. Not just in playing, but also in sports management, coaching...”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/azwoet/article31089757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/aerialview,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/coimbatore-district-cricket-association-gears-up-to-host-the-upcoming-tnpl/article31089763.ece
475,2020/03/17,Coronavirus | 51 private labs will soon be allowed to conduct tests,"WHO prescription on tests not for India, says ICMR chief.

The “test, test, test” prescription of the World Health Organisation (WHO) is not for India, Director-General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday, stressing that community transmission of COVID-19 has not yet occurred.

Dr. Bhargava, however, also announced that 51 private laboratories [accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)] will soon be allowed to test for COVID-19 to enhance capacity for diagnosis and detection in addition to the 72 functional laboratories.

“The WHO criteria are not country specific and we have told the country office of the Organisation that statements like these spread panic and fear. This is more applicable for Europe, U.K., Italy, etc.,” he said. “While we cannot say that we have contained and avoided community transmission, we did close our international borders very early.”

On Monday, Director-General of WHO said: “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test. Test every suspected case.”

ICMR also released a preliminary report of its sample testing for community transmission and noted that 500 of 1020 samples picked up to get trends and indications of third stage transmission have all tested negative. “We will have the full report in within a day or two,” the ICMR chief said.

He added that currently there is no evidence of community transmission and that the random samples, picked up (between March 1-15) from ICU patients who have been admitted with respiratory distress, have shown no indication of community transmission.

“India has witnessed only imported cases of COVID-19 and limited local transmission from imported cases to their immediate contacts. Community transmission of the disease has not been documented till now. If community transmission is documented, our testing strategy will undergo changes to evolve into stage appropriate testing strategy,’’ the ICMR chief added.

ICMR has also scaled up its testing operations and has released revised testing guidelines which includes testing norms for health care workers looking after patients with respiratory distress.

“Health care workers managing respiratory distress / Severe Acute Respiratory Illness should be tested when they are symptomatic,” the Council said.

The revised norms specify that all asymptomatic patients, who have taken international flights in the past 14 days, should get tested as per current protocol if they develop symptoms. Also symptomatic people who come in close contact with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus cases must be tested.

Announcing a major scale-up of testing facilities, ICMR said: “We appeal to all private laboratories to offer COVID-19 diagnosis free of cost. We have 72 functional ICMR laboratories in government sector for testing and 49 — more under organisations like Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR), Department of Biotechnology (DBT), and Defence Research, Development Organisation (DRDO) — will be active by the month end. Private NABL accredited laboratories will soon be operationalised,” Dr. Bhargava said.

“The ICMR was approached by several private players who want to contribute and talks are on with 51 NABL accredited private laboratories. We will give them standard operating procedure and will also maintain strict standard control,” added Dr. Bhargava

“The NIV is in the process of checking if these work and, if good, can be deployed for large scale testing,” said Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology. “Hopefully we should know of their suitability in the next two weeks,” Ms. Swarup added. On Tuesday, the government said it was readying guidelines for private diagnostic companies to develop tests to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is responsible for the disease. All companies — and the ICMR themselves — currently rely on multinational companies for their diagnostic test kits.

To accelerate development of drugs and diagnostics, the government will be forming a Rapid Response Regulatory Framework to rapidly evaluate potential diagnostic kits and vaccines against COVID-19.

Currently these processes, led by the Drug Controller General of India and Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation, take from 30-45 days, and the proposed farmework aims to bring the approval cycle to 7 days.

“The government notification on this should be out soon but this is to accelerate the development of potential products made in India and aid the development of diagnostics and vaccines in India,” Ms. Swarup said in telephone interview.

The ICMR has maintained that India now has 120 facilities where tests can be undertaken and that barely 10% of the capacity was being utilised. Its own tests had so far revealed no evidence of community transmission — when the virus begins to spread rapidly in the country and it’s no longer possible to trace positive cases to those with a travel history to affected countries or links to their contacts. However, there have been reports of patients, showing symptoms of the disease, showing up at hospitals and testing centres and being turned away.

Adoption of commercial kits for testing should be based on validations conducted by lCMR-National institute of Virology, Pune,” ICMR Director-General Balram Bhargav said on Tuesday.

ICMR is also pressing into action two rapid-testing units at Odisha and Noida which can test 1,400 samples a day and this would be functional by the end of the week. It has proposed to install more such units in at least 5 locations on an urgent basis.

Guidelines to labs

The Council also issued guidelines to private sector labs stating that the test should be only offered when prescribed by a qualified physician as per the ICMR guidance for testing. Since the guidance evolves periodically, the latest revised version should be followed.

“Appropriate bio-safety and bio-security precautions should be ensured while collecting samples from a suspect patient. Alternatively, a disease-specific separate collection site may be created. Also, all the private testing laboratories are to ensure immediate/ real-time reporting to State officials of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme and ICMR headquarters for timely initiation of contact tracing and research activities,” noted ICMR.

Handling of bodies

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry issued an advisory on handling of bodies with COVID-19 stating that autopsies should be avoided.

“If autopsy is to be performed for special reasons, a well-trained and limited staff should be used. Embalming of the body should not be allowed. Also, all staff identified to handle bodies in the isolation area, mortuary, ambulance and those workers in the crematorium / burial ground should be trained in the infection prevention control practices,” notes the guideline.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/93nafr/article31093218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17IN-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/icmr-asks-private-labs-to-hold-free-tests/article31093045.ece
478,2020/03/17,"Coronavirus | Air pollution may further impact patients, say doctors","Those in polluted regions and with compromised lung function should take extra care, they say.

A collective of doctors working on health impacts of air pollution has warned that people living regions with high levels of air pollution and with compromised lung function could be more vulnerable to coronavirus (COVID-19).

State Helpline numbers | A map of confirmed cases in India

The Doctors For Clean Air (DFCA) has warned that compromised lung function due to air pollution could lead to serious complications in patients affected by the pandemic.

Also Read Coronavirus | A complete list of travel advisories issued by the Union Health Ministry

“Exposure to air pollution in long term reduces the capacity of organs to function fully and makes it more vulnerable to infections and diseases. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, such individuals are likely to face severe complications”, said the DFCA.

The collective has Arvind Kumar, director, Institute of Robotic Surgery, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital; Raja Dhar, director, Pulmonology, Fortis Hospital; and Sundeep Salvi, director, Chest Research Foundation, among others.

A statement issued by them noted that there was so far no proven links between air pollution and COVID-19 mortality.

``However, previous strains of coronavirus like SARS have known to cause higher deaths in regions with high levels of air pollution,’’ said Dr. Kumar.

A study, which appeared in Environmental Health: A Global Access Service Source, compared the SARS death rates and air pollution levels in five different regions of China between April and May 2003, when the majority of SARS cases were diagnosed.

Researchers found that the SARS death rates increased as pollution levels increased, ranging from about 4% in regions with low air pollution to 7.5% and 9% in regions with moderate or high air pollution levels, respectively.

The DFCA has asked people, especially those who live in polluted urban centers and those who have pre-existing conditions of lung or heart diseases, to take extra precautions of maintaining hygiene, social distancing and immediately seeking medical help in case they show symptoms of cold, fever and breathlessness.

Call to government

It has urged the government to formulate long-term plans to reduce air pollution in the country. It has sought stricter enforcements of thermal power plant emission norms, regulation of emissions from diesel and petrol vehicles and strict enforcement of construction and solid waste norms so that the sources of air pollution can be tackled.

“The only way for India to fight COVID-19 or future pandemics would be if its environment is protected. This pandemic has made us realise the value of clean air and this should be a key lesson for going forward in building resilience in our country”, the DFCA noted.

Every year, 12 lakh Indians died from breathing poor quality air. Air pollution was one of India’s biggest killers. Globally, outdoor air pollution caused three million premature deaths in 2012 – roughly the same as the toll from malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS combined. Pollution affected health and quality of life throughout the life course, with evidence of links to cancer, asthma, stroke, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, changes linked to dementia, and harmful effects on the foetus and young child. In Delhi, one in every 4 children had irreversible lung damage. This crisis was costing India 3% of it’s GDP annually. Despite these well-documented consequences, 92 per cent of the world’s population lived in places where air quality levels exceeded the World Health Organisation’s guidelines, it said.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yihlda/article31092878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-air-pollution-may-further-impact-patients-say-doctors/article31092789.ece

480,2020/03/17,"Coronavirus | Undetected cases drive spread in community, say researchers","These cases can expose a large population to the virus than would otherwise occur

Eighty-six per cent of people in China who were infected with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were not tested in the two-week period before travel restrictions came into force on January 23 in Wuhan and other cities. And these undetected cases contributed to the majority of virus spread in the community, says a paper published in the journal Science. It says that undetected cases can expose a large population to the virus than would otherwise occur.

The researchers used a computer model that draws on observations of reported infection and spread within China in conjunction with mobility data from January 10-23 and January 24-February 8.

People who experienced mild, limited or no symptoms were not detected but spread the virus anyway. “Per person, these undocumented infections were 55% as contagious as the documented infections. About half as infectious per person as a documented case who has more severe symptoms and maybe shedding more,” Prof. Jeffrey Shaman of Columbia University, New York, and one of the corresponding authors of the paper, said during a press briefing.

Even though the undetected cases are only 55% contagious compared with those who exhibit severe symptoms and are detected, due to their greater numbers, they facilitated the rapid spread of the virus throughout mainland China. The undetected cases were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.

Also read: How does soap use help in tackling COVID-19?

“There are many more of these undocumented cases and it’s the undocumented infections that are driving the spread and growth of the outbreak,” Prof. Shaman said. “The undocumented infections which tend to be milder are distributing the virus broadly. They’re contributing essentially to what we call self transmission of the virus because it’s really undetected and it’s flying below the radar.”

The modelling study suggests that a “radical increase” in identifying and isolating people who have not been tested yet would be needed to fully control the spread of the virus.

Also read: Coronavirus | A problematic testing strategy

The paper says that steps taken by many individuals and governments to restrict travel, shut down schools, prevent large gatherings, isolation of suspected cases, and the use of face mask and regular hand washing could have helped slow down the spread of the virus. And some countries have also started community testing.

The authors say that while travel restrictions and other control measures could have reduced the spread of the virus in the community, the study does not provide evidence that such control measures would be sufficient to end the spread locally and prevent a rebound once travel and other restrictions are removed or relaxed. “Similar control measures and travel restrictions would have to be implemented outside China to prevent reintroduction of the virus,” they write.
