0,2020/02/27,Maiden podium finish for Tamilselvan,"Bags 81kg category bronze medal

Tamil Nadu weightlifter V. Tamilselvan’s wait for a maiden podium finish came to an end on Thursday as he claimed the men’s 81kg category bronze medal at the Khelo India University Games here.

Under the watchful eyes of his father and coach L. Vinayagamoorthy, a former national-level weightlifting silver-medallist himself, Tamilselvan lifted a combined total of 264 (110+145) to take home his first medal in 10 events. Creditably, at 18, he was the youngest lifter in the event, with his opponents at least two years older.

“It feels great to finally have my first medal. My hard work has paid off and this will serve as a huge boost to me,” said Tamilselvan, who is pursuing a BA degree in history from Thiruvalluvar University in Vellore.

When asked if he grew up wanting to follow his father’s footsteps, he said, “I have actually never seen any videos of my father weightlifting. I have only seen a few photos. I joined the gym just to stay fit, and it just so happened that I found my calling in weightlifting.”

While father-son squabbles are common, especially when they work as coach and son, the youngster says the two of them share an indomitable bond. “My father has been a pillar of support. He has never put pressure on me and has been very patient with me throughout, even at times when I struggled.”

Vinayagamoorthy, who is currently a Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu coach at Vellore, adds, “He took it up as a hobby, but has been seriously lifting only over the last year. Now that he has finally won a medal, you can expect a lot more from him.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/pjsa55/article30935965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th28Tamil-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/maiden-podium-finish-for-tamilselvan/article30935966.ece
1,2020/02/27,Great escape for Indian boxers,"Contingent leaves coronavirus-hit Italy, reaches Germany

With the coronavirus spreading fast in many countries, there is a new development virtually every hour. Countries have shut borders, cities have been locked down, people quarantined and flights have been suspended.

And with the coronavirus cases jumping to 400 in Italy, it was virtually a great escape for the Indian boxers training there in Assisi on Thursday.

The contingent (13 boxers and 10 support staff), which is scheduled to fight in the Olympic qualifiers in the Jordanian capital of Amman from March 3, left Italy and reached Germany on Thursday.

“Our team has reached Frankfurt airport and it will be leaving for Jordan in an hour. We were running around from pillar to post,” Jay Kowli, the secretary general of the Boxing Federation of India, told The Hindu on Thursday evening. The team includes stars like M.C. Mary Kom and Amit Panghal.

Clearly, the new developments — Italy is now experiencing the largest outbreak of the coronavirus in Europe and on Wednesday Royal Jordanian Airlines announced that it was suspending all flights from Amman to Rome until further notice — had left Kowli very worried.

“We had to be alert all the time and get various arrangements done. We had to be very careful. Italy’s name (on the coronavirus hit list) has come out and had we been late, it could have been a problem,” he said.

“People are quarantined, flights are stopped, so it’s lucky that we left. We are like parents, they are our kids. Now all over the world, there’s a big worry.”

Boxers from Ireland, France, New Zealand and Russia were also training in Assisi, in the central Italian region of Umbria, which is nearly 500km from Lombardy, the worst-affected area. The Irish team had cut short its camp and left on Wednesday.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/19yatu/article30935118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28BOX,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/great-escape-for-indian-boxers/article30935119.ece
2,2020/02/27,Indian squad for Tokyo test event,"Anjum takes Tejaswini’s spot in women’s rifle 3-position

The National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) has announced a 17-member shooting team for the Olympic test event to be staged at the Asanka Range in Tokyo, from April 16 to 25.

The Asanka Range was used for the 1964 Games in only rifle and pistol events.

Also Read: Shooter Manu Bhaker undeterred by high expectations

This test event is basically meant for the Olympic qualified shooters with rare exceptions, in terms of numbers.

India will have 14 Olympic-qualified shooters, as Tejaswini Sawant who won the Olympic quota in the women’s rifle 3-position event, has been kept out.

Her place has been taken by Anjum Moudgil.

Air rifle spots

The two spots in the women’s air rifle have been filled by Apurvi Chandela and Elavenil Valarivan.

Since the test event does not allow additional spots, Anjum will not shoot in air rifle, despite having won the first Olympic quota with the silver medal in air rifle in the World Championship in 2018.

This could also give a hint about the thought process of the National federation for the Olympics.

India has not won any Olympic quota in men’s rapid fire pistol event, but will field Anish Bhanwala and Adarsh Singh in the test event.

Interesting read: Manu Bhaker: 'Working on mental strength and technique'

Moreover, Rahi Sarnobat and Chinki Yadav will shoot in the women’s 25-metre pistol event, even though Manu Bhaker has a better ranking.

Since only one Olympic quota may be swapped by a country, with the same gender, and depending on availability, it is a good possibility that Chinki gets to retain her place in the event, with good performances.

Entries revised

Incidentally, the NRAI has revised the entries for the World Cup at home in Delhi in March, by bringing Chinki into the main event, and keeping Olympian Annu Raj Singh in the MQS section.

The team: Men: 50m rifle 3-position: Sanjeev Rajput, Ashwary Pratap Singh. 10m air pistol: Abhishek Verma, Saurabh Chaudhary.

10m air rifle: Divyansh Singh Panwar, Deepak Kumar. 25m rapid fire pistol: Anish Bhanwala, Adarsh Singh. Skeet: Mairaj Ahmad Khan, Angad Vir Singh Bajwa.

Women: 50m rifle 3-position: Anjum Moudgil. 10m air pistol: Manu Bhaker, Yashaswini Singh Deswal. 10m air rifle: Apurvi Chandela, Elavenil Valarivan.

25m sports pistol: Rahi Sarnobat, Chinki Yadav.

Mixed air pistol: Abhishek Verma & Manu Bhaker; Saurabh Chaudhary & Yashaswini Singh Deswal. Mixed air rifle: Divyansh Singh Panwar & Apurvi Chandela; Deepak Kumar & Elavenil Valarivan.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/5igwuf/article30935053.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28ANJUM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indian-squad-for-tokyo-test-event/article30935054.ece
3,2020/02/27,Kerala kickboxer Ann Mary Philip wins laurels at competition,"Kickboxer Ann Mary Philip on finding balance between sport and family

Learning kickboxing was the furthest thing on Ann Mary Philip’s mind when she enrolled her son, Chris Jubin, for lessons in 2018. She and her husband, Jubin Peter, wanted their son to learn a contact sport. “We were impressed by a demonstration fight by the Kerala Kickboxing Association,” says Ann.

Cut to February 2020, the 35 year-old has won two gold medals — Light Contact Senior Female (under 60 kg) and Kick Light Senior Female (under 60 kg) — at the Wako Indian Open International Kickboxing Championship, held in Delhi this month. And nine-year-old Chris won a bronze medal in Point Fighting, in the children’s category.

Ann initially took Chris, a student of Class IV, at Rajagiri Public School in Kalamasserry, to Jzals Dance and Fitness Studio in Kakkanad, before moving to SpaRing on Chittoor Road, run by the Kerala Kickboxing Association, in the YMCA building. It is here, as she waited for her son’s classes to finish, she got interested in the sport.

“The more I practised the more interested I got. It is not monotonous: routines are different. I was pushed to do more by the coach, Kiran VS” she says. Seeing her enthusiasm, and stamina, Kiran asked her if she wanted to compete. The Kickboxing Association’s championship competition was to be held in June 2019 in Kottayam.

Though she had only been training for four months by then, she was game for a challenge. Her schedule got intense: she began training for close to seven hours a day. As a result, she won a gold medal in her category in Kottayam.

Buoyed by the win, she began preparing for the Wako Indian Open International Kickboxing Championship in Delhi, which draws competitors from six-seven countries such as Kirgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Iran and Nepal. Since there are few women training competitively in Kochi, Ann spars with male boxers for practice. “Some of these are veterans of national and international championships, I get to match my power with theirs,” she says. Her schedule is spread across the day — three hours in the morning and the rest in the evening, when Ann takes Chris for his training after school.

Age is a factor in sport, especially contact sport, but Ann is not deterred by the fact that she has started relatively late. “There is no age limit to kickbox: there are 55 year-olds who practise it for fitness. Age accompanies maturity with which comes inner strength. The knowledge that you can do something; that is motivation enough,” she says.

From the ring Kiran is secretary of the Ernakulam branch of Kerala Kickboxing Association. He has been a kickboxer for 12 years. He says the age limit for kickboxing competitively is 40. There is a veteran’s category for those between 40-55 years. Kiran took a team of seven for the Wako Indian Open International Kickboxing Championship this year and returned with eight medals. He says that the composition of the teams from other parts of the country is 50-50, when it comes to men and women. “Teams from the south, especially Kerala have barely one or two women if at all there are any. This year Ann was the only woman.”

She credits Kiran for her achievements, “How a coach pushes one to do better, to try harder is very important. Kiran sir constantly pushed me.” He in turn says that being a coach on the national kickboxing team for eight years helped him recognise Ann’s potential. “I could see that she had it in her. She has the attitude and the commitment. She constantly pushes herself...if she is asked to do 10 push-ups, she will do it irrespective of how tired she is,” he says proudly, adding that she competed with a six time national champion in one of the rounds and came out winner.

An engineering graduate, Ann did an MBA after her son was born, which was not easy with a baby. Post-competition, she still trains for a couple of hours everyday with Chris, when she takes him for his classes in the evening. She adds that her husband is a constant source of support. Balancing home and her training schedule was a challenge. “But we, my family and I, worked it out,” she says. She signs off by adding why she keeps going, “I want to set an example for my son and inspire him.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/f5jybz/article30931701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPANNMARY1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kickboxer-ann-mary-philip-on-finding-balance-between-sport-and-family/article30931703.ece
4,2020/02/27,Expect Tokyo Olympics to go ahead as scheduled despite coronavirus concerns: Rijiju,"Rijiju said the current situation demands that nations come together to fight the crisis.

Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday said he expects this year’s Tokyo Olympics to go ahead smoothly despite fears being expressed over the fate of the Games amid the novel coronavirus threat.

The Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in July-August this year but a senior IOC member Dick Pound has said that the event might have to be cancelled if the deadly coronavirus outbreak is not brought under control by May.

“Virus China mein hai, Tokyo mein Nahi (the virus is in China not Tokyo),” Rijiju said in response to questions about the Games on the sidelines of a workshop to sensitise Indian athletes about Japanese etiquette and culture here.

Rijiju said the current situation demands that nations come together to fight the crisis.

“We have to fight every situation together. I expect Tokyo Olympics to start July 24 on time and go ahead smoothly,” he said.

“World is a community, we have to support each other,” he added.

14,2020/02/27,There remain trade barriers in place,"India was Australia's eighth-largest trading partner and fifth-largest export market in 2018-19, driven by coal and higher education

Despite bushfires that have ravaged a part of the Australian countryside, the country very much remained “open for business”, said visiting Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham. He added that Canberra had announced an additional A$1 million this week to keep selling packages around the T20 World Cup events.

Australia to hold wide-ranging enquiry into disastrous bushfires

Reports in some sections of the media, particularly in the U.S., had led to misinformation about the extent of the impact of the bushfires, the Minister said, including some maps that showed almost all of Australia in flames.

Not only tourism, but bilateral trade and investment across resource, agribusiness and produce, and higher education services sectors are expected to get a boost, Mr. Birmingham said to The Hindu, as Australia pushes forward with implementing its ‘India Economic Strategy’ (IES). To that end, he said, the recent India-Australia Business Exchange, a 120-strong business delegation visiting India this week, would help spread awareness about investment opportunities and the business landscape in this country.

Trade partnership

While India was Australia's eighth-largest trading partner and fifth-largest export market in 2018-19, driven by coal and higher education, and two-way goods and services trade with India was $30.3 billion, the ambition behind the IES is to expand Australian exports to India from $14.9 billion in 2017 to around $45 billion, and outward Australian investment to India from $10.3 billion to over $100 billion. “We trust that we continue to be a trusted, valued supplier of resources and energy to meet the growing needs of Indian industry and manufacturing,” Mr. Birmingham said, in this context.

To achieve such goals, however, it would require progress on the trade barriers that exist, the Minister noted. “Australia has had great success in achieving more liberal trade arrangements, with a number of other bigger trading partners over recent years. We think that achieving greater trade access for each of us with one another is a further way to grow the flow of trade and investment.”

Reflecting on the impact of the Coronavirus crisis on China’s trading partners, he noted, “I would expect, particularly following the events of Coronavirus and its impact especially on trade and travel sectors, that businesses will re-evaluate those risks. In some cases that may present opportunities for economies like India.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ctawky/article30935169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2020-02-27-Simon-Birmingham---Australian-Trade-Minister,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/there-remain-trade-barriers-in-place/article30935170.ece
15,2020/02/27,Shinzo Abe calls for closure of all schools in Japan over virus,"It’s a bid to prevent the spread of infections among children

Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday urged schools nationwide to close for several weeks to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, as authorities reported the country’s fourth death linked to the outbreak.

The move comes as crew members from the Diamond Princess, a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship quarantined off Japan, began leaving the vessel, where more than 700 people have tested positive for the disease.

“The government considers the health and safety of children above anything else,” Mr. Abe said.

“We request all primary, junior high and high schools... across the nation to close temporarily from March 2 next week until their spring break.”

The spring break for public schools usually starts in late March in Japan and lasts several weeks.

Local media said the call would not extend to nurseries and daycare facilities.

Many public elementary schools and junior high schools in northern Hokkaido, where the death of a man in his 80s infected with the virus was confirmed on Thursday, were already closed after a cluster of infections prompted the governor to request public schools close for about a week.

The city of Osaka also said it will close its kindergartens, elementary and junior high schools from Saturday for two weeks.

Mr. Abe’s call comes after the government urged organisers of major events to consider cancelling them, and called on businesses to allow employees to work from home.

Authorities have said the coming two to three weeks will be critical in determining whether they can stem the outbreak of the virus, which has infected nearly 200 people in the country.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/c9qg0j/article30934998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-kids,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/abe-calls-for-closure-of-all-schools-in-japan-over-virus/article30934999.ece
16,2020/02/27,"U.K. rejects EU trade demands, threatens to walk away","EU wants common trading standards and continued fishing rights, which Johnson’s govt. has declined

Britain put the prospect of a chaotic Brexit back on the table on Thursday as it set out its red lines for trade talks with the European Union.

In its mandate for the negotiations that start on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government rebuffed EU demands for common trading standards and continued fishing rights.

And it warned it could walk away from the talks if a “broad outline” of a deal is not agreed by a meeting planned for June.

This would see Britain’s currently seamless trading arrangements with the EU, forged over half a century, abruptly end after a post-Brexit transition period expires in December.

“We want the best possible trading relationship with the EU, but in a pursuit of a deal, we will not trade away our sovereignty,” senior government minister Michael Gove told MPs.

The European Commission, which is negotiating on behalf of the EU’s 27 member states, said it was preparing for all scenarios.

“The Commission maintains its capacity to prepare for no deal following the result of those negotiations,” spokeswoman Dana Spinant said.

Also Read Joy and sadness: how the world reacted on Brexit Day

She added that the mid-year meeting was “a very fair timeline” to take stock of whether a deal was possible.

No alignment

Britain left the EU on January 31, but both sides agreed to a standstill transition period lasting until December 31 to allow time to strike a new partnership.

Mr. Johnson wants a free trade agreement similar to the EU’s deal with Canada, set alongside separate agreements on issues such as fishing, energy and aviation.

But Brussels says Britain’s geographical proximity and existing close ties make it a different case, fearing it could gain an uncompetitive advantage by relaxing costly environmental and labour laws.

It says Britain must mirror EU standards if it wants to continue freely trading goods with the bloc’s huge single market.

However, Mr. Johnson argues this would undermine the whole point of Brexit, even if that means increased barriers with what is currently Britain’s largest trading partner.

“We will not agree to any obligations for our laws to be aligned with the EU’s,” the official U.K. mandate says.

Brussels also wants its state aid rules to apply in the U.K. — something London rejects.

Another potential flashpoint is financial services, a key concern for Britain that it wants resolved by June to allow firms to keep working in the EU after December 31.

The European Commission spokeswoman refused to commit the EU to completing so-called equivalence assessments by June.

In the British parliament, opposition politicians decried the government’s hard line approach.

“This is nothing other than a routemap to the cherished no-deal -- the real ambition of these Brexit zealots,” said Scottish National Party MP Pete Wishart.

Tensions were already high between Britain and the EU ahead of the first round of negotiations.

On Tuesday, when the bloc published its mandate, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said he would not strike a deal “at any price”.

One crucial issue for both sides in the upcoming negotiations is fishing rights.

But it is also vital for many EU countries, notably France, where fish and seafood caught in U.K. waters account 30% of sales for fishermen.

Brussels wants to maintain the right of its fleets to fish in U.K. waters, warning that failure to agree on this could scupper the wider trade talks. But Mr. Gove warned: “We will take back control of our waters as an independent coastal State and we will not link access to our waters to access to EU markets.”

London proposes instead that fishing opportunities be negotiated annually, based on stock levels.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hk5zk6/article30934814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Boris,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-rejects-eu-trade-demands-threatens-to-walk-away/article30934815.ece

Pakistan Air Force is fully prepared to counter any threat to the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the PAF chief said here on Thursday, a year after IAF jets bombed a terror camp in Balakot.

The Indian Air Force jets carried out air strikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Balakot on February 26 last year to avenge the killing of 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel in the Pulwama terror attack on February 14. Pakistan retaliated on February 27 by attempting to target Indian military installations.

Pakistan’s Air Chief Marshal Mujahid Anwar, speaking during a ceremony at the Air Headquarters here to celebrate the first anniversary of the “Operation Swift Retort”, reiterated the PAF’s commitment of responding to aggressors, The Express Tribune reported.

“We stood as an integrated force that is hard-hitting and focused on its mission. Prior to the Indian aggression, our leadership had made it amply clear that no misadventure will ever go un-responded,” he said.

He said that the PAF is second to none and has proved its air superiority on February 27 last year.

“Pakistan Air Force along with other services is fully prepared to counter any threat to the country,” Khan added.

To mark the day, the PAF recently released a special patriotic song.

The relations between India and Pakistan strained following the Balakot strike. The ties further nose-dived after New Delhi abrogated Article 370 that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir in August last. Pakistan downgraded diplomatic relations with India and expelled Indian High Commissioner.

The strike by India’s warplanes on the camp and the Pakistani Air Force’s subsequent retaliation the next day triggered fears of a war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

The U.S. president was feted at the world’s largest cricket stadium in the “Namaste Trump” event in Ahmedabad and was cheered by tens of thousands of people.

“We were treated very, very well and we really enjoyed it. A lot of tremendous progress was made in terms of relationship — our relationship with India is extraordinary right now,” Trump said.

“We are going to be doing a lot of business with India, they are sending billions and billions of dollars now to the United States,” Trump said in response to a question.

Reacting on Trump’s statement on the issue, Sanders on Wednesday tweeted, “Over 200 million Muslims call India home. Widespread anti-Muslim mob violence has killed at least 27 and injured many more. Trump responds by saying ‘That’s up to India.’ This is a failure of leadership on human rights.”

Sanders is the second Democratic presidential nominee after Senator Elizabeth Warren to speak against the violence over the Citizenship Amendment Act in New Delhi.

Meanwhile, President Trump’s daughter Ivanka noted that the President announced that the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (USIDFC) will open an office in India.

The USIDFC will establish a permanent presence in India to strengthen our economic ties, improve development plus further women’s economic empowerment through WGDP (Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative)!”

On her arrival from India, she thanked Prime minister Modi for “your warm hospitality as we visited your beautiful country and celebrated the strength, spirit and unity of the US and India!”

“Throughout our visit we saw monumental achievements of human creativity & proof of the infinite capacity of the human heart!” she said.

The First Lady tweeted two pictures of her with Trump facing the Taj Mahal in Agra.

“One of the Seven Wonders of the World, the breathtaking Taj Mahal!” she said.

President Trump “reaffirmed the strong strategic partnership, vibrant economic ties and expanding security relationship between our two countries. Wonderful trip, but glad to be home! Thank you India!” said White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham.

During Trump’s visit, India and the U.S. finalised defence deals worth $3 billion under which 30 military helicopters will be procured from two American defence majors for the Indian armed forces.

The deals will include procurement of 24 MH-60 Romeo helicopters by India from the U.S. at a cost of $2.6 billion. Another contract to acquire six AH-64E Apache helicopters for $800 million from the U.S. is also on the table.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5jrck0/article30930778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-USATRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-is-incredible-lot-of-progress-made-in-bilateral-ties-during-visit-president-trump/article30930779.ece
24,2020/02/27,China to send ‘duck army’ to help Pakistan fight locusts,"China deployed ducks, whose natural diet includes insects, to fight a similar infestation in its northwestern region of Xinjiang two decades ago, reportedly with considerable effectiveness.

China is planning to dispatch a 100,000-strong army of ducks to help Pakistan combat a massive locust infestation, a local newspaper reported Thursday.

The legion of lotus-eating waterfowl will be sent from the eastern province of Zhejiang following the earlier dispatch of a team of Chinese experts to Pakistan to advise on a response to the infestation that is being called the worst in 20 years, the Ningbo Evening News said.

China deployed ducks, whose natural diet includes insects, to fight a similar infestation in its northwestern region of Xinjiang two decades ago, reportedly with considerable effectiveness. Their use is both much less expensive and environmentally damaging than the use of pesticides, the paper quoted Zhejiang Provioncial Institute of Agricultural Technology researcher Lu Lizhi as saying.

Ducks are also more suited to the task than other poultry, such as chickens, Mr. Lu said.

""Ducks like to stay in a group, so they’re easier to manage than chickens,” he said. A duck is also capable of eating more than 200 locusts per day, compared to just 70 for a chicken, Mr. Lu said. “They have three-times the combat capability,” he added.

Calls to the provincial government press office seeking confirmation of the report rang unanswered Thursday and a number provided for the publicity department at the agricultural sciences institute was constantly engaged.

25,2020/02/27,UN disarmament chief: nuclear arms race is threatening world,"Izumi Nakamitsu didn’t name any countries but she was clearly referring to the United States and Russia, and possibly China, when she told the UN Security Council that relationships between states — especially nuclear-weapon states — are fractured.

The UN disarmament chief warned Wednesday that the specter of an unbridled nuclear arms race is threatening the world for the first time since the 1970s, the height of the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union.

Izumi Nakamitsu didn’t name any countries but she was clearly referring to the United States and Russia, and possibly China, when she told the UN Security Council that relationships between states — especially nuclear-weapon states — are fractured.

So-called great power competition is the order of the day, Ms. Nakamitsu said.

Division, distrust and a dearth of dialogue are increasingly the norm. Russia-US relations have been at post-Cold War lows since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea.

Last year, Russia and the US both withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the US saying it pulled out because of Russian violations and the Kremlin denying breaching the treaty’s terms.

Russia has said the US also appears reluctant to extend the New START treaty, the only treaty governing the number of strategic nuclear weapons deployed by the two countries, which expires in 2021.

Last week, US Defense Secretary Mark Esper touted a multibillion-dollar plan for a top-to-bottom modernization of America’s nuclear arsenal to keep up with Russia and outpace China. In late December, Russia’s defense minister reported to President Vladimir Putin that a new intercontinental weapon that can fly 27 times the speed of sound had become operational, bolstering the country’s nuclear strike capability.

Ms. Nakamitsu warned that the specter of unconstrained nuclear competition looms over us for the first time since the 1970s.

We are witnessing what has been termed a qualitative nuclear arms race — one not based on numbers but on faster, stealthier and more accurate weapons, she said.

Regional conflicts with a nuclear dimension are worsening, and proliferation challenges are not receding.

The Security Council meeting was requested by Germany to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty on March 5 and to support the upcoming conference to review and advance its goals which starts April 27 and ends May 22.

Russia and the United States clashed at the meeting over the breakdown in arms control negotiations.

But they supported a statement by the 15-member Security Council saying the treaty, known as the NPT, remains the cornerstone of the nuclear nonproliferation regime and the foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

The council resolved to advance the NPT’s goals and underlined the treaty’s essential role in the preservation of international peace, security and stability as well as the ultimate objective of a world without nuclear weapons.

Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the council that despite its achievements the NPT is facing serious setbacks: Nuclear disarmament has come to a standstill. New technologies are creating dangerous strategic imbalances. And proliferation crises are demanding our fullest attention.

He pointed to North Korea acquiring nuclear weapons, disregarding the NPT and Security Council resolutions, as a key failure.

Mr. Maas said the only realistic way ahead is applying pressure and stepping up nuclear diplomacy.

He urged international support for US efforts to negotiate with North Korea, and for the 2015 Iran nuclear deal which remains the best and only promising tool to keep Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ybhuad/article30929212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNITEDNATIONS-NUCLEARNON-PROLIFERATION-GERMANY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-disarmament-chief-nuclear-arms-race-is-threatening-world/article30929213.ece

27,2020/02/27,"El Salvador approves law to prosecute civil war crimes, president to veto","El Salvador's civil war that pitted the former Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation (FMLN) against the army lasted from 1980 to 1992 and left 75,000 dead as well as 8,000 missing.

El Salvador's Congress on Wednesday narrowly approved a controversial law intended to allow the prosecution of crimes committed during the country's bloody civil war, although President Nayib Bukele said he would veto it.

While proponents argue the law is meant to ensure that nobody receives an amnesty or pardon for their crimes during the civil war, opponents, including human rights organisations, argue it will achieve the opposite.

Mr. Bukele called it “an amnesty law that protects war criminals” and said he would veto it. If he does not, it will become law within 60 days of being officially announced.

The law covers compensation, reparations, history and access to military and police archives, and makes it illegal to praise disgraced characters for their role during the civil war.

One of the main criticisms, however, is that it allows judges to significantly commute sentences for reasons of health or age, or because alleged perpetrators collaborate. It was approved by 44 out of 84 possible votes.

A day after U.S. lawmakers reacted sharply to the violence in the Indian capital, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders here accused U.S. President Donald Trump of failing on the issue of human rights.

Slamming the US president, Mr. Sanders said the Trump’s statement regarding the violence in New Delhi during his India visit was a “failure of leadership“.

Mr. Sanders is the second Democratic presidential nominee after Senator Elizabeth Warren to speak against the violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in New Delhi.

Apart from the Democratic presidential candidate, other influential senators too expressed concern over the developments on Wednesday.

“We are alarmed by the recent violence in New Delhi. We continue to support an open dialogue on issues of significant concern in order to advance our vital long-term relationship,” Senator Mark Warner from the Democratic Party and John Cornyn from the GOP said in a joint statement.

Warner and Cornyn are co-chairs of the Senate India Caucus, the largest country-specific caucus in the U.S. Senate.

Congressman Jamie Raskin said he was horrified by the violence, which was fueled by religious hatred and fanaticism.

“Liberal democracies must protect religious freedom and pluralism, and avoid the path of discrimination and bigotry,” the Congressman said.

Richard N Hass, who heads the powerful Council on Foreign Relations, said the reason for India’s relative success has been that its large Muslim minority saw itself as Indian.

“But this is at risk owing to govt attempts to exploit identity politics for political advantage,” he said.

Earlier in the day, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom urged the Government of India to take swift action for the safety of its citizens.

29,2020/02/27,Saudi Arabia halts travel to Islam’s holiest site over virus fears,"The extraordinary decision by Saudi Arabia stops foreigners from reaching the holy city of Mecca and the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims pray toward five times a day. It also said travel was suspended to Prophet Muhammad’s mosque in Medina.

Saudi Arabia on Thursday halted travel to the holiest sites in Islam over fears about a new viral epidemic just months ahead of the annual hajj pilgrimage, a move coming as the Mideast has over 220 confirmed cases of the illness.

The extraordinary decision by Saudi Arabia stops foreigners from reaching the holy city of Mecca and the Kaaba, the cube-shaped structure the world’s 1.8 billion Muslims pray toward five times a day. It also said travel was suspended to Prophet Muhammad’s mosque in Medina.

The decision showed the worry about the outbreak potentially spreading into Saudi Arabia, whose oil-rich monarchy stakes its legitimacy on protecting Islam’s holy sites. The epicenter in the Mideast’s most-affected country, Iran, appears to be in the holy Shiite city of Qom, where a shrine there sees the faithful reach out to kiss and touch it in reverence.

""Saudi Arabia renews its support for all international measures to limit the spread of this virus, and urges its citizens to exercise caution before traveling to countries experiencing coronavirus outbreaks,” the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement announcing the decision. “We ask God Almighty to spare all humanity from all harm.”

Disease outbreaks always have been a concern surrounding the hajj, required of all able-bodied Muslims once in their life, especially as pilgrims come from all over the world. The earliest recorded outbreak came in 632 as pilgrims fought off malaria. A cholera outbreak in 1821 for instance killed an estimated 20,000 pilgrims. Another cholera outbreak in 1865 killed 15,000 pilgrims and then spread worldwide.

More recently, Saudi Arabia faced a danger from a related coronavirus that caused Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS. The kingdom increased its public health measures in 2012 and 2013, though no outbreak occurred.

While millions attend the 10-day hajj, this year set for late July into early August, millions more come during the rest of the year to the holy sites in the kingdom.

The virus that causes the illness named COVID-19 has infected more than 80,000 people globally, mainly in China. The hardest-hit nation in the Mideast is Iran, where Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 19 people have died among 139 confirmed cases.

Experts are concerned Iran may be underreporting cases and deaths, given the illness’s rapid spread from Iran across the Persian Gulf. For example, Iran still has not confirmed any cases in Mashhad, even though a number of cases reported in Kuwait are linked to the Iranian city.

In Bahrain, which confirmed 33 cases as of Thursday morning, authorities halted all flights to Iraq and Lebanon. It separately extended a 48-hour ban over flights from Dubai and Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, through which infected travelers reached the island kingdom off the coast of Saudi Arabia.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said there were no immediate plans to quarantine cities but acknowledged it may take “one, two or three weeks” to get control of the virus in Iran.

As Iran’s 80 million people find themselves increasingly isolated in the region by the outbreak, the country’s sanctions-battered economy saw its currency slump to its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in a year on Wednesday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cvudcz/article24723447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAUDIHAJJ1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/saudi-arabia-halts-travel-to-islams-holiest-site-over-virus/article30928748.ece
30,2020/02/27,"Malaysian king summons Mahathir, who’s trying to be PM again","""I just want to do what is best for the country. I believe, rightly or wrongly, politics and political parties must be set aside for now. If allowed, I will form an administration that does not side with any party. Only national interest will be prioritized,” Mr. Mahathir said in a televised message.

Malaysia’s king summoned Mahathir Mohamad to the palace Thursday, fueling talks he may have majority support to return as the next prime minister after his abrupt resignation and the collapse of his ruling coalition this week.

Mr. Mahathir didn’t speak to reporters as he was driven into the palace grounds. The meeting came after the king interviewed lawmakers to determine who they support as prime minister and if they want fresh elections.

A comeback as prime minister for a third time will be a remarkable feat for Mr. Mahathir, the world’s oldest leader at 94, after nail-biting twists, turns and machinations in the political drama that unraveled over the weekend. A failed bid by Mr. Mahathir’s supporters to form a new government without his named successor Anwar Ibrahim plunged the country into a political limbo.

A total of 37 lawmakers, led by Mr. Mahathir’s Bersatu party, left the ruling alliance, depriving it of majority support and sparking a crisis less than two years after it ousted a corrupt-tainted coalition that had ruled for 61 years. The king dissolved the Cabinet but reappointed Mr. Mahathir as interim leader.

The result was a renewed battle between Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar, whose political feud has stretched more than two decades.

Mr. Mahathir said on Wednesday he had quit to show he wasn’t power crazy and because he doesn’t want to work with the former corrupt regime that he had ousted in 2018 polls. Despite a preelection pact to handover power to Mr. Anwar, he said Parliament should pick the next leader and that he would form a nonpartisan government if he is chosen again to helm the government.

""I just want to do what is best for the country. I believe, rightly or wrongly, politics and political parties must be set aside for now. If allowed, I will form an administration that does not side with any party. Only national interest will be prioritized,” Mr. Mahathir said in a televised message.

Mr. Anwar said lawmakers from the three remaining parties in his alliance have nominated him as the prime minister after Mahathir rejected their offer to restore their former government. He has said they will wait for the king’s decision. His camp still controls 41% of parliamentary seats but could be the largest bloc after two key Malay opposition parties withdrew their support for Mahathir.

Mr. Anwar was Mr. Mahathir’s deputy during Mr. Mahathir’s first stint in office in the 1990s, but he was sacked following a power struggle and later jailed on sodomy and corruption charges that he said were trumped up. Mr. Anwar led a reform movement that helped built a fledgling opposition but was jailed a second time for sodomy in 2014 in a move he said was aimed at killing his political career.

Mr. Mahathir, who retired in 2003 after 22 years in power, made a comeback in 2016 spurred by anger over a massive graft scandal involving a state investment fund. Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar reconciled and forged an alliance that won a historic vote in 2018 that ushered in the first change of government since independence from Britain in 1957. But their relationship remained uneasy as Mahathir refused to set a time frame to hand over power to Mr. Anwar.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/p8z80j/article29769921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-LT-MAHATHIRMOHAMAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysian-king-summons-mahathir-whos-trying-to-be-pm-again/article30928709.ece
31,2020/02/27,China investigates release of SARS-Cov-2 infected inmate in Hubei,"Media reports said an infected inmate was released from a Wuhan women's prison after completing her sentence. Family members then drove her to Beijing.

China has sent an investigation team to Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, after reports that a prison released an infected inmate who then travelled to Beijing.

A team led by the Ministry of Justice, Supreme Court and Ministry of Public Security will look into the incident, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China said in a news release on Thursday.

Media reports said an infected inmate was released from a Wuhan women's prison after completing her sentence. Family members then drove her to Beijing.

The report has caused an uproar, with netizens asking how she got out of a city that has been sealed off for more than a month.

“We healthy people get stuck in Wuhan and she can escape the strictest lockdown there with a fever?” one commentator said on China's Twitter-like Weibo.

“She must have really good connections,” said another.

An official with the Hubei provincial prison regulator told The Beijing News on Wednesday that the inmate had been released lawfully. The Beijing CDC confirmed she was infected with the virus, SARS-Cov-2.

The woman, surnamed Huang, is now in quarantine along with three family members, health authorities in Beijing said on Wednesday. She was one of more than 300 inmates in the prison to be infected.

Virus containment in jails throughout the country has come under greater scrutiny after the cases were discovered.

Xiong Xuanguo, a deputy justice minister, told reporters on Wednesday that local law enforcement was to blame, saying there were “gaps” in their prevention and control work.

Hubei province revised its daily tally of new infections last week after it had failed to include more than 200 cases from its prisons, casting doubt on the accuracy of its data.

Ying Yong, the Communist Party chief of Hubei province, called on officials late on Wednesday to strengthen virus-control measures in prisons, detention centres, drug treatment centres and other public facilities.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/266ybw/article30902992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-investigates-release-of-sars-cov-2-infected-inmate-in-hubei/article30928669.ece

China reported 433 new cases on Thursday, against 406 a day earlier.

The United States and South Korea postponed joint military drills on Thursday to limit the spread of coronavirus, as the number of infections inside China - the source of the outbreak - was for the first time overtaken by fresh cases elsewhere.

Brazil confirmed Latin America's first infection and the new disease - COVID-19 - was also detected for the first time in Pakistan, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Romania and Algeria. China reported 433 new cases on Thursday, against 406 a day earlier.

U.S. health authorities reported the first possible case of community transmission in the United States involving someone who had no relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient.

U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking to calm U.S. stock markets which fell for the fifth consecutive day, said the United States was “very very ready” to face the virus threat.

Asked by reporters whether he was considering restricting travel to and from South Korea, Italy and other countries where the number of infections have exploded in the last week, Mr. Trump said everything was on the table.

“At some point, depending on what happens, we may cut certain additional countries off, like we've had to do with China, and we hope we can open it up to China soon as possible,” Mr. Trump said in a live broadcast.

U.S. stock futures fell as far as 1% as he spoke while oil and Asian share markets slipped.

The U.S. State Department issued a new travel warning for South Korea after the U.S. military reported its first case of the coronavirus on Wednesday, in a 23-year-old soldier based near the South Korean city of Daegu.

The South Korean military has also reported a number of infections and confined most troops to their bases.

An upcoming “command post training” usually conducted by members of the two militaries' Combined Forces Command will be postponed “until further notice”, according to a statement from the combined command.

South Korea reported another 334 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, pushing the total to 1,595, the most in any country other than China.

Global spread

Chinese health authorities said the number of new deaths stood at 29 on Thursday, the lowest daily rate since Jan. 28. The virus that can lead to pneumonia has now killed a total of 2,744 people in the country, mostly in the central province of Hubei where it originated late last year.

It has infected about 80,000 people, the vast majority in China, and its rapid spread through countries such as Italy, Iran and South Korea has raised the risk of a pandemic.

As panic increased, Mexican authorities barred a cruise ship from docking at one of its ports over what the ship's company said was a single case of common seasonal flu. The ship was eventually allowed to enter the Cozumel port.

Cruise ships have been in the spotlight after confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the British-registered Diamond Princess approached 700 with three deaths since the ship docked at a Japanese port on Feb. 3.

The United States is managing 59 cases so far - mostly Americans repatriated from the cruise ship in Japan.

Latin America's first case was confirmed in a 61-year-old man in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who had recently visited Italy, a new front line in the global outbreak. The diagnosis coincided with the carnival holiday, a peak time for domestic travel. Brazil's stock index fell over 7%.

Italy reported another 100 cases nationwide, taking the total in Europe's biggest hotspot to more than 400, while the death toll rose to 12.

The outbreak is centred on Italy's industrial heartlands of Lombardy and Veneto, and the government has closed schools and universities, shuttered cinemas and banned public events in an effort to prevent the spread of the highly infectious disease

A hotel in Tenerife in Spain's Canary Islands remained locked down for a second day on Wednesday with more than 700 guests, over cases linked to Italy.

In France, a second person died - a teacher who had not visited any country with a known outbreak.

There have been nearly 50 deaths outside China, including 19 in Iran, according to a Reuters tally.

Iraq on Wednesday banned public gatherings and barred entry by travellers from Kuwait and Bahrain because of the spread of the new coronavirus.

In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for sports and cultural events to be scrapped or curtailed for two weeks as concern mounted for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

33,2020/02/27,Tunisia’s parliament approves a coalition government,"Elyes Fakhfakh, who was designated prime minister last month by President Kais Saied, has brought parties from across the political spectrum into his cabinet - and they continue to disagree on several big policy areas.

Tunisia's parliament approved a new coalition government in a confidence vote on Thursday, after months of political wrangling that has slowed the north African country's efforts to tackle looming economic problems.

There were 129 votes in favour, 77 against.

Elyes Fakhfakh, who was designated prime minister last month by President Kais Saied, has brought parties from across the political spectrum into his cabinet - and they continue to disagree on several big policy areas.

Despite winning the confidence vote, the government may prove fragile after struggling to reconcile differences over policy and cabinet positions.

Fakhfakh's cabinet included Nizar Yaich as finance minister, Nourredine Erray as foreign minister and Imed Hazgui as defence minister.

The new government will face a major economic challenge after years of low growth, persistent unemployment, big government deficits, mounting debt, high inflation and deteriorating public services.

It must tackle high public spending and politically sensitive reforms to energy subsidies and state firms.

It will also need to secure new external financing worth $3 billion after an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme ends in April, with no new support yet agreed.

Introducing his proposed government's programme in parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Fakhfakh said Tunisia has successfully completed its transition to a democratic state, but still needs to pursue economic changes.

The country's last election, held in October, produced a deeply fragmented house in which no party won more than a quarter of the seats. An earlier attempt to form a government was defeated in a confidence vote in January.

Mr. Fakhfakh said his government's priorities would include fighting widespread corruption and reforming public services and the state phosphate producer.

It would also work to maintain the value of the currency, which has recovered in recent months after years of decline, he added. Central Bank governor Marwan Abbasi said this month that the International Monetary Fund had been in favour of the dinar losing some value to bolster exports.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/55iech/article30928605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TUNISIA-GOVERNMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tunisias-parliament-approves-a-coalition-government/article30928606.ece
34,2020/02/27,Gunman kills 5 at Milwaukee brewery before taking own life,"The assailant who attacked the Molson Coors complex was identified as a 51-year-old Milwaukee man who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

An employee opened fire on Wednesday at one of the nation’s largest breweries in Milwaukee, killing five fellow workers before taking his own life, police said.

The assailant who attacked the Molson Coors complex was identified as a 51-year-old Milwaukee man who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

""There were five individuals who went to work today, just like everybody goes to work, and they thought they were going to go to work, finish their day and return to their families. They didn’t - and tragically they never will,” Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said.

Authorities offered no immediate motive for the attack and did not release details about the shooter or how the shooting unfolded.

None of the victims was identified. Police said they were still contacting relatives as of early evening. No one was wounded beyond those who were killed, authorities said.

Officers were working to clear the more than 20 buildings in the complex where more than 1,000 people work. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said authorities believe the shooter operated alone and that the threat was over.

President Donald Trump addressed the shooting before speaking at the White House about steps his administration is taking to combat the coronavirus.

""Our hearts break for them and their loved ones,” the president said. “We send our condolences. We’ll be with them, and it’s a terrible thing, a terrible thing.”

The attack occurred at a sprawling complex that includes a mix of corporate offices and brewing facilities. The complex is widely known in the Milwaukee area as “Miller Valley,” a reference to the Miller Brewing Co. that is now part of Molson Coors.

Molson Coors CEO Gavin Hattersley called the shooter “an active brewery employee.”

""Unfortunately, I am devastated to share that we lost five other members of our family in this tragic incident,” he said in an email sent to employees. “There are no words to express the deep sadness many of us are feeling right now.”

A group of brewery employees gathered at a nearby bar to talk about what had happened.

""We are all a family. We work a lot of hours together, so we’re all very sad,” said Selena Curka, a brewery employee who was about to start her shift when the complex went on lockdown and she was turned away.

""It’s just weird, because nine times out of 10 you’re going to know the shooter,” said another employee Thomas Milner. “It’s a tight-knit family. Within the brewery we all interact with each other.”

Milner was also on his way to work when the shooting happened, and he was turned away too.

James Boyles told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his wife, Lasonya Ragdales, works at Molson Coors in the claims department. She was texting from inside the facility and told her husband that there was an active shooter and she was locked in a room with a bunch of co-workers, the Journal Sentinel reported.

""Miller Valley” features a 160-year-old brewery, with a packaging center that fills thousands of cans and bottles every minute and a distribution center the size of five football fields. A massive red Miller sign towers over the complex and is a well-known symbol in Milwaukee, where beer and brewing are intertwined in the city’s history.

The facility is also home to corporate customer service, finance, human resources and engineering. Tours take people to underground caves where beer was once stored, a saloon with intricate woodwork, a stein hall with stained-glass windows, a champagne room meeting hall with leaded-glass windows, and an outdoor beer garden that can hold 300 people.

Molson Coors announced in October that it planned to close a Denver office as part of a restructuring to eliminate 400 to 500 jobs. The reorganization was to benefit Milwaukee, which was expected to see hundreds of corporate and support jobs relocated there.

Before Wednesday’s shooting, there had been three mass killings nationwide in 2020, with 12 total victims. All have been shootings. In 2019, there were 44 mass killings, with 224 total victims. /USA TODAY/Northeastern University Mass Killings database tracks all U.S. homicides since 2006 involving four or more people killed, not including the offender, over 24 hours regardless of weapon, location, victim-offender relationship or motive.

The last mass shooting in the Milwaukee area was in August 2012, when white supremacist Wade Michael Page fatally shot six people and wounded four others at a Sikh temple in suburban Oak Creek. Page killed himself after being wounded in a shootout with police. The worst mass shooting in the area in the past 20 years was in 2005, when seven people were killed and four wounded at a church service in Brookfield, a Milwaukee suburb. The shooter killed himself.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/22jfor/article30928592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MILWAUKEESHOOTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gunman-kills-5-at-milwaukee-brewery-before-taking-own-life/article30928593.ece
35,2020/02/27,"COVID-19: Trump tells Americans risk is low, puts VP Pence in charge of U.S. response","Public health officials were “ready, willing and able” to move quickly if the virus spreads, said President Trump.

President Donald Trump told Americans on Wednesday that the risk from coronavirus remained “very low,” and placed Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the U.S. response to the looming global health crisis.

At a White House briefing with his coronavirus task force, Mr. Trump defended his administration's response to the crisis and said public health officials were “ready, willing and able” to move quickly if the virus spreads.

Public health officials on Wednesday warned Americans to prepare for more coronavirus cases and New York City announced plans to provide up to 1,200 hospital beds if needed as U.S. stock markets fell for the fifth consecutive day.

Mr. Trump said he would accept whatever emergency spending Congress decided was appropriate for the crisis, and that he was not ready to institute new travel restrictions for countries such as South Korea and Italy that are dealing with outbreaks, although he could not rule it out.

“The risk to the American people remains very low,” Mr. Trump said, flanked by Mr. Pence and public health officials.

“We're ready to adapt and we're ready to do whatever we have to as the disease spreads, if it spreads,” he said, adding the spread of the virus in the United States was not “inevitable.”

“It probably will, it possibly will. It could be at a very small level, or it could be at a larger level. Whatever happens were totally prepared,” he said.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infections Diseases, said earlier in the day that while the virus was contained in the United States, Americans must prepare for a potential outbreak as transmissions spread outside of China.

“If we have a pandemic, then almost certainly we are going to get impacted,” Fauci told CNN.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has 59 coronavirus cases, including 42 American passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan.

“We have to be alert to the possibility of a pandemic,” Peter Marks, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in an interview.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called on the federal government to help it obtain 300,000 extra protective masks. There were no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the city, he said.

Global stock markets have slumped in recent days due to worries over a prolonged disruption to supply chains and economies from the virus, which has infected about 80,000 people and killed nearly 3,000, mostly in China.

U.S. stocks turned lower in afternoon trading on Wednesday in a fresh wave of selling sparked by fears of the coronavirus spreading in the United States. The S&P 500 index fell for a fifth straight day and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 123.77 points, or 0.46%.

Mr. Trump, who is running for a second term in the November election, has been increasingly alarmed by the drop in U.S. stock markets, which he considers a barometer of the health of the American economy and sees as important to his re-election.

He told reporters at the White House that fears of the coronavirus had hurt the stock markets. But he also blamed the Democratic presidential candidates for spooking investors.

“I think the financial markets are very upset when they look at the Democrat candidates standing on that stage making fools out of themselves,” Mr. Trump said in a reference to debates that are part of the process toward nominating a Democrat to run against Republican Trump.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump accused two cable TV news channels of presenting the danger from the virus in as bad a light as possible and upsetting financial markets.

Mr. Trump tweeted that CNN and MSNBC, both of which often criticise him, “are doing everything possible to make (the new coronavirus) look as bad as possible, including panicking markets,” adding: “USA in great shape!”

The CDC has advised Americans to not visit China and South Korea, and on Wednesday stepped up travel warnings for Iran, Italy and Mongolia.

House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, on Wednesday dismissed Trump's assertion in India that the coronavirus was under control at home.

“I don't think the President knows what hes talking about, once again,” she told reporters.

Asked about her comment, Mr. Trump responded: “I think Speaker Pelosi's incompetent.”

Mr. Trump is seeking $2.5 billion from Congress to boost the government's virus response, an amount Democrats said falls far short of what is needed and have also urged the White House to appoint a “czar” to coordinate a national response.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday called for $8.5 billion to prepare.

“We're going to spend whatever is appropriate,” Mr. Trump said.

A congressional source said the Democratic-controlled House would attempt to advance a coronavirus emergency funding bill before the next recess, scheduled to begin on March 12.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6a97n/article30721438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Trump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-tells-americans-coronavirus-risk-is-low-puts-vp-pence-in-charge-of-us-response/article30928528.ece

37,2020/02/27,U.S. lawmakers take note of Delhi violence,"“Deeply troubled by the deaths from the communal violence in India over the past couple of days,” Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Eliot Engel said.

As the death toll in the Delhi riots climbed to 27 on February 26, lawmakers in the U.S. took note of the violence even if President Donald Trump did not want to comment on it during his February 25 press briefing in Delhi.

“Deeply troubled by the deaths from the communal violence in India over the past couple of days,” Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Eliot Engel tweeted on February 26 morning, retweeting a Washington Post story on the violence.

“The right to protest is a key aspect in democracy, but they must remain peaceful and police must ensure the safety of all,” Mr. Engel, whose committee is charged with oversight and legislation related to the U.S.’s foreign policy, said. The violence in Delhi had erupted over the Citizenship Amendment Act, a law passed by Parliament in December, which discriminates against refugees’ claims to Indian citizenship based on whether or not they are Muslims.

On February 25, Representative from Washington State, Pramila Jayapal had tweeted about the issue.

“This deadly surge of religious intolerance in India is horrifying,” Ms. Jayapal said this week. “Democracies should not tolerate division and discrimination, or promote laws that undermine religious freedom. The world is watching.”

Ms. Jayapal had sponsored a bill at the end of last year, titled, ‘Urging the Republic of India to end the restrictions on communications and mass detentions in Jammu and Kashmir as swiftly as possible and preserve religious freedom for all residents’. This led to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar boycotting a meeting with HFAC during his December visit to Washington DC after he found that Ms. Jayapal would be attending.

Ms. Jayapal’s bill currently has 62 co-sponsors, including 5 Republicans. GOP lawmakers are generally seen as taking a softer stance on recent developments in India such as the abrogation of Article 370, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Religious Freedom Commission hearing on March 4

The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent bipartisan body set up by the U.S. Congress, also took note of the violence in Delhi and reacted on Twitter on February 25.

“USCIRF is alarmed by reports of deadly mob violence targeting Muslims in New Delhi, #India and urges the #Modi government to rein in mobs and protect religious minorities and others who have been targeted,” the Commission said, retweeted a BBC story on the Delhi violence.

The Commission has announced a hearing on religious freedom and citizenship laws, scheduled for March 4.

38,2020/02/27,Super Singer contestant Krishaang’s rendition of ‘Buddhi Ulla Manidharellam’ goes viral on social media,"A video of the youngster singing the popular track from the Tamil film 'Annai', shot inside a classroom at a city school, has been widely circulated

A short video of a young boy singing Buddhi Ulla Manidharellam, the famous old song from the Tamil film Annai rendered in characteristic style by the yesteryear artiste Chandrababu, and starring Ranga Rao and Bhanumathi, has taken social media by storm.

The video, so far anonymous, was shot inside a classroom at a city school, and shows the student whose name is Krishaang, render a delightful version of the track. His enthusiasm and enunciation of the language, as well as his ability to capture the unique inflections of Chandrababu’s voice have come in for great praise from Twitter users who have been sharing the video since yesterday.

This song has so many chromatic notes and crazy vibratos this boy jus nailed it with so much ease ... I request his parents to give the best ever training possible ... future @Shankar_Live for sure ♥️ https://t.co/xjNoQVTT9h — thaman S (@MusicThaman) February 26, 2020

Among those who shared the video and praised his singing was music composer S. Thaman, who said that the boy would be a future Shankar Mahadevan.

“This song has so many chromatic notes and crazy vibratos. This boy jus nailed it with so much ease. I request his parents to give [him] the best ever training possible,” he said, in a tweet.

Following the video going viral, many social media users were quick to identify the boy as a contestant on the new season of Super Singer Junior which airs on Vijay TV. He has been selected to participate in the show and will compete against 19 other young contestants.

In the reality show’s first episode which aired on Saturday, Krishaang along with another contestant sang the peppy song Ennama Kannu Sowkiyama? from the Rajinikanth film Mr Bharat. Their performance came in for much praise from the judges, singers Shankar Mahadevan, Chitra, Kalpana and actor-singer Nakul.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/kfxhzp/article30931759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/krishaaaang,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/super-singer-contestant-krishaangs-rendition-of-buddhi-ulla-manidharellam-goes-viral-on-social-media/article30931760.ece
39,2020/02/27,"‘Navelru... Half Boiled’, ‘Popcorn Monkey Tiger’: Bizarre titles come calling to Kannada cinema","Suri is the kind of director who zeroes in on a title before thinking of a plausible plot, which limits the exercise

On average, a minimum of five Kannada films get released every week. Most don’t last beyond the weekend, leave alone one whole week. What else do you expect with titles like ‘Navelru Half Boiled’! This has not discouraged production. You wonder why and how so many films are being churned out with only a fraction of the investment earned back. Last month more than 100 films were lying with the censors awaiting a viewing and certification.

I’m a die-hard cinema fan, but that’s one job I don’t envy. You can’t even walk away midway. Application for a censor certificate is now online and is on a first come first serve basis. Release dates can be announced only after the producer procures the certificate. The making of ‘Popcorn, Monkey, Tiger’ was done in an unhurried manner but with a scramble for suitable date and screens the influence of a Minister was used to jump the censor certificate queue. With a title that’s as bizarre as they come, the film would have normally gone unnoticed if it had not been helmed by Suri who’s considered among the most talented in Kannada cinema.

Some people just don’t bother to peep out of a social, moral cocoon they’ve carefully created for themselves. Suri is one. They don’t celebrate and explore the wonderful opportunities life has thrown up thus ending up wallowing in self-pity and catharsis. Cinema gives you the chance to dream and explore an unseen world and experience a roller-coaster of emotions. Suri has a flair for the medium, purely visually but his writing is hollow. It’s the lack of a definitive script that makes his films appear disjointed. He’s the kind of director who zeroes in on a title before thinking of a plausible plot which limits the exercise. With Ram Gopal Varma and Bala for cinematic idols there’s more crime than punishment. This time his son suggested the title, ‘Popcorn, Monkey, Tiger’ so he has to write something connected. ‘Blood, Booze and Babes’ would have been more apt.

Anyway while people call him ‘Monkey’, Seena the protagonist claims he’s ‘Tiger’ Seena. That takes care of two disjointed names. There’s this girl called Popcorn Devika who delivers a child in prison wanders around aimlessly after release, loses her money and infant and transforms into a cold, heartless character. Then there are the usual Suri characters with names like Galeej, Kothambari and Kushka. The purpose of any films is to entertain, enlighten, educate or move you emotionally, usually. ‘PMT’ refuses to tick any of these boxes.

You don’t identify with any of these characters and so fail to empathise with them purely because they’ve consciously chosen the paths they tread. There’s no plot nor is there a definite character arc save Devi. Hero is always in a drunken stupor, getting humiliated by women or smashing skulls with his fists. The kind of expletives used in the film is unheard of in Kannada cinema. Suri has been digging out scenes from his life right from ‘Inthi Ninna Preethiya’, and it continues, lamenting lost love, mouthing puerile pop philosophy and treating every woman but his mother with disdain. He also tries to weave in the cache full of cash episode from ‘Kenda Sampige’ making the film appear even more disjointed. ‘PMT’ is like the ramblings of someone high on some sort of substance, banned not prescribed. Sadly, I don’t think his son who suggested the title can watch the film, at least for a few more years.

A still from the movie ‘Kendasampige’

There has been talk of late that some films like ‘Dia’, ‘Love Mocktail’ and ‘Kanadhanthe Mayavadhanu’ should have done well at the box-office. It’s always going to be tough for small budget films which depend solely on ‘word of mouth’ because a separate budget for publicity is an added burden. The sad fact is before the positive word can spread the films are pulled out. Last week, six films were released and Ramesh’s ‘Shivaji Suratkal’ has emerged the winner. The two most difficult genres are comedy and murder mysteries. If the gags have to keep coming in the former the latter depends on periodical twists to keep the viewer guessing. You can see that a painstakingly written script was ready before going on sets.

The last time a murder mystery masquerading as victims of mumbo jumbo worked was in ‘Rangi Taranga’. Here too the twain is intertwined for not entirely believable but convincing viewing. The trick is to not make you think while watching and director Akash Srivatsa achieves that. Also the sequences moving back and forth are done seamlessly sans confusion. A song just after the interval is intrusive and should be removed to make it more engrossing. A lot of effort has gone into answering prospective doubts but a few more suspects with likely motives would have made it more interesting. With a holiday resort as the location in verdant Maikeri a coffee brand is plugged a tad too obviously. A sidekick a la Dr. Watson is essential for a sleuth to act as a sounding board and that works here, occasionally. Ramesh is obviously excited about the role and brings out the right amount of manic restlessness associated with such characters while being convincing in the emotional sequences.

‘Shivaji Suratkal’ made on a practical budget will make a good profit for the producer who can be proud he made a film that everyone can watch. Every film has it’s own destiny and the unpredictability in audience reactions makes it more fascinating. A collaboration of creative minds works better than the cinematic ranting of a troubled soul craving sympathy for a life spent complaining rather than celebrating.

40,2020/02/27,A passionate restoration,"The present generation of the Sajjan Rao’s family has been restoring whatever their predecessors had given to the city

Continued…..

After S.L. Mannaji Rao, it was the turn of his son, S.M Ramakrishna Rao, to carry forward the baton of charitable services dedicated to Bengaluru, started by S. Sajjana Rao. Next to Satyanarayana Swamy Temple was a vacant land allotted to build another choultry. It was decided to undertake the task and the foundation stone was laid by Sri Dharma Vira the Governor of Karnataka State for Sree Satyanarayana Swamy Kalyana Mantap on January 20, 1972. It took more than a decade for the building to come up. Finally on January 23, 1984 it was inaugurated by the Seer of Sringeri, Shri Shri Abhinava Vidyateertha Mahaswamiji, presided over by the Chief Minister Ramakrishna Hegde and the Chief Guest was the ex-governor, Dharma Vira.

Yet another vacant land at the present Jain Temple Street, Visvesvarapuram was being used to grow flowering plants to procure flowers for Sri Subrahmanya Swamy Temple. S. Sajjana Rao had catered to the medical, religious and social needs of the city. Next, he would have chosen the sphere of education.

To fulfil this requirement, an alternative source for the flowers to the temple was arranged and a Kannada medium school was started for the benefit of, particularly for the children of economically weaker families of the nearby localities. Inaugurated on May 19, 1991, with the divine presence and blessings of revered Swamy Harshanandaji of Ramakrishna Math, Bull Temple Road, Sajjan Rao Vidya Samsthe, is also widely known for efficiently running educational and vocational training centre for special children as per all the norms set by the concerned authorities. Except the recognition from the Government, the establishment is run from own resources including training the parents to handle their special children.

The most significant aspect of the trust is strictly adhering to the dictum of S. Sajjana Rao that his descendants are only the custodians of the property he had made for the charitable causes in Bengaluru. The present generation of the family has been passionately restoring whatever their predecessors had given to the city.

Ajay Kadam, who, on behalf of the trust and the family had taken this responsibility, shares the hardships and the challenges that crop up to bring back the glory of original works. S. Sajjana Rao, along with the temple had built two wooden and one silver chariot for the annual car festival. They were built as per the direction, and specifications of the Seer of Shankara Matha Sringeri.

Since then, the Silver Chariot festival held during the month of December is an iconic event of Bengaluru, similar to Karaga and groundnut fare .

During subsequent decades, the Silver Chariot used to be washed frequently using strong chemicals not realising the damage that would cause to the structure. Not only the glitter of the silver had faded, even the wood within had been damaged. When, an organisation reputed for efficiently handling restoration of such structures was consulted, it was suggested to demolish and build a new one at the cost of several lakhs of rupees. Expenses apart, the emotional and the sentimental connect did not allow the opinion to be accepted. The present Seer of Shankara Math at Sringeri was approached. He sent his experts, who, after a thorough study, said it could be restored. The entire chariot was very systematically dismantled, packed and transported to Sringeri in 1999. Under the direct supervision and the directions of the Seer the work was completed in about two years. Since 2001, with the regained glory and grace, Silver Chariot festival is being carried out.

Another uphill task undertaken by Ajay Kadam is the restoration of Sajjana Rao Choultry built in 1934. ‘…Few years back we noticed seepages here and there and the problems were attended using local material. Suggestions were also mooted to build a new structure in its place. But finally we decided to restore it in its original form.

Several sessions of consultations with the experts in the field, visits to some restored heritage centres and a few other such preliminary tasks were done before initiating the project in November, 2018.

Now, we have specialists in the field working on it. Some basic ingredients required are procured from Anegundi and the final product for the work is done here. With little modifications we have retained the grandeur of wedding hall, dining hall and the front elevation.

A few decades back, people used to come and stay for nearly a week for wedding. To accommodate them, there were about 23 rooms. Now we have reduced the number and restructured them and also a few other areas of the choultry to cater to the present day requirements. “It may take a few more months to get the work completed,” says Ajay Kadam. Recently, he has established an exclusive Heritage Centre in the school building, methodically displaying all the old materials, documents related to the trust. A restored colour portrait of S. Sajjana Rao is a major attraction of the centre.

“We know that the task we have undertaken is expensive, time consuming, and strenuous. Yet, we have great satisfaction of bringing back one of the glorious buildings of the city to life. That is the tribute we are paying to our predecessors and also doing the duty of handing over the wealth of heritage, and the tradition to the care of the next generation,” he says.

In the name of urbanisation and expansion, Bengaluru has been losing many of its architectural marvels, though with little thought and vision they could be preserved for the posterity.

S. Sajjana Rao’s descendants and some others in the city have shown that intense passion. At the domestic and bureaucratic spheres it is required to preserve the history, culture and heritage wealth of Bengaluru.

41,2020/02/27,Desire to express,"There can be no prescription to theatre, it takes the shape of your imagination, says Atul Kumar, who brought his blockbuster Piya Beharupiya for Rangashankara’s 15th year celebrations

Atul Kumar was in Bengaluru recently to showcase his much acclaimed play, Piya Beharupiya which was staged as part of Rangashankara’s 15th year celebrations. Atul has had an impeccable journey both as an actor and director from his days in Kerala, where he learnt Kathakali and Kalaripayattu, to later studying theatre abroad. Gathering his experiences from working with “Chingari” and other companies he formed his own company, “The Company Theatre” which went on to produce hugely successful productions that have toured the globe and gathered rave reviews. Be it the Clown acts, the huge ensemble performances, experimental theatre, the Nautanki and what not, Atul’s work has always set a new precedent and touched the hearts of his audiences. He is blessed with a brilliant sense of wit and is seen always sporting that bright smile. He holds no bars and eloquently expresses himself just like it is in his plays.

Piya Beharupiya has almost gathered a cult following of sorts and has set a benchmark amongst the adaptations of Shakespeare’s works. It is a brilliant coming-together, of “the bard” and “Nautanki”, in a musical extravaganza. How did this play come about?

37 plays from 35 countries were invited by the Shakespeare Globe theatre for their globe to globe festival back in 2011. They invested hugely to bring all of his works in different languages. Sunil Shanbhag picked up, “ All’s well that ends well” and “Twelfth night” came to us. We, by then had already staged “Hamlet”, and “King Lear” and were excited at the opportunity of presenting a comedy. I will not deny that we were going to be compensated well and that was a huge motivation too.

I would have never done it myself! It just happened and the stars aligned, I must say. It was by accident that I found all the wonderful singer-actors through the audition process and slowly we discovered that one could make this into a Nautanki style presentation. I was no expert of that style, but I had wonderful support from an extremely talented team of a multi-talented actors who could dance, sing, write lyrics and what not!

You have experimented with many styles of storytelling through your plays.

It is really funny that anybody would write down a dictum or a rule book that theatre must be done this way! We are in the arts primarily because we yearned for the freedom to express and we couldn’t find it elsewhere. The constant stifling of expression in the society has led us here, to lay ourselves bare open and this was the main reason for us to be in theatre. Theatre is not a monochrome, single stream art-form, it has one billion streams. There is social drama from the activists, some use language as the mainstay and others use just their bodies to communicate. Now we see cinema and visual arts also being used in theatre. Then there is narration around spaces, ideas and concepts. There is enough space in the world for all of this to coexist and much more to join in too. Problems arise when any discourse becomes personal and egoistic. Theatre must be tolerant and accepting of all the ways of telling stories.

What is your process? Is there a process at all or is it all organically evolving?

To keep changing is my mantra. I would never want to stick to one process and slide into comfort. First we had success with this clown series that went on tour across the globe and it was alluring to keep doing more of that. It was easy to fall in that trap and typecast ourselves to just that.

I eventually stopped doing Clowns with Rajat Kapoor and told him that I needed to leave this zone and take on different challenges. Then this musical happened and there were proposals and investors ready to produce the next Piya Beharupiya already! I received resumes and recordings of all the wonderful singer-actors from across the country in anticipation of this new Nautanki that I would create. I knew that this is exactly what I wouldn’t be doing!

I am left In awe when I visit places like Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Some works by the visual artists there look more theatrical than than a lot of theatre we see around. Even at the Serendipity festival, I was surprised to attend a concert that was presented very theatrically. I want to absorb it all and keep evolving. I can never remain stagnant and trapped in a formula or process.

There is sudden increase in acting schools everywhere. Lot of youngsters want to learn theatre.

Life of every artist must be open-ended as I see it. If you want to do theatre for the love of it, please do! If you want to use it for cinema, then go ahead! It's important to realise that acting is a very individualistic process and there is no path or roadmap to achieve something. There are few actors who are brilliant on stage and fall flat on the screen and same holds even for the reverse scenario. There are a few who are brilliant at cinema, but keep coming back to theatre just to feel that magic. There are all permutations and combinations. Everything must be allowed and experimented with. It is ultimately time and destiny that decides what works and what doesn’t. Its however not a golden rule that theatre will help actors get better at cinema! It has actually worked the opposite for many. They are separate genres and operate on different variables.

What is that one uncompromisable quality that you look for in your actors?

Skill can be taught or worked on. Acting can evolve but not the core persona. I look for what kind of person the actor is and what kind of energy they bring to the table.

Theatre is a collective process and if there is an energy drain, that can ruin everything. Each member must add an ounce of happiness and align their energies into the process of creation and that’s the most vital aspect for me. Their immediate values, ideology and belief system has a huge impact on the ensemble building process. Work once created lasts for years and every ensemble becomes a family of sorts, so staying put together becomes extremely important.

Theatre is still vibrant and new spaces are mushrooming everywhere to facilitate this art form. What makes theatre a living, relevant and vibrant art even in the age of YouTube, OTTS and IMAX screens?

To understand this, one must get back to the roots. Why was theatre born anyway? Simply because one needed to express! This dire desire to say something will exist perpetually. Theatre is an extremely sensitive, personal and humane space and this quality will suffice to guarantee its relevance in all ages to come.

We are coming up with a new play based on “Mountain Language”, a strong piece written by Harold Pinter. It touches upon the topics on totalitarianism and the politics around that. There is one lady in our team who opened up to us during one rehearsals and said that at home she had no freedom to voice her dissent since her husband supported one extreme political ideology. She said she found her freedom in this space and that only here she could finally have a voice. The whole ensemble was left with a lump in their throat while trying to understand the gravity of this. These little things are really the most integral and important things that show us why theatre will always continue to be important and necessary.

We don’t need royal patronage or government grants. We can do with or without them. A play can happen in a royal theatre, an amphitheatre, a cafe or even a street! Forget the cities, just see how vibrant theatre is in small towns, villages and smaller communities! It has this rebellious quality to thrive everywhere and that keeps theatre really alive!

While it's absolutely true that theatre can survive anywhere it is also a blessing to have exclusively designed spaces. How important are spaces like Rangashankara for theatre to thrive?

Artists run organisations always have a heart. It takes another degree of madness and passion to build and sustain such organisations. I am ever in awe of artists like Arundhati Nag, Veenapani Chawla and Sanjana who had this insane commitment to dedicate entirely to theatre.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/6j0ur3/article30931652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bgfak4-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/desire-to-express/article30931661.ece
42,2020/02/27,"Pink Floyd’s Roger Waters recites Aamir Aziz’s ‘Sab Yaad Rakha Jayega’, calls CAA Modi's ‘fascist’ law","Rock icon Roger Waters reads out lines from Delhi student Aamir Aziz’s ‘Sab Yaad Rakha Jayega’, calls Narendra Modi a ‘fascist’.

At a protest in London last week to demand the release of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, Pink Floyd co-founder and rock icon Roger Waters read out lines from a poem by an Indian poet to huge applause from the crowd.

The lines were a translation of Sab Yaad Rakha Jayega (Everything will be remembered) by Amir Aziz, a student from Delhi. Responding to a series of events from the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir to the violence against students in Jamia Millia and JNU, Aziz’s poem, written in January, had been shared widely.

Waters introduced Aziz as a poet and activist in Delhi “involved in the fight against Modi and his fascist, racist citizenship law.”

The lines had the same anger against the establishment as the songs Waters used to write for his legendary rock band Pink Floyd in the late 60s, but expressed in more overt tones than Waters’ sarcastic pessimism. The anger here was more full blooded than the quiet desperation of many Pink Floyd songs.

The lines that Waters read went thus:

“Kill us, we will become ghosts

And write of your killings, with all the evidence

You write jokes in court,

We will write ‘justice’ on the walls

We will speak so loudly that even the deaf will hear

We will write so clearly that even the blind will read

You write injustice on earth

We will write revolution in the sky

Everything will be remembered,

Everything recorded.”

“I think this kid's got a future,” 76-year-old Waters said after the recitation, as the crowd applauded. The rockstar also made a reference to India’s anti-CAA protests, as well as protests in other countries.

“Julian is why we are here today, but this is no parochial protest. We are part of a global movement that might be the beginning of the global enlightenment, which this fragile planet so desperately needs,” he said.

The video of Waters' recital set off a Twitter storm with Pakistan PM Imran Khan tagging it with the words that “it was time for the world to stand up and take notice” of the “massacre in India”. Reactions from IndianTwitter users ranged from a resounding thumbs up to put downs terming it “naive interventionism”.

Waters received a resounding thumb’s up from Indian Twitter users, including celebrities such as composer Vishal Dadlani and actor Richa Chadha.

“Roger Waters of #PinkFloyd reads a translation of Aamir Aziz’ poem “Sab Yaad Rakha Jaayega”, in solidarity with anti-CAA protestors. The world is watching Delhi, amitshahofficial and @narendramodi. The world is...” wrote composer Vishal Dadlani.

Actor Richa Chadha posted, “So how many foreign-nationals have been declared anti-national yet? @iamjohnoliver @rogerwaters @chrislhayes @BernieSanders” .

One of the greatest and most successful rock bands of all time, Pink Floyd emerged in post-World War II England. Their lyrics and music spoke of anti-war sentiment, loneliness, and exploitation.

43,2020/02/27,A meet for Chennai’s plant lovers,"Plant Parents’ Meet-Up by Delhi-based Lazy Gardener provides an opportunity for Chennaiites with green thumbs to get together

“You have an extra day this year. How are you going to make it more valuable and useful?” asks Vinayak Garg, the chief gardener (also known as the founder) of Delhi-based Lazy Gardener.

The organisation started out eight months back, by providing a variety of plant food sticks that you can insert into the mud for healthier plants, “And at that time we started creating content on Instagram. We created videos on how to garden, talked to people and got them together on Instagram to discuss plants. Very soon we grew and within six months we had 50,000 followers,” says Garg. Lazygardener.in is nearing 100,000 followers on Instagram today. That is when Garg realised that a lot of people they were are attracting were those who are just starting to garden and get plants. They usually have one or two plants. “Which is why we started Million Gardeners as an initiative to inspire new people to take up planting,” says Garg.

The third event under the Million Gardeners initiative, is the Plant Parents’ Meet-Up in 13 cities across India including Chennai. Garg says, “It is all done on a volunteers’ basis by people who gathered together on Instagram. They started with volunteers in 50 cities.""

He adds, “We have sent out kits and are training volunteers on these topics, so that anyone who comes is able to go back learning something new and useful.”

At the Delhi office of Lazy Gardener, the team has created a curriculum and put it together in cards created for the volunteers. They will also cover topics about light and watering, which “are the two most essential things people should learn about,” says Garg.

Under light, the discussion, Garg says, will mainly be about indoor plants, what kind of light requirement do different plants have and how to assess the light intensity within the house with respect to a window and artificial light.

“One of the reasons we see most people struggling with plants is because they think the solution to every problem is watering. Overwatering kills. So when to water and how much to water. Also the ways of watering that harm the plant. When you water from overhead, the leaves of certain plants can rot,” explains Garg.

Gardening, Garg believes, helps with well-being. “It is also the simplest and most actionable things one can do as the first step towards helping the environment and the climate.”

The Plant Parents’ Meet-Up will take place on February 29, between 10 am and 11.30 am at the Semmozhi Poonga Amphitheatre. The event is free of charge. To register, log on to https://tinyurl.com/

44,2020/02/27,‘RBI lifted curbs in recognition of our effort’,"We have a strategy to comply with promoter holding norm: Bandhan Bank MD

With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) removing restrictions on Bandhan Bank on opening branches, Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, its managing director and chief executive officer, said the development indicated the bank’s effort to comply with regulatory guidelines.

In September 2018, the RBI barred the Kolkata-based lender from opening new branches without prior approval and froze the remuneration of its CEO.

The restrictions were imposed as the bank failed to bring down promoters’ shareholding in the bank to 40% within three years of operations as mandated by it while granting the bank licence. The private sector lender started operations in August 2015.

‘Merger helped’

The removal of restrictions on branch expansion came after Bandhan Bank reduced its promoter stake to 61% by merging with Gruh Finance in October 2019.

“The first message that comes from the regulator is that they have recognised our effort to compliance. That can inspire us to further emphasise the importance on compliance,” Mr. Ghosh told The Hindu.

He said branch expansion during the restriction period was not totally stopped, but was taking time since the bank had to take the RBI’s approval before opening a new branch.

“Branch expansion was not totally stopped because earlier they said we need RBI approval for opening branches. That was taking time some. Now, whatever my board approves, automatically the branches will be opened. The plan was to open 250 banking outlets by March 2020,” he said.

“We are making the plan now for the next financial year for branch opening. We will disclose the figures once my board approves,” he said.

Mr. Ghosh said the move would help in growth of the business and motivate the staff. He said he expected that full benefit from the merger of Gruh Finance would be achieved from the next quarter once the team settled down.

On bringing down promoter stake to 40% from 61% which is required for complying with RBI norms, Mr. Ghosh said the bank had a plan but cannot disclose it.

“We have a strategic plan, we would like to work on that. I cannot disclose the way or the timeline of the strategy. We are very keen to comply with the guidelines of RBI,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jp9zgz/article30935524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBUBANDHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbi-lifted-curbs-in-recognition-of-our-effort/article30935525.ece
45,2020/02/27,"Foundry sector eyes railways, defence for growth","Industry may contract by up to 15% in FY20 on slowdown

The Indian foundry industry is eyeing overseas markets to more than double its share in the global trade over the next five years. Besides, it is also betting on railways and defence to post higher growth in volumes, said a top official.

“Currently, India is the second largest producer of castings at 13.38 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). However, its share in the total global trade is 2.4%,” said Sanjay Shroff, president, The Institute of Indian Foundrymen (IIF).

“But Indian exports are set to scale up to $4 billion (from the current $3.5 billion) in the next five years to achieve a 6% share in the total global imports. For this, it will be focusing on competitiveness, value addition and tapping markets other than the U.S. and the Europe,” he said.

Now, the foundry industry is eyeing Bangladesh, Panama, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Cambodia and other countries that are growing at an average rate of more than 10% year-on-year.

Last year, about 4,550 foundries in the large, medium and small scale segments in the organised sector produced 13.38 MTPA, which was an 11% increase over the corresponding year-ago period. It is likely to end the current fiscal with a negative growth of 10-15% due to overall slowdown in the Indian economy.

“Auto industry is the biggest consumer at 32%, followed by railways at 6%. We expect an uptick in the economy during the third quarter of 2020-21,” he said.

Explaining that all was not lost, Mr. Shroff said the IIF had drawn up a five-year road map to increase the toal revenue from the current $20 billion to $30 billion.

“If India needs to achieve its goal of a $5-trillion economy, then the Indian foundries need to grow by at least 25% year-on-year for the next five years. This calls for suitable intervention, investment by industries, technology, skilling and focusing on value addition. If foundry sector supports manufacturing, then the goal of $5 trillion economy can be easily achieved,” he said.

Asserting that the Indian foundry sector was eyeing railways, defence and capital goods, he said: “The total demand from railways is estimated to be 4.50 lakh tonnes per annum to 5 lakh tonnes per annum, which is likely to increase by 8-10%. Similarly, defence consumption will be about one lakh tonnes per annum to 1.20 lakh tonnes per annum, which is likely to post 15-20% growth due to opening of this sector, he mentioned.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/foundry-sector-eyes-railways-defence-for-growth/article30935513.ece
46,2020/02/27,Apollo Tyres capex to skid on slowdown,"Firm to cut expenditure by ₹300-400 cr.

Apollo Tyres Ltd. (ATL) has decided to scale down its capital expenditure (capex) for FY21 by ₹300-400 crore due to prolonged economic slowdown.

“We started the year with an estimated capex of ₹2,700 crore and that has been scaled back to ₹2,400 crore. In the last nine months, we had invested ₹2,000 crore,” said Gaurav Kumar, chief financial officer,ATL, in an earnings call.

“For the next year, the number should be in the range of ₹1,400-₹1,500 crore, from the earlier plan of ₹1,700-1800 crore,” he said.

He said major players, including ATL, were surprised at the drop in original equipment manufacturers’ business, adding almost every company had cut capex.

“Based on the market information that we have got, almost all the players have slowed down the capex So, is there specifically some capacity coming up, which will alter the demand‐supply economics in near term,” he said.

Asked about ATL’s greenfield plant coming up in Andhra Pradesh, he said it was set to start production by this quarter. Depending upon the demand situation, the production would be ramped up over a period of two years. Production may be raised to the plant’s full capacity of 15,000 car tyres and 3,000 truck radials by the end of FY2022.

Talking about the European market operations, he said the market conditions were sluggish and the passenger car segment market was down by about 3% to 4%. Yet, Apollo Tyres had posted a 3% growth. ATL made a significant improvement in truck volumes and was continuing to make inroads.

According to him, the European operations, currently, were small at about 2,00,000 tyres. ATL was in the final stages of beginning supplies to some of the premium original equipment manufacturers, besides VW and Ford.

“Over a five-year horizon, this number should go up three to four times from the current level. It would still be a small chunk of the overall business. Even three to four years down the line, it would still be only 10% of our overall volume,” he said. Meanwhile, an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a leading global private equity firm focused on growth-investing, has decided to infuse ₹1,080 crore (approximately $150 million) into Apollo Tyres.

The board of Apollo Tyres Ltd. approved an issuance of compulsorily convertible preference shares worth ₹1,080 crore to Warburg Pincus.

The investment represents a primary capital infusion into Apollo Tyres and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, said Apollo Tyres in a statement.

“I am delighted to announce Warburg Pincus’ investment in Apollo Tyres. Their investment is a strong vote of confidence in our business, management team and growth prospects. I believe the company will benefit from the backing of a large financial investor of their pedigree and our partnership will further strengthen Apollo Tyres’ board and governance,” said Onkar S. Kanwar, chairman and managing director, Apollo Tyres Ltd.

“We see a compelling growth story in Apollo Tyres and believe the company is well-positioned to build upon the strong leadership position it has carved out within the industry. Warburg Pincus is excited to partner with the management team of Apollo Tyres in this journey and looks forward to supporting them during the next phase of the company’s growth,” said Vishal Mahadevia, managing director and head, Warburg Pincus India.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/apollo-tyres-capex-to-skid-on-slowdown/article30935507.ece
47,2020/02/27,JNPT seeks priority in DFC,"‘Connectivity to private player first can impact us adversely’

With the Delhi-Mumbai Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) running behind schedule and the likely prospects of Adani-run Mundra Port getting precedence in securing connectivity to the dedicated rail line rather than the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) for which the project was originally mooted, JNPT authorities have raised concern and asked the government to expedite the entire project.

“We have been pushing for it [expediting the project] because if it [DFC] goes to Mundra first obviously I’m [JNPT] affected in an adverse way. That’s a fact. So, we have been making a noise everywhere, saying please expedite it,” said Sanjay Sethi, chairman, JNPT.

“From the government’s point of view, obviously if it [DFC] comes first [to Mundra in Gujarat] they will do that first [provide port connectivity to Mundra] but, from JNPT point of view, what we are saying is the original project is meant for JNPT.

“From an economy point of view, private ports also contribute equally but we also compete with private ports at some level. So, we are saying please expedite this [connecting DFC to JNPT] so that we start to benefit from it as early as possible,” Mr. Sethi said.

JNPT’s fear is if Adani’s port is connected first, then cargo from the hinterland would move to the private port, affecting its business.

The western DFC will cover 1500 km linking JNPT to Dadri, near Delhi. The objective is faster movement of cargo to and from JNPT and the hinterland. Other ports in the route such as Kandla, Pipavav and Mundra will also be connected.

On the impact of COVID-19 on JNPT, he said one of the terminals in the port had reported four skips already, which means the four vessels, scheduled to call on the terminal, had skipped.

“Sometimes, when a skip happens at this stage, nobody is in a position to forecast completely. But some skips are already reported. In terms of overall figures, March end would be the right time [to know the exact impact],” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jnpt-seeks-priority-in-dfc/article30935462.ece

49,2020/02/27,Sugar output set to beat estimate: ISMA,"Production is expected to be 26.5 MT this season

The Indian Sugar Mills’ Association (ISMA) has revised its sugar production estimate for the current season (2019-2020 sugar season) following a study of satellite images of cane areas in the last week of January.

According to ISMA, the production in this season, which started in October 2019, is expected to be 26.5 million tonnes (MT). The initial estimate in 2019 was 26 MT. The satellite pictures have given an idea of areas where sugarcane was harvested and remained unharvested across the country.

The details were discussed at a meeting of ISMA on February 25 and “there was an agreement that sugar production during 2019-2020 sugar season would be slightly more than what was estimated in November 2019... this after considering reduction of sugar due to more production of ethanol by way of diversion of B heavy molasses and sugarcane juice,” said a press release from the association.

Sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh are expected to produce almost the same quantity (118 lakh tonnes) as the previous season, while those in Maharashtra are likely to produce only 62 lakh tonnes as against 107.20 lakh tonnes in the 2018-2019 sugar season.

The season started in October last year with 14.5 MT of opening stock.

The domestic consumption in 2019-2020 is estimated to be 26 MT and exports nearly five MT. The closing stock on September 30, 2020, is expected to be nearly 10 MT, the press release said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sugar-output-set-to-beat-estimate-isma/article30935452.ece
50,2020/02/27,‘Data usage surpassed 11 GB in Dec.’,"Indians consumed over 11 GB data on an average in Dec. 2019, says Nokia study

Driven by cheaper data plans and mobile handsets, along with increasing popularity of video streaming services, Indians consumed over 11 GB data on an average in December 2019, according to Nokia’s annual Mobile Broadband India Traffic Index (MbiT) study.

“The average monthly data usage per user surpassed 11 GB in December, growing 16% annually due to increase in upgradation of the 4G network, low data prices, affordable smartphones, and the ever-increasing popularity of videos,” Nokia India chief marketing officer Amit Marwah said.

As per the study, data traffic was driven by 4G which constituted 96% of the total data traffic consumed across the country, while 3G data traffic registered its highest ever decline of 30%. The number of 4G handsets devices also grew 1.5x to reach 501 million units due to the availability of a range of feature-rich models and competitive prices.

The study noted that video viewership had been fuelled by growth in number of over-the-top (OTT) platforms, increased streaming of regional language content and cheaper subscription plans. “The online video platforms are truly going mass in terms of frequency and duration of consumption. Mobile phones have become the dominant medium of online video consumption in India with widespread freedom of access,” it added.

The study found that average time Indians spent on OTT platforms stood at about 70 minutes/day, while average frequency of access is 12.5 times per week and average single session duration is about 40 minutes.

Further, about 88% of daily online video watching time happens on mobile phones, followed by smart TVs (5%), laptops (4%), PCs (2%) and tablets (1%).",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rsf0g0/article30942255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DATAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/data-usage-surpassed-11-gb-in-dec/article30935448.ece

Defunct airline Jet Airways’ Committee of Creditors has decided to issue fresh Expression of Interest (EoI) for the carrier, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings, according to a regulatory filing.

“We wish to inform that the 8th Committee of Creditors (CoC) meeting of Jet Airways (India) Limited was held on February 18 and in the e-voting concluded on February 25, the CoC passed the resolution to issue fresh Invitation of EoI (Round) for the corporate debtor,” Jet Airways said in BSE filing on Wednesday.

Against this backdrop, the CoC extended the last date of submission of resolution plans to March 9. The earlier deadline for submitting the bids was February 18.

The decision to call for fresh bids was taken after a team from Russia’s Far East Asia Development Fund along with Enso Group met the CoC earlier this month and expressed interest in Jet Airways, a source said earlier.

The airline which was grounded in April last year, owes more than ₹8,000 crore to banks, with those from the public sector having significant exposure.

Set up in 2011, the Far East Asia Development Fund is a State finance development institution which warrants a flexible approach to projects’ structuring and financing, as per its LinkedIn profile.

Mumbai-headquartered Enso Group has reportedly been roped in by the fund to find an Indian partner to form a consortium that would later put in a formal bid. It has interests in diverse sectors, including oil and gas, metal mining, healthcare, infrastructure and real estate, as per its website.

56,2020/02/27,Microsoft to miss sales forecast due to COVID 19 outbreak,"In a statement, the company said although it sees strong Windows demand in line with its expectations, “the supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call.”

After Apple, Microsoft has revised its revenue guidelines for its January-March quarter owing to Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, saying the supply-chain has been slowed down which will impact its Windows and Surface businesses.

In a statement, the company said although it sees strong Windows demand in line with its expectations, “the supply chain is returning to normal operations at a slower pace than anticipated at the time of our Q2 earnings call.”

“As a result, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, we do not expect to meet our More Personal Computing segment guidance as Windows OEM and Surface are more negatively impacted than previously anticipated. All other components of our Q3 guidance remain unchanged, the company said late Wednesday.

On January 29, Microsoft issued quarterly revenue guidance for its ‘More Personal Computing’ segment between $10.75 and $11.15 billion, which included a wider than usual range to reflect uncertainty related to the public health situation in China.

“As the conditions evolve, Microsoft will act to ensure the health and safety of our employees, customers, and partners during this difficult period,” said the company, adding that it would continue to partner with local and global health authorities to provide additional assistance.

In its second quarter (October-December period), Microsoft reported revenue of $36.9 billion and a profit of $11.6 billion. Surface revenue for the quarter was up 6% (year over year) to $1.9 billion.

Apple last week warned that coronavirus outbreak will affect its business in the January-March quarter as worldwide iPhone supply will be temporarily constrained.

“Work is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter due to two main factors,” the company said in a statement.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/article22941621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06in%20microsoft,https://www.thehindu.com/business/microsoft-to-miss-sales-forecast-due-to-covid-19-outbreak/article30929291.ece
57,2020/02/27,"Why no chargesheet against Chopan, asks Congress","Poser to Shah on Pulwama suspect

The Congress on Thursday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to explain why the National Investigation Agency could not chargesheet Yusuf Chopan, alleged to be a suspect in last year’s Pulwama terror attack.

Addressing a press conference, party spokesperson Pawan Kehra alleged that though the BJP used the Pulwama attack to ‘garner votes’, the NIA could not chargesheet him and the accused managed to get bail.

“It was an attack on the soul of India and the BJP wasted no time in using that attack to garner votes to whip up passion. They shamelessly used the martyrdom of our Jawans pasting their photographs in the election rallies,” Mr. Khera said. “One year later the so-called nationalism of the BJP stands exposed because the NIA has failed to file a chargesheet against an accused of Pulwama, a terrorist of Jaish by the name of Yusuf Chopan,” he said.

The Congress said that under the watch of the Home Ministry, every week there had been law and order incidents, “be the Delhi riots, attacks on libraries and campuses or a sense of a breakdown of law and order across the country.”

“Who will take responsibility for this failure? The Home Minister, the NIA chief or should I quote Mr. Doval [National Security Adviser Ajit Doval], who used some strange words here yesterday in Delhi ‘Jo Hua to Hua’ [what has happened, has happened]!” the Congress spokesperson said.

“So we need answers, we need accountability, we demand resignation of Mr. Home Minister, where are you? You are an expert in explaining the chronology; please explain the chronology to us. What happened in Pulwama? Why weren’t you able to fix responsibility?

58,2020/02/27,BJP got 78% of donations to national parties,"BJP got ₹742 crore out of ₹951 crore, says ADR analysis of contributions of over ₹20,000 in 2018-19

The BJP received three times more donations over ₹20,000 than all other national political parties combined in 2018-19, according to an analysis by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) of the submissions made by the parties before the Election Commission (EC).

The recognised national political parties — the BJP, the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Communist Party of India, the Communist Part of India (Marxist), the Nationalist Congress Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party — were supposed to submit details of all contributions over ₹20,000, received by September 30, 2019.

The ADR report noted that the BJP was 31 days late in its submission, the CPI(M) 21 days and the CPI three days.

The national parties declared a total of ₹951.66 crore in such donations in 2018-19 and much of the amount — ₹742.15 crore — was declared by the BJP.

“The donations declared by the BJP is more than three times the aggregate declared by the Congress, NCP, CPI, CPI(M) and the Trinamool for the same period. The BSP declared that the party did not receive any donations above ₹20,000 during FY 2018-19, as it has been declaring for the past 13 years,” the ADR report stated.

Compared to the previous financial year 2017-18, the national parties’ declared donations increased by 103% in 2018-19, which was an election year. Donations to the BJP increased from ₹437.04 crore in 2017-18 to ₹742.15 crore in 2018-19 and those to the Congress increased from ₹26.658 crore to ₹148.58 crore.

The ADR found that the bulk of donations to the parties came from Maharashtra among States and corporate or business sectors when looking at the category of donors. The national parties received a total of ₹548.22 crore from donors in Maharashtra, followed by ₹141.42 crore from Delhi and ₹55.31 crore from Gujarat.

Over 92% of the total donations, worth ₹876.11 crore, came from the corporate or business sector, while 3,509 individual donors gave ₹71.407 crore or 7.5% of the total. Out of the 1,776 donations made by corporate or business sector, the BJP received 1,575 donations totalling ₹698.092 crore. The Congress got ₹122.5 crore from 122 donations from the corporate or business sector.

The top donor was the Tata Group-controlled Progressive Electoral Trust, which gave a total of ₹455.15 crore to the BJP, the Congress, and the Trinamool.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6je1e5/article29582912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BJP03,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-got-78-of-donations-to-national-parties/article30935574.ece

India has been invited to witness the ceremony to seal the peace deal between the U.S. and Taliban in Qatari capital Doha on Saturday, an official source has confirmed.

India’s acknowledgement came two days after a source privy to Taliban told The Hindu that around 24 countries are expected to participate in the ceremony where the deal will be signed. Officials here had earlier stated, that India’s participation as a witness would depend on the stance of the Government of President Ashraf Ghani.

An Indian official however reiterated India’s position that a peace negotiation should be “Afghan owned, Afghan led and Afghan controlled,” and a participation from the Afghan government in the ceremony will indicate that the U.S.-Taliban deal will ultimately take an inclusive turn. His statement hinted that India will take a call about sending a delegation for the ceremony if President Ghani sends a delegation to Doha.

A six-member Afghan delegation left Kabul on Thursday for Doha to conduct negotiation about the release of 5,000 Taliban fighters who are in custody of the Government of Afghanistan. This issue is already part of the draft peace agreement and Kabul is expected to deal with this soon after the U.S.-Taliban deal is signed on February 29.

The haste shown by the government to in transferring Delhi High Court Judge Justice S.

The CPI(M) pointed out that the transfer was part of a recommendation made by the Supreme Court Collegium, against which the Delhi High Court Bar Association protested for well-argued judicial-administrative considerations. “Post haste implementation appears to be a selective response for what unfolded in the Delhi High Court yesterday,” the Politburo statement said.

64,2020/02/27,Analysis | LJP shows signs of breaking ranks with the BJP ahead of polls,"The key NDA ally has taken a host of steps to flex its muscles and chart its own identity in Bihar

With the Bihar Assembly elections just seven months away, the State’s political pot is boiling with stakeholders attempting new permutations and combinations. In the latest, key National Democratic Alliance ally, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) is showing signs of breaking free from its overbearing senior ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

LJP last year saw a generational change, with Ramvilas Paswan handing over the reins to his son Chirag Paswan. Now, according to sources, the son is trying to break out of the side-hero role that the LJP has been playing.

First ever

The party has taken a host of steps in this direction. To begin with, LJP’s State executive has identified 119 seats in Bihar that the party would like to contest. These 119 seats are at present held either by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) or the Congress. Secondly, the LJP has started a membership drive. Currently, the party boasts of 20 lakh registered members. Thirdly, the party has started working on its manifesto — ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’. The manifesto will be launched on April 14 this year at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan. This is a first ever for the party. In the 2015 Assembly polls, it had come up with a manifesto after two phases of the elections were over.

All these exercises are aimed at achieving multiple goals. It’s a classic case of muscle flexing. In the 2015 Assembly elections, having hitched their wagon to the NDA, the LJP was derailed, along with rest of its allies, in the face of the RJD-Janata Dal-United (JD-U) mahagatbandhan (‘grand alliance’) tsunami. The LJP contested 42 seats and could win only two seats.

More claimants

This time around, with the JD(U) back in the NDA camp, there are more claimants for the seat pie. The LJP, being the juniormost partner, doesn’t want to be left behind.

“If we are not prepared well in advance, then the BJP could squeeze us in for merely 20-odd seats. More importantly, we want to ensure that we get seats where we have a shot of victory, unlike in 2015, when we were given the leftover seats,” a senior LJP leader said. The party is aiming for 42 seats that it fought last time, but senior leaders say that it would be willing to settle for 35.

It is a battle for the party’s identity, which the new leadership feels is lost entirely playing a junior partner in an alliance. “The LJP will never be considered an alternative till we strike out on our own,” the senior leader added.

Gambling berth

If the party does decide to part ways with the BJP in the State, it may have to give up on its Ministerial berth at the Centre. But this is a gamble that the party’s top leadership is willing to take.

The LJP was formed in 2000 and the only Assembly elections it fought solo, in 2005, won 29 seats in the Bihar Assembly, its highest tally ever. The party’s leadership feels that it would be better to go solo and than return to the NDA umbrella and contest in the shadow of the alliance.

“Even if we don’t take the final step towards divorce [from the NDA], we will be building our party for the future. We have to have a longer vision for the party,” another senior LJP leader quipped.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dldb0i/article30932894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LJP-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bihar-elections-2020-ljp-shows-signs-of-breaking-away-from-the-bjp-ahead-of-polls/article30932896.ece
65,2020/02/27,Delhi violence: Akali MP Naresh Gujral complains to Amit Shah about Delhi police’s apathy,"Shiromani Akali Dal MP Naresh Gujral likened the situation to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, where too police apathy had exacerbated the violence

Shiromani Akali Dal MP Naresh Gujral has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah about the unresponsive attitude of the Delhi police to distress calls, not just from ordinary people caught in the violent riots in North East Delhi but also of having completely ignored his own pleas for a rescue mission for an acquaintance in Maujpur, on the night of February 26.

In his letter, addressed to Mr. Shah and copied to Delhi’s Lt. Governor Anil Baijal and Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik, Mr. Gujral likened the situation to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, where too police apathy had exacerbated the violence.

“On 26th night, at around 11.30 p.m., I received a desperate call from an acquaintance that he and 15 other Muslims were trapped in a house near Gonda Chowk in Maujpur, and that a mob was trying to break into the premises,” wrote Mr. Gujral, whose party is an ally in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

“I immediately called 100 to lodge a complaint and gave the police officer the phone number of the gentleman who called me. I explained the urgency of the situation and told the operator that I am a member of Parliament. At 11.43 p.m., I received a confirmation from the Delhi Police that my complaint had been received along with the reference number 946603. However, much to my disappointment, no action was taken on my complaint and those 16 individuals received no assistance whatsoever from the Delhi police. They fortunately managed to escape only because some Hindu neighbours came to the rescue. If this is the situation when a member of Parliament makes a complaint personally, it is not surprising that certain parts of Delhi continue to burn while the police stands by apathetically,” he added.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Gujral, who is the son of former Prime Minister I.K. Gujral, said that the events of the last few days in Delhi were tragic and likened them to the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.

66,2020/02/27,Justice Muralidhar’s ‘midnight transfer’ condemned by NGO on judicial reform,"‘Rushed manner in which the notification has been issued by the Union Government cannot be ignored’

The Campaign for Judicial Accountability and Reforms (CJAR), an NGO which has, among others, former Supreme Court judge P.B. Sawant and noted author Arundhati Roy as patrons, on Thursday condemned the “midnight transfer” of Justice S. Muralidhar from the Delhi High Court to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

In a statement, the NGO, which has senior Supreme Court lawyers like Prashant Bhushan as members, said the transfer had nothing to do with “public interest”. The entire purpose of the transfer was to “punish an honest and courageous judicial officer for simply carrying out his constitutional duties”.

‘Done his duty’

“We are fully cognisant that Justice Muralidhar’s transfer was recommended by the Supreme Court Collegium on February 12, but the rushed manner in which the notification has been issued by the Union Government cannot be ignored. The fact that the notification for his transfer was issued on the evening he had done his duty to hold Delhi Police and the Union Government accountable for the loss of lives in the Delhi riots organised by the ruling party, tells us the true nature of his transfer,” the statement said.

On February 26, a Bench led by Justice Muralidhar directed tough questions at the Delhi Police, asking why First Information Reports had not yet been registered against leaders and Ministers of the ruling party at the Centre for making inflammatory remarks.

‘Punitive in nature’

The NGO said the nature of the Judge’s transfer is punitive and resembles those which were handed out to High Court judges during the Emergency period. “It resembles the petty vindictiveness of a government which superseded Justice H.R. Khanna for Chief Justiceship for authoring a dissent in ADM Jabalpur v Shiv Kant Shukla (Emergency case)” the CJAR said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aihnzu/article30875401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21th-muralidhara,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/justice-muralidhars-midnight-transfer-condemned-by-ngo-on-judicial-reform/article30932509.ece

The BJP on Thursday hit out at the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for “politicising” the riots that has claimed over 30 lives in north-east Delhi and left over 200 injured. It accused Congress president Sonia Gandhi of instigating violence by using phrase “aar ya paar” (fight to the finish) at a rally in December last.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar, at a presser at the BJP headquarters in Delhi, demanded to know why other political parties were silent on the attack on policemen who were present in north-east Delhi and on the death of Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma. “In such a situation, the duty of all political parties should be to consolidate peace,” he said.

Nearly three dozen CRPF personnel have donated blood at the GTB Hospital here to supplement its bank in view of the injured in the Delhi communal clashes being admitted to the facility, officials said.

They said a contingent of 50 personnel of the paramilitary were sent to the hospital on Tuesday, of whom 34 donated blood while the rest were asked to remain on standby.

“The donation was made in order to supplement the blood bank of the GTB Hospital where fatal and non-fatal casualties of the Delhi riots were being admitted since Monday,” a senior official of the force said.

At least 34 people have been killed and over 200 injured in the riots in northeast Delhi that began on Monday.

Meanwhile, over 1,300 personnel from Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) such as the CRPF, BSF, CISF and ITBP donated blood at a mega blood donation drive organised by the AIIMS here on Thursday.

About 500 personnel from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), 400 from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), 350 from the Border Security Force (BSF) and 100 from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force donated blood at the camp, a senior CAPF official said.

71,2020/02/27,Uproar in Punjab Assembly over questioning of Kartarpur pilgrims,"Punjab Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa told the assembly that some pilgrims were questioned following information from the Intelligence Bureau unit in Amritsar

Opposition MLAs created an uproar in the Punjab Assembly on Thursday, storming the Well of the House and walking out over the questioning by police of some pilgrims returning from the Kartarpur Sahib gurdwara in Pakistan.

Punjab Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa told the assembly that some pilgrims were questioned following information from the Intelligence Bureau unit in Amritsar.

Opposition MLAs accused the government of harassing pilgrims making use of the visa-free Kartarpur Corridor to visit the Sikh shrine, just across the border from Gurdaspur district.

The uproar in the House comes days after Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta triggered a row, suggesting in the media that Pakistani agencies could make overtures to Indian pilgrims to Kartarpur Sahib.

Shiromani Akali Dal’s legislative wing leader leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon raised the issue during the Zero Hour.

Devotees are being questioned in police stations by Punjab police, he said, citing a media report, and sought a reply from the Congress-led government.

Aam Aadmi Party legislator Kultar Singh Sandhwan described the questioning of pilgrims as shameful and sought the immediate dismissal of DGP Dinkar Gupta over this.

Akali leader Bikram Singh Majithia sought the suspension of Gurdaspur’s senior superintendent of police and a station house officer.

Jails minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa quoted from a letter written on February 17 by an IB official to the Gurdaspur SSP, seeking the questioning of some pilgrims.

He said the state government will take strict action against the SSP and the SHO if they are found at fault. SAD members stormed the Well of the House and then staged a walk out.

Later Aam Aadmi Party and Lok Insaaf Party MLAs also walked into the Well of the House, and staged their separate walkouts.

AAP MLA and Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema attacked the state police chief, claiming that he was posing a threat to peace and amity in the state.

“The DGP had an eight years stint in the IB and he still has links there, Cheema claimed.

Lok Insaaf Party legislator Simarjeet Singh Bains claimed that the questioning of the pilgrims had exposed the conspiracy behind the DGP’s purported statement. Bains said the police chief should be removed and an FIR lodged against him.

The DGP was under fire earlier over his remarks suggesting that that the Kartarpur Corridor was prone to misuse by Pakistani agencies.

On Tuesday, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh told the House that the top cop had tendered an apology over the remarks.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7gxpoq/article30931814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI11102019000048B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uproar-in-punjab-assembly-over-questioning-of-kartarpur-pilgrims/article30931815.ece
72,2020/02/27,Delhi HC to hear plea for FIRs against 3 BJP leaders on April 13,"Time not “conducive” to file FIRs related to alleged hate speeches as priority right now is to ensure peace, says SG

The Delhi High Court on Thursday adjourned to April 13 the hearing on a petition seeking FIRs against three BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches. The Central government and the Delhi Police have been given four weeks to file their affidavit on the issue.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar also allowed the Central government to become a party to the matter, following submissions by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.

Also Read Delhi HC issues directions to help city’s riot victims

After the affidavit is filed by the police, which comes under the Union Home Ministry, petitioner Harsh Mander is expected to file his reply.

During the hearing, Mr. Mehta — who has been authorised by the Delhi Lieutenant-Governor to represent the Delhi Police — said the time was not “conducive” to file FIRs related to the alleged hate speeches as the priority right now was to ensure peace. The authorities had examined all the video clips related to the speeches and FIRs would be registered at an appropriate time.

Special Commissioner of Police Praveer Ranjan submitted that the police had registered 48 cases related to rioting, following which Mr. Mehta said all stakeholders were currently working to ensure normalcy and that any hurried intervention might not be conducive.

Mr. Mehta said the petitioner “in his wisdom” had picked only three speeches and that the police had received a large number of speeches alleged to be inflammatory in nature.

Petitioner’s plea

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, representing the petitioner, sought immediate registration of FIRs against anyone who had indulged in hate speech, to send across a strong message. Earlier, protests were going on very peacefully, with the exception of traffic snarls and some small incidents, but the impugned slogans changed the whole thing. Provocative speeches were made by people who held high positions in party and the government. Those videos became viral. The implication was that it was alright to kill, he said.

“We want an order very quickly...it is indisputable that the statements were made. It is a clear cut and prima facie case that it is hate speech resulting in murder...”, he said.

Advocate Chetan Sharma, who appeared for Lawyers' Voice that has filed another petition seeking FIRS against several others on allegations of hate speech, interjected, after which Mr. Gonsalves said action should be taken against anybody making such speeches to send a strong message.

On Wednesday, the Bench comprising Justice S. Muralidhar asked the police to take a “conscious decision” on registering FIRs after watching all the videos, “not limited to the videos played in the Court, but any other videos that might be provided to them and which they perhaps already are in possession”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ezdvud/article30644521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DelhiHC-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-hc-to-hear-plea-for-firs-against-3-bjp-leaders-on-april-13/article30931718.ece
73,2020/02/27,"BJP responsible for Delhi violence, does politics by ‘spreading hatred’: Akhilesh","The death toll in the violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in areas in northeast Delhi increased to 34

Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Thursday blamed the BJP for the communal violence in the national capital, saying this is their “Gujarat model”, and alleged that the saffron party does politics “by spreading hatred”.

The death toll in the violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in areas in northeast Delhi increased to 34 on Thursday, and over 200 people are injured.

“BJP is responsible for the riots. It’s their Gujarat model, which is nothing but spreading hatred,” Mr. Yadav said when asked about the violence in Delhi.

“When the U.S. President was here and lakhs of policemen were deployed, how can a riot happen? Had the government and police wanted, the riots could not have happened. It’s their failure that they even could not control riots in Delhi,” he said.

The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister attacked the BJP, saying they do politics “by threatening and spreading hatred” and divide society and play the Hindu-Muslim card.

“They are damaging brotherhood to divert attention. When there is a riot no will ask about roads, development, employment, investment and black money”, Yadav said

On Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, “The chief minister does not know political dignity.

74,2020/02/27,"Stop irresponsible comments on Delhi violence, India tells U.S. critics","MEA statement comes hours after leading figures voiced concern over riots in the capital.

India has urged U.S. Congressional outfits and leading figures to avoid making “irresponsible” statements about the communal riots in the national capital.

The statement from the Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs came hours after leading figures of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and Democrat presidential candidate Bernie Sanders expressed serious concern about the violence in Delhi, which has claimed around 33 lives so far.

“Our law enforcement agencies are working on the ground to prevent violence and ensure restoration of confidence and normalcy. Senior representatives of the government have been involved in that process. Prime Minister has publicly appealed for peace and brotherhood,” said Raveesh Kumar, Official Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs.

The exchange of words came two days after India hosted U.S. President Donald Trump, who had refused to be drawn into the debate about the new controversial citizenship law, which has been at the centre of a nationwide protest in recent months. The riot in Delhi began when Mr. Trump was visiting Ahmedabad and Agra and continued during his 36-hour long stay in India. Hours after Mr. Trump’s departure, the U.S. Embassy issued an advisory urging citizens to be cautious while visiting India.

Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to comment on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 was criticised by Mr. Sanders, who said, “This is a failure of leadership on human rights.”

The Ministry of External Affairs took note of the comments and said such statements were “irresponsible”.

“These are factually inaccurate and misleading, and appear to be aimed at politicising the issue,” said Mr. Kumar, referring to the series of criticism from the U.S. about the evolving situation in the Indian capital.

Earlier, Congressman Eliot Engel had expressed the right to protest is a key aspect of democracy and that the Indian police must ensure the safety of all. In a social media message, he said, “Deeply troubled by the deaths from the communal violence in India over the past couple of days.”

Tony Perkins, Chair of USCIRF, had expressed concern about the safety of Indian citizens saying, “The ongoing violence we are witnessing in Delhi and the reported attacks against Muslims, their homes and shops and their houses of worship are greatly disturbing. We urge the Indian government to take serious efforts to protect Muslims and others targeted by mob violence.”

Commissioner Anurima Bhargava of the USCIRF was the most forceful and asked India to act swiftly to stop the violence targeted against the Muslim community. “The brutal and unchecked violence growing across Delhi cannot continue. The Indian government must take swift action to ensure the safety of all of its citizens,” said Ms. Bhargava.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/stop-irresponsible-comments-on-delhi-violence-india-tells-us-critics/article30929884.ece
75,2020/02/27,BJP vs Bernie Sanders duel defused,"Angered by Democrat leader’s criticism, BJP leader B.L. Santosh threatens party will ‘play a role’ in U.S. elections, then deletes tweet.

In a strong response to criticism from U.S. Democrat leader Bernie Sanders, a senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader threatened that the ruling party would be “compelled” to wade into U.S. Presidential elections. The tweet, which was later deleted without further comment, threatens to pit the ruling party against the opposition Democrats in the upcoming election, much as BJP-allied groups in the U.K. were accused of campaigning against the Opposition Labour Party in the elections in December.

“How much ever neutral we wish to be, you compel us to play a role in Presidential elections,” wrote B.L. Santosh, the BJP’s general secretary in charge of organisation on Twitter on Thursday morning. “Sorry to say so…But you are compelling us,” he added.

Mr. Santosh was reacting to a tweet by Mr. Sanders, who had called U.S. President Donald Trump’s response to the violence sparked by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) “a failure of leadership.”

“Over 200 million Muslims call India home. Widespread anti-Muslim mob violence has killed at least 27 and injured many more. Trump responds by saying, “That’s up to India. This is a failure of human rights,” Mr. Sanders said.

In answer to a question on the violence at a press conference in New Delhi on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that he would “leave it to India” to deal with the CAA and the protests, adding that he had not discussed the violence in Delhi with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Mr. Sanders has criticised Mr. Modi on several occasions, including writing an op-ed that appeared in the Houston Chronicle on the day of the previous Trump-Modi joint rally, “Howdy Modi” in Houston last September, where he had referred to the U.S.’s “deafening silence on Kashmir”.

Earlier this week, Mr. Sanders’ Foreign Policy adviser Indian-American Representative Ro Khanna had also said that while India remained an important strategic ally, the “India that has captured the imagination of the world, and the world respects, is the India of 1947, an India shaped by Gandhi and Nehru. It’s not the India of the eleventh century. Any effort to undermine India’s conception as a pluralistic democracy and go back to the medieval ages will not be in India’s interest.”

The Modi government has also expressed its disapproval of the Democrat leader Pramila Jayapal’s decision to bring a U.S. Congress Resolution on Kashmir last year, and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had refused to attend a House Foreign Affairs Committee meeting as she had been invited as well. Ms. Jayapal’s resolution now has 62 co-sponsors, including 5 Republicans, but has not yet been brought for a vote.

Last year, The Hindu had reported that the British government had formally “expressed its concerns” to the Ministry of External Affairs and to the BJP’s Foreign Affairs Cell about comments made by a leader affiliated to the BJP calling for British-Indians to vote for the Conservative Party, and against the Labour Party for its resolution criticising the decision to nullify Article 370.

At the time, Ministry of External Affairs sources had said that the “Election is an internal matter of U.K. People who voted in the elections are all U.K. nationals.

76,2020/02/27,Justice S. Muralidhar’s transfer triggers war of words,"Congress party alleges foul play, Law Minister says due process has been followed.

The late Wednesday notification of the Law Ministry, notifying the transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar from the Delhi High Court to the Punjab and Haryana High Court triggered a political war of words on Thursday between the Union government and the Congress party.

The principal Opposition party alleged that the government’s move was aimed at saving Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders since it came barely hours after a Bench comprising Justice Muralidhar and Justice Talwant Singh came down heavily on the Delhi Police for not registering a case against BJP leaders like Kapil Mishra, Pravesh Verma and Union Minister Anurag Thakur for making hate speeches.

‘Routine, recommended’

Terming the transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar as “routine and on the recommendation of the Supreme Court Collegium’s decision of February 12”, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday accused the Congress of politicising the issue.

Law Ministry officials also pointed out that Justice R.V. Malimath of the Karnataka High Court was transferred to Uttarakhand and Justice R.V. More of the Bombay High Court to Meghalaya, along with Justice Muralidhar.

The Ministry, late on Wednesday night, had the notified the transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his signatures to the order.

Questioning the transfer, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi also dragged in late Judge B. H. Loya by “remembering” him in a tweet.

Justice Loya’s death

Judge Loya, who died of a heart attack in December 2014, was handling the encounter case of Sohrabuddin Sheikh in which Home Minister Amit Shah was an accused but subsequently discharged.

The Congress had levelled allegations of foul play surrounding the 47-year-old Judge Loya’s death — the party wanted a probe but the higher judiciary did not order any such investigation.

“Remembering the brave Judge Loya, who wasn’t transferred,” former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted in a dig at the government over the transfer of Justice Muralidhar.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hit back at Mr. Gandhi and the Congress in a series of tweets.

“The Loya judgment has been well settled by the Supreme Court. Those raising questions do not respect the judgment of the Apex Court pronounced after elaborate arguments. Does Rahul Gandhi consider himself above even the Supreme Court?” asked Mr. Prasad.

“Transfer of Honourable Justice Muralidhar was done pursuant to the recommendation dated 12.02.2020 of the Supreme Court collegium headed by Chief Justice of India. While transferring the judge consent of the judge is taken. The well settled process has been followed,” he tweeted.

‘Politicised’

“By politicising a routine transfer, Congress has yet again displayed its scant regard for the judiciary. People of India have rejected Congress Party and hence it is hell bent on destroying the very institutions India cherishes by constantly attacking them,” the Law Minister added.

Attacking the Congress for its role in undermining the judiciary during Emergency, Mr. Prasad alleged that “they [Congess] rejoice only when the judgment is of their liking otherwise raise questions on the institutions itself”.

Using strong words, the Law Minister said, “The party, which is the private property of one family, has no right to lecture about objectionable speeches. The family and its cronies have routinely used the harshest words against the Courts, the Army, the CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General), the PM and the people of India.”

‘Judiciary undermined’

The Minister’s response came after Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala, at a press conference, listed out examples of “how the government was undermining the judiciary”.

“The Modi government maliciously blocked the recommendation of the Supreme Court Collegium in appointing Justice K.M. Joseph as a Supreme Court Judge after a Bench of Uttarakhand High Court headed by him had quashed the illegal decision of the Modi Government in imposing President’s rule in Uttarakhand. The government had also blocked the recommendation of the Supreme Court Collegium on Justice Akil Qureshi, whose order had led to detention of Amit Shah in the year 2010,” alleged Mr. Surjewala.

‘A dictatorship’

Congress general secretary K. C. Venugopal called the transfer “malicious” and it was done because an impartial investigation would have exposed the complicity of the Prime Minister and the Home Minister in the recent Delhi riots.

“The country is witnessing a dictatorship which is continuously gaining ground, wherein not only democratic institutions but the judiciary itself is blatantly suppressed and undermined. Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah must make it clear as to why are they afraid of an impartial and fair investigation,” he said in a statement.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pkj2is/article30455047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2TH-RAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/justice-s-muralidhars-transfer-triggers-war-of-words/article30929101.ece

The Law Ministry late on Wednesday notified the transfer of Justice S. Muralidhar from Delhi High Court to Punjab and Haryana High Court after President Ram Nath Kovind gave his signatures to the order.

But the timing of the transfer has become controversial as the Congress accused the Central government of transferring Justice Muralidhar after a Bench comprising him and Justice Talwant Singh came down heavily on the Delhi police for not registering a case against BJP leaders for their hate speeches.

After the Law Ministry’s notification, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi not only attacked the government but also ‘remembered’ judge B.H. Loya, who died following a heart attack in December 2014 while he was handling the encounter case of Sohrabuddin Sheikh in which Home Minister Amit Shah’s name also figured.

Mr. Shah was discharged in the case but the Congress had levelled allegation of ‘foul play’ surrounding the death of 47-year-old judge Loya.

“Remembering the brave Judge Loya, who wasn’t transferred,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted, in a dig at the government over the transfer of the Delhi High Court judge.

India on Thursday evacuated its nationals from Wuhan and brought back those who were quarantined on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked off Yokohama in Japan.

The evacuations were conducted even as Indian nationals in Iran demanded to be evacuated after India restricted all civilian flights from Tehran because of the COVID-19 outbreak that prompted widespread cancellation of tickets.

A civilian aircraft evacuated 119 Indian nationals and five foreign citizens — two from Sri Lanka and one each from Nepal, South Africa and Peru — who were quarantined on board the cruise ship. A government release said two Indian crew members did not board the special flight as they wanted to complete the extended quarantine period put in place by the Government of Japan.

“Appreciate the facilitation of Japanese authorities. Thank you Air India once again,” said External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, announcing the evacuation from Japan.

Mr. Jaishankar announced that an Indian Air Force C-17 aircraft brought back 76 nationals from Wuhan on Thursday after delivering 15 tonnes of medical cargo to the Chinese authorities. The Government said that the assistance to China was as agreed during the discussion between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping on February 8.

“On its return from Wuhan the IAF Flight also brought back 76 Indian nationals [including 3 Indian Embassy officials who were on ground in Wuhan to coordinate the evacuation] and 36 foreign nationals, including from some of our neighbouring countries who had sought assistance in travelling,” said the Ministry of External Affairs in a press release.

Iran crisis

Even as India battled the COVID-19 threat by evacuating nationals and placing them in quarantined facility, a new crisis has emerged on the Iranian front with Indian nationals complaining of large scale cancellation of air tickets after India restricted entry of Iranian airlines into India.

Huda Fayaz, an Indian medical student in the Kish island of Iran, complained that Indians who had booked air tickets to return home are unable to board flights as Iranian airlines like Mahan Air have been restricted from entering Indian airspace. “Kish is located far from Tehran, but there is no quarantine procedures in place here and people from Tehran are travelling here freely and therefore we are very worried about our safety and want to return home as soon as possible,” said Ms. Fayaz over phone.

A large number of Iranians are affected by the virus and several countries in the Gulf have placed restrictions on the movement of passengers from Iran. Indian embassies in the region are conducting public outreach to spread awareness about the spread of the virus and the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi has issued an advisory for the Indian community in the Gulf nation to help prevent the spread of the disease.

India has so far flown three sorties for evacuation of citizens from Wuhan, which is the epicentre of the COVID-19 crisis of China.

79,2020/02/27,Govt decides to lift ban on onion exports,"In September 2019, the government banned onion exports and also imposed a MEP of USD 850 per tonne

The government on Wednesday decided to lift the nearly six-month-old ban on export of onions in a bid to protect the interests of farmers as prices are likely to fall sharply due to bumper rabi crop.

Sources said the decision was taken at a meeting of a Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by Home Minister Amit Shah.

“Since the price of onion has stabilised and there is bumper onion crop, government has decided to lift ban on export of onions. Expected monthly harvest in March is over 40 lakh MT compared to 28.4 lakh MT last year,” Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said in a tweet on Wednesday.

The lifting of ban would be effective once the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) issues a notification in this regard.

The GoM on Wednesday also deliberated on whether to reduce or scrap the Minimum Export Price (MEP) on onion to facilitate outbound shipments, the sources said.

The MEP is the rate below which no exports are allowed.

Mr. Paswan, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba were present at the meeting.

In September 2019, the government banned onion exports and also imposed a MEP of USD 850 per tonne. The move came after prices had started skyrocketing due to supply-demand mismatch.

81,2020/02/27,Delhi violence a chilling reminder of 2002 Gujarat riots: Yechury,"The violence in Delhi is a “chilling reminder” of the 2002 Gujarat riots, when the current Prime Minister Narendra Modi was the Chief Minister of the State, said CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury.

In a joint press conference with the CPI general secretary D. Raja, Mr. Yechury claimed that it is clear that the violence in Delhi has the sanction of the police and that of the ""powers that govern them"". Both the parties said that there is a need to deploy the Army in the capital to bring the situation under control as the Delhi police has proven to be “completely ineffectual.”

""What is happening in Delhi now is a chilling replay of 2002 Gujarat riots, when the current Prime Minister was the State Chief Minister,"" said Mr. Yechury.

On behalf of the Samajwadi Party, the DMK, the NCP and other opposition leaders, he also sought an appointment with President Ramnath Kovind to discuss the violence that left over 20 persons dead.

Both Mr. Yechury and Mr. Raja slammed Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

“If the National Security Advisor (NSA) is supposed to be in charge of the Delhi police, then what is the role of the Home Minister? Has the government conceded that Home Minister Amit Shah is incapable of handling Delhi violence,” said Mr. Yechury, adding that the violence was not “spontaneous”, as it was being made out to be and there was clear provocation by BJP leaders like Kapil Mishra and others.

Mr. Raja said that Mr Shah is solely responsible for the situation in the national capital. “The situation demands that the Supreme Court must act suo motu, order a thorough probe and consider deployment of Army,” he added. He also appealed to all secular parties to come together to lend confidence to people.

82,2020/02/27,Delhi violence similar to Gujarat riots: Digvijaya,"He says RSS and Islamic fundamentalist groups are the two faces of the same coin

Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday drew a parallel between the violence in New Delhi and the 2002 Gujarat riots. To drive home his point, he quoted former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Dwarka Prasad Mishra, “Communal riots cannot take place without the complicity and/or connivance of the administration/government.” Pointing to Mr. Mishra’s “politico administrative acumen”,

Mr. Singh tweeted, “This is what we saw in Gujarat in 2002 and now we are seeing in Delhi in 2020. Sad.”

Mr. Singh said that during his 10-year tenure as Chief Minister, “there was no communal riot” in the State. “I took strong action against anyone who incited violence, irrespective of his or her religion,” he said. “...whether it was RSS/VHP/Bajrang Dal or SIMI/or any other Islamic Religious Fundamentalist Organisation. Both are two faces of the same coin,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-violence-similar-to-gujarat-riots-digvijaya/article30917188.ece
83,2020/02/27,When to call in the Army,"Armed Forces are called in by civil power when public security is in “manifest danger” from an unlawful assembly

The Armed Forces are called in by the civil power when public security is in “manifest danger” from an unlawful assembly which is refusing to disperse despite the efforts of police forces.

The procedure for use of Armed Forces to disperse a mob bent on violence is provided in Sections 130 to 132 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) of 1973. The Defence Service Regulations also act as an extensive guide to procedure for calling in the Armed Forces and also how they should operate while on duty, especially if they have to use fire power to restore peace.

Step-by-step process

Chapter 10 of the CrPC under the title ‘Maintenance of Public Order and Tranquillity’ provide the step-by-step process for calling in the Armed Forces for help. The first provision in the chapter, Section 129, deals with the dispersal of a violent mob using civil forces.

However, if this happen to fail, Section 130 steps in. The provision empowers the “Executive Magistrate of the highest rank,” in situations of gravest danger to public security, to write to “any officer-in-command of any group of persons belonging to the Armed Forces to disperse the assembly with the help of the Armed Forces under his command.” Rioters can also be arrested or confined in order to either disperse the mob or punish them in accordance with the law.

The provision allows the Armed Forces officer-in-command concerned to comply with the Magistrate’s requisition for aid in a manner “as he thinks fit.” But in dispersing the unlawful assembly and restoring calm, the Armed Forces should use as “little force” as possible and causing as “little injury to person and property as may be consistent with dispersing the assembly and arresting and detaining such persons.”

Incommunicado situation

Section 131 considers a situation in which the Executive Magistrate is somehow incommunicado and the riot situation is full-blown. In such cases, “any commissioner or gazetted officer of the Armed Forces may disperse the unlawful assembly with the help of the Armed Forces under his command.” But the officer has to comply with the instructions of the Magistrate once communication is established with the latter.

Section 132 protects the officers and members of the Armed Forces from prosecution for acts done in good faith in the course of their duties to contain the riot.

The Defence Service Regulations specifies that requisition for help from the civilian power to the Armed Forces officer should either be in writing or by telegram. The Forces should immediately come to the aid of the civil power for maintenance of law and order.

The strength and composition of the force, the amount of ammunition, arms and equipment to be taken and the manner of carrying out the operations are matters for the Armed Forces alone.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/when-to-call-in-the-army/article30926989.ece

Earlier in the day, the Delhi High Court asked why the police had not filed a First Information Report (FIR) for the hate speech made by three BJP leaders in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly election, including Mr. Thakur’s slogan of “desh ke gaddaro ko [traitors of the country]”, to which the crowd had responded, “goli maaro saalon ko [shoot the traitors]”.

When a journalist asked Mr. Thakur for his reaction to the court’s remarks, Ms. Sitharaman intervened immediately. “No reaction,” she said.

85,2020/02/27,Gehlot supports demand for Amit Shah’s resignation,"Rajasthan CM says the Union Home Minister did nothing to restore normalcy in Delhi

Lambasting the Bhartiya Janata Party government at the Centre over the ongoing violence in Delhi, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday extended support to Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s demand for Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation for his inability to control the situation.

“The Home Minister should resign on moral grounds as he did nothing to save lives and restore normalcy. Delhi has been burning and we see no action [from Mr. Shah],” Mr. Gehlot tweeted. He said the violence in Delhi was a result of “inflammatory speeches” and “provocative statements” made by BJP leaders.

‘Vicious environment’

Mr. Gehlot alleged that BJP leaders had purposely created a “vicious environment” of hatred and fear while the authorities remained a mute spectator. “The Central and Delhi governments must respond to questions raised by Ms. Gandhi. As a responsible Opposition party, Congress is ready to extend complete support in maintaining peace,” he said.

Pointing out the tradition of the ruling party taking along all others across the political spectrum, Mr. Gehlot said the BJP government had “zero interest” in confidence building measures, neither among the political parties nor with the citizens, even though it was in the national interest.

Liaison groups

Earlier, Mr. Gehlot directed the police force to remain vigilant on the law and order front and asked the Director-General of Police to hold meetings of community liaison groups at all police stations to ensure peace in their respective areas. “No anti-social element will be allowed to indulge in violence anywhere in Rajasthan,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gehlot-supports-demand-for-amit-shahs-resignation/article30925936.ece
86,2020/02/27,COVID-19: IAF aircraft lands in Wuhan with medical supplies,"Centre issues travel advisory for South Korea, Italy, Iran

India on Wednesday sent a heavy lift military transport aircraft to the COVID-19-hit Wuhan in China. The Indian Air Force’s (IAF) C-17 Globemaster III aircraft carried 15 tonnes of medical supplies and will bring back around 120 citizens and five infants while flying back on Thursday.

Apart from the Indian nationals, the flight is also expected to bring back citizens of neighbouring countries. An Indian based in Wuhan said the Indian Embassy in Beijing had asked the citizens to remain ready for evacuation and the official process was underway till late Wednesday evening.

India had reached out to China on February 13 seeking permission for sending the aircraft with medical supplies. But it subsequently accused China of deliberately delaying the process, causing considerable friction between the two sides. However, China had rejected India’s charge and said the delay arose due to complications in the process on ground.

A Chinese source familiar with the exchanges, said that there was no ""deliberate delay"" for flight permission to Wuhan. ""The Chinese side takes it seriously regarding the health and safety of the foreign nationals like its own citizens including Indian students in China,"" said a Chinese source.

This is the third aircraft that India has sent for evacuation of citizens from the COVID-19-hit region.

Meanwhile, the Union Health Ministry on Wednesday issued an additional travel advisory stating that Indians should refrain from non-essential travel to Republic of Korea (South Korea), Iran and Italy. “People coming from Republic of Korea, Iran and Italy or having such travel history since 10th February 2020 may be quarantined for 14 days on arrival to India,” noted the release.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fo7wqu/article30926717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Photo-3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-iaf-aircraft-lands-in-wuhan-with-medical-supplies/article30926718.ece
87,2020/02/27,"At Haryana’s Harappan site of Rakhigarhi, anxiety trumps history","Villagers fear loss of land, as Centre moves to turn Harappan site into tourist hub.

Looking at the mounds at the Harappan site of Rakhigarhi, where locals dry cow dung cakes and dump garbage, there is little to show the thousands of years of history beneath. But the Centre is moving ahead with its plan to develop the site as a tourist hub and set up a museum, and this has got residents in two villages in Haryana’s Hisar district — Rakhi Khas and Rakhi Shahpur — known as Rakhigarhi worried.

After Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the government’s plan to fund five on-site museums, including the under-construction museum initiated by the Haryana government at Rakhigarhi, in her Budget speech on February 1, there is excitement and concern here. The Archaeological Survey of India has started planning the project. Union Tourism and Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel visited the site on Sunday and spoke to villagers about their concerns.

“If Dholavira changed history, Rakhigarhi is changing history for the second time. People in Delhi will have to visit Rakhigarhi,” Mr. Patel said, adding that the government would work with the villagers to address their concerns as the tourist hub is formed.

A former sarpanch, or local head, Dinesh, told the Minister, “We are happy that there will be work in our villages, but we are scared about what will happen to us. Already, people are anxious about the rehabilitation of homes around mound number four and five.”

The ASI has been able to get under its control just 83.5 acres of the 350-hectare site that spans 11 mounds, after first taking over the site in 1996, due to encroachments and pending court cases, said ASI Chandigarh Circle Superintending Archaeologist Zulfeqar Ali. The site is under ASI protection.

“If encroachments are removed, the cow dung on the mounds will also shift,” he said, adding that about 5% of the site had been excavated so far by the ASI and Deccan College, Pune. Among the findings, which indicate both early and mature Harappan phases, were a 4,600-year-old female skeleton, fortification and bricks.

As part of encroachment removal, 152 households are being shifted to flats, Hisar Deputy Commissioner Priyanka Soni told The Hindu.

Tensions may rise

But, many villagers say that is not enough and if the rehabilitation scheme is a sign of things to come, there may be more tension over future projects.

“They aren’t giving us adequate space. If they are taking away a 500 square-yard house, they are giving us a 100-square yard flat in return. And what about the space to dry cow dung cakes? There is no talk of alternative land for that,” said Sewa Singh, a farmer and resident.

Mr. Patel ended his meeting with the villagers with the assurance that the government would not make public its “action plan” for the site without telling the panchayat. He said that all five archaeological sites mentioned in the Budget – Rakhigarhi, Hastinapur in Uttar Pradesh, Shivsagar in Assam, Dholavira in Gujarat and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu – would be developed into “iconic sites” simultaneously.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/va6raj/article30926621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THRDRAKHI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/at-haryanas-harappan-site-of-rakhigarhi-anxiety-trumps-history/article30926622.ece
88,2020/02/27,‘Jilted lover’ lands in trouble,"He creates fake fire accident scene, ‘kidnaps’ girl

In an incident that appears to be straight out of a crime thriller, a jilted lover enacted a drama to fake a fire accident scene to kidnap a girl, but landed in police dragnet after his attempt boomerangs in Kadapa district on Wednesday. The accused, Derangula Krishna Mohan (33), used skull and bones for his ‘drama’.

According to the police, the accused, an engineering graduate started off as an assistant professor in a private college, but finally settled as a ward secretary in Fakirpalli of Kadapa city. He fell in love with a girl (21), a student in his college, and followed her to Bengaluru, where she moved to pursue courses like Java, was pestering her to marry him. On learning about the harassment, the girl’s parents brought her home.

Parents alerted

Finding the girl alone at home on Wednesday, Krishna Mohan sneaked into the house by wearing a burqa and ‘kidnapped’ her. On alerted by the watchful neighbours, her parents lodged a police complaint.

Te police, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police (Kadapa twn) U. Suryanarayana, were aghast on seeing bones and a skull, with a candle kept next to an open LPG refill and the girl’s spare dress drenched in petrol at her house. He allegedly made all it to divert the attention of the police. The timely police action prevented what could have otherwise been a certain cylinder blast.

Mr. Suryanarayana formed two teams and rushed them to Nellore and Vellore (Tamil Nadu). Using technology, the accused was traced near Vellore railway station and was arrested around noon on Thursday. “The kidnapper tried to fake an accident that however failed. His plan was to mislead the police and her parents that the girl died in the fire accident,” Mr. Suryanarayana said, while producing the accused before the media on Thursday.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/zd9ulk/article30935785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28ONGCASE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jilted-lover-lands-in-trouble/article30935786.ece

The outbreak of coronavirus in China will hit hard the global economy, including India, according to Prof. P. Venkat Rao, Vikrama Simhapuri University.

Delivering the valedictory address at a UGC-sponsored national seminar on ‘Global Turbulence: India’s Preparedness’ organised by the Andhra Kesari Tanguturi Prakasam University here on Thursday, he observed that the growing interdependence among the global economies invited threat of spread of financial distress from one market to the other. The country sourced electronic goods, consumer goods, auto components and pharma bulk drugs from the eastern neighbour.

He underscored the need for India importing goods from multiple sources and diversifying its exports to more number of countries. It was all the more important to develop indigenous technologies to meet food and other basic needs of the people. But, by and large, the impact of the global turbulence was less than that of other countries in view of continental dimension of the Indian domestic market. India could reap demographic dividend by skilling the youth, he explained.

In all, 46 papers were presented on various aspects including India’s preparedness to counter global shocks, impact of global financial crises on Indian banking system and future of India amidst global turbulence, integration of Indian stock market with world stock markets and impact of global recession on India’s exports, seminar director B.

91,2020/02/27,YSRCP leader arrested for assault on ward secretariat staff,"Employees stage protest demanding action against him

The Chittoor West police on Thursday arrested a local leader of the YSR Congress Party, Prakash Reddy, on charges of assaulting and abusing the staff at the ward secretariat under the Chittoor municipal corporation limits on Wednesday evening.

According to information, Prakash Reddy of the 21st division had on Wednesday evening visited the ward secretariat and reportedly picked up an argument with a woman staff member, and reportedly abused the employee, over the sacking of a ward volunteer. When the staff tried to pacify him saying that the issue would be taken to the notice of the higher officials, the party leader, who got further enraged, had resorted to slapping two men on duty.

As the working hours were already over by then, the ward secretariat staff had approached the Chittoor West police and lodged a complaint against Prakash Reddy late in the evening. As a sequel to this, the staff, with the support of the ward secretariats under the corporation limits, staged a protest in front of the municipal corporation office on Thursday morning. A video footage pertaining to Prakash Reddy’s abusive language and physical attack on the staff was circulated to the media and the police personnel.

Circle inspector Lakshmikanth said that based on the complaint from the ward secretariat staff, a criminal case was registered against Prakash Reddy and he was arrested and remanded.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-leader-arrested-for-assault-on-ward-secretariat-staff/article30935683.ece
92,2020/02/27,Collector kick-starts 45-day Praja Abhivrudhi Yatra,"Gandham Chandrudu inspects functioning of Grama Sachivalayam

Kick-starting a 45-day ‘Praja Pragathi Yatra’ (abhivrudhi, sankshema) to get first-hand information on the implementation of a number of welfare and development schemes, the District Collector on Thursday initiated a long spell of continuous tour of different villages keeping intact an element of surprise.

At the first stop in Gandlaparthi in Rapthadu mandal, Collector Gandham Chandrudu inspected the functioning of Grama Sachivalayam and interacted with the elderly people who were present there on any difficulties they faced in getting pensions. After inspecting the various registers and online redressal of complaints received at the Spandana during a brief stop, he headed to the M. Bandameedapalli to get feedback on the preparations done for distribution of house site pattas to 87 beneficiaries.

“In the olden days District Collectors used to ride horses or animal-driven carts to reach out to people in the far-off places and stayed in Circuit Houses specially built for this purpose as returning same day was impossible. Taking the spirit of those visits and tours by those administrators, I wish to get a feel of my own administration and test the dedication of the ground staff at the implementation level,” the Collector said. District Panchayat Officer Ramanath Reddy also accompanied him on the tour.

Complaints

The villagers made a beeline for the Grama Sachivalayam and expressed their happiness at government services coming to their doorstep. There were general complaints of some people being stripped of pensions, but none from the crowd came forward with any specific issue.

Panchayat secretary Arun Kumar said disbursement of pensions was the most-liked service for the villagers as on February 1, 90% of them could receive it and the others who were out of village, got it the next day. Earlier, they had to travel up to Rapthadu and make at least two trips to get their pension amount, which was now being delivered at their door-step.

A cross-check on the way the Health Assistant and Horticulture Assistant functioned, turned out to be satisfactory. “It was heartening to see things falling into place very early and a majority of the village secretariats turning out to be hubs of busy activity providing all kinds of services,” Mr. Chandrudu summed up.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/q5ufr7/article30935676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28VJATYATRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/collector-kick-starts-45-day-praja-abhivrudhi-yatra/article30935677.ece

An MoU signed between the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) is set to give a fillip to the conservation of migratory birds which are found in large numbers along the coastal wetlands of the State.

BNHS is the country’s premier bird conservation society with an overreaching mission to conserve migratory birds with special emphasis on Central Asian Flyway. The MoU includes bird monitoring, management of habitats and training of forest personnel.

Chief Wildlife Warden and Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, D. Nalini Mohan and Director, BNHS, signed an MoU on the sidelines of Conference of Parties (CoP) on Migratory Species (CMS) held at Gandhinagar in Gujarat.

“The Forest Department has been working with premier institutes like Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History, Coimbatore in conservation of birds at Pulicat in Nellore district and Telineelapuram in Srikakulum district. Our personnel will be trained in technology transfer like ringing of birds, which is globally recognised,” said Mr.Nalini Kumar.

The MoU will boost conservation of migratory birds, which over many years, have made the wetlands across the 950 km coastline of the state as their nesting places. Spot-billed pelicans, White Ibis, Open-billed storks, Night herons, Little coromont are some of the migratory birds that are present in Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary, Nelapattu Bird Sanctuary, Nellore, Uppalapadu in Guntur, to name a few wetlands.

Some of the unique conservation measures followed by the A.P. Forest Department have come in for praise at the CoP-CMS meet held recently. Union Minister for Forest, Environment, Prakash Javadekar, said that the art of peaceful co-existence and conservation measures at Kolleru is a role model for the rest of the country.

Calling upon youth to stand up for the rights of common people and downtrodden communities, Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan said graduates should be mindful of the welfare of these sections.

“Everyone talks of fundamental duties, but what about the rights of common people and downtrodden people? Do they have the strength to knock on the doors of courts? ’’ Mr. Harichandan said in an extempore address at the 35 and 36th convocations of Acharya Nagarjuna University on Thursday.

The Governor also made a reference to the sacrifices made by freedom fighters and hailed the contribution of Mahatma Gandhi and Subhash Chandra Bose.

The Governor said he has seen Andhra Pradesh as one of the progressive and modern States which continues to sustain the legacy of pursuing knowledge and scholarship.

A.P. too had played a leading role in the freedom struggle and continued to produce a number of outstanding leaders and parliamentarians enriching democracy and the discourse of social and cultural enrichment.

The Governor also praised the role ANU Acharya Nagarjuna University has been playing in moulding students.

Calling upon graduates to chart their own course, Mr. Harichandan, quoting Gautama Buddha, said: “Be your own light.”

Innovation mantra

The Governor said it was only through innovation, research and development that India could initiate positive transformation in the world and address the problems of poverty, unemployment and discrimination.

“The shortage of faculty has become a severe constraint in the pursuit of excellence in education. Across the nation there is a shortage of 50 % in all universities and colleges,” he said.

Chairman, DRDO and secretary to Department of Defence G. Sateesh Reddy, who was the chief guest, could not make it.

Minister for Human Resource Development A. Suresh said the State government had been working in a mission mode for the development of higher education. Changes in curricula and introduction of degree honours would go a long way in making graduates employable.

Vice-Chancellor P. Rajasekhar said the university is now accredited with NAAC ‘A’ grade and offers 66 PG programmes, and M. Phil and Ph. D research programmes in 48 disciplines.

97,2020/02/27,Tension as YSRCP workers block Chandrababu Naidu at Visakhapatnam Airport,"The former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister is scheduled to hold a meeting with farmers at Pendurthi and in Vizianagaram later in the day

Tense situation continues to prevail at Visakhapatnam Airport on Thursday, as a large number of leaders and workers belonging to the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) prevented Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president N. Chandrababu Naidu from going to Pinagadi village in Pendurthi mandal in Viskhapatnam district.

The former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister is scheduled to hold a meeting with farmers at Pendurthi and in Vizianagaram later in the day.

The YSRCP leaders and workers tried to hurl eggs and tomatoes at Mr. Naidu’s convoy. Earlier, a similar protest was directed at former TDP Minister K. Atchannaidu’s vehicle.

Early in the morning, a large number of TDP and YSRCP workers and leaders had assembled at the airport.

Mr. Naidu reached Visakhapatnam Airport around 11.30 a.m and his vehicle was stuck on the road inside the airport till the last reports came at 1 p.m.

Though a large number of policemen, including senior police officers, were at the airport and tight security was arranged all along the route from the airport to Pinagadi, they could not prevent the protesters from reaching the airport.

YSRCP supporters carrying banners and placards ‘Uttarandhra Drohi Chandrababu’ and ‘Go Back Babu’ staged protests near the airport. TDP workers were seen pushing back the YSRCP groups from making their way to the airport terminal building. Many YSRCP and TDP workers were seen engaged in heated arguments.

TDP senior party members, including N. Chinarajappa, K. Atchannaidu, reached the airport to receive Mr. Naidu. Vehicles of TDP South (MLA) Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar and MLA (East) V. Ramakrishna Babu were stopped near the airport and eggs and tomatoes were hurled. The vehicle of Mr. Babu was also damaged by some unidentified miscreants.

At one stage, Mr. Naidu jumped out of the car and tried to walk his way to the main road, but was prevented by his securitymen and the police.

TDP men alleged that it was the failure of the police department and they had intentionally allowed YSRCP members to block Mr. Naidu’s convoy.

TDP leader M. Sribharat asked how the police department allowed such huge number of YSRCP activists to enter the airport premises. He also said that though protesters were blocking the convoy, the policemen were not trying to clear the way.

Alleging that the protesters were “paid artists”, TDP leader Nakka Anand Babu said that the government, local MLAs and police had planned to thwart the party chief’s meeting with the farmers.

It is learnt that a huge number of TDP and YSRC activists have gathered at the meeting place in Pinagadi and Pendurthi MLA and YSRC leader A. Adeep Raj was detained at his home to avoid any untoward incident.

Passengers at the airport faced a lot of inconvenience and had to wait for about an hour before the police and CISF officials could route them out through another gate.

People commuting on the Gajuwaka-NAD stretch also had to bear the brunt, as the blockade led to huge traffic jam.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/u2cs2p/article30930008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/chandrababu-naidu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tension-as-ysrcp-workers-block-chandrababu-naidu-at-visakhapatnam-airport/article30929957.ece

TTD Additional Executive Officer A.V. Dharma Reddy on Wednesday exhorted the merchant community to be courteous towards devotees visiting the hill shrine of Lord Venkateswara.

Addressing bankers and businesspersons at Asthana Mandapam here, Mr. Dharma Reddy underlined the need for reducing the use of plastic. The TTD was toying with the idea of introducing jute and cloth bags as an alternative for laddu covers and substituting plastic water bottles with ones made of copper, steel and eco-friendly materials.

The TTD on an average receives ₹5 crore in the form of coins a month as proceeds from the temple hundi which is deposited in various banks. To enhance the circulation of the coins and thereby reduce the growing burden on the banks, he urged the traders to encourage them as a medium of exchange.

Should the traders express their willingness, the bankers would be asked to provide coins of various denominations in sealed packets to be sold to pilgrims. The TTD on its part would promote the use of coins at all its sales counters and places of monetary transactions.

Hoteliers should segregate waste materials into biodegradable, non-biodegradable and bio-medical and employ separate bins for their easy collection and contribute their bit to the upkeep of hygiene in the temple town, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/be-polite-ttd-addl-eo-tells-tirumala-traders/article30926443.ece
101,2020/02/27,"Now, 24 railway coaches can be cleaned in 10 minutes flat!","Automatic washing plant will help save 75% water, says official

Cleaning of the exteriors of a 24-coach train, which otherwise takes about four hours, can now be done in just 10 minutes flat! This will be a reality, once the automatic coach washing plant set up near the Coaching Depot at Kancharapalem at a cost of ₹1.41 crore is commissioned.

The unit will help not only save time, but also reduce water consumption and manpower requirements. The state-of-the-art facility is the first of its kind to be set up in the limits of East Coast Railway (ECoR), the Railways officials say, adding that a similar plant proposed in Puri could not make much headway in view of the delays due to three cyclones hitting Odisha last year.

How it works

The automatic washing plant has four vertical brushes extending up to the height of the coach, two circular brushes for circular movement and scrubbing, and a few other brushes to clean the curved portion at the lower end of the coach exterior.

“The washing plant will result in saving of 70% to 75 % of water used for cleaning of coach exteriors when compared to manual cleaning. The plant is equipped with sensors to track the movement of the coaches and automatically operate the brushes and release water and detergent. The coaches will be moved at a speed of 5 km/hr to ensure thorough cleaning,” says Coaching Depot Officer Mohnish Bramh.

Three-stage cleaning

Furthermore, the waste water treated by the existing 500 kl/day Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) located at the Coaching Depot will be used for the cleaning of the coaches first, while RO water mixed with detergent will be used in the second stage and again fresh water will be used to wash off the detergent foam. Finally, a vertical blower would be used to dry the coach exteriors. The entire process will be completed in just 10 minutes, he explains.

Manual cleaning of the exteriors by two persons, one on either side of a 24-coach train, would take about four hours. “We plan to set up one more 5 kl ETP near the coach washing plant, about 500 metres away from the existing one. This will provide treated water for dedicated use of the washing plant. The end panels of the coaches will, however, have to be cleaned manually as the brushes will not reach that area,” Mr. Mohnish says.

The internal washing and cleaning of the coaches, electrical and other repairs would be undertaken manually in the pit lines at the coaching depot. The plant will be commissioned soon.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/y2idzn/article30926350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-VZ-COACHWASHINGFACILITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/now-24-railway-coaches-canbe-cleaned-in-10-minutes-flat/article30926351.ece
102,2020/02/27,"What did Naidu do to develop north Andhra, asks Botcha","‘TDP president trying to politicise everything to gain cheap mileage’

Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana on Wednesday came down heavily on TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu for trying to “derail development,” and said it was high time for the Leader of the Opposition to embark on self-introspection after his party’s severe drubbing in the 2019 elections.

Ridiculing Mr. Naidu’s plan to undertake Praja Chaitanya Yatra in Vizianagaram district, Mr. Satyanarayana challenged him to disclose his contribution to the development of the backward north Andhra region when he was the Chief Minister for nine years before bifurcation of the State and five years post bifurcation.

Mr. Satyanarayana was speaking at a meeting organised at the party office here under the chairmanship of Anakapalle MLA Gudivada Amarnath to welcome the former chairman of Anakapalle Market Committee, M. Kishore, and others into the YSRCP.

Stating that Mr. Naidu was trying to dupe the people by spreading canards against the YSRCP government despite the success of schemes launched under the Navaratnalu programme, Mr. Satyanarayana said the Leader of the Opposition should have learnt a lesson after the humiliating performance of the TDP in the elections. “Instead, Mr. Naidu is trying to politicise everything to gain cheap mileage,” the Minister alleged.

He denied undertaking any exercise for distribution of house sites under land pooling in Vizianagaram district.

Three capitals

Justifying the formation of three capitals to ensure balanced development of all the regions, he said that Mr. Naidu should disclose who wanted to oppose the location of Visakhapatnam as Executive capital.

“The people here are very happy as Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy wants to make Visakhapatnam compete with developed cities such as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. What’s wrong in it?” he asked.

He also urged people to grill Mr. Naidu on his party’s stand to oppose formation of three capitals.

“People should question Mr. Naidu as to why he does not want development of the backward areas,” he stated.

Mr. Satyanarayana said the government had already prepared an action plan to develop all the regions, and hastened to add that they were firm in implementing it.

He also criticised Mr. Naidu for opposing land pooling in Visakhapatnam, and alleged that the TDP president was also trying to stall distribution of house sites in Amaravati and other areas.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/xim3up/article30926366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27ONG4BOTCHASATYANARAYANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/what-did-naidu-do-to-develop-north-andhra-asks-botcha/article30926339.ece

The State government will soon announce the energy export policy with a view to promoting investments in the energy sector.

The government is of the view that the investors who establish power plants and generate power in the State should be allowed to sell power outside Andhra Pradesh.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who held a review meeting on the power sector on Wednesday, asked the officials to formulate the policy for promoting investments in the energy sector.

“The policy needs to enthuse prospective investors. It should be investor-friendly. The target is to generate more employment and attract investments,” Mr. Reddy said.

Land on lease

Discussing the proposal to give land on lease to the companies, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said it would benefit the landowners as well. The farmers would receive income every year and still enjoy ownership of the land, he added.

Seeking the progress made in the setting up of the 10,000 MW solar power plant in the State, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the officials to take it to its logical conclusion at the earliest.

“Also, complete the feeder automation in the next two years to facilitate nine-hour power supply to the agriculture sector,” he said.

The officials informed the Chief Minister that the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) was ready to increase its power generation by 1,000 MW. Steps were being taken to allocate land for the same, they said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/energy-export-policy-on-the-cards/article30926290.ece

There is not much progress with regard to establishing Franklin Templeton Investments’s full-fledged development centre with own campus in Visakhapatnam even as two years will elapse on March 29 after launching its facility in the city.

Uncertainty clouds the project as there is no clarity with regard to allotment of 40 acres of developed plot near Panorama Hills. Incidentally, Industries and IT Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy immediately after swearing in of the new government flew in to the city to hold talks with the top brass of the leading asset management company and its India partner Innova Solutions.

At the time of launching the facility at Tech Hub (new building of Tech Mahindra), Jenny Johnson, president and COO, Franklin Templeton Investments, along with key officials of the State, had announced that their facility in the city would serve as Centre of Innovation and one of the key tech hubs globally.

It was supposed to focus on building core competencies in investment management data science with a view to gain information advantage and drive investment out-performance. The firm promised to leverage its strategic investment pool to invest in disruptive companies and launch vertical disruptors through a rapid development process where ‘concept to prototype to design/development’ by hiring high-end talent pool from the State.

“Once fully operational, our Vizag centre, set up in collaboration with Innova Solutions, will play a key role in the firm’s technology plans,” a senior official of the company had said during the inauguration of its facility in the city.

Principal Secretary, IT, Electronics and Communication, Kona Sasidhar, during his recent visit to the city, told The Hindu that they had not taken any decision yet on the project.

Land row

The company, founded in 1947 and considered one among five capital markets companies in the world with over 10,000 employees, had promised an investment of $73 million in the State, employment of 2,500 and developed land of 40 acres.

The land was supposed to be allotted in two phases. The project was sanctioned on a fast-track mode by the previous TDP government on January 11, 2018. As per GO, the land was promised at ₹32.5 lakh per acre.

However, a section of YSR Congress Party leaders, including MP Mithun Reddy, had been making allegations that the land allotment was a ‘fraud’ as the previous government wanted to give the valuable land in the city on a golden platter to the company with an ulterior motive.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/uncertainty-dogs-franklin-templeton-project-in-vizag/article30926257.ece

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Mr. Srikanth Reddy said that Mr. Naidu’s language and conduct during the Praja Chaitanya Yatra showed his frustration due to poor response on the one side and the appreciation shown by the people to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s welfare policies on the other.

“We are refraining from hitting back at the TDP as per the directive of Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Mr. Naidu’s bluff has been proven at the Kuppam public meeting, where a youth said that he had to pay ₹1 lakh for online registration,” said Mr. Srikanth Reddy.

He also said that Mr. Naidu had been speaking about “Pulivendula panchayati” and showing the region in a poor light.

“In fact, it is Mr. Naidu who is instigating people to attack our MLAs and MPs. Our Dalit MP was assaulted at Amaravati. Our Tadikonda MLA U. Sridevi was also attacked,” Mr. Srikanth alleged.

Mr. Naidu, through the media close to him, was spreading falsehood without mentioning the welfare schemes being carried out by the State.

The government has plans to set up desalination plants in the coastal belt in collaboration with Israeli company IDE Technologies to overcome drinking water shortage in the State.

IDE Technologies Deputy CEO Lizi Torenstine and other officials called on Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday who stressed the need for utilising only desalinated water for industrial purpose.

He, however, said there should be provision to upgrade the plant to meet drinking water requirements as well. Idea was to ensure not a single drop of water goes waste. “Israel is totally dependent on desalination to meet its water requirements,” he said.

Mr. Jagan asked the Israeli firm to conduct a study to identify suitable places in the State. The process can be kick-started from Visakhapatnam and later other areas can be covered. Vizag Steel Plant can use desalinated water, he added.

An action plan has to be prepared to ensure that all thermal plants use desalinated water, he said.

Huge presence

The company officials were all praise for the Chief Minister for making efforts to solve drinking water shortage in the State and said Israel had started a commercial desalination plant in 1964. The services of IDE Technologies were being utilised by 40 countries across the world. It has been working in India for the past 25 years and providing services to corporate entities such as Essar and Reliance.

The Bengaluru Central Prison has a maximum of 2,023 prisoners suffering from mental disorders. While Hassan district prison has 344 prisoners with mental disorders, Kalaburgi has 336, Tumakuru has 237, and Ballari has 235.

The data was submitted to the court after conducting psychiatric assessment of all the prisoners in the 36 prisons of the total 43 prisons in the State as per the provisions of the Mental Health Care (MHC) Act, 2017. The assessment in seven jails, Gadag and Mandya district prisons, and four taluk prisons is in progress, The court in July last year found that assessment of mental health of prisoners was not done as per the MHC Act as all the prisoners were not subjected to psychiatric assessment when the government had claimed that only 562 prisoners were suffering from mental disorders.

111,2020/02/27,"We will be happy if government contributes to Jesus statue project, says Archbishop","Ramanagaram district administration says no illegality in allotment of 10 acres to trust

Expressing happiness that their stand has been vindicated over the allotment of land for installation of a Jesus Christ statue atop Kapala Betta in Kanakapura, Archbishop of Bengaluru Peter Machado on Thursday said the community would be grateful if the government also contributed to the project.

His response came after the Ramanagaram district administration submitted its report on the legality of allotment of 10 acres to Harobele Kapala Betta Development Trust. The administration is learnt to have said that there has been no illegality or violation in allotment of land. The Bharatiya Janata Party, Hindu Jagarana Vedike, and other groups have raised objections to the project and the government had asked the district administration to look into the land allotment.

“We are happy that the government has done a sincere job of finding the real antecedent. It shows that we have obtained the land legally and most requirement and obligation have been fulfilled. Our stand seems to be vindicated,” Mr. Machado told The Hindu. He further said: “We will be grateful if the government in power helps us to build the statue. We will be encouraged if the government also supports the initiative by perhaps making a contribution.”

Further, he said: “In the past, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had opened avenues for Christians to receive aid. This would be another gesture.”

On the commencement of work on the statue, the Archbishop said: “We will wait for publication of the report. Surely, we will take the government into confidence in whatever has to be done in future.”

The issue [to ascertain the legalities in allotting land for the controversial statue] was thoroughly looked into from various angles, sources said, adding that a host of government personnel from Revenue, Forest, and Mines and Geology were deputed to look into the issue. The allegations made by various Hindu groups were also taken into consideration before finalising the report, sources added.

According to sources, no major violations pertaining to allotment of 10 acres of ‘gomala’ land (land reserved for grazing cattle) were found during the probe conducted prior to preparation of the report.

Revenue Minister R. Ashok said he was yet to look into the report. “Further action will be taken after the report is examined,” he said.

Trouble in another hillock?

Trouble for Christians could be brewing at the Mahima Betta at Dodddasagarahalli village in Devanahalli taluk with the community members allegedly being asked not to utilise four-and-a-half acres that has been allocated for a cemetery. On Thursday, revenue officials also visited the spot for inspection.

According to Archbishop Peter Machado, the land allotted to the community for cemetery is also being used for over 50 years for prayers during the Lenten season and has the cross that has been put up. “Local people have no problem but people from outside are now stating that we have occupied the land. It is similar like Kapala Betta). We do not want any land that is not given in a proper or official manner. We will not want to encroach,” he added.

Will oppose statue

112,2020/02/27,Stakeholders seek more clarity on draft National Dental Commission Bill,"A majority of heads of colleges and academic institutes as well as dentistry practitioners have sought for clarity on some aspects of the National Dental Commission Bill-2020, which they said should be more democratic. If passed, the commission members will no longer be elected but nominated by the government.

This was one of the main topics of discussion that came up on Thursday at a stakeholders’ meeting on the draft National Dental Commission Bill, which will repeal the existing Dentist Act, 1948. The meeting was organised by the Centre for Education and Social Sciences (CESS).

Edwin Devadoss, Dean, Rajarajeswari Dental College & Hospital, said: “Under the existing Dentist Act, 1948, there are provisions to elect members to the Dental Council of India, which will not be the case with the National Dental Commission Bill. The democracy that exists now will be missing.”

Many practitioners and academicians urged that the word ‘clinic’ be defined and that quality control initiatives be included.

Roopa Nadig, former dean of Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, said that there was no clarity on the exit test. She sought to know if the final year examination or the end of internship is considered as the exit test or whether one more exam would be conducted. “Lots of details still need to be worked out in the Bill,” she added.

M.S. Sudhakar, former MLA, highlighted the need for dentistry facilities at primary health centres. The government should provide infrastructure and human resources to enhance dental services to the public. “Dentistry interns should be made to go to rural areas for services. This will also give them exposure to clinical learning,” he said.

Speaking on the need for more integration of general medicine and dental science, most of the participants said that basic medical science subjects should be included in dentistry and there should be window available for students to upgrade their skills through fellowships and certificate courses.

M.K. Sridhar, president, governing board of CESS, said the centre would forward all feedback to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

113,2020/02/27,Hubballi Bar Association withdraws resolution against representing three Kashmiri students,"Court appreciates A-G’s intervention; extends police protection to lawyers

The office-bearers of Hubballi and Dharwad Bar Associations on Thursday assured the High Court of Karnataka that they will not prevent any advocate from representing the three Kashrmiri students arrested for shouting pro-Pakistan slogans, and will make all efforts to ensure that the unruly incident that occurred on the Dharwad court premises on February 24 was not repeated.

The Bar Association Hubballi (BAH) has also clarified to the High Court that it had already modified its February 15 resolution of asking its members to abstain from representing the accused students.

Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi, who had intervened to resolve the issue that cropped up owing to BAH’s resolution, made these submissions before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoundar during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by 24 Bengaluru-based lawyers, who had challenged BAH’s resolution.

When the Bench said that the BAH should pass a fresh resolution clearly indicating withdrawal of the February 15 resolution, the A-G, on instruction of the office-bearers who were present in court, said that the association’s governing council will pass a fresh resolution.

Mr. Navadgi also told the Bench that the office-bearers have already reached out to a large section of the association’s members to ensure that there will not be any hindrance for the accused students to engage service of a lawyer to represent them. While appreciating the A-G’s intervention to resolve the issue, the Bench said that his intervention avoided the High Court from passing a drastic order on BAH’s resolution, which curtails the right of the accused persons from appointing an advocate of their choice under Article 22 of the Constitution.

Police protection

Following these assurances, the Bench passed an order directing the Hubballi-Dharwad police to collect the names of advocates, who either shouted slogans on the Dharward court premises or prevent advocates from representing the three Kashrmiri students, and submit it to the High Court for initiation of action. The Bench also continued its earlier order issued to the Hubbballi-Dharwad Police Commissioner to provide security to the advocates from Benngaluru when they go to Hubballi and Dharwad to file applications for bail on behalf of the students.

Meanwhile, the Bench made it clear that the applications for bail to be filed on behalf of the accused students should be treated like any other application for bail filed in normal course before the court. The Bench also directed the Belagavi prison authorities to allow lawyers to meet the accused students to get their signature to represent them in court.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hubballi-bar-association-withdraws-resolution-against-representing-three-kashmiri-students/article30935892.ece
114,2020/02/27,Bonhomie marks BSY’s 77th birthday celebration,"Siddaramaiah attends event, showers praises on the Chief Minister

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s 77th birthday bash held on Thursday stood out as it was an apolitical event with Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah not only attending the programme but also showering praises on the veteran Bharatiya Janata Party leader.

While acrimony has marked recent political events, including sharp attacks on each other over the contentious CAA and NRC just a week ago in the State legislature, bonhomie prevailed at Mr. Yediyurappa’s birthday celebration held on Bengaluru Palace Grounds.

Above party lines

“It is common to have political differences based on ideology. But that should not come in the way of human relationships,” said Mr. Siddaramaiah, while explaining why he attended the event. “Mr. Yediyurappa is among a handful of politicians who has a clear idea of the State’s political scape. He has come up through struggle and only such people can understand the problems of other people,” the Congress leader said. This was welcomed with applause and whistles, with some in the audience shouting “Huliya”, a sobriquet for Mr. Siddaramaiah. This made Minister C.T. Ravi, who moderated the session, to remark that the birthday event had seen the sharing of stage by “Huliya” and “Raja Huli”, latter being the title given to Mr. Yediyurappa by a few TV channels.

Even BJP national general secretary B.L. Sathosh, with whom Mr. Yediyurappa is believed to not share a good relationship, was full of praises for the veteran leader. “The BJP has not been able to come to power in some of the States despite having an organisational presence. This is because we do not have a tall leader like Mr. Yediyurappa there,” he said.

A benchmark

Describing Mr. Yediyurappa’s achievements and discipline as a benchmark for other party workers, he said the hallmark of the veteran leader was that he still considered himself as a party worker despite raising to great heights, he said.

Former External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna hailed Mr. Yediyurappa as a leader who was known for keeping his words, which was a rarity in today’s politics.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh described Mr. Yediyurappa as a prominent leader with a stature in the entire country and acknowledged his contribution to bringing the party to power for the first time in a southern State.

Poet Siddalingaiah, who gave a felicitation speech, said that it was a miracle of democracy that Mr. Yediyurappa, who used to help out his family once by selling lemons in Mandya bus-stand, had risen to the position of Chief Minister. He appealed to Mr. Yediyurappa to hold the hands of the oppressed sections such as Dalits, pourakarmikas, daily wage workers, and guest lecturers.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who appeared to be emotional, declared that he would dedicate the remaining part of his chief ministerial tenure towards turning Karnataka into a model State and relieving farmers of their problems.

Expressing happiness over the participation of his political rival Mr. Siddaramaiah, Mr. Yediyurappa remarked: “I do not have words to thank him for his gesture.”

Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy could not make it to the event. However, in a letter, he extended his greetings to the Chief Minister on his birthday.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sb8698/article30935877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGYEDIYURAPPANEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bonhomie-marks-bsys-77th-birthday-celebration/article30935878.ece

116,2020/02/27,Status report sought on buildings,"A report has been sought on the condition of buildings housing schools, colleges and anganwadi centres in Kodagu with only three months left for the onset of monsoon.

Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy issued this direction to the authorities at a meeting convened by her in Madikeri on Wednesday to discuss the preparations to be made to counter the monsoon. Kodagu had witnessed its worst floods and landslides in 2018 and 2019.

She said North Kodagu and South Kodagu saw more devastation in 2018 and in 2019 respectively. “We focussed on North Kodagu following the damage in 2018 but the calamity struck most parts of South Kodagu last year. Therefore, we need to focus on all areas this year. In this connection, district-level officers would be deployed at the hobli level to attend to the works.”

The officers at the taluk level including the PDOs would be trained on handling the rescue situations. Funds under NDRF would be released in advance to the ZP CEO, tahsildars and the GPs for attending to the rain havoc.

He told presspersons here on Thursday that Congress leaders who have responded in a proactive manner when Mr. Doreswamy was criticised, failed to stage similar protests against those raising pro-Pakistan slogans at a meeting held against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Bengaluru and by a few students in Hubballi.

Referring to the stand taken by Mr. Doreswamy against the CAA, he said that on many issues, Mr. Doreswamy failed to behave in a non-partisan manner.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/b90u4/article30935609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGKSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kse-slams-cong/article30935610.ece
118,2020/02/27,More help for Kodagu flood victims,"Land identified, houses to be built for those living illegally near riverbanks

With around three months left for the onset of monsoon, the Kodagu district administration, after experiencing the gravity of floods and landslides in two consecutive years and spending its time and resources in relief operations, has drawn up a plan to entirely relocate the affected families living illegally close to the river banks to forestall sufferings similar to those undergone in 2018 and 2019.

The authorities hope to complete the construction before the monsoon sets in.

The administration has identified government land in five villages for relocating 237 affected families (they were living in temporary dwellings close to the river banks and most of the dwelling had been destroyed in floods).

Plots of 30 x 40 sq ft. dimension had been planned for providing housing to the victims. These houses will be in addition to those being constructed for people whose legally built houses had been destroyed in the floods.

Villages in list

The Department of Town and Country Planning had prepared the plan for developing sites in the identified villages.

The villages include Abhyathamangala, B. Shettigeri, Arvathoklu, Kedamullur, and Balagodu. About 8.22 acres of government land had been identified at Abhyathamangala besides six acres in B. Shettigeri and half-an-acre in Arvathoklu. The government land identified in Kedamullur and Balagodu was not much since the number of flood victims to be rehabilitated there was less.

The number of affected families identified for rehabilitation in Abhyathamangala is 117- belonging to Nellihudikeri, Valnur, Nanjarayapattana and Basavanahalli. In Arvathoklu, nine flood victims from Thithimathi, Chennangolli, Kanoor and Muttoor had been identified for rehabilitation.

Three families from Thora and one flood victim from Naangala had been identified for rehabilitation at Kedamullur and Balagodu villages respectively.

In Abhyathamangala, 60 sites had been developed. The planning for the remaining sites had been done and steps had been taken for allotting the sites in the presence of the Assistant Commissioner on Wednesday.

Instalments

A sum of ₹5 lakh is also being spent for the construction of each house in a plot measuring 30x 40 sq. ft – similar to the way houses were being constructed for those who lost their dwellings that had all valid records and documents.

The money would be released in four instalments.

Flood victims displeased

The flood victims of Guhya, Siddapura and Karadigodu, who recently called off their indefinite agitation to provide them housing, following the intervention of Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy, are apparently displeased with the place identified by the district administration for their rehabilitation.

The district administration has identified a six-acre plot in B. Shettigeri near Virajpet for developing sites and building houses for 103 flood victims whose houses had been completely destroyed in the calamity last year.

About 125 sites had been proposed on the plot.

However, some have expressed their disapproval claiming that the identified site was “unsuitable” for earning a livelihood since majority of affected families from the three villages were labourers and farm workers who depended on daily earnings for their living.

Yamuna, one of the flood victims and convener of the Niveshana Horata Samithi from Karadigodu, said a memorandum had been submitted to the office of the Deputy Commissioner with a request to consider rehabilitating them near Siddapura, Ammatti and nearby places instead of B. Shettigeri.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kcw5sn/article30935576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MYSFLOODS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/more-help-for-kodagu-flood-victims/article30935577.ece
119,2020/02/27,Sudhakar Chaturvedi: A Vedic scholar and social reformer,"Sudhakar Krishna Rao earned the title ‘Chaturvedi’ for his scholarship in four Vedas

Sudhakar Chaturvedi, scholar and freedom fighter who passed away on Thursday morning, was deeply influenced by Vedic tradition, Gandhian thoughts and teachings of Arya Samaj in a life that spanned over a century.

According to his associates, Mr. Chaturvedi was born at Balepete in Bengaluru on April 11, 1897. However, there has been some dispute on the year of his birth. Sudhakar Krishna Rao earned the title “Chaturvedi” for his scholarship in four Vedas. He translated them into Kannada and brought it out in 20 volumes. He was also the founding editor of Veda Taranga, the Kannada magazine devoted to Vedic studies.

His associate Shruthipriya, the current editor of Veda Taranga, said the veteran Gandhian had been jailed 30 times over a period of around 12 years during the freedom struggle. “He was kept in various jails, including those at Dhaka, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Bombay, Howrah, Karwar, Belagavi, and Mangaluru. He stayed with Mahatma Gandhi at both Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad and Sevagram at Wardha,” Mr. Shruthipriya said: “During the freedom struggle, Mr. Chaturvedi interpreted the Vedas to spread awareness against untouchability.”

Mr. Chaturvedi’s first interaction with Mahatma Gandhi came during the latter’s visit to Gurukul Kangri at Haridwar run by Mahatma Munshi Ram, who later became Swami Shraddhananda, propagating the teachings of Dayananda Saraswathi and of Arya Samaj. “He was deeply influenced by the Mahatma and later chose to follow him to participate in the freedom movement,” Mr. Shruthipriya added.

He was often called “Gandhi’s postman” as the Mahatma used to dictate letters and send them to important persons through him. Mr. Chaturvedi was fond of recalling how the Mahatma used to call him “Karnataki”.

Mr. Chaturvedi returned to Bengaluru about a week before the Mahatma was shot dead in Delhi on January 31. Though he could not attend the funeral, he had been part of the condolence meeting that was held at Chikka Lalbagh then, said Mr. Shruthipriya, adding that after his return to Bengaluru, Mr. Chaturvedi chose to immerse himself in the study of Vedas instead of entering politics.

His death has been condoled by many leaders, including Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. His last rites were conducted on Thursday evening.

‘Leading light of Arya Samaj movement in State’

Veteran freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy said: “Though Sudhakar Chaturvedi was born into a very conservative Brahmin household, he was a Vedic scholar and reformer who opposed untouchability. Unmarried, he adopted a Dalit boy, got him traditionally educated in Sanskrit and he grew to become a reputed bureaucrat.”

Mr. Doreswamy recalled that Mr. Chaturvedi had two brothers and both worked in social and religious reforms. “While the eldest became a sanyasi at a very young age, another brother identified himself in the Harijan movement and Mr. Chaturvedi worked with the Arya Samaj... He was a leading light of the Arya Samaj movement in the State,” Mr. Doreswamy said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ugfmbj/article30935626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGCHATURVEDIINSIDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sudhakar-chaturvedi-a-vedic-scholar-and-social-reformer/article30934283.ece
120,2020/02/27,‘Dalits not allowed to go to tea stalls’,"Accusing some caste Hindus in Halihal village, Nidagundi taluk, of boycotting Dalits by not allowing them to go to local tea stalls and also filing false cases against them, Karnataka Rajya Dalit Sangharsh Samiti has condemned the act and demanded a CID probe in the matter.

Addressing presspersons here on Thursday, State convener of the samiti Ramesh Asangi said that since January 20 this year, caste Hindus are boycotting Dalits in the village.

He also added that when the Dalit community filed a complaint with the police, as a revenge, caste Hindus filed cases against Dalits accusing them of murdering a person belonging to an upper caste.

“The body of the man was found near the bus stand under suspicious circumstances. Without checking facts, they simply filed cases against 21 Dalits. We have also filed cases against 18 persons for throwing stones at houses of Dalits and creating trouble,” he said.

Demanding a CID investigation in the matter as Dalits had lost faith in the local police, he said that only the CID will carry out a fair inquiry and take action against those erring persons.

Other functionaries of the samiti were present. Later, the samiti members submitted a memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil in support of their demand.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dalits-not-allowed-to-go-to-tea-stalls/article30933643.ece

The KDA on Thursday held a meeting of teachers to elicit information and views on adoption of a uniform Kannada teaching method. It was proposed that KDA be made the single agency to supply materials, evaluate the course, and issue certificates.

Though there are a large number of teachers conducting Kannada classes for non-Kannada speaking people, they adopt different methods and materials to teach the language. Moreover, there was no single agency to evaluate and certify the courses.

T.S. Nagabharana, chairman of KDA, P.S. Muralidhar, secretary, and Abdul Rahman Pasha, member of the KDA, attended the meeting and heard opinions of teachers and discussed various issues they have been facing.

Speaking to The Hindu, Prof. Pasha said it was proposed that a single methodology be adopted for teaching Kannada to non-Kannada speaking people in Bengaluru and other parts. Though KDA had been providing textbooks and other materials to teach Kannada, in their private capacity teachers have been following different textbooks and methodologies, he said.

122,2020/02/27,Yatnal continues tirade against Doreswamy,"Lashing out at the Congress leaders who had demanded that he apologise for his remark against freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, former Union Minister and BJP MLA, has said that he need not learn a lesson in propriety from the Congress leaders who have let their tongue loose on many occasions against freedom fighter V.D. Savarkar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Speaking to presspersons here on Thursday, he justified calling Mr. Doreswamy as a fake freedom fighter and refused to apologise for his statement.

Continuing the verbal tirade against Mr. Doreswamy, he said that, “Mr. Savarkar was harshly punished by the British for participating in the freedom movement. Mr. Doreswamy was not lodged in Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands like Mr. Savarkar for participating in the freedom struggle”. The Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi who repeatedly insult SMr. avarkar feel agitated if something is spoken against Mr. Doreswamy, he said.

Deploring Mr. Doreswamy for the stand he had taken against Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the previous Lok Sabha election and against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said that Mr. Doreswamy acts like a spokesperson of the Congress. He said that the Congress leaders and Mr. Doreswamy have on many occasions spoken in a derogatory manner against Mr. Modi and thereby have tried to demean the office of Prime Minister.

He said that Mahatma Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had also favoured according Indian citizenship to non-Muslims who were persecuted in Pakistan. Unfortunately, Congress leaders and persons like Mr. Doreswamy speak against CAA that was passed by Parliament to protect the interests of non-Muslims in Pakistan, he said.

Terming the Delhi violence as a conspiracy to defame the country during U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit, he condemned the tweets by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the issue. “Instead of criticising the BJP-led government in the Centre and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Mr. Khan should focus on addressing the problems of poverty and hunger in his country,” he said.

Meanwhile, condemning Mr. Yatnal’s remarks against Mr. Doreswamy, activists of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha staged a protest on the premises of the Deputy Commissioner’s office in the city on Thursday.

127,2020/02/27,BJP may field candidates in thenext corpn. polls on its symbol,"Hitherto in Belagavi, the elections were fought on language affiliations

The BJP Core Committee has decided to fight the next city corporation polls in Belagavi on party lines. The party will filed its nominees on party ticket, MLA Abhay Patil said in Belagavi on Wednesday.

He was speaking at the swearing-in ceremony for new party office-bearers at the Maratha Mandir here.

He said that BJP candidates would win in large numbers, paving the way for a BJP nominee becoming the Mayor of Belagavi.

This is a very interesting development for Belagavi, where the city corporation elections have never been fought on party lines. In all the past elections, candidates filed nomination papers as independent candidates and after elections, formed groups based on their language affiliations.

There were Kannada councillors, Marathi councillors and Urdu councillors. The Mayor was thus elected on the grounds of language. Pro-Marathi and pro-Kannada organisations celebrated the victories of their respective Mayors. There have never been attempts by any party, be it the Congress or the BJP, to field candidates on party symbols. The former Mayor Sambhaji Patil and Congress leader Anil Potdar tried to float a Sarva Bhashika Vichar Vedike to bring councillors of various linguistic background together, but that did not last long.

129,2020/02/27,Conduct of advocates on Dharwad court premises ‘sheer militancy’: HC,"Court accepts A-G offer to resolve issue on Bar association’s resolution to not represent Kashmiri students

The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday described as “sheer militancy” the conduct of members of the Dharwad Bar Association (DBA) on the Dharwad court premises on February 24 when advocates from Bengaluru went there to file applications for bail on behalf of three Kashmir students, and accepted the Advocate-General’s request to allow him to resolve the issue.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar made these oral observations during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by 24 Bengaluru-based advocates, who had questioned the legality of a resolution passed by the Hubballi Bar Association (HBA) asking its members not to represent the Kashmiri students who are accused of raising pro-Pakistan slogans.

‘Not good for institution’

The Bench said the conduct of the advocates on the Dharwad court premises was “not good for the institution of judiciary” while pointing out that even Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani terrorist who was among the ten who attacked Mumbai on November 26, 2008, was given a fair trial in this country by providing him service of a good lawyer to defend himself.

The members of the DBA had “heckled” the advocates from Bengaluru, owing to which they had to return without filling applications for bail on behalf of the accused students.

To say mildly, the Bench said, the conduct of advocates on the Dharwad court premises was “sheer militancy”. The Bench indicated that it would transfer the case to a court in Bengaluru so that it becomes a lesson to the Bar associations that pass such “illegal” resolutions.

The Bench is “not bothered about the outcome of the bail applications to be filed on behalf of the arrested students”, but the accused persons should not be deprived of their right to appoint lawyers of their choice, the court observed. During earlier hearing, the Bench had pointed out that the resolution passed by the HBA is contrary to the law laid down by the apex court and may amount to criminal contempt of court.

Talks with advocates

At this stage, A-G Prabhuling K. Navadgi intervened and said he held a round of talks over the telephone with office-bearers of the Bar association on Wednesday and expressed confidence that further talks with them would help in resolving the issue.

“We welcome the intervention by the A-G and hope that the issue will be resolved here,” the Bench said while adjourning the hearing till Thursday and asking the A-G to ask the Bar association office-bearers to be personally present in the court.

Earlier, the counsel of the petitioners pointed out that the police provided adequate security as per the court’s earlier directions.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1zmjcu/article30926355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGADVOCATES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/conduct-of-advocates-on-dharwad-court-premises-sheer-militancy-hc/article30926356.ece
130,2020/02/27,They managed ‘superhuman’ feats for promotions,"Marks card and certificates of at least 27 ASOs awaiting promotion now being treated as suspicious

It may be physically impossible for a person to be present at two places at one time, but some Assistant Statistical Officers (ASOs) have claimed to have achieved this superhuman feat to get promotions.

Sample this: an ASO, working at the Directorate of Economics and Statistics on a given day, has claimed to have successfully written undergraduate examination in Tamil Nadu on that day. Similarly, at least 10 other ASOs were actually working in their respective offices, yet they claimed to have written examinations in various universities in India on the same day.

In another case, an ASO wrote the degree examination in December 2017 and received his marks card the same month. But, he has also shown the admission ticket for the examination that is dated January 2018. Another ASO’s confirmation report shows his educational qualification as PUC in 2015, B.Com. in 2016, and finally B.A. in 2017.

All these and many other cases are now under scrutiny as it is learnt that the directorate has sought the genuineness of the marks card and certificates from the universities, and in some cases genuineness of the universities themselves. Directorate sources said the marks cards and certificates of at least 27 ASOs awaiting promotion to the posts of Additional Director are now being treated as suspicious after senior officials flagged them during the departmental promotion committee (DPC) meeting in October 2019. A total of 127 ASOs were eligible for promotion for which the DPC was formed. The promotion is currently withheld. Many of the ASOs are close to superannuation.

Changed rules

Sources said that many of the ASOs, who did not have “prescribed qualification” as per the changed cadre and recruitment (C&R) rules of 2010, have resorted to this practice despite having postgraduate degrees and a couple even doctoral degree.

“The rules were changed in 2010, prescribing that only those who have studied any one of the subjects among the four prescribed — Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, and Computer Science — in undergraduate course would be eligible for promotion,” sources explained. When they became eligible for promotion, the rules came in the way, sources said. “While they are guilty of providing false information, the rules made without application of mind triggered it. In any case, changes in the rules are not notified regularly and employees may not know. Work experience and any degree would have helped,” he added.

A department official said that certificate verification should have been done before the DPC meeting, but it was taken up after that, and that too after complaints were raised. “By rule, all verifications are a must before the DPC.” Meanwhile, with the educational qualification matter reaching Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, he has directed DPAR officials to consider reviewing the C&R rules of 2010.

131,2020/02/27,Yediyurappa’s 77th birthday bash on Thursday,"Rajnath Singh to inaugurate the event; Opposition leaders to be part of it

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is all set to celebrate his 77th birthday on a grand scale at the Palace Grounds here on Thursday.

While Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will inaugurate the event, Opposition leaders and former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah from the Congress and H.D. Kumaraswamy from the Janata Dal (Secular) will be part of the event. Senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna will preside over the event. B.L. Santhosh, BJP national general secretary (organisation), will also be part of the event.

“Mr. Singh was the BJP national president when Mr. Yediyurappa became the Chief Minister for the first time. Hence he has been invited as the chief guest,” said a member of the B.S. Yediyurappa felicitation committee.

Felicitation volume

A felicitation volume in Kannada with 78 articles from a cross-section of people, including politicians, writers, bureaucrats, and spiritual leaders, a coffee table book of photographs, and a documentary will be released.

Being the only Chief Minister beyond the age of 75 to be in power from the BJP, the bash has raised eyebrows. However, sources close to him said, “Mr. Yediyurappa is now one of the tall leaders of the State and the event seeks to position him so, which has not happened so far. It is important to record his rise to being in this position.”

After the floods

However, Mr. Yediyurappa celebrating his birthday as a public function on a grand scale, that too when the State is recovering from floods, has raised many eyebrows in both the BJP as well as other parties.

“We could have understood it if he was celebrating 75th or 80th birthday. But celebrating 77th birthday on a grand scale has led to curiosity in the party, triggering speculation on the intentions behind holding such an event,” said a senior party leader. Some of the party old-timers, including a few Ministers, too said they were puzzled.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappas-77th-birthday-bash-today/article30925976.ece
132,2020/02/27,‘Transgender persons should have reservations in jobs’,"How inclusive is society when it comes to the rights of transgender people? At the workplace, they still have to fight stereotypes and discrimination. There is a need for transgender persons to have reservations in jobs, said Jyotika Kalra, member, National Human Rights Commission, here on Wednesday.

She was speaking after the conference ‘LGBTQI: Challenges and Way Forward’ held at the National Law School of India University. She pointed out that there was a need for management courses to have a syllabus on sexuality education.

Various stakeholders at the event said they were against the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 as it requires one to apply for a “transgender certificate” from the district magistrate. Ms. Kalra said the government was yet to frame rules on how the transgender person would be identified.

There is also the question of whether they are under-represented. “The Census 2011 figure of 4.88 lakh people being identified as transgenders was considered a gross underestimation as many transgender persons had not identified themselves,” said Ms. Kalra.

133,2020/02/27,Efforts on to increase area under Mattu Gulla cultivation,"The brinjal variety, which has Geographical Indication tag, is grown in parts of Udupi district

Efforts are on to increase the area under cultivation of Mattu Gulla, a special type of brinjal known for its unique taste and which enjoys the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, at Mattu and its surrounding villages of Kaipunjal and Uliyargoli in Udupi district.

Presently, Mattu Gulla is cultivated in about 225 acres of land in these villages, but there is a potential to cultivate it in another 140 acres of land, which is mostly fallow. Since the cultivation of Mattu Gulla is profitable, it is expected to help farmers increase their income.

Bigger profits

The Mattu Gulla Belegarara Sangha has 210 farmers as its members. Lakshman Mattu, chief executive officer of the sangha, which helps in collecting and marketing the vegetable, said, “If a farmer invests about ₹60,000 an acre, he is assured of making a profit of about ₹1.5 lakh subject to vagaries of rainfall. The average yield for an acre is four to five tonnes. Last year, farmers made more profits, but this year, the profits dipped slightly because of heavy rain during the monsoon.”

Efforts to popularise the cultivation of Mattu Gulla by the sangha, the Department of Horticulture, and the Manipal Institute of Management (MIM) are bearing fruit. “In the last two years, the area under Mattu Gulla cultivation has increased by about 30 acres and nearly 20 more farmers have taken to its cultivation,” Mr. Mattu said. One of the farmers who took to Mattu Gulla cultivation two years back, Gururaj Bhat, said paddy cultivation was difficult and cumbersome. “Hence, I took to cultivating Mattu Gulla in 35 cents of land at Mattu. Last season, I made more profits when compared with this year,” he said.

The MIM is the Programme Implementation Agency under NABARD and is acting as a facilitator with Mattu Gulla growers. Harish Joshi, coordinator, Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, MIM, said, “Some persons owing fallow land at Mattu and its surroundings are contacting us for cultivating the brinjal crop.”

Longer shelf life

Some Mattu Gullas which have one or two black spots are not sold in market. Such “seconds” are given to needy persons.

But there is a proposal to preserve such Mattu Gulla in brine. “They can be used for making gojju during the monsoon, when the vegetable is not available,” said Mr. Joshi.

Mattu Gulla is transported in packs of 50 kg. This results in damage to the brinjals that are at the bottom of the pack. Hence, there is a proposal to develop paper trays to avoid damage.

Model farm planned

Plans are on to set up a model farm to demonstrate the cultivation of Mattu Gulla in about an acre of land at Mattu village to cater to a large number of researchers and tourists. Many researchers from other countries too are coming to study the vegetable.

“We have identified three pieces of land for the model farm near the backwaters of Mattu, but are yet to finalise the land. Since the Mattu beach is nearby, it will also help tourists. We will be submitting a project on the model farm to NABARD, which could be a potential funding agency, and we can also take the support of private donors if more funds are necessary,” said Mr. Joshi.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/52em2b/article30925916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGMATTUUDUPI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/efforts-on-to-increase-area-under-mattu-gulla-cultivation/article30925918.ece

The country loses its soul when it drops its diverse character, Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel has said.

Inaugurating the 36th annual meeting of the Mahatma Gandhi University Employees Association (MGUEA) here on Thursday, the Minister observed that it was the diverse character of India which made the country unique.

“While the entire world is opening up to embrace people irrespective of their caste or creed, the people in our land are fighting each other in the name of religion. It is the leftist ideals that should act as a counter-force to this wave of religious bigotry,” he said.

Contribution

Upholding the contribution of non-teaching employees at the varsities towards the growth of country’s higher education sector, the Minister urged them to initiate action on each file under their consideration in a time-bound manner.

He further credited the LDF government for bringing in a major change with regard to the publication of varsity results.

“The delayed publication of results was a curse that gripped our higher education sector for long. This government, however, has brought about a major turnaround.

Classes to undergraduate courses which hitherto opened in September or October began as early as June 17 this academic year and from the next year, the UG and PG classes are slated to open on June 1 itself,” the Minister said.

Major change

According to him, the higher education sector in Kerala is in for a major change. “All varsities have received adequate number of employees while about 1,000 teaching posts are being created. At the same time, all certificates are becoming online and no student will have to visit the varsity for obtaining his or her certificates,” Dr. Jaleel added.

He was speaking on ‘Reasons for Forest Fire’ at a workshop organised by the Thrissur Press Club here on Wednesday against the backdrop of the death of three foresters at a wildfire at Desamangalam in the district recently.

“Our forests are prone to fire due to increasing temperature and dry climate. More than firefighting, the focus should be on prevention of fire incidents. It is very important to take local people into confidence and make them part of the plan for preventing fire. Reducing the amount of flammable substances in the area and clearing fire line are important for prevention of fire,” he said.

Along with environmental and climatic conditions, socio-political reasons also added to the risk of forest fire. Without addressing them, we would not be able to reduce such risks, Dr. Sajeev said.

He added that most of the forest fire accidents were man-made.

Impact on water quality

Addressing the workshop, P.S. Easa, former Director in-charge of the KFRI, spoke on the impact of forest fire on quality of water, soil and air.

“There are not many detailed studies on how fires have been affecting the water retention capacity and soil quality of forests or how biodiversity has been destroyed by the fires. We need to study the socio-economic and environmental impact of fires,” he said.

Gopakumar Cholayil, environmental scientist, spoke about drastic changes in the climate pattern and its impacts.

“In all, 1,688 heat-related cases have been reported in various hospitals in the State in the past one year. Heat waves, cold waves and dust devils, which used to be alien terms for us, have become common since 2016. Changes in temperature pattern in the high ranges have already started affecting our cash crops,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/make-local-people-part-of-wildfire-prevention-expert/article30935713.ece
146,2020/02/27,Umra ban hits travel industry,"Restrictions imposed by Saudi Arabia in the wake of COVID-19 threat

The unexpected ban imposed by the Saudi Arabian government on Umra pilgrims in the wake of the COVID-19 threat will hit the travel industry across the country hard.

Particularly vulnerable are the 4,000-odd travel agents in the country and the airlines that operate services to Jeddah.

The Saudi ban came at a time when Umra travel from Kerala was set to peak in the summer vacation and Ramzan. With the school vacation in Kerala set to begin on April 1 and the holy month of Ramzan set to start on April 24, all airlines have already sold out their Umra tickets to Jeddah.

“We do not know what is going to happen. It will depend on how long the pilgrim ban continues,” said Abdul Rasheed N., a leading travel agent and joint secretary of the Kerala Umra Welfare Association (KUWA).

Uncertainty over refund

Travel agents and pilgrims alike are worried about the refund policies the airlines are going to adopt in the wake of the ban. Sources in Air India and Saudi Arabian Airlines said it was too early to give a definite answer.

Figures indicate that about 600 pilgrims from Kerala are going to Jeddah every day for Umra. When 350 of them are from Karipur, 150 are from Nedumbassery and 100 from Thiruvananthapuram. The Umra services take place five days a week on an average. Umra pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia takes place from the month of Muharram to Shawwal.

The recent increase in the Umra visa stamping fee too has been a huge worry for the pilgrims.

Until last year, the fee for Umra visa was only ₹2,500. Now that the fee has increased to ₹15,000, thousands of pilgrims who have geared themselves up to the pilgrimage are worried to lose their money.

Unlike other visas, Umra pilgrim visa has a validity of only 15 days. The pilgrims will lose their money if they cannot travel within 15 days. “At present, none can say when the Saudi government will lift the ban,” said M.P. Mohammed, a travel agent from Malappuram.

The travel industry is heavily dependent on Umra pilgrimage for their survival in Kerala. “It is Umra pilgrimage that gives the airlines and the travel agents some profit. The current ban will hit us all badly,” said Mr. Rasheed. The recent expansion of facilities in Makkah too had given high hopes for the travel industry. The Tawaf capacity of the Umra pilgrims at a time was almost doubled in the recent expansion of the Masjidul Haram.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lwttsr/article30936509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200227-WA0117,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/umra-ban-hits-travel-industry/article30935690.ece
147,2020/02/27,Kerala toughens its stand on NPR,"Census officials told not to attend training session related to the register

Kerala has toughened its stand against the update of the National Population Register (NPR) by asking its Census officials not to attend training sessions related to the register. The State steps up its resistance even as the national authorities have made it clear that the register will be updated along with the Census in the State.

The Principal Secretary, General Administration Department, has written to all District Collectors stating that the officials need not attend the training session connected with the NPR, if any

Read: What connects the NPR, NRIC and Census?

The communication was issued to the district and charge-level officers of the Census 2021 operations last week while reiterating that “the NPR operations are not undertaken in the State.” The State authorities had taken care to strike down all references related to the NPR in the circular issued by T. Mithra, Director of Census Operations, Kerala, last week regarding the appointment of enumerators, supervisors and field trainers for house-listing and housing census operations and updating of the NPR.

The State government has toughened its stand against the register in the wake of the stiff resistance against the programme.

Incidentally, Vivek Joshy, Registrar General and Census Commissioner, had informed the Chief Secretary that the State government officials would be deployed for the Census field work between April 15 and May 29, and the same set of officials will carry out the NPR update in the State.

The Hindu had reported that the national authorities had insisted on updating the register in spite of the State government's resistance to the programme. The two-day training sessions for most of the districts have been completed. It will begin in Ernakulam and Wayanad districts on Friday.

According to a senior official from a southern district who took part in the training programme, no references were made on the NPR during the training session. There were no questions from the participants too. It was also indicated that the register need not be updated in the State, the official said.

The training classes focussed on the modules for house-listing blocks (HLB), Census-2021 Management and Monitoring System and App developed for the Census. It was mostly a hands-on training programme and the booklets distributed at the classes pertained to HLB and related activities. No publication regarding the register was distributed, he said.

A national-level trainer who led the programme also confirmed that there were no references to the updating of the register as the State government was opposed to it.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wi2jv2/article30937241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NPRJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-toughens-stand-against-npr-updating/article30934464.ece
148,2020/02/27,KC(M) leaders toughen stance,"No compromise on Kuttanad seat, says Joseph

Even as the United Democratic Front (UDF) is striving hard to bring in consensus between the warring factions of the Kerala Congress (M) over Kuttanad, the tussle hit another low with the group leaders toughening their respective stances on Thursday.

Addressing media persons in Kottayam, KC(M) working chairman P.J. Joseph dismissed the claims raised by Jose K. Mani as meaningless. “The KC(M) leadership will hold a bilateral discussion with the Congress over Kuttand on February 29 and Mr. Mani, who left the party, does not have any role in it,’’ he said.

According to him, the rebel candidate fielded by Mr. Mani during the previous Assembly election received just 235 votes. “This number is indeed a reflection of his degree of presence in the constituency,’’ he said.

Meanwhile, he sought to dismiss reports regarding a likely exchange of Kuttanad with the Congress for the Muvattupuzha Assembly seat. “Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has made it amply clear that the seat belonged to the KC (M). Moreover, we are fully confident about winning the seat,” Mr. Joseph said.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Joseph released the official mouthpiece of his faction `Sabdamillathavarude Shabdam' by handing over a copy of the magazine to Mahatma Gandhi University Vice Chancellor Sabu Thomas.

Responding to Mr. Joseph's statement, Mr. Mani insisted that not an inch would be conceded to anyone on the Kuttanad seat and that Mr. Joseph’s drama over Kuttanad was not going to yield any result. “We have been invited for holding bilateral talks with the Congress in Kochi. I have no idea as to whether the Congress will be holding any talks with Mr. Joseph and team,” he said.

KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, Mr. Chennithala, and AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy will hold separate meetings with Mr. Joseph and Mr. Mani as part of working out a deal over Kuttanad.

Though the meeting is unlikely to yield a final decision, Congress leadership will try to convince the KC(M) groups on the importance of shunning their rivalry before proceeding to the byelection. In case of the leaders sticking to their respective stance, the Congress may consider a proposal to take over the seat.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/57ioun/article30942754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kcm-leaders-toughen-stance/article30934220.ece
149,2020/02/27,No norms in teachers’ appointment kicks up a row,"MSc Biotechnology as qualification for teaching posts in botany, zoology

The State government’s decision to include post-graduation in biotechnology as an eligibility qualification for appointment to teaching posts in botany and zoology has raised eyebrows.

While officials point out that the regulations laid down by the University Grants Commission (UGC) form the basis of the decision, critics claimed that the move amounted to an encroachment of powers vested with the universities on deciding on equivalency of unrecognised courses.

A government order, which formed the basis of the contention, was issued recently following a recommendation of the State- Level Academic Committee (SLAC), a panel of Vice-Chancellors of State universities formed by the Kerala State Higher Education Council. The committee had a month ago considered the representations submitted by two MSc Biotechnology degree holders, who sought its intervention to enable them to apply for the posts.

UGC norms

According to official sources, the regulations framed by the UGC on minimum qualifications for appointment of teachers and other academic staff in universities and colleges in 2018 enabled post-graduates who secured at least 55% marks in a “concerned, relevant or allied subject” to apply for posts in various disciplines, including science, as in the particular instance.

“Besides, the fact that the National Eligibility Test [conducted by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)] in life sciences, which formed the basis for appointment to zoology and botany teaching posts, also applied to biotechnology was also taken into account. Similar inferences that remain within the bounds of prescribed norms are essential while deciding on the equivalency of interdisciplinary courses,” an official said.

Teachers’ concern

However, the decision has not gone down well with a section of the teaching community which fear that it could undermine the autonomy of universities and open the floodgates for more government-imposed diktats.

All Kerala Private College Teachers’ Association general secretary P.N. Harikumar said that the Academic Council of universities were entitled to take decisions concerning course equivalence on the basis of proposals submitted by the chairperson of the Board of Studies and the Dean of subject concerned.

“In such cases, the content of the biotechnology course would be scrutinised to ascertain if it satisfied the mandatory requirements for the zoology and botany teaching posts,” he said.

The Higher Education Department maintained that the order only permits those with the qualification to apply for the posts. The onus of making appointments still remains on the university-constituted interview board.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-norms-in-teachers-appointment-kicks-up-a-row/article30933555.ece
150,2020/02/27,Let Arooja school students take SSLC exam: HC,"Govt. may take a favourable decision in this regard

The Kerala High Court has suggested that the State government consider issuing an order permitting the class 10 students of Arooja Little Star School at Thoppumpday in Kochi who are unable to write the CBSE examination to take the SSLC examination beginning on March 10.

Justice S.V. Bhatti made the suggestion when the Government Pleader submitted that the government was live to the problem faced by the students and was prepared to examine the issue objectively. The government would place a decision in this regard before the court so that the students would not lose an academic year.

The Government Pleader further submitted that some of the students may not be willing to take the State board examination because of the syllabus was different.

The court observed that it was up to the parents and students to decide. The school authorities had taken the students and parents for a ride. It was, therefore, necessary that the Secretary and the Director of the General Education examine the issue and take a decision.

Court flays CBSE

When the petition was taken up for hearing, the court criticised the CBSE for not taking action against schools which functioned without affiliation. The CBSE should have shown minimum responsibility to rein in such unaffiliated schools. The apathy on the part of the CBSE had now resulted in the present situation.

The court said the CBSE should improve its functioning and take steps to stem the menace of unaffiliated schools. The court pointed out that the practice of allowing students of unrecognised schools to register for the board examinations through neighbouring recognised schools had to be viewed seriously.

The court said the files relating to the processing of applications of the Thoppumpady school submitted before the court was incomplete. They were submitted by Sachin Thakkur, Regional Officer of the CBSE, Thiruvanthapuram, who appeared before the court as directed by it.

The court directed the Station House Office of the Thoppumpady police station, where an FIR had been registered against the management of the school, to be present before the court on March 4.

The court also directed the CBSE to file an affidavit in the case and adjourned to March 4 the case for further hearing.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/let-arooja-school-students-take-sslc-exam-hc/article30933409.ece
151,2020/02/27,Villages in the grip of fear of wild beasts,"Forest watchman killed by wild elephant at Vaaruchal, near Rajampara forests, is the latest incident

The sleepy hamlet of Vaaruchal on the boundary of the Rajampara forests at Ranni is in the grip of fear of wild beasts.

The killing of forest watchman A.S. Biju by a wild tusker that strayed into the area on Wednesday afternoon is the latest such incident. Though the Forest Task Force managed to detract the lone wild tusker to the forests late in the night after a series of attempts, the villagers fear the return of the wild pachyderm.

Rapid force

Forest Rapid Response Force teams are camping in the locality to extend a helping hand to the people in case of an eventuality.

The 41-year-old tribal forest watchman was gored to death while he was trying to detract the elephant to the forests.

A farmer, K.P. Paulose, was injured in a wild elephant attack in the forenoon when he was working in his rubber plantation in the adjoining village of Kadumeenchira. Mr. Paulose had a narrow escape from the wild beast’s attack and has been admitted to the taluk hospital in Ranni.

There are unconfirmed reports of spotting of a wild tusker somewhere near Kattickal on Thursday. But, sources deny it.

Wild animals straying into human habitations along forest boundaries has become common in Konni and Ranni during summer months. The spontaneous reaction of the panicky people to ensure their protection often results in the death of many wild animals too.

Changes in ecosystem

The rapid changes taking place in the forest ecosystem, mainly owing to excessive human intervention and climate change, have been leading to frequent straying of wild animals into human habitations in recent times.

Villagers say instances of leopards, king cobras, wild elephants, etc., straying into the villages along the forest fringes of Ranni and Konni have become more frequent during summer.

Experts attribute this to the acute water scarcity and shortage of food inside the forests during the summer months. Excessive human interventions in the forests have led to depletion of green cover in many areas.

The mushrooming of granite quarries from hills bordering the forests has been causing drastic changes in the forest ecosystem, forcing the fauna to stray from their natural habitats, say experts.

Unscrupulous quarrying of rocks has reportedly resulted in drastic depletion of the groundwater table in the region, drying up of many fresh water sources inside the forests, forcing the fauna to stray into the adjoining villages where they could get water and domesticated animals as prey.

It is also a fact that the Forest Department is yet to be properly equipped to face the challenges posed by ferocious wild animals straying into human habitation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ruv3qh/article30936542.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvElephant,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/villages-bordering-forests-in-the-grip-of-fear-of-wild-beasts/article30932500.ece
152,2020/02/27,Bountiful harvest for Sadanandapuram GHSS,"Students and teachers of the school cultivate corn at its half-acre farm

Corn may not be very popular among farmers in Kerala, but the students and teachers of Government Higher Secondary School, Sadanandapuram, have cultivated the crop and received a good yield from their half-acre farm.

The school has also conducted a corn festival in connection with the harvest since their farm, full of golden tassels, has been drawing visitors from many parts.

Festival

During the festival, the school authorities have prepared some traditional corn dishes, giving many students a chance to taste them for the first time.

“Last year we had taken our students to Kanyakumari for a one-day trip and there they saw huge heaps of corn near local farms. Many of them wanted to know how it was cultivated and so we decided to try it on our campus,” says Mohanlal P, teacher.

The students and teachers have actively participated and monitored various phases in the farming, right from sowing seeds, while the Vettikavala Krishi Bhavan and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme workers from the Madathiyara ward offered all assistance.

At first corn was used as a border crop for paddy farming and the seeds were collected.

“Many of our students had no idea about the farming of various crops, including paddy. So we made sure that they are involved in the entire process and they get a chance to watch all activities, including the preparation of land, sowing, weeding and harvesting. Since corn usually don’t get serious pest attacks, it’s comparatively easy to cultivate it. We used a mixture of cow dung and oil cake as the main manure and received a yield over 70 kg,” he says.

Agriculture club

The agriculture club in the school has been conducting various projects that include paddy farming and vegetable cultivation using drip irrigation.

For Onam the school had cultivated tapioca, colocasia, taro, ginger, purple yam, beans, tomato, eggplant, green chilli, spinach, snake gourd, ivy gourd, bottle gourd, cucumber and cauliflower.

The school is keen on promoting organic farming and last year they had exhibited the yield and honoured student farmers after the harvest.

“Not just club members, but all students are part of our farming projects. We feel it’s very important to introduce them to farming so that they can understand and value our agricultural culture. We only take a break during summer months due to the scarcity of water and this year we are planning to start cultivation around May,” he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s7ekh0/article30936568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvMullakkara,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ghss-sadanandapuram-shows-the-way/article30932201.ece
153,2020/02/27,Cancel all direct postings in VACB: Chennithala,"‘Appointments made by Behera are against guidelines’

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has sought to cancel all the direct appointments in the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) made by State Police Chief Loknath Behera, claiming that they are against the guidelines stipulated in the Vigilance manual.

Mr. Chennithala told the media here on Thursday that it was the job of the VACB Director to make appointments in its various units.

As per the manual, the VACB Director seeks the consent of those proposed to be appointed and checks their credibility and integrity. Their list is later passed on to the State Police Chief, who allots them to the VACB Director. The postings are later done by the Director.

Mr. Behera had snatched these rights and appointed his own loyalists in various posts. This had put the organisation’s credibility at risk even as prominent leaders in the Opposition, such as former Ministers V.S. Sivakumar and V.K. Ebrahim Kunju, were being targeted by the VACB officials.

“VACB officials have the right to probe corruption cases even against senior police officers and here Mr. Behera, who himself has been accused of corruption, is appointing them,” Mr. Chennithala said. The Opposition leader demanded that fresh appointments be made to the VACB.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cancel-all-direct-postings-in-vacb-chennithala/article30932145.ece
154,2020/02/27,Survey moots support system for women dairy farmers in Kerala,"It calls for steps to ensure due representation and leadership roles for them in cooperatives

A first-of-its-kind survey conducted by the Dairy Development Department has shed light on the all-important role played women in the State’s dairy sector and the problems they face.

Based on the findings, the Women Dairy Farmers’ Survey Study Report 2019 has recommended measures for providing support to women farmers and ensuring due representation and leadership roles for them in dairy cooperatives. The report was released by Health Minister K.K. Shylaja at the Ksheera Sangamam 2020 meet here on Thursday.

Empowerment

The survey report stressed that the State’s dairy and animal husbandry sectors offer ample opportunities for women empowerment. It recommended that 40% of seats in dairy cooperative governing committees may be reserved for women. The post of either the president or the vice president in the cooperatives also should be set aside for them, the report said.

“It is important that their representation is increased for raising their social status and in consideration of the fact that the income they generate go entirely to their families,” the report noted.

Only 5.7% of the dairy cooperatives have women as their presidents, 16.2% as vice presidents and 68.3% as secretaries, according to the survey finding.

The survey, which covered 82,000 women farmers over a six-month period, has thrown up some interesting findings. It found that the vast majority of women dairy farmers fall in the small-holding category.

Tiny representation

Registered women dairy cooperatives accounted for a mere 2.2% of the 3,647 dairy cooperatives in the State. This, despite the massive presence of women in the sector.

“Considering the number of women actually engaged in dairying, the number of women cooperatives is minuscule,” it noted.

Skewed representation

Elsewhere, the report observed that there is scarcely any justification for the skewed representation of women in the cooperatives.

Women dairy farmers spend, on an average, four to four-and-a-half hours a day at work, one hour more than their male counterparts,

“The dairy sector offers women ample scope for income generation. The report is meant to help the State government design specific projects for enhancing their livelihood,” S. Sreekumar, Director, Dairy Development, said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/az9y32/article30936443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tv-Women-Dairy-Farmcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/survey-sheds-light-on-womens-role-in-states-dairy-sector/article30932005.ece

The Medical College authorities confirmed that the injury was not serious in nature. However, a minor vascular surgery would be required to fix the affected blood vessel, they said.

Following the incident, the police stepped up surveillance measures inside the jail. According to them, Jolly had shown suicidal tendencies earlier too during the course of investigation into the Koodathayi murder case. At the time of her police custody, she had been under close surveillance, they said.

Jolly was mentally disturbed after she was denied bail in all the six murder cases in which she was the prime accused. Even after the submission of charge sheets by the special investigation team in all the six cases, she had tried to secure bail, which was rejected by the court.

157,2020/02/27,Truck’s GPS not tagged to RTO control room,"DTC probe endorses RTO findings on driver’s negligence

A high-level investigation conducted by a team of State transport officers into last week’s Tiruppur accident, in which 19 passengers of a Volvo bus of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation had lost their lives, has endorsed the findings of the Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement) that the tragedy was a result of the truck driver’s negligence.

It also found that the GPS equipment fitted with the truck had not been tagged to the Regional Transport Office (RTO) concerned.

RTO P. Sivakumar, in his initial inquiry, had found that the trailed container truck had jumped off the median and slid onto the opposite lane before ramming the KSRTC bus as a result of the driver’s negligence.

The investigation carried out by a team led by Deputy Transport Commissioner (DTC) M. Suresh found fault with the motor vehicle inspectors who provided fitness certificate to the truck for failing to tag the vehicle’s GPS equipment.

MVI’s responsibility

According to State transport authorities, it is the responsibility of the motor vehicle inspector (MVI) to ensure that the GPS equipment is tagged to respective RTO office. MVIs are increasingly found to be ignoring to tag the GPS while giving certificates about the GPS at the time of the fitness procedures. Had the GPS been tagged to the RTO office, the authorities could have verified from their control room the actual speed of the truck at the time of the accident. Transport authorities will now have to seek the help of Bharat Benz to get the GPS data of the truck.

A senior transport officer said although it was mandatory to tag the GPS equipment in heavy vehicles with the RTO office, many vehicles in the State were running without a tagged GPS machine. “MVIs and AMVIs are to blame for not tagging the GPS,” said the officer.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xvobss/article30926636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27TVLORRYACCIDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/trucks-gps-not-tagged-to-rto-control-room/article30926637.ece

162,2020/02/27,Gajaratnam Guruvayur Padmanabhan is no more,"A sought-after elephant for festivals due to its majestic looks and cool behaviour

Gajaratnam Guruvayur Padmanabhan, one of the most majestic elephants in the State, died at Guruvayur on Wednesday. It was 80.

One of the oldest elephants of the Guruvayur Devaswom, Padmanabhan had been undergoing treatment for the past two weeks after it developed swelling on its body. It died by afternoon on Wednesday.

High procession fee

Padmanabhan was a much sought-after elephant for festivals, including for Thrissur Pooram. In 2004, it set a record for the highest procession fee of ₹2.25 lakh for a day for parading at the Nenmara-Vallanki Vela. Padmanabhan was offered to Guruvayur Sreekrishna Temple by E.P. Brothers, Ottappalam, in 1954.

The elephant, which carried the golden idol of Guruvayurappan for the Arat since 1976, was venerated by devotees. It had a huge fan following due to its majestic looks and cool behaviour. It had been bestowed with many titles, including Gajaratnam and Gajachakravarthy, considering its attractive features such as its long and well-carved tusks.

With the death of Padmanabhan, the number of elephants in the devaswom has come down to 47. Its body will be buried after postmortem examination on Thursday, sources said.

The Forest Department on December 7, 2019 banned the parading of Guruvayur Padmanabhan and Guruvayur Valiya Keshavan at festivals due to health-related issues. Following protests, the department formed a committee to examine the health condition of the tuskers. The committee on February 3 allowed Padmanabhan to participate in temple rituals. However, the elephant developed health issues after a week.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pxp2g/article30926424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvtr-elephant,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gajaratnam-guruvayur-padmanabhan-is-no-more/article30926425.ece
163,2020/02/27,150 projectsin 150 days,"₹650-crore annual Plan for district panchayat

In the run up to the local body elections, the Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat aims at completing 150 projects in 150 days, district panchayat president V.K. Madhu has said. He was speaking at the development seminar for 2020-21 organised here on Wednesday.

The district plan will combine the ongoing mission activities as well as novel projects aimed at the all-round development of the district.

A total of ₹650 crore has been set aside for the annual plan of the district panchayat. Ongoing projects such as Patheyam for providing noon meals to the needy, Jalashree for revitalising the water sources, and construction of homes as part of the LIFE project will continue this year too.

“Our district panchayat stands way ahead in the State with a plan expenditure of 99.99% in 2018-19. Though there are certain challenges this year due to the financial situation of the State government, there is no room for any concern as the government has assured us that all the bills that are not cleared by March will be paid in April,” said Mr. Madhu.

Result-oriented

Planning Board member K.N. Harilal said that the immediate challenge for the district panchayat was implementing the 150 projects in 150 days, for which priority had to be decided taking into consideration the practicality of the projects. Each grama panchayat should choose result-oriented projects on priority and focus on those in the coming days.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/150-projectsin-150-days/article30926391.ece
164,2020/02/27,P. Parameswaran was a role model: Bhagwat,"‘He was the embodiment of qualities required for a swayamsevak’

P. Parameswaran, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue and founder-director of the Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram (BVK) who passed away on February 9, was a ‘karmayogi’ and a role model, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said.

“Above all, he was a very compassionate human being, a swayamsevak, a pracharak. Such personalities are the expression of eternal presence,” Mr. Bhagwat said, speaking at Namami Parameswaram, a function organised by the BVK here on Wednesday to remember Parameswarji, as he was popularly known.

True ‘shraddhanjali’ could be offered to him by trying to achieve the qualities that he had displayed in life, Mr. Bhagwat said. “There is never a vacuum. It should be filled by us. That should be the real ‘Ssraddhanjali’ to him,” he said.

Parameswaran was the embodiment of the qualities required for a swayamsevak and a pracharak. He displayed strength, character, was knowledgeable and was a fighter. A humble person, he was a living model of Gita Upadesh who had grasped its essence, Mr. Bhagwat said.

‘Humble personality’

Speakers at the function remembered Parameswaran as a self-effacing and humble personality who possessed a sharp intellect and dedicated his life to society.

165,2020/02/27,Student bodies up in arms,"May challenge verdict legally

Student organisations have come out against the High Court’s order banning protests that disrupt the normal functioning of educational institutions. The organisations are contemplating a legal challenge against the order which ruled that strikes, rallies and gheraos that affect classes should not be held on school and college campuses.

In a statement, Students Federation of India State secretary K.M. Sachin Dev said the HC order tramples upon Constitutional rights. The ruling goes against Article 19 of the Constitution which guarantees the Right to Freedom of Speech and to assemble peacefully.

“It is the right of students to raise their voice when even their right to study is being threatened due to the stands taken by private managements and even the government. The ongoing protest in JNU is a case in point. The Arooja’s school in Ernakulam also witnessed a similar protest this week. Campus politics plays a key role in turning students into secular, social beings who are aware of their democratic rights. It is the politically aware students of the country who are now raising their voice against the anti-Constitutional stands taken by the government,” said the statement

The SFI pointed out the instances of private managements torturing students, like in the case of Jishnu Pranoy, on apolitical campuses.

Plea to govt., oppn.

Kerala Students Union State president K.M. Abhijith said the government and Opposition should legally challenge the order

“Our campuses are very much part of the ongoing struggle for democracy in the country. These students are adults, having voting rights. It is unfortunate if anyone thinks that their right to protest should be curbed. Disruptions of classes do not happen so often. We call for such strikes only in crucial situations. The High Court seems to have some misunderstanding regarding this. The KSU will move legally against the order,” said Mr. Abhijith.

Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) State joint secretary Manu Prasad said that a blanket ban on protests would not work in a democratic country.

“In the past too, we have taken the position that everyone should have a right to protest democratically. Similarly, those who do not want to take part in the protests should have a right to stay away from it. The danger of such orders is that the private managements will use it to impose a blanket ban on all protests, even though the order does not say so,” said Mr. Prasad.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/n8agd4/article30926242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tv-Quotecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/student-bodies-up-in-arms/article30926243.ece
166,2020/02/27,HC directs advocate to vacate rented property within two weeks,"Permits landlord to use police force if he fails to comply with court order

The Madras High Court has directed an advocate in Vellore district to vacate a rented premises within two weeks failing which the landlord, a doctor, was given liberty to seek the assistance of the police to evict him. “It is made clear that the pendency of a rent control appeal is not a bar for the police to enter the premises using force,” the court said.

Justice S. Vaidyanathan passed the order on a petition filed by the lawyer V.K. Kumaresan to transfer rent control appeal from the Principal Subordinate Court in Vellore to a Subordinate Court in Ranipet. The advocate had insisted upon transferring the hearing after levelling certain allegations of bias against the presiding officer of the court in Vellore.

During the course of hearing of the transfer petition, the judge found that the lawyer had taken a 1,113 square feet property, belonging to doctor P. Jayaseelan, for a monthly rent of ₹1,800. However, claiming that he did not pay the rent properly since 2006 and was also using the property as a dumping yard, the landlord asked him to vacate in 2010.

The lawyer refused to vacate and so a rent control petition was filed. A trial court allowed the petition in favour of the doctor in 2015 and directed the lawyer to pay rental arears of ₹1.94 lakh. Subsequently, the landlord also filed an execution petition to initiate eviction proceedings but in the meantime, the lawyer went on appeal.

After multiple legal proceedings, the lawyer settled the rental arrears but did not vacate the property. Terming such conduct as a disgrace to the legal profession, Justice Vaidyanathan said: “The petitioner is a venom and if he is allowed to be mingled with other members of the Bar freely, the entire profession would be ruined like how a single drop of poison in a pot of milk turns the whole milk into poison.

“It is apposite to state that law profession is already under severe criticism and due to the activities of lawyers in this State, it further started diminishing its reputation among public. If a tenant, like the petitioner is allowed to occupy the premises, a situation may arise when no owner will rent out his building to an advocate.”

Empathising with the landlord for the agony undergone by him for last 14 years, the judge said: “A house is usually built or bought with the hard earned money of an individual or the family and it is considered to be the most expensive single purchase. The conduct of the petitioner in attempting to squat on such property is condemnable.

“Though this court had given him ample opportunity to correct himself, he has not shown any respect or indulgence to this court and is remorseless.” He also left it open to the landlord to lodge a complaint against the lawyer with the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-directs-advocate-to-vacate-rented-property-within-two-weeks/article30933851.ece
167,2020/02/27,Demand for investigation into school teachers’ recruitments since 2012,"An association approached Madurai Bench of Madras High Court in 2018 demanding an investigation by the CB-CID wing of Tamil Nadu police

Following revelations about irregularities in the recruitment by Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission, a group of people have demanded investigation into school teachers’ recruitments done by Teachers Recruitment Board through Teachers Eligibility Test since 2012.

Alleging that their demand has been ignored for long despite providing documentary evidence indicating widespread irregularities, they blamed the State government and TRB in particular for trying to mislead Madras High Court as well by withholding information.

M. Ilangovan, coordinator, 2013 TET Qualified Candidates’ Welfare Association, said that neither the TRB nor the School Education Department (SED) has till date released the full list of roughly 21,000 persons appointed in 2012.

“Similarly, they have not provided the details of toppers in exams conducted in 2013, 2014 and 2017. They have evaded replying to a number of requests filed under Right to Information Act for obtaining these details,” he said.

S. Vadivelsundar, president of the association, said that information they have collected so far indicated abnormally high numbers of recruitment from a particular center in Salem in the TET examination conducted in 2013. “Similarly, in the recruitment for Geography teachers in the same year, the majority were from Theni and Dindigul,” he said.

He said that the association has also noticed individual anomalies of persons scoring abysmally low marks in the recruitment for secondary grade teachers, but scoring extremely high marks in the relatively tougher paper on the same subject for the recruitment of graduate teachers.

“We approached Madurai Bench of Madras High Court in 2018 demanding an investigation by the CB-CID wing of Tamil Nadu police. The court asked the TRB and the SED to respond, but they have not done so yet,” Mr. Ilangovan alleged.

He said that with the ongoing focus on irregularities in recruitments, they were hopeful that their fresh petition to the TRB would be investigated properly.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ya7nd9/article30929999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/demand-for-investigation-into-school-teachers-recruitments-since-2012/article30930000.ece
168,2020/02/27,DMK president MK Stalin: We have not come together to fight BJP but save India,"Pass resolution against CAA, NRC, NPR, he says at ‘Kudiyurimai Paadhukappu Maanadu’ in Chennai

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday refuted the Centre’s accusation that the Opposition parties were wilfully instigating protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) and urged the Tamil Nadu government to pass a resolution against these three.

Mr. Stalin was speaking at the ‘Kudiyurimai Paadhukappu Maanadu’ organised by the Tamilaga Makkal Otrumai Medai at the YMCA at Royapettah in Chennai.

Stating that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had not fulfilled a number of promises that it made: 2 crore jobs every year, retrieving black money etc, Mr. Stalin said, “We have not come together to fight the BJP government, but to save India, India’s unity and its people. You [BJP] said you will double agricultural income, generate 2 crore jobs every year...you promised that the black money will be brought back, did you do it? Did you inter-link Indian rivers as promised? In Madurai, you said you will build AIIMS. There is not even a board now at the site. So, there are many issues for us to oppose the BJP politically. We don’t need the CAA to do politics. This is an issue that concerns the people and the country.”

He charged that right wing forces were dividing people on the basis of religion. “We oppose Hindutva, not people who believe in Hinduism,” he said.

He said that there would be many issues due to the NPR as one would become a ‘doubtful citizen’ if one could not present documents in proof.

“I raised the issue in State Assembly. TN CM Edappadi K. Palaniswami said that nobody will face problems due to this in Tamil Nadu. But, why did the CM and Deputy CM write a letter to the Centre on February 22 asking for removal of information such as mother tongue, voters ID, birth place of parents, driving licence and cell phone numbers in the 2020 Census. With this, has he not accepted that there are problems with it? The State government must announce that they will not implement the NPR. The State government must pass a resolution in State Assembly stating that the CAA must be repealed,” he said.

Mr. Stalin criticised the Central government for allowing the protests to turn violent in New Delhi.

‘Attack on Constitution’

N. Ram, Chairman, THG Publishing Pvt. Ltd., noted that the country had not seen such an “upsurge in several decades” as it had against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC and said that this was not just a Hindu-Muslim issue but an attack on the Indian Constitution.

“It has gone to the Supreme Court and what I expect from the court is that it will strike down the CAA. It is violative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution,” Mr. Ram said.

He added: “Even if the Supreme Court fails to strike down the CAA as unconstitutional, we must still oppose it. It goes against the basic structure of the Constitution. It polarises society. It divides society and for the first time, it makes religion the basis of citizenship. It is a shame on the Republic of India.”

He said that the Tamil Nadu government should not go ahead with the NPR. “NPR is the first step...not just a first step...but a basis for the NRC.” He also appealed to actor Rajinikanth to reconsider his support for the CAA, the NPR and the NRC.

Pudhucherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said: “When I spoke in the Assembly after passing the resolution in the House, I said that India is a democratic country of various cultures. And, we will not allow people to be divided on the basis of religion. If we have to spill blood, we will do it for inter-faith harmony and we don’t care about losing power.”

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan could not make it to the event due to health reasons. Reading out the message from Mr. Vijayan, K. Balakrishnan, State Secretary, CPM, said, “India’s values of secularism and tolerance face a threat today. It is important to safeguard religious tolerance and unity to face these threats.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5n6fvv/article30928663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MKSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-president-mk-stalin-we-have-not-come-together-to-fight-bjp-but-save-india/article30928662.ece

170,2020/02/27,The Netherlands looks to expand cooperation with State,"Water management will be a main topic of discussion

The Netherlands is looking to expand its cooperation with Tamil Nadu in the areas of water management, agriculture, urban planning and mobility among others, Marten van den Berg, Ambassador of the Netherlands to India, said.

He was in Chennai to announce the appointment of Gopal Srinivasan as Honorary Consul of the Netherlands for Tamil Nadu. Mr. Srinivasan is the founder, chairman and managing director of TVS Capital Funds.

They met Tamil Nadu’s Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam and Finance Secretary S. Krishnan on Wednesday to discuss the potential areas of cooperation. They will be meeting the Chief Minister on Thursday.

The Netherlands is known for its experience in all areas related to water management. The Netherlands can help clean polluted rivers in Chennai like the Cooum, the Adyar and the Buckingham canal and assist in making them navigable, according to a statement. They can provide tremendous expertise in water and flood management to prevent urban flooding, it added.

Mr. Berg pointed out horticulture, aerospace, life sciences and healthcare, education, tourism as other potential areas of cooperation.

There are nearly 15 Dutch companies which have a presence in Tamil Nadu like Shell Business Services, Randstad, Stahl India, Paques B.V., among others and an equal number of Tamil Nadu-based companies that have invested in sectors like information technology, agro-food and textiles in the Netherlands.

Mr. Srinivasan said he was hopeful of taking the Netherlands-Tamil Nadu relations to much greater heights, mainly in the areas of MSME business, education and water reliance, and pointed out the State’s long association with the Dutch.

Tamil Nadu and the Netherlands have historical ties dating back to over 400 years when the Dutch merchants set up trading posts in Pulicat and Sadras, both of which lie close to Chennai. The Tamil Nadu Archives contains over 300,000 documents in the Dutch language and around 90,000 of these original documents were laminated and digitalized with the help of the Netherlands National Archives, according to a release.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-netherlands-looks-to-expand-cooperation-with-state/article30926713.ece

The father of a class 10 student, who was raped and murdered in 2011 in Pudukkottai, moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday seeking a compensation of ₹1 crore from the State for its inability to solve the case.

K. Kalaikumar, the petitioner, said his daughter was raped and murdered in 2011 by unidentified persons at their home when he and his wife, both teachers, were at work. .

The case was first transferred to the CB-CID and then to the CBI. However, till date perpetrators have not been found, Mr. Kalaikumar said. Under the circumstances, last year the CBI submitted a closure report before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Tiruchi, citing inability to collect evidence in the case, which was accepted.

This was a complete failure on the part of the State who have failed to crack the case, he said. The State should realise its vicarious liability and provide compensation of ₹1 crore to the family for the failure of the investigating agencies in the case, the petitioner said. He added that his representation to the State made in this regard had not been acknowledged.

172,2020/02/27,HC decides ownership of temple property using Chola inscriptions,"Judge deems patta and partition deed insufficient proof of ownership

The Madras High Court has come to the rescue of Adheepureeswarar temple at Keezhakasakudi village in Karaikkal taluk of Puducherry in claiming title over huge tracts of immovable properties situated around it. It relied solely upon epigraphs on the walls of the temple, dating back to 1174 and 1227 CE, to prove that the valuable lands had actually been donated to it by the then Chola kings.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam dismissed an appeal suit filed by Balkis Natchiar and her family members who claimed title over the properties on the basis of a partition deed reportedly executed between their ancestors during the French rule of Puducherry in 1961 and a patta issued by the revenue officials in recent years.

‘Not sufficient’

The judge said, “Neither the partition deed nor the patta would be sufficient to prove title.”

“The contention of the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that the Notaire in French government used to verify the title cannot be taken as a conclusive evidence so as to grant the relief of declaration of title. This court cannot come to the conclusion that the Notaire would have done title verification and only thereafter, signed the partition. Such a presumption is inadmissible in law,” the judge said.

Burden of proof

He also observed that the appellants could not claim title over the property by simply contending that the temple was also not in possession of any document to prove its title. “The plaintiff, who instituted the suit for declaration, is expected to prove his case at the first instance. Non production of the title documents by the temple would not be a ground for the appellant plaintiff to seek for the relief of declaration of title,” he noted.

Nevertheless, pointing out that the inscriptions found on the temple walls had been documented by the Archaelogical Survey of India (ASI), the judge said: “When the inscriptions are very much available and such inscriptions are recorded in South Indian Inscriptions, Volume VII, maintained by Director General, ASI, and there is a clear version regarding the gifting of the property in favour of the temple by the Dynasty of Raja Raja Cholan.

“Thus, this court has no hesitation in arriving a conclusion that the temple has established their title with reference to the suit schedule property and the appellants / plaintiffs have not placed any record to establish their title. There appears to be many encroachments of the temple lands. The Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department is duty bound to prevent all such encroachments by following due procedures,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-decides-ownership-of-temple-property-using-chola-inscriptions/article30926698.ece
173,2020/02/27,Scam surfaces in 2018 NEET; medico held,"Youth engaged a proxy to write the exam in Hindi at Gaya

The Crime Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police on Wednesday arrested a second-year medico on the charge of fraudulently securing admission in the Madras Medical College (MMC) by paying ₹20 lakh to a broker.

The suspect engaged a proxy to write the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) held at Gaya in Bihar in 2018 to get the seat.

Acting on a complaint lodged by the MMC Dean suspecting foul play in the admission of D. Dhanush Kumar, 20, a special team of the CB-CID called for documents from CBSE, which conducted the test that year, and found that the student had engaged a proxy writer. His father K. Devendra had paid ₹20 lakh to facilitate the fraud.

Investigation revealed that Kumar joined a coaching centre in Bengaluru to prepare for NEET. He was approached by a broker who promised to get him seat by arranging the proxy. After paying an advance of ₹3 lakh, he followed the instructions on how to fill the application and other formalities.

Hindi medium

Kumar, a native of Hosur in Tamil Nadu, opted for Gaya as the examination centre and also chose to write the examination in Hindi. He “cleared” NEET with a good score and got into MMC, which is usually the first choice of toppers in the State.

“His score in Plus-Two was very poor. Had the staff/invigilators at the examination centre verified the photograph in the hall ticket and the person who appeared for the examination, the fraud could have been detected on the spot. Kumar is said to have failed in some subjects in first year MBBS,” a CB-CID official told The Hindu.

Manhunt on

After ensuring that he got a good score in NEET, Kumar and his father paid the balance of ₹17 lakh to the broker.

“Efforts are on to apprehend the broker who is a native of Bengaluru. There seems to be no link between Rashid, the prime suspect in the 2019 NEET scam, and the suspects in the 2018 NEET scam.

Kumar is not able to confirm whether like him more students engaged proxy writers but the modus operandi points to a suspicion that more students would have been involved in the scam,” the official said.

When investigators questioned Kumar about his ability to write NEET in Hindi, the suspect, who initially refused to cooperate, later confessed that he had no knowledge of Hindi and opted the centre and language going by the instructions of the broker. Kumar and his father were arrested and remanded to judicial custody. Police were trying to locate the proxy writer in Gaya.

The CB-CID is already investigating a scam in the 2019 NEET, conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA), in which 16 persons, including 7 medicos, were arrested on charges of impersonation and cheating.

174,2020/02/27,‘Special courts for hearing graft cases not entitled to grant anticipatory bail’,"Only sessions courts and the High Court have the power to do that: HC

The special courts constituted across the State to try Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA) cases are not empowered to entertain anticipatory bail applications filed by the accused, since such power has been conferred only on the sessions courts and the High Court under the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Madras High Court has held.

Justice M. Dhandapani passed the ruling after differing with a majority view taken on the issue by two judges of a Full Bench (comprising three judges) in the Patna High Court and concurring with a minority view of the third judge in the Bench.

‘Erroneous decision’

He observed that the majority decision of the Full Bench was “erroneous”.

“This court, with great respect to the learned judges on the Bench, is unable to accept the said view expressed therein. This court, holistically, is in agreement with the minority view expressed by the learned Judge on the Full Bench who has given his dissent holding that the special court is not vested with jurisdiction to take on board an advance bail application,” he said.

The judge also directed the Registrar (Judicial) M. Jothiraman of the High Court to place his present judgment, on the issue of entertaining anticipatory bail petitions, before Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi for being circulated to all trial courts in the State as well as those in the Union Territory of Puducherry to be followed henceforth.

The orders were passed on a petition filed by V. Sridharan who had been booked by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) under PCA. Though the accused initially filed an anticipatory bail petition before the Principal Sessions Court in Tiruvallur, it was returned with an endorsement to move it before an appropriate forum.

He then moved the Chief Judicial Magistrate court, designated as a Special Court for PCA cases, but the latter refused to entertain his plea. Hence, the accused had moved the High Court with the present petition seeking a direction to the special court to entertain his anticipatory bail plea and dispose it of on merits.

Refusing to issue such a direction, Justice Dhandapani said Section 438 of the CrPC makes it clear that advance bail petitions could be filed only before a court of sessions or a High Court. Since a special court acts as a Magistrate court during initial stages of taking cognisance of a case and performs the duty of a sessions court only during trial, it was not empowered to entertain a plea for anticipatory bail, he held.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/special-courts-for-hearing-graft-cases-not-entitled-to-grant-anticipatory-bail/article30926683.ece
175,2020/02/27,Karnataka’s push for dam project goes against SC verdict: Palaniswami,"‘We have been raising the issue with Cauvery Authority’

Karnataka's bid to secure approval for a dam project at Mekedatu during Monday’s meeting of the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA) in New Delhi goes against the Supreme Court’s final verdict on the river dispute, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Wednesday.

“Tamil Nadu has been raising the issue for quite some time now. In its judgment, the SC had clearly stated that no one can divert or prevent the supply of the water meant for the State. In spite of this, Karnataka had been raising the issue whenever the CWMA met,” the Chief Minister said while addressing the media.

To a question on the omission of Tiruchi and Ariyalur from the Protected Special Agricultural Zone, Mr. Palaniswami said a study had revealed that besides Thanjavur, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur districts, only a few parts of Pudukottai and Cuddalore districts were identified as places where methane gas extraction was possible. Based on the survey, these places were brought under the Protected Special Agricultural Zone. As far as Tiruchi, Karur and Ariyalur districts were concerned, they had a number of industries. If they were brought under the protected zone, they would have been adversely affected. Hence, they were left out of the zone.

He said there was no question of disturbing the existing projects in the delta districts. “It has been clearly mentioned in the Act and the gazette notification,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

The declaration of delta areas as being part of a Protected Special Agricultural Zone was within the powers vested with the State on agriculture. The Centre had also been apprised of this, the Chief Minister said.

When asked about the DMK teaming up with election strategist Prashant Kishor for the 2021 Assembly election, Mr. Palaniswami said that in a democracy, votes cannot be purchased by agencies.

Policies and performance were key factors for winning the confidence of the voters, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/karnatakas-push-for-dam-project-goes-against-sc-verdict-palaniswami/article30926674.ece
176,2020/02/27,‘Panel probing Jaya’s death being given extensions to shield CM’,"If report is published, Palaniswami will have to spend time in jail, says Stalin

“If the Commission of Inquiry’s report on the hospitalisation and death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa is published, both Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam will have to spend time in jail. This is why the Commission is repeatedly being given extensions,” DMK president M.K. Stalin alleged on Wednesday.

Speaking at an event in Ranipet, Mr. Stalin said the Justice Arumughaswamy Commission, which was supposed to have completed the inquiry in three months, had now been given a four-month extension — the seventh overall.

“It has been three years since the Commission was formed. It was supposed to submit the report by the time of Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary (February 24) this year, but has been given another extension,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said that when the DMK comes to power, Mr. Panneerselvam and Mr. Palaniswami would have to face justice in the case. “They can escape now, but we will definitely catch them once we come to power. Even Duraimurugan (DMK treasurer) may have a soft heart But I won’t leave them. When Jayalalithaa was CM, she died under mysterious circumstances, and the current government is functioning under that shadow. They are not bothered about the people,” Mr. Stalin said.

He said the DMK and its allies were protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as they were fighting for everyone, including the Chief Minister. When a group of eminent persons met the CM to express their concerns about the Act, Mr. Palaniswami reportedly told them that he too did not know of his place of birth and did not have documents for the same, Mr. Stalin claimed.

“So, we are fighting for everyone, including the Chief Minister,” he said, blaming the AIADMK for the protests across the country as it was on the back of its support that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/622d1d/article30804781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13DMKMKSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/panel-probing-jayas-death-being-given-extensions-to-shield-cm/article30926669.ece
177,2020/02/27,Leaders condemn clashes in Delhi,"Condemning the violence in northeast Delhi, political leaders in Tamil Nadu have demanded the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah.

Expressing shock over the deadly clashes between anti- and pro-CAA protesters, PMK founder S. Ramadoss said the agitators should understand that violence is never a solution. He sought strict action against those who were involved in the riots.

Actor Rajinikanth alleged that the protests in Delhi were the result of an “intelligence failure” on the part of the Central government. “At a time when the President of the United States was on a visit here, they should have been extremely careful. They should have quelled the protests with an iron fist,” he told reporters. He added that the Home Ministry had to answer for the violence.

The Indian Union Muslim League said peace should be restored in the violence-hit areas. P.K. Kunhalikutty of the IUML said security must be strengthened to restore normalcy.

Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani said he was pained by the news that 20 persons had been killed in clashes between two groups.

178,2020/02/27,Retired judge to dispose of properties of mentally challenged man adopted by HC,"Court had invoked doctrine of loco parentis since his life was under threat

The Madras High Court has appointed its former judge K. Chandru as a Commissioner to sell vast properties belonging to 40-year-old mentally challenged Manoj Rajan whom the court had adopted in August 2016 by invoking the doctrine of loco parentis (in the place of a parent) since many had tried to cheat him after the death of his parents.

Justice P.N. Prakash, who had been following up the case of Mr. Rajan for the last four years by keeping him under foster care at Madurai-based MS Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation run by reputed psychiatrist C. Ramasubramanian, had appointed Justice K. Chandru to dispose of the properties and use the money to take care of him.

It was during the hearing of a petition alleging abduction of Mr. Rajan that Justice Prakash learnt about the mentally challenged man who had lost his mother at the age of 14. His wealthy father had got him married at the age of 29 but the wedlock did not last long as the woman decided to part ways and obtained divorce on mutual consent after citing his illness.

However, after Mr. Rajan’s father death in 2013, his former wife abducted him with the assistance of her associates and got remarried solely with the intention of grabbing the properties. However, a family friend rescued him and filed a case in court leading to Justice Prakash ordering a Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID) inquiry.

Finding that a huge gang was waiting for an opportunity to usurp the properties of the hapless individual whose life could be at risk if the court does not step in to safeguard him, the judge ensured his safety handing him over to the trust in Madurai where he had developed a lot of skills over the last four years through the intervention of trained personnel.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/retired-judge-to-dispose-of-properties-of-mentally-challenged-man-adopted-by-hc/article30926091.ece
179,2020/02/27,Poll petition against Parthiban dismissed,"Petitioner, who insisted on arguing the case personally, did not turn up for the hearing on two occasions

The Madras High Court on Wednesday dismissed for non-prosecution an election petition filed by a woman candidate challenging the victory of S.R. Parthiban of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam from Salem Parliamentary constituency last year.

Justice P.T. Asha rejected the petition since the litigant, G. Pravina, who claimed to be a MBBS graduate apart from having obtained a law degree too, insisted on arguing the case in person but could not make it to the court on most occasions.

The judge agreed with Richardson Wilson, counsel for the returned candidate, that the election petition need not be kept pending any more since the petitioner did not appear to be serious in prosecuting the case and had been exhibiting a lethargic attitude.

When the case was listed on January 3, the litigant reported that she could not appear before the court on short notice. Hence, the judge directed the Registry to inform the petitioner over phone as well as through WhatsApp regarding the hearing fixed on February 3.

The Registry complied with the order and the litigant too acknowledged. Nevertheless, she did not appear before the court on February 3 too. Enquiries revealed that she had been addressing various letters to the Registry on the WhatsApp number from which she had received notice.

Making it clear that a litigant could not make applications through WhatsApp, the judge adjourned the case to February 26 with a warning that it would be dismissed in case of non appearance. Despite the warning, she was not present on Wednesday and so the judge dismissed the case.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/poll-petition-against-parthiban-dismissed/article30925955.ece
180,2020/02/27,"'Android Kunjappan', 'Nine', 'Red Rain': How sci-fi and technology-based movies have fared in Malayalam cinema","The history of science and technology in the industry is of mostly failed attempts, but filmmakers and scenarists continue to experiment with bold, fantasy themes

An old man, wearing a white mundu and a light-green shirt, walks back home through a typical Kerala rural neighbourhood with his caretaker – a short white android, also clad in a mundu with a thorthu around his shoulders. This would have sounded surreal and an improbable recipe for a hit in Mollywood a few years ago. But not today, after the success of Android Kunjappan 5.25, last year.

The film was a bold attempt since past works of science-fiction (sci-fi) or similar themes featuring science or technology haven’t had much success in Kerala. “I wasn’t worried about whether or not it would be a success since I was confident it would work if I turned it into a family drama. The tough part was getting a supportive producer as it was a double whammy – a technological fantasy with a septuagenarian protagonist,” says Ratheesh Balakrishna Pothuval, who wrote and directed Kunjappan.

Jenuse Mohamed’s Prithviraj-starrer Nine was the other ‘scientific’ cinematic surprise of 2019. Prithviraj plays an astrophysicist, a rarity in itself for Malayalam cinema, investigating an astronomical phenomenon in the movie. Jenuse adds, “However, more than a pure sci-fi, the film was a psychological thriller. That made it a far more palatable watch for the viewers.”

Blast from the past

The history of science and technology in Malayalam cinema is a history of mostly failed attempts. Madhu Muttom’s Bharathan Effect, which explored the concept of anti-gravity, and Vinayan’s Athishayan (2007), a tale clearly inspired by Marvel’s Hulk, both failed to connect with the audience. Poor CGI might have been a reason why they didn’t work. “If the idea is extremely fanciful, then it’s important to make the audience feel that what is happening on-screen is plausible. Hollywood movies often have the budget for good CGI, but we don’t. That is why we decided to make an actual android which could move minimally and a stunt double for certain scenes in Kunjappan. CGI was kept to a minimum,” says Ratheesh.

Meanwhile Rahul Sadasivan’s Red Rain (2013), starring Narain, was a well-made science-fiction thriller. It explored, perhaps for the first time in Malayalam cinema, an extra-terrestrial theme inspired by the red rain phenomenon that had occurred in Kerala in 2001. Although it was appreciated for various aspects of its making, it failed to leave an impact on the audience. Commenting on the style and theme of the film, Rahul says, “The style employed is Western and was inspired by subjects that are explored there. It is, however, hard to sell such a theme in Kerala since there is a limited audience for it.”

The first sci-fi in Malayalam was released in 1967. Directed by P Subramaniam, Karutha Rathrikal was an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde with Madhu in the lead role. Apart from that, science and technology in Malayalam cinema have been restricted to communication devices, killer robots and tacky lairs of villains in CID Nazir films, clearly inspired by props from the James Bond series.

The one science that Malayalam cinema has explored well is medical science. “Medical ethos have been well portrayed in films such as Amrutham Gamaya (1987) and Ayalum Njanum Thammil (2012). Meanwhile, the dark side of the medical community comes up in Nirnayam (1995) and Joseph (2019). Mohanlal in Ulladakkam (1991) and Soman in Thalavattam (1986) showed how diametrically opposite two people practising the same profession can be,” explains Dr. Chris Abraham, a city-based psychiatrist and movie buff. The popularity of medical dramas and thrillers in Malayalam, Jenuse says, is because of the social aspect of medicine, and how familiar people are with hospital procedures and doctors. This might be a reason why Aashiq Abu’s Virus (2019) was well-received, apart from the fact that Nipah outbreak and its severity were still fresh in people’s memories.

Set in a familiar terrain

Both Ratheesh and Jenuse agree that in order for science-centric movies to work in Kerala, the stories must be set in a terrain familiar to the Malayalam audience. In fact, the best works, both in literature and cinema, with science or technology at the heart of it, were commentaries or critiques on human nature and society. Be it Aldous Huxely’s Brave New World or James Cameron’s Avatar, the story was about our society.

The recent attempts in Malayalam cinema to portray science- and technology- centered themes seem inspired by this. “Kunjappan was born out of my desire to explore the alienation mobile devices are creating in our society. It was inspired by the observation that nowadays people travelling in trains rarely speak to their co-passengers like we used to in the past. All of us are glued to our screens,” Ratheesh says. He says the android in his movie symbolises a totality of technologies that keep us busy today.

Although not a sci-fi, Aashiq’s path-breaking Virus is a movie centred on a scientific quest to control a potential pandemic. Muhsin Parari, one of the writers of the movie, admits that they were worried how people would receive a world filled with medical jargon. He adds, “Most of the dramatic moments in the movie were around some kind of scientific concept or the other. So we were careful to ensure that the script was as engaging as possible. But then again, fear of death and hope are universal feelings.”

For any movie to be successful, Jenuse says, the focus should be on human elements that people can relate to. Nine, for instance, was more of a psychological journey than a scientific one. “For a large portion of the Malayalam audience, those themes are hard to comprehend. So you need to make it culturally relevant for them like Ratheesh did in Kunjappan,” quips Jenuse.

The social and cultural relevance regarding the issue of care for elderly people in Kerala, Ratheesh believes, was a factor in making his movie a success. This larger social aspect may have been the missing factor in the past attempts at sci-fi in Malayalam or maybe they were just unlucky to have come out before the current generation of movie-goers had arrived on the scene.

Nevertheless, Muhsin believes a new group of movie-goers made up of generation-Z provides an opportunity for Malayalam writers and filmmakers to try sci-fi and other bold, fantasy themes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ialmby/article30930550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvandroid4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/android-kunjappan-nine-red-rain-how-sci-fi-and-technology-based-movies-have-fared-in-malayalam-cinema/article30930553.ece
181,2020/02/27,"I'm a 'visiting actor' in Tamil cinema, says Dulquer Salmaan ahead of ‘Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal’","The Malayalam actor speaks about fanboying over Gautham Menon, establishing his own production firm to support young filmmakers, and his upcoming Kollywood release

Dulquer Salmaan is everywhere... in the Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu and Hindi film industries. This omnipresence does make him wonder where his career is headed to right now, “I’m always working. Maybe it’s just that nobody is working in so many industries at the moment,” says Dulquer with a chuckle, reminiscent of the one that made women swoon over him, when OK Kanmani hit screens in 2015.

Dulquer reveals an interesting information on how he filters content, one that may or may not guarantee you his dates. The actor prefers a narration from the director. “I get a sense of their vision when they narrate. If I’m reading a script, I have a different movie that is playing in my head. That’s why some of the movies have failed,” he laughs, “I need to see how passionate they are...to get a better sense of the world.” He says he would rather sit idle and binge-watch movies than sign up projects just for the sake of it. That did happen to a large extent, when he was out of work for almost nine months recently.

A visiting actor

Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal (KKK) marks the directorial début of Desingh Periyasamy. It is not that Dulquer has not worked with newcomers before. But what convinced him of KKK was Periyasamy’s crisp narration. “It was fast-paced. The movie is packed with emotion and the intensity doesn’t drop even by an ounce,” he says, clarifying that KKK is not a homage to Mani Ratnam’s Thiruda Thiruda, the title of which was taken from the song ‘Kannum Kannum’.

Dulquer returns to Tamil cinema following Solo in 2017. A word of caution; do not use the word ‘comeback’ to describe his re-entry. He says he prefers to label himself a “visiting actor”. Says Dulquer, “I cannot plan my career here like how a Tamil actor would do. Because he/she is predominately focusing on Tamil Nadu, which I cannot afford.” Ask him how he dealt with the failure of Solo and he says, “Life goes on. It wasn’t the end of my career. When Solo released, I had movies lined up for a year,” he says, adding, “It’s my mom who gets worked up when my movies flop. I’ll have to console her saying, ‘Ma, I have movies for a year’.”

What’s DQ chasing? Dulquer has always been torn between playing character-driven roles and star-vehicles. He plays a charming, romantic-at-heart character in a movie like Charlie but at the same time, he surprises with a movie like Kammatipaadam. “Which is nice in hindsight. But if I don’t find a character worth of substance for a while, then I’m like ‘where am I heading?’. It’s because I’m greedy about good content.”

He does acknowledge that there is a fair bit of typecasting in the industry, especially when he is offered has-been roles. “But a character-driven role doesn’t necessarily guarantee a good movie, right?,” he continues, “At the end of the day, I have to shoulder the project — whether it is Kammatipaadam, Parava or Mahanati.”

Another aspect of Dulquer you need to know is this: he turns down rom-coms on a daily basis. But that does not take away the fact that he became the poster boy of romance when Mani Ratnam launched him in Tamil. Dulquer takes a pause and begins by emphasising, “KKK is not a rom-com, if that’s what you are thinking.” He explains, “It has romance, is racy in parts and has a thriller element to it. In terms of my line-up this year, I think KKK stands out.”

System at fault

But Dulquer is not the only star of KKK. The movie has filmmaker Gautham Menon playing an extended role, “We were all fanboying over him [Gautham Menon] as if some superstar had arrived on the sets,” says Dulquer, “He brought a certain amount of maturity to it.”

KKK was billed as Dulquer’s 25th movie, had it not been muddled by financial crunches. Delays, production issues and bad-marketing are an inevitable part of the glitzy, glam world of the movie industry. Dulquer is aware of that, even if it puts him in helpless situations at times. It was one of the reasons why he established his own production firm, to support young filmmakers, warranting a smooth release. “Being invested in a project and marketing it right is a lot of commitment. We face delays in release when that fails. It’s frustrating sometimes when you aren’t allowed to work and they lock you down with your previous movies,” says Dulquer, about how he handled the delayed release of KKK, whose production began in 2017.

Inside Dulquer’s world

The actor feels that there’s room for everyone and anyone in Malayalam cinema. “Whoever does good work gets the lion’s share. Take a movie like Kumbalangi Nights for instance. It’s a small movie, but did great numbers. It’s the same case with Anjaam Pathiraa. Ultimately, one needs to rethink the way scripts are being written.”

Every actor is insecure in one way or the other, and Dulquer Salmaan is no different. “I’m insecure about my growth,” says the actor. Expanding further, he says, “When you earlier mentioned typecasting, I am beginning to think if the audience perceives me that way. That’s why I break away from the mould and do a movie like Kammatipaadam. But, I cannot create a movie like that. It has to find me.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/q9qa3s/article30931808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/D9A3511JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/im-a-visiting-actor-in-tamil-cinema-says-dulquer-salmaan-ahead-of-kannum-kannum-kollaiyadithaal/article30931809.ece
182,2020/02/27,Talat Mahmood’s voice of love and longing,"None could capture the ache of romance better than Talat Mahmood

If romantic longing of the human heart could be given an aural form, it would be Talat Mahmood’s voice. Listen to some of the softest songs of yearning from Hindi films to realise how Talat’s voice is a whispering window to pain and pine. Poet Shelley’s immortal lines that “the pleasure that is in sorrow is sweeter than the pleasure of pleasure itself” is an apt summation of Talat Mahmood’s singing.

Talat’s velvet soft singing complimented an almost parallel thought of Shelley through Shailendra’s song of “Patita”. Inspired by Shelley’s immortal lines, “our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought”, the song “Hain Sabse Madhur Vo Geet Jinhein Hum Dard Ke Sur Mein Gaate Hain” comes alive in the dew throated voice of Talat. Filmed on Dev Anand and Usha Kiran, the song depicted a lover comforting a misery struck woman but it is the Talat’s voice that gives you goose-bumps.

Time and again, the uncrowned ‘King of ghazals’ poured forth gentle emotions, moulding his songs into sweet sagas of sacred, unrequited passion. ‘Jalte hain jiske liye teri aankhon ke diye” (Sujata) with its haunting tune and heartwarming lyrics has been rendered timeless by Talat’s voice. Harmonium has played an intrinsic part in many a Bollywood song, but never has it been complemented with such finesse as in this song. Majrooh Sultanpuri’s lines explore the depths of emotions.

Similarly, ‘Mitwa nahin aaye’ (Devdas), an S. D. Burman composition with Sahir Ludhianvi’s lyrics is another gem rendered impeccably by Talat. Its tender pitch is backed by Talat’s caressingly soft expressions.

His singing endeared him to lovelorn youngsters of the era, while many drooled over his inflections of Urdu and Hindi verses. Talat also set the benchmark for the non-classical, light ghazals with his fabulous diction and petal soft voice. Later, Jagjit Singh, Pankaj Udhas and Chandan Das followed his footsteps.

Distinct impression

Starting from the earliest non-film ghazal ‘Tasveer teri dil mera behla na sakegi’ of Fayyaz Hashmi with music by Kamal Dasgupta, Talat made a distinct impression on the hooked-to-the-radio generation of the 1940s. After a string of similar non-film ghazals as well as Bengali film songs, Talat made a resounding impact when he entered the Bombay film industry. He enchanted connoisseurs and common man alike with his songs and ghazals.

Every song is a testament to the goodness of the artiste, who was referred to as a thorough gentleman. Rewind to gems like ‘Sapnon ki suhani duniya ko’ (Shikast), ‘Humse aaya na gaya’ (Dekh Kabira Roya), ‘Jayen to jayen kahaan’ (Taxi Driver), ‘Tasveer banata hun” (Baradari), “Seene mein sulagtein hain armaa’ (Taraana), ‘Sham-e-gham ki qasam’ (Footpath), ‘Meri yaad mein tumna’ (Madhosh), ‘Phir wohi sham wohi gam’ (Jahanara), ‘Aye mere dil kahin aur chal’ (Daag), ‘Zindagi dene wale sun’ (Dil-e-Nadaan) to understand the era when melody was the king and soft-throated thrush was an adornment. His duets like ‘Itna na mujhse tu pyaar badha’ (Chhaya), ‘Dil-e-Nadan tujhe hua kya hai” (Mirza Ghalib), “Kehta hai dil tum ho mere liye” (Mem Sahib), “Pyas kuchh aur bhi bhadka di” (Lala Rukh) and ‘Pyar par bas to nahin hai’ (Sone Ki Chidiya) with Lata Mangeshkar, Suraiyya and Asha Bhosle are etched in our hearts.

Born in Lucknow in 1924, Talat, despite parental objections, took to learning music. Along with his voice, his exceptionally good looks helped him get lead roles in films like Lala Rukh, Sone Ki Chidiya, Dil-e-Nadaan, Dak Babu, Raftaar, Ek Gaon Ki Kahani and many more. But while the celluloid roles did not augment his status, his singing certainly lent him an enduring glory. As the synthetic sounds of electronic instruments started dominating film music, the soft, pure notes of the handsome singer receded into the background.

Married to his lady love Latika Mullick, Talat never saw his contemporaries as competitors, instead held them in high esteem. At the demise of his dear friend and colleague Mohammed Rafi, Talat said, “I wish the Almighty had taken my life instead of Rafi Sahab’s as the world needs him more!” Two of the greatest voices of Hindi cinema came together in the song, ‘Ghum ki andheri raat mein’ (Sushila).",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5mqu8b/article30931608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Talat-Mahmood,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/talat-mahmoods-voice-of-love-and-longing/article30931609.ece

Filmmaker Rian Johnson has revealed that tech giant Apple has mandated that the villains or the bad guys in the films cannot be shown using its flagship product, iPhone.

In a video interview with Vanity Fair, Johnson discussed a scene from his recent murder mystery feature Knives Out.

In the scene, all the members of a family have iPhones, barring one character who is revealed to be the killer in the film’s climax.

Johnson said, “I don’t know if I should say this or not. Not because it’s lascivious or something, but because it’s gonna screw me on the next mystery movie that I write.”

“But forget it, I’ll say it, it’s very interesting. Apple, they let you use iPhones in movies, but, and this is very pivotal, if you’re ever watching a mystery movie, bad guys cannot have iPhones on camera,” the filmmaker added.

184,2020/02/27,Bangalore Queer Film Festival to be held from March 6 to 8,"A highlight will be the screening of 1919 German film ‘Anders Als Die Andern’

It is that time of the year again where you can kick off your shoes, lie on a mattress and watch a film as the 11th edition of the Bangalore Queer Film Festival (BQFF) will be held from March 6 to 8. Around 65 films, including shorts, documentaries, feature length, and animated films, will be screened with Max Mueller Bhavan hosting on the first day and Alliance Francaise de Bangalore on the other two days.

Talking about what festival-goers can expect, Nadika Nadja, one of the eight co-directors of the festival, says: “Usually, we don’t go by categories at the festival. Instead, we look at representation, the larger narrative and the politics of each of these films and how the films redefine the idea of queer. That has largely been the focus of BQFF. Earlier, a lot of films, not just at BQFF but also at other queer film festivals, were focused on gay men. “But over the last few years, we have got a lot of trans and intersex focus. So, we are looking at how queerness is being represented and what we can do to change the dialogue around it.”

She adds, “When people say queer cinema, they usually mean gay and some lesbian films. The dynamic is almost always that. For instance, there are very few films that talk about the bisexual part in LGBT. And trans films are usually full of gloom and made by a cis man who wants to save us. That is why we try to get films made by queer people themselves who talk about their aspect of queerness, how they live and negotiate life.”

What to watch out for

Anders Als Die Andern (1919, German)

The Blonde One (Spanish)

Kattumaram (Tamil)

Gay India Matrimony (Bengali)

Nupishabi (Manipuri)

Kucumbu Tubuh Indahku (Indonesian film)

Love and Death in Montmartre

There will also be performances, including a dramatised reading of Esthappen's new play, Slam Bam Thank You Ma'am, which looks at emerging sexual trends and practices in the queer community through the lives of its characters.

Detailing some of the films that will be screened, Nadika says, “There are a whole bunch of films that are exciting and interesting. We will be screening a 100-year-old German film that is very queer called Anders Als Die Andern. Then there is Coffee Café, a Tamil feature-length film, which I like for the way it represents the denominations of what queerness means.”

Stating that the BQFF has grown over the last decade, Rovan Varghese, co-director, says, “From being just a bunch of people coming together to celebrate queer cinema, it is now one of the premier events of the Bangalore queer space. A lot of cinephiles too come for the festival because not only do they get to watch mainstream queer cinema but also the film festival provides a space for a lot of smaller documentaries, shorts etc. that one would never get to see or hear about. And because the films are from across the world, it covers a wide spectrum of topics and queer lives and perspectives.”

He adds, “It is also a forum for the community to come together. It is a big social space for people to interact and connect with each other. One of the unique things about the BQFF is that a large part of it is crowd-funded, which means that the community space and relevance of the film festival is retained in spirit.”

185,2020/02/27,"‘Forensic’ sees Tovino in the role of a medico-legal advisor, say directors Akhil Paul and Anas Khan","The Mollywood film, which releases on February 28, focuses on a forensic officer and his scientific methods in helping solve a sensational case, say the newbie filmmakers

Whodunits never fail to pique interest. And Mollywood has a long list of gripping crime thrillers, with the CBI investigation series featuring the uber-cool sleuth Sethurama Iyer, played by Mammootty, being a shining example. But most often, such thrillers move forward from the perspective of police officers or astute detectives. Tovino Thomas-starrer Forensic, written and directed by Akhil Paul and Anas Khan, and releasing on February 28, shifts the focus towards a forensic officer and his scientific methods in helping solve a sensational case.

“A crime jolts a city and the police swing into action. A forensic officer, the protagonist of our story, joins the investigation team. The young medico-legal advisor realises he has a key role to play in tracking down the killer,” says Akhil, preferring to keep the details under wraps. “Once we came up with the one-liner idea, we realised it could be best narrated in the investigation format,” adds Anas. Forensic also marks the directorial début of Akhil and Anas, both engineers. Akhil, who earlier scripted neo-noir mystery thriller 7th Day with Prithviraj Sukumaran in the lead, says it’s a genre they both have interest in.

“The seed of the idea for Forensic germinated from a news report. We felt that we could develop an interesting yarn out of the incident. That’s when I realised that though there are quite a few investigation thrillers, the point of view of a forensic expert, a key person in several crime case solutions, was something unexplored in Malayalam. When Tovino, whom we became friends with during the shoot of 7th Day, heard the story, he loved it,” says Akhil. Forensic is also Tovino’s first release this year.

Despite the freshness of the perspective, Anas says the directors have not attempted to weave a story simply to fit into a forensic analysis background. “In fact, the process was the other way round. We wanted to narrate the story through such a backdrop and cherry-picked the forensic aspects required for the framework. Of course, it’s given a cinematic flourish as the film follows a commercial formula and equation,” points out Akhil.

Tag team Kannur native Akhil and Anas from Pathanamthitta studied mechanical engineering together at TKM College of Engineering, Kollam, where their creative collaboration took wing.

“We are both movie buffs and spearheaded the formation of a film club in the college. That was also the time I was independently working on the script of 7th Day,” says Akhil. Lovers of mystery stories, they joined hands for a “big-budget project” after college, which, however, did not materialise. “But the collaboration helped blossom a creative rapport between us,” adds Anas. The duo says working together “helps us take better decisions.”

During the scripting, the directors sought pointers from the forensic team of the Kerala police to “refine” the screenplay. “We consulted experts at the Forensic Science Laboratory and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in the capital city for their inputs. We then showed the screenplay to subject experts for vetting and corrections, while maintaining that it, however, is a cinematic version,” explains Akhil. Earlier, the duo also sought “advice and inputs” from renowned forensic surgeon B Umadathan, known as the ‘Sherlock Holmes of Kerala’, who passed away last year.

Others in the cast include Mamta Mohandas, who plays an IPS officer, Reba Monica John, Renji Panicker, Saiju Kurup, Prathap Pothen and Srikant Murali. Shot mainly in Palakkad, Coimbatore and Chennai, the cinematography is by Akhil George. Music is scored by Jakes Bejoy and though Forensic “does not feature any songs in the traditional format”, Akhil points out that they have incorporated “lyrics-supported music snippets” to suit situations.

Akhil admits with a chuckle that perhaps expectations for Forensic are high in the light of box-office success of the recent crime thriller, Anjaam Pathiraa, but underlines that “the treatment” of the former is quite different. As a genre, he feels crime and investigative thrillers always command “an undying interest” from cine-goers, citing P Padmarajan’s Mammooty-starrer mystery thriller Ee Thanutha Veluppan Kalathu and 1990 film Mukham featuring Mohanlal as big inspirations.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fn2k6a/article30930136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvmstill3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/forensic-sees-tovino-in-the-role-of-a-medico-legal-advisor-say-directors-akhil-paul-and-anas-khan/article30930137.ece

187,2020/02/27,‘Indian 2’ blame game: Lyca Productions states that shoot was under the supervision of Kamal Haasan and Shankar,"Production house was responding to Kamal Haasan’s open letter that questioned the safety standards on the sets, during the accident that claimed the lives of three crew members

The producers of director Shankar’s Indian 2, Lyca Productions, have responded to Kamal Haasan’s letter in which he questioned the safety standards that were in place on the sets of the film. After the accident that less to the deaths of three members on the set, Kamal had also called for a safety audit.

Now, tweeting out a response to him, the director of Lyca Productions Neelkant Narayanpur states in the letter that Mr Subaskaran and senior management boarded the first available flight to Chennai and reached the mortuary just 15 minutes after the actor himself. “At that very point, Mr Subaskaran announced financial assistance to the tune of ₹2 crores to the family members of the deceased, and those who suffered injuries and also undertook to take care of their treatment. All these measures were taken before the receipt of your letter, and it is unfortunate that this did not come to your attention before the 22nd of February.”

He also says that the shoot was under the direct supervision of Shankar and Kamal, and that incidents of this nature need to be dealt with in the spirit of ‘collective responsibility and rectification’: “Given the involvement of an eminent artiste and technician of your calibre and experience, and a veteran director of Mr Shankar’s stature being the captain of the ship, we were doubly confident that our own safety measures would have been amplified by your on-the-spot judgement. It hardly needs reminding that the entire shoot was also under the control and supervision of yourself and the director.”

Explaining about the insurance policy, the letter from Lyca also adds, “We have invested substantial sums towards the production of the film, so you will appreciate that we have not compromised on health and safety. As regards the safety measures at our end, we left no stone unturned.”

Neelkant Narayanpur concluded, stating, “Given all the above, let us all work together and pray that the almighty gives all strength to the bereaved family members to overcome the unfortunate loss of their beloved ones.”

Director Shankar also shared his first reaction to the accident on Twitter, posting, “It is with utmost grief, I’m tweeting. Since the tragic incident, I've been in a state of shock & having sleepless nights on the loss of my AD & crew. Having missed the crane by a whisker,I feel it would’ve been better if it was on me. Heartfelt condolences & prayers to the families.”

188,2020/02/27,Will Suriya's ‘Soorarai Pottru’ take on Vijay's ‘Master’ this April?,"With the Kollywood box-office at an all-time low, all hopes are pinned on these two summer releases to rake in the moolah

First the bad news. The Tamil box-office is at an all-time low as none of the new releases have been able to bring in the audiences to the theatres. And with the exam season setting in, there is not going to be much improvement in footfalls in March unless the content is extraordinary. The first two months of 2020 have been comparatively quiet, with only Psycho and Oh My Kadavule turning out to be multiplex hits.

The good news is that all this might change come summer, when all hopes are pinned on Vijay’s Master and Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru to bring back the viewers. The buzz in the trade and among the fans is that both the biggies are likely to hit the screens on April 9 (Thursday) for the Easter, Vishu, and Tamil New Year weekend. It’s a perfect five-day holiday weekend and the beginning of summer, probably the best season to release films.

The big clash

Now, the big question is: will there be a confirmed face-off between Master and Soorarai Pottru, which are both eyeing the April 9 holiday weekend?A section of the trade believes that there is nothing wrong in it and feel that it will only make the box-office boom. They point out the success of same day double–header at the box-office: Rajinikanth’s Petta versus Ajith’s Viswasam for Pongal 2019 and Vijay’s Bigil clashing with Karthi’s Kaithi for Deepavali 2019. However, another section, mostly representing single screens, terms it a bad move and feel that the films will eat into each other’s collections.

But, the clash looks inevitable, as the shoot of both the films are over and post–production work is going on. As per sources, both films are racing towards getting their censor done by middle of March before officially confirming their release dates. The CBFC laws and regulations do not allow the producers to announce the release date before the issue of censor certificate: in fact, a Tamil biggie recently ran into trouble with censors after it was found that theatrical length of the film was shorter than the actual run time shown in the certificate!

At the ground level, distributors of both the films are trying to block the screens for an April 9 release. For Suriya, Soorarai Pottru is a crucial film; it will be his first April release, 11 years after blockbuster Ayan (April 3, 2009).

Sudha Kongara, the director of the film, says, “The first copy is getting ready and we should be ready for censor by mid-March. The film has heavy VFX and special effects as the story is set in late 90s and early 2000, when the Indian aviation opened up to private players, so we had to give that period look to runways and airports we shot. We feel it will be a perfect summer release as it will be an inspiring and emotional story of a common man (played by Suriya) in pursuit of his reams.” Rajsekar Pandian of 2D Entertainment, one of the producers of Soorarai Pottru, confirms that it is going to be an April release and adds that it would release in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada simultaneously.

Things are not very different at the Master camp; the producers had announced long ago that that it would be an Easter –Tamil New Year summer release. Vijay, after three successive Deepavali hits — Mersal (2017), Sarkar (2018) and Bigil (2019), is going back to an April release (his last big April release was the super hit Theri in 2016). A source close to the producers of Master says, “Everything is working to clockwork precision for an April release. We have wrapped up the film in 118 days and post–production work is in full swing. We will announce the release date after the censor in March.”

Exciting months ahead

If the end of March sees two biggies in other languages (Akshay Kumar’s Hindi flick Sooryavanshi and Mohanlal’s Malayalm film Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham) April will see more of them. Ranveer Singh’s 83 Movie, based on India’s historic cricket World Cup win in 1983, has a Tamil dubbed version and is slated for an April 10 release. And the biggest of them all is going to be James Bond Hollywood action entertainer No Time To Die hitting screens in India on April 2. Whichever way you look at it, April seems to be a packed month for movie-goers.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fr5a3b/article30930623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trade,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/will-suriyas-soorarai-pottru-take-on-vijays-master-this-april/article30929773.ece
189,2020/02/27,"Fahadh Faasil on his latest film 'Trance', the response to Shammi from 'Kumbalangi Nights', and why the Kerala audience comes first","The Malayalam actor, who also has 'Mailk' and 'Thankam' in the pipeline, says he takes constant and deliberate efforts to surprise the audience

With his riveting performances, Fahadh Faasil has proved to be a real game changer in Malayalam cinema. Be it the soft-spoken photographer from a high-range town in Maheshinte Prathikaram, the chain snatcher in Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum, the Indian diplomat in Take Off, the psychotic Shammi in Kumbalangi Nights or Pastor Joshua Carlton with his ‘healing’ tricks in Trance, Fahadh steps into the characters with remarkable precision.

He will be seen next in Mahesh Narayanan’s Malik, set to release in April. Akhil Sathyan’s directorial début, Saheed Arafath’s Thankam, and possibly Zakariya’s next, for which the talks are going on, are some of his projects in the pipeline.

Fahadh has a sheepish smile on being asked to decode the secret behind his versatility during an interview. Edited excerpts.

Why did you take up the role in Trance?

Trance is about dependency, be it on drugs, religion or emotions. Religion has become a business these days. The film does not point fingers at who’s in the right and who’s in the wrong. What we are trying to say in Trance is that humanity and compassion come above religion. I liked that thread of thought.

How do you step into and out of the shoes of your characters?

I try not to be repetitive in the roles I do. I focus on the narrative. An actor’s job is to understand the narrative and shape the character accordingly. For instance, while shooting for Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum, all I knew was that my character had turned a thief because of hunger.

Fahadh Faasil | Photo Credit: Siril K Joy

My approach and the high that I get as an artiste is the same while I am doing a Njan Prakashan, a Trance or a Malik. Even while performing, I tell myself that I am Fahadh Faasil and not the character. When I am at the monitor to review a shot, I judge the character as a third person. Also, I make it a point to never take my characters back home.

When a shoot for a film takes long to complete, like it did in the case of Trance, how do you maintain the energy level of your character?

We decided to go ahead with Trance after a lot of discussions. It wasn’t possible to finish the shoot in one go. We divided the script into four chapters and decided to deal with them one after the other. I was given the freedom to do other films in between and to take time to get back into shape.

Malik is based on an incident that happened in a coastal town in Kerala...

Malik is the story about a man who stood up for others. That’s why I believe that the story has to be told. While many say that the incident that we talk about in the film was communal, it wasn’t. Although certain parts of the tale have been fictionalised, we have stuck close to the truth.

Are you tense or anxious while handling controversial subjects like those in Trance and Malik?

In India, anything to do with religion is sensitive. As an actor, I hold myself responsible when I am handling a sensitive subject. But the issue here is that they can hold me responsible but they can’t stop me from doing it. To be honest, I do think whether the subject I am doing is going to offend people’s sensibilities. But I kill such thoughts then and there. As an artiste, my job is to entertain people. I am not propagating any ideology or supporting any religious practice through my movies.

You work with your wife, Nazriya, in Trance.

The chemistry that we share in Trance is very different. She is in a never-seen-before role as Esther in the film. I enjoyed the way she handled her part.

Do you shape your characters or do you leave such nuances to the directors?

I usually let the director frame it for me. I keep asking them questions and they have always given me proper responses. I depend on them most of the time. I believe they know the film better than I do. I feel it is like a puzzle and you can’t do it all alone. You have to let others come in and help you fill in the blanks.

How important are the performances of your co-stars while you face the camera?

It is important. Of late, I have noticed that the new actors are so good that they are not conscious about the presence of the camera. I am the kind of actor who asks for retakes. So I don’t know how much I affect the rhythm of my co-actors (smiles).

What was it like to work in Tamil films Velaikkaran and Super Deluxe?

Both were really interesting experiences. For me, it goes without saying that I want to be part of every film made by (Super Deluxe director) Thiagarajan Kumararaja. However, I still maintain that it is difficult for me to work in a language that is not my mother tongue as I don’t think in that language. For that matter, even when working in my mother tongue (Malayalam), I am never satisfied with my work.

Do viewers expect something unconventional whenever you are on screen?

I don’t know. Do they? (laughs).See, I want my audience to be entertained and I really work hard for that. I am not really concerned about how it does at the box office or its reception outside Kerala or anything else. For me, it has to be accepted in Kerala in a way that gives me energy to move on to do my next. I take constant and deliberate efforts to surprise the audience by doing something new.

Were you surprised by the reactions of the viewers to any of your characters?

I was surprised at the way people reacted to Shammi from Kumbalangi Nights. I did not depict him as a good character. We turned him into a caricature. And while I may have been on his side while playing him, I do not think he is a good guy. I was, however, shocked when a certain group of people defended and justified him.

You are often seen teaming up with a certain group of people from the industry...

They know my limitations and what to extract from me as an actor. Having said that, if someone comes up to me with an exciting project, I am all for it. I will never let go of good films.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/y86iqp/article30922055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvfFahadhFaasilinTrance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fahadh-faasil-on-his-latest-film-trance-the-response-to-shammi-from-kumbalangi-nights-and-why-the-kerala-audience-comes-first/article30922056.ece

191,2020/02/27,"Steven Spielberg quits ‘Indiana Jones 5’, ‘Ford vs Ferrari’ director James Mangold to take over","Spielberg, who kickstarted the franchise with ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’, will remain as a hands-on producer on the fifth installment

Veteran filmmaker Steven Spielberg has vacated the director’s chair of Indiana Jones 5 for the first time in the franchise’s history.

According to Variety, Disney is now in early negotiations with director James Mangold, best known for delivering hits like Ford vs Ferrari and Hugh Jackman’s last superhero movie Logan, to helm the long-awaited film.

Spielberg, who kickstarted the franchise with Harrison Ford-starrer Raiders of the Lost Ark, will remain as a hands-on producer on the fifth installment.

It is being rumoured that the veteran filmmaker’s decision to not direct the fifth movie stems from his desire to hand over the franchise’s reigns to the younger generation.

He had taken a similar step with Jurassic World, a reboot of his three Jurassic Park films, that was directed by Colin Trevorrow in 2015.

Mangold is a favourite of Disney after the success of Matt Damon and Christian Bale-starrer Ford vs Ferrari. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning two for best editing and best sound editing.

With the studio, the director is already working on a Bob Dylan project, starring Timothee Chalamet, and a feature adaptation of the Don Winslow bestseller The Force with Matt Damon.

Indiana Jones 5, which will see Ford returning as the bullwhip-wielding adventurer, was originally announced three years ago and has gone through various delays since then.

Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, released in 2008, was the last film from the beloved franchise.

Ford and Spielberg first worked together on 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, which the duo followed up with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984) and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989).",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8dfzb0/article30929676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/indiana-jones,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/steven-spielberg-quits-indiana-jones-5-ford-vs-ferrari-director-james-mangold-to-take-over/article30929677.ece

193,2020/02/27,Will Goverdhan Reddy be next DCCB chief?,"Senior farmer leader’s chances brighten with the intervention of KTR

The chances of senior farmer leader of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) Goverdhan Reddy being given the reins of the Adilabad District Cooperative Central Bank (DCCB) have brightened after the intervention of party working president and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao in making him a director of the management committee of the bank. The intervention of the working president came as a blow to the plan of Adilabad MLA Jogu Ramanna and Boath MLA Rathod Bapu Rao who were hell bent on eliminating Mr Goverdhan Reddy from the race at an early stage.

The veteran farmer leader, who also headed the district farmer cell of the TRS, had always been sidelined when it came to being given either nominated post or being fielded in some election. The general opinion is that his experience in farmers’ issues made him absolutely eligible for the post which, incidentally, seems to be the opinion of the party high command too.

Mr. Goverdhan Reddy had joined TRS from Telugu Desam Party in August 2010, about 18 months before Mr. Ramanna crossed fences. He was denied opportunities to serve people several times, the latest being not favoured to contest even the Municial Council election earlier this year.

He was, however, elected unanimously chairman of the Jainad Primary Agriculture Cooperative Society which made him eligible to get elected as one of the 20 directors of the DCCB managing committee and further for the post of chairman itself. On February 25, the MLAs objected to Mr. Goverdhan Reddy filing nomination for director post.

Forest Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy, who was camping in Adilabad, overseeing the filing of nominations, reportedly received a call from KTR. He was said to have instructed all the MLAs present to accommodate Mr. Goverdhan Reddy as a director.

The election to the chairman post on February 29 will most certainly be unanimous with the party high command sending a sealed envelope with the name of the director of its choice. While Mr. Ramanna and Mr. Bapu Rao are reportedly camping in Hyderabad to ensure that the candidate of their choice gets nominated by the party high command, the Forest Minister and other MLAs in favour of Mr. Goverdhan Reddy appear confident of his victory.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/will-goverdhan-reddy-be-next-dccb-chief/article30932540.ece
194,2020/02/27,Illegal parking of auto-rickshaws inconveniences road-users,"Even as the authorities are celebrating the Pattana Pragathi programme with hype, issues concerning people of the town are being neglected.

The century-old Karimnagar town, which has been included in the Smart City programme for taking up various development works, is a free-for-all — to encroach on the roads for selling vegetables and fruits or for parking auto-rickshaws illegally and causing inconvenience to road users.

Even as the authorities are celebrating the Pattana Pragathi programme with hype, issues concerning people of the town are being neglected. Taking advantage of lethargy on the part of officials, auto drivers are erecting signboards, illegally converting roadsides into auto-stands.

In the Karimnagar RTC bus station area where already the authorities allocated auto stand, auto drivers have encroached upon all four sides of the main road. The illegal parking of autos on the roads was denying pedestrians the basic right to walk safely on footpaths.

Auto are being parked illegally at RTC bus station main entrance and near the in-gate and in the area adjoining Andhra bank complex and opposite the ZP office with signboards erected, causing inconvenience to road users.

Peruka Nagamohan, a retired headmaster of Jyothinagar locality, criticised the traffic police and municipal authorities for remaining mute spectators ti illegal parking of autos.

Expressing similar views, Lok Satta Udyama Samstha district president N Srinivas demanded that the traffic police remove illegal auto-stands in the town and regulate traffic. Strict enforcement of helmet rule alone would not prevent accidents, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/66a4yl/article30928631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27HYKRMAUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/illegal-parking-of-auto-rickshaws-inconveniences-road-users/article30928632.ece
195,2020/02/27,"KTR instructs officials to make Bhongir town clean, beautiful","Interacts with newly-elected councillors

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao on Wednesday instructed officials and elected representatives of Bhongir municipality to work towards making the town clean, by improving solid waste management and sanitation in all its 35 wards.

Construction of 100 public toilets within two months, replacement of old electric poles, compulsory ward-wise greenery plans, and awareness of local bodies’ annual budget and Panchayat Raj Act 2018, were some of the issues discussed by Mr. Rao under the Pattana Pragathi programme in a closed-door review meeting at the Bhongir municipal office.

Mr. Rao, who was returning from Jangaon, interacted with newly-elected councillors and special officers here, and took stock of challenges in various wards. Under Pattana Pragathi, he assured that he would take a ward-wise padayatra in his next visit here after two months, which would also be the ‘testing time for officials and leaders to improve the conditions and show a beautified Bhongir’.

Speaking to the gathering, according to officials, the MA&UD Minister emphasised the importance of understanding the local body’s annual budget.

According to Mr. Rao, urban local bodies in the State would get ₹148 crore and Gram Panchayats would get ₹339 crore, annually.

And Bhongir municipality, in the first release, would get ₹53.74 lakh, he told officials and representatives, encouraging them to understand its components and plan better.

The Municipal Minister also instructed District Collector Anita Ramachandran to be present in budget sessions of all the six municipalities in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri with legislators of respective Assembly constituencies.

Special officers were also instructed to ensure biometric attendance of sanitation staff, 28 workers per 10,000 population, as per Swacch Bharat guidelines.

198,2020/02/27,Tiger corridors back in focus,"The number of big cats has been swelling since the last few years

The tiger corridors between Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) in Maharashtra and Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR) in former undivided Adilabad district in Telangana are once again in focus what with tigers from the former and even from forests outside the sanctuary entering this side of the border apparently trying to find their way to the latter. The safety of the big cats crossing over has become a matter of prime concern for the Forest Department in this State.

About 15 days back, and on two occasions in July last year, a tiger crossed Penganga river, which forms the border between Pandharkawda taluq of Yavatmal district and Adilabad, to enter Tamsi forest. A different tiger, which could have come from TWS itself or from the forests outside it, entered Jainad mandal on the intervening night of Tuesday-Wednesday making it imperative for the department to move in in a big way to ensure the big cat is not harmed as it is likely to kill cattle in the absence of its prey.

The number of tigers in former composite Adilabad district, especially in Kagaznagar Forest Division in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, the KTR and in the Reserve Forests of Adilabad has kept swelling since the last few years. There are as many as 16 tigers on prowl in these areas and there is a chance that some of the big cats will become residents in respective areas of movement, according to officials.

“We are seized of the matter,” observed Adilabad District Forest Officer B. Prabhakar as he delved into the issue of tiger ‘influx’. “We will soon draw an action plan with regard to safety of the incoming tigers in the corridors,” he hoped.

“The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had decided to fund conservation activities in tiger landscapes which includes corridors in question. Also, we have requested the Authority to declare Kagaznagar Forest Division as extended core area of KTR,” revealed KTR Field Director C.P. Vinod Kumar of the steps already taken toward tiger protection.

""At the NTCA meeting on tiger landscapes in April last year, which included participation of top officials from Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve in Chandrapur district of the neighbouring State and TWS, it was decided to go in for better coordination between the entities on either side of the border. As a result of it we will have team of our animal trackers and Forest Beat and Section Officers visiting TWS in the coming month,” Mr. Vinod Kumar, who is also the Conservation of Forests, Adilabad Circle, added. The route that the tiger was seen on Wednesday has taken is the corridor which links TWS with KTR and passes through Bela, Lokari, Indervelli and Vankatumma. The other one which had visits by tigers earlier passes through Talamadugu, Kinwat, Ajjar-Vajjar and Boath.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/80davu/article30926034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27TIGER3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tiger-corridors-back-in-focus/article30926035.ece

200,2020/02/27,Collectorate building in Adilabad to get a facelift,"Work begins on heritage structure damaged by rapid weathering and unsuitable repairs

The nearly eight-decade-old Collectorate building, which is among the handful of surviving links that this part of Telangana has with its past, is getting a new lease of life, thanks to renovation work taken up by the government.

The heritage structure was in dire need of protection from rapid weathering and damages being caused by the ‘unsuitable’ constant repairs.

The building, which has an extended middle to function as portico and a large courtyard in the middle, was constructed in 1941 during the last decade of Nizam’s rule to function as the administrative nerve centre of Adilabad district, following shifting of the headquarters from Asifabad to this town. The structure has expansive rooms and was constructed in lime-mortar which made the task of conservation a shade challenging for the engineers.

The sanction for renovation of the building was given in 2018 with an outlay of ₹3.07 crore but work started only in the last quarter of 2019 since many things had to be planned, especially on the technical side. “We not only needed to take into account the ‘heritage’ quotient when restoring damaged parts but also to keep the cost within permissible limits,” said R&B deputy executive engineer R. Suresh, who is handling the work.

As far as conservation part of the work is concerned, all the old plaster on the walls is being replaced by two coats of new cement one with a 20% mix of lime. The toughest part was removal of the existing six-inch terrace and replacing it properly to arrest the leakages while reducing overly burdening the surface.

“Water harvesting is also given equal priority. A stormwater drain to collect rainwater and discharge it in the existing rainwater harvesting pits is also part of the plan,” assistant executive engineer K. Shwetha added. There is some renovation work, too, that has been planned — like replacing the flooring and painting the building. There, however, is no plan to earmark a place for parking of vehicles and shifting of government billboards and the weather display from the front part of the buildings, the works on which are likely to be completed by June.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hx7n6b/article30925998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-COLLECTORATE-ADILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/collectorate-building-in-adilabad-to-get-a-facelift/article30925988.ece
201,2020/02/27,Video of police kicking suicide victim’s dad goes viral,"Inter student’s family was demanding action against college management for ‘negligence’

Tension prevailed for sometime at the area hospital in Patancheru on Wednesday when the parents of an Intermediate first year student at Narayana College, who committed suicide by hanging on Tuesday, held a protest and police forcibly took away the body of the deceased in the freezer box.

While doing so, the police kicked Chandrasekhar, father of the girl, and it went viral on social media.

The Inter student had committed suicide in the hostel bathroom and Chandrasekhar had lodged a complaint with BDL Banur police station alleging negligence of college management. Though she was suffering from fever for the past one week the college authorities failed to send her home or get her treated, he alleged.

Parents and relatives held a dharna in front of the police station on Wednesday morning when the body was brought for post-mortem to the area hospital, demanding justice and action against the college management. Not only that, they obstructed the police from taking the body for post-mortem.

Some of the students too joined them in the protest

At this point police used force, pulled Chandrasekhar aside and in one of the videos that went viral a policeman is seen kicking him with his boot.

SP tweets

Responding to the video, Superintendent of Police said in his twitter handle @spsangareddy: “Police were trying to prevent agitators taking law into their hands at the mortuary, yet suitable action will be taken for any wilful misbehaviour exhibited by the officers on duty as alleged in the video.”

Post-mortem completed

Meanwhile, post-mortem examination was done on the student’s body at the government hospital in Patancheru amid heavy police security. Police had a tough time dealing with relatives and students, who demanded justice to the family.

Though post-mortem was completed by evening, her parents reportedly refused to accept the body, demanding compensation from the college management.

₹15 lakh compensation

However, late in the night the college management reportedly agreed to pay a compensation of ₹ 15 lakh and with this, the relatives took the body to their native place in Mahabubnagar district for last rites.

Punitive action

In a turn of events, Superintendent of Police (in-charge) Chandana Deepti has directed attachment of constable Sridhar, who allegedly kicked the Inter student’s father, to the Armed Reserve Headquarters on Wednesday, according to a release here on Wednesday.

Ms. Chandana Deepti said: “We regret the incident. Constable was attached to AR Headquarters and disciplinary action will be initiated after enquiry.”

202,2020/02/27,Another tiger on the prowl in Adilabad,"It attacked bullock but could not kill it

One more tiger has crossed over into Adilabad district from neighbouring Maharashtra on February 25, making it the second big cat to do so within a fortnight.

While the first one which had crossed Penganga river near Tamsi (K) in Bheempur mandal was identified a female from Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS) in Pandharkawda Tahsil in Yavatmal district of Maharashtra, the second one is yet to be identified but it could have come either from TWS or from the forest outside the sanctuary.

The tiger was seen by motorists on Bhoraj-Bela road near Awalpur in Jainad mandal at about 11 p.m. By 6 a.m., it reached Mangurla, about 10 km away from where it crossed the road. The tiger on prowl was seen by villagers at this point. It also attacked a bullock but could not kill it.

The Forest Deparment swung into action immediately and deputed a large number of its officers and staff led by Adilabad Forest Divisional Officer V. Chandra Shekhara Rao early on Wednesday to monitor the movement of the big cat. The officials interacted with villagers where the tigers was sighted and assured them that the big cat will cause no harm.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gabczq/article30925959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27TIGER1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/another-tiger-on-the-prowl-in-adilabad/article30925960.ece
203,2020/02/27,‘Tao is our canvas’,"As the Worli gallery completes 20 years, mother-daughter duo Kalpana and Sanjana Shah look at the past and future

Tao Art Gallery opened in 2000 but its seed had been sown almost a decade earlier. The 1992-93 Mumbai riots had spurred many artists to pour their angst on canvas. Among them was MF Husain, who was painting at Marine Drive. Collector and self-taught artist Kalpana Shah accompanied by her friend and art patron Sangita Jindal to witness it. “I was moved by what I saw. Seeing my passion for art, Sangita Jindal suggested that I open a gallery. I had never given it a thought. Her encouragement helped and here I am,” recollects Kalpana, 61, the director of the spacious 3,500 sq-ft space in Worli.

Mounted on one of the walls is Paresh Maity’s ‘The Spin Of Time’. The sprawling, almost nine feet wide, mixed media work portrays Mahatma Gandhi on the charkha. It is part of the gallery’s 20th anniversary exhibition titled ‘A Tapestry of Time’. Opening this weekend, the group show features 66 artists who have been part of Tao’s journey. These include Ali Akbar Mehta, Anju and Atul Dodiya, Arzan Khambatta, Brinda Miller, Ingrid Pitzer, Jayasri Burman, Jitish Kallat, Madhvi and Manu Parekh, Rini Dhumal and Seema Kohli. The exhibition also extends to the adjacent building’s Atrium Gallery where Tao was housed for five years before it found permanent residence in the current space that was built by Kalpana’s late husband real-estate developer Pankaj Shah.

Past perfect

Standing away from Kala Ghoda’s art district, Tao has managed to carve an independent identity for itself. “When we opened, my first instruction to the staff was to never compare ourselves with other galleries. I didn’t entertain gossip either. This space was our canvas and we were focused on painting it our way,” says Kalpana matter-of-factly.

The Worli sea-facing gallery’s iconic, giant window display is also unmissable. “That’s our organic publicity!” laughs Sanjana, 24, who helped her mother co-curate shows before joining the gallery as Creative Director in 2018. “The location has worked in our favour. With the Lower Parel mills getting rejuvenated, much of the focus has shifted to this area. Our works also get breathing space,” she adds.

Over the years, Tao’s curatorial calendar has seen many interesting exhibitions. Their first anniversary show brought together eight Modern art masters – Akbar Padamsee, Bal Chhabda, Krishen Khanna, MF Husain, Ram Kumar, SH Raza, Tyeb Mehta and VS Gaitonde. “From Bal Chhabda, I had heard stories about the tough lives that the artists had led in their early days. They would even share a single cup of tea among themselves,” says Kalpana.

As tribute to the legends, she juxtaposed their works from the 1940s with the present masterpieces. “Husainji gave the show’s title of ‘Ashta Nayak’. Then, he took the charcoal and designed the catalogue in front of my eyes in five minutes! He even recommended the name of the printer I could visit to bind the catalogue. Back then, the artists were extremely involved in the entire process,” she smiles, adding, “They would make huge works and they were large-hearted when it came to lending the paintings to the galleries for shows.”

Tao’s journey has also been dotted with group shows such as ‘Nava Nayika’ comprising works of nine women artists including Anjolie Ela Menon, Nalini Malani and Rekha Rodwittiya, and solos of Raza, Husain, Dashrath Patel and Sohan Qadri. The space has also showcased photography, sculpture, video, performance, installation art and calligraphy. The opening night of the anniversary show will witness a dance movement performance. “Whether dance or design, they are extensions of art and our aim is to make people see that,” says Sanjana. “Ours is a diverse arts space,” asserts Kalpana, adding that the gallery’s evolution reflects in her tastes as a collector too. “Earlier, I liked only abstracts but later, I started understanding and appreciating expressive and figurative works too.”

Boomerang brigade

The economic slowdown has impacted the art world, shares the duo. “The supply is more than demand as more people are selling off their collection,” observes Kalpana. Social media is influencing galleries to relook at their curation, says Sanjana. “Instagram is impacting exhibition concepts.” For instance, last year, their show titled ‘Boomerang’ featured pop hues and was themed on the mini videos that loop back and forth.

To attract millennials, Tao has also started hosting workshops on different forms of art. Sanjana reasons, “Many people are wary of galleries because they feel they need to intellectualise art and see it in a certain way. The workshops aim to create awareness and show that art is nothing but a creative expression. Ultimately, it’s about making you feel an emotion.”

A Tapestry of Time opens tonight and will runs until March 31, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Tao Art Gallery, Worli.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/bmsu3x/article30933845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kalpana-and-Sanjana-Shah,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/tao-is-our-canvas/article30933846.ece
204,2020/02/27,Visit artist Alamelu Annhamalai’s exhibition and show support for Blue Cross of India,"From a painting of peeping meerkats to art on pages torn out of a book — Chennai-based artist Alamelu Annhamalai will display her work to raise funds for Blue Cross of India

His name is Sunface, and he brightens everyone’s days. The unofficial ‘mascot’ of Blue Cross of India is holding a red Christmas bow in his mouth, his beady brown eyes and black fur against a background of Juno-esque orange stripes. The portrait is part of city-based artist Alamelu Annhamalai’s upcoming exhibition Canvas for a Cause.

Until one year ago, the famously ambidextrous 26-year-old was afraid of animals, dogs in particular. And then she joined the Blue Cross of India as a volunteer; it was one of her 2019 goals to get over this fear. “I got a sense of community there, getting to know people (including school kids) who would volunteer and work there. I felt that if I can’t help as much as them, how else can I contribute?” says Alamelu.

Art, she felt, was a good way to bring attention to the cause, and so over the last month, they put together the Canvas for Cause exhibition. A collection of her works, made over the past couple of years will be for sale here, and half the sales will be donated to Blue Cross of India.

While Alamelu’s art is not bound to a specific theme (she uses multiple media such as acrylic, watercolor, pen and ink, and charcoal), her work is generally concept-driven. “Each piece has a story of its own,” she says.

For this exhibition, she will be displaying paintings from her solo exhibition at Lalit Kala Akademi, ‘A Soldier of Hope’. She had also worked with the solo exhibition’s curator Anisha Palat, to create a series of paintings based on the animals Anisha had photographed. The title of each painting — from Guidance (an elephant mother and child) to Amicable (peeping meerkats) — reflects the qualities Alamelu associates with these photographs.

“I also have a series in which I have taken all the pages out of a book, (The Art of Remaking Men by Paul Campbell) and illustrated on, and framed each one of them,” she says. “I wanted to point out how we as a generation have stopped reading books all that much.”

The old printed pages of the book are embellished with pen, ink and charcoal drawings, each inspired by the content, and certain words, on that particular page, which stood out for Alamelu. The series has 55 pieces, one on each page of the book, and 15 of them are still up for sale.

For the three days of the exhibition, Alamelu will be doing ambidextrous live sketches at 5 pm. Incidentally, the painting that made her viral (an Instagram video of her painting with both hands has garnered over eight million views), will also be displayed there.

The paintings on sale range anywhere from ₹500 to ₹80,000. “I am all for affordable art. People have this impression that art is only for the elite, but you can find one in any budget, if you know where to look,” she says.

Canvas for a Cause will be inaugurated at Shakunthala Art Gallery, CP Art Centre, Alwarpet, on February 28, 6 pm. The exhibition and sale will be held from February 29 to March 2, 10 am to 7 pm.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/lasckn/article30932241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPAlamelu4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/artist-alamelu-annhamalai-holds-charity-exhibition-for-blue-cross-of-india/article30932242.ece
205,2020/02/27,Dance of the gladiators,"This martial art form, apart from teaching self-defence, imparts values for life

“Capoeira, at first glance, had a resemblance to yoga. But then there was song, music, dance, kicks and so much more! That very moment I fell in love with this less-familiar martial art form and got trained in the next eight years,” recalls Reza Baba Massah, Founder, Centre for Capoeira, Mumbai. This, for Reza Baba, happened in Isreal where he used to run a restaurant. But after he learnt the art form, he embraced it full time and moved to India.

Having four centres in India — at Mumbai, Delhi, Jaipur and Gurgaon -- Centre for Capoeira conducts professional classes for learners of all ages. It conducts regular sessions for children in schools. “Capoeira” Reza Baba feels, “is essential for everyone, especially for women and children as it makes them fearless and confident.”

Capoeira looks more like a street dance with the music of barimbau, a single-string instrument and drums in the background. But it is actually an African martial art form from Brazil with unique features, history and philosophy. “While most martial art forms in the world originated for war purposes, Capoeira on the other hand was developed for liberation of slaves from racial oppression. Therefore it has upside down movement intended to trick the oppressor and thereby seek defence,” explains Reza Baba. For him, it alternates between a dance and a martial art form.

The best description of Capoeira Reza Baba has heard so far is from another martial artist from California. “He was in Mumbai to assist Amir Khan during the shoot of Dhoom 3. That was when he described Capoeira as ‘the flight of the ballerinas and dance of the gladiators’,” he recalls. For him, it’s more a play than a sport. “There is singing, clapping, shouting, hissing, jumping, cart wheeling and a lot more, apart from kicks,” he describes.

Capoeira is ritualistic. Before it begins, the other players form a circle called ‘roda’. “In this space they clap and sing rhythmically cheering the two performers who are at the centre of the roda. The live music will be led by a master,” he informs.

How beneficial is this multi-dimensional martial art form? “It not only imparts strength of a martial artist but also coordination of a dancer, flexibility of a gymnast, endurance of a marathon runner and rhythmic sense of a musician,” explains Reza Baba gleefully. As most of the songs of Capoeira are in Portuguese, children get the chance to learn a foreign language. Like any another art form, the variety of activities involved in Capoeira boosts students’ mental development. Most importantly, with crime rate rising in all parts of the country, children get trained to face adverse situations.

Philosophy of Capoeira is to propagate peace and respect. “The Afro-Brazilian tribe believed: ‘if you hurt someone or for that matter you get hurt, it’s all your fault’. So Capoeira teaches sharing of responsibility, working as a team and respecting the other. For example, Reza Baba explains: “If a teenager is to play Capoeira with a child, the rule of the game is to make the younger one win. It’s about making sure the weaker is safe and comfortable. So there’s plenty of lessons for life!”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/7jzwqj/article30931670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bgfcapjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/dance-of-the-gladiators/article30931672.ece

From his childhood days, whenever he was told that “he could not”, visual artist Baadal Nanjundaswamy, who has been testifying power of public art, proved that “he could”.

Baadal Nanjundaswamy popularly referred as Baadal in art circle, created a space for himself in the art world by expressing his views on issues plaguing the society through his works, especially 3D art. As a young artist he strongly believes that he could enjoy his art, while responding to the societal concerns.

His “Moonwalk” video which presents a graphic picture on the plight of people in Herohalli area of Bengaluru created much buzz both in civic and art circle. The video which went viral drew attention of the art curators across the globe. An art curator from Mumbai got impressed by the way the video was shot with Chandrayan concept, referred the video to Liz Hingley, Curator at SOAS University, London. Liz asked Baadal, whether he is willing to part the video to showcase in “A Passage Through Passages”, which opened at Brunei Gallery, SOAS on January 16. The exhibition is a part of Roads and the Politics of Thought, a European Research Council funded, five-year ethnographic study of road-building in South Asia.

Cine actor Poornachandra dressed in a spacesuit walking around crater like potholes of Herohalli is inspired by Chandrayan-2. This video puts focus on Baadal’s creativity for a cause. “To be frank, I haven’t expected the kind of response. I am indebted to cine actor Poornachandra, for co-operating in the project. Images of creators on moon surface captured by Chandrayan mission, triggered my imagination while watching potholes in Herohalli area. I zeroed in on the idea and translated that in to striking visuals. Initially, we approached a local tailor to stitch a costume that resembles space suit. But, the result was not satisfactory. Finally, a fancy store shop on Brigade Road met our requirement. We might have spent meagre Rs.5000 for the project”, Baadal explained the effort invested in making Moonwalk video.

In a way, Baadal created a new trend in street activism in Silicon city-Bengaluru. In recent years, he took on issues that people are confronting in their day to day life. Instead of taking recourse to canvas, Baadal transformed public roads as his canvas. He transformed broken roads and glaring potholes, which are claiming lives of innocents as art works to draw attention of civic authorities, for whom these “eyesores” do not make any difference. With the help of sculptures, Baadal translated into installations. He made a searing statement on the apathy of civic authorities about the killing potholes through his installation of a life-sized crocodile on a “mouth opening” pothole at Sulthanpalya Main Road. “I planted a life-sized fibre crocodile weighing 20 kg in the 12-ft long pothole and painted that with green. It cost me about Rs.6000,” Baadal explains. But, civic authorities are not insensitive as popularly believed. As the pictures of installation made headlines in the media, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) fixed that in no time. Then onwards, Baadal is popularly known as crocodile artist. “But, nothing significant has changed so far, except some cosmetic changes made by civic authorities in the guise of repairs,” regrets Baadal.

Likewise, the dismal turnout in Bengaluru Urban district in polls disturbed him. While studying in Chamarajendra Academy of Visual Arts (CAVA) he contested in Corporation election in Mysuru. He wanted to be part of the system to bring about the change in the society. But he could not compete with the professional politicians, who mastered the art of mesmerising the electorates by projecting colour pictures. Baadal’s realistic images failed to enthuse voters. To pull the electorates from their deep slumber in 2018, Baadal created three huge public arts at prominent places of Okalipuram, Mekhri Circle and Sheshadripuram. His project of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, monkeys mutated to human to underline the need of civilised citizens to exercise their franchise at Okalipuram, people lining up holding relevant documents to claim their right to vote near Mekhri Circle, and visuals proclaiming “You are your own creator” inspired by the creation of Adam-a fresco work of Italian artist Michelangelo believed to be succeeded in forcing reluctant voters to exercise their franchise.

To showcase the problem of stagnated water in the huge craters on the roads, Baadal converted the crater near Cubbon Park into a lake with a mermaid. Popular Kannada actor Sonu Gowda helped Baadal by dressing up as a mermaid. “Following deaths because of potholes, I highlighted the issue through mermaid installation to force the government to address the issue,” says Baadal. His attempt really shocked both the people and civic lords, who were just crossing that without cribbing. These are some of the installation that yielded results for Baadal’s public art initiatives. “Without anticipating anything from anyone, I have created many installations of the kind to highlight problems of metropolis. I am happy that as soon as my work goes viral on social media, authorities promptly responds to them. As an artist, I don’t expect more than this,” he humbly said, scratching his beard.

There is a recurring pattern in the life of 40-year old Baadal, He is actually Nanjundaswamy Nanjaniah. “Baadal” is a prefix he got later.

When asked about the trend he set in street art activism. Baadal said: “at some point of time, I realised that art is only thing to which I can relate. I understood that art is my language and medium, with which I can express myself. I am experimenting with street art since my college days. Van Gogh and Salvador Dali are the two artists, who influenced me a lot. In fact, I am a fan of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. To a certain extent, he influenced my creative thinking of blending illusions with reality”.

On hitting headlines overnight with Moonwalk, he said: “I am feeling awkward. It was not for publicity or attention. I am just repaying my debts to the society,” there was no pretension in Baadal’s voice.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/konjmm/article30931666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGFBADALNANJUNDASWAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-city-is-his-canvas/article30931669.ece
207,2020/02/27,Rising to the occasion,"Natya Tarangini’s Maha Shivratri festival saw offerings of dance and music to the Creator of the performing arts

The amphitheatre of RajaRadha Rangmanch as always was agog with music and dance aficionados on the festive night of Maha Shivratri. The cool sky above was arrested from showering its winter haze by the lamp post heaters placed at vantage points, emanating warmth on the gallery where the audience were seated. For the past couple of years, Natya Tarangini has been hosting Shivratri with offering of dance and music to the Creator of the performing arts. The line up of artistes have always been the best in the field and this year was no less. This year had the likes of Manipuri expert Poushali Chatterjee, Kuchipudi danseuse Sindhu Ravuri and the students of Natya Tarangini performing exclusively on lord Shiva in keeping with the auspicious, austere night.

Sindhu Ravuri

Says guru Raja Reddy, “We’ve been observing Shivratri on a personal level through the years but this dedication to dance and music has begun four years ago. This auspicious night is significant as driving away the darkness called ignorance to help realise the pulsating cosmic energy that is responsible for this live universe. Our entire family is into dance and nothing but dance. So it is natural that we offer our art to the creator.”

The Shiva-Panchakshari, a home production by the group, paved way for US-based Sindhu Ravuri. A disciple of Raja and Radha Reddy explored the nuances of Kuchipudi with her “Aadenamma Harudu”. A eulogy to Lord Shiva (Hara), it was marked by rigorous footwork to stunning jatis, a hallmark of Guru Raja Reddy’s style and fine hastha abhinaya (gesticulations with mudra). The dancer displayed immense verve and vigour to undertake this solo lengthy piece with spiritual fervour. Her statuesque postures in pause were striking as were her agile moves.

Beat of drums

The Manipuri group, led by Poushali Chatterjee, showcased a colourful and novel worship of Shiva through ‘damaru’(drums), the rhythmic aspect of the lord of dance. With a spear placed on the pedestal and flowers forming the backdrop, the dancers, both male and female, went in circular fashion to the beat of their drums to the chants of Mahadev with salutation to the syllable ‘Ma’ which is one of the Panchakshari.

The theme was lengthy as it covered varied facets of Shiva – from the emergence to cleansing and restoration of balance when the universe goes topsy-turvy. The concept of time which originates from Mahakaal was suggestively represented through the percussion dance which had the audience in raptures. A couple of verses from Ravan’s “Shiv Tandav Stotra” to which they mimed and danced was the best in the whole show. The damaru also moves to envisage Devi, the Shakti aspect of Shiva. In a nutshell, the Manipuri dance ensemble encapsulated in entirety the Shiva tatwa making for a wholesome presentation.

A young talented painter Jason was a treat to behold with his drawing of Shiva on the insides of the wall enclosing the amphitheatre even as he watched the dances on stage. Raja and Radha Reddy also felicitated three veterans gurus Singhajit Singh and Charu, poet and man of letters Dr Ashok Chakradhar and dance critic Ravindra Mishra.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/qfmu08/article30931183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG9396,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/rising-to-the-occasion/article30931185.ece
208,2020/02/27,Health workers roughed up in Indore as TB survey mistaken for NPR exercise,"Key National Health Mission survey stalled in slum as workers fear returning to field

A survey of the National Health Mission (NHM) to identify tuberculosis patients has been hit in Indore after four ASHA workers carrying questionnaires were roughed up and driven away from a slum, where locals suspected they were attempting to update the controversial National Population Register (NPR).

The Accredited Social Health Activists (AHSAs) had just begun their survey in the city’s Khajrana area, where six to seven patients stayed, when dozens of locals reportedly came out with sticks and brooms, threatened to lynch them, and drove them away. One of the workers fainted on the spot, and had to be carried back home in a rickshaw. The NHM’s TB survey has been stopped in the area for now.

“We had already identified eight patients and given them medicines, and reached a house where they refused to talk to us,” said Irshad Khan, one of the ASHA workers who were undertaking the NHM survey. “But then a woman came from inside with a broom. She started shouting that we were seeking phone numbers for the NPR, after which others gathered around us,” added Ms. Khan. “They manhandled us and tried snatching the paper where we had noted down details of patients. Eventually, we had to tear it up and run away to save our lives.”

Ms. Khan, who lives in a neighbouring locality, said that in her own slum, residents had asked workers not to carry out any surveys given the vicious atmosphere in the country.

“It was terrifying for us. They even hurled slippers at us. Never have we faced such resistance before. It could have cost us our lives,” she said. “At my basti, however, every child knows me. But here we were strangers, which still shouldn’t have been an issue as we were there to identify patients,” noted Ms. Khan, adding, “I fear going back to the field”.

Farzana, another health activist, claimed they were even asked to lift their veils, to prove they were not men. “We were just doing our work. We were not there to get beaten up. I don’t know how we’ll do our work anymore,” she said, adding that they even showed the authorisation letter to locals, who remained obstinate and suspicious.

The ASHA workers, who serve as an interface between communities and the public health system, number about 64,000 in Madhya Pradesh and are tasked with promoting good health practices, counselling pregnant women, facilitating locals in accessing health facilities and containing malnutrition.

According to a December 9 State government notification, the NPR updation exercise would be undertaken in the State from May, while the tuberculosis survey is being conducted from February 17 to March 3. Despite Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s assurance that the Congress government wouldn’t allow the NPR to be updated, local census officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, asserted that they were yet to receive any communication from the State government to stop the exercise.

“This was the first survey where we faced resistance,” said Pravin Jadia, Indore’s Chief Medical and Health Officer. “Just last month, we smoothly conducted a survey for immunisation.”

Admitting it was an unprecedented challenge, Dr. Jadia said, “ In the future, we’ll approach community and local leaders first to explain to them about a survey. Still, if the majority in an area don’t support us, then we may have to stop the programme.”

Shailesh Sakalle, Deputy Director, NHM State unit, said, “Conducting surveys is one of the primary functions of ASHA workers. If they are not allowed to undertake household surveys, access to public healthcare may be affected”.

Observing that the Centre aims to eradicate tuberculosis from the country by 2025, Dr. Sakalle wondered how that goal could be met if the current challenges were not resolved. “If we are not allowed to identify patients, how will we achieve this? We have apprised superiors of the incident, and they may issue an advisory to ensure smooth conduct of surveys,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/health-workers-roughed-up-in-indore-as-tb-survey-mistaken-for-npr-exercise/article30935693.ece
209,2020/02/27,Meghalaya coalition partners differ on illegal coal trade,"United Democratic Party has defended the State Lokayukta’s move asking the CBI to probe the illegal coal trade

Illegal transportation and mining of coal appears to have driven a wedge between the coalition partners in the Meghalaya government.

The regional United Democratic Party (UDP) has defended the State Lokayukta’s move asking the Central Bureau of Investigation to probe the illegal coal trade. The party backed the move on Wednesday when the Meghalaya High Court took up the State government’s petition against the Lokayukta.

Also Read Meghalaya to conduct special programme for granting coal mining licence

The UDP is the second-largest party in the National People’s Party-led Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA) government, in which the BJP is a minor partner.

“Our party did not have any discussion [with the coalition partners] on the matter that the Lokayta deemed fit to take up,” said senior UDP leader Bindo M. Lanong.

The MDA government headed by Conrad K. Sangma had earlier petitioned against the Lokayukta order for a CBI probe — a move that was criticised by the Opposition Congress.

“The petition is a ploy to delay the process of investigation and protect a big cartel operating to facilitate illegal mining and transportation of coal,” said former Chief Minister Mukul Sangma.

The National Green Tribunal had in April 2014 banned the unsafe rat-hole coal mining in Meghalaya. Although it allowed the transportation of already extracted coal from time to time.

However, in 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the State government to stop the transportation of coal.

But activists in the State alleged that despite the ban, coal was being transported with impunity. Last week, the police caught several trucks transporting coal out of the State.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2ljdyk/article30537331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MeghalayaCoalMines,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/meghalaya-coalition-partners-differ-on-illegal-coal-trade/article30935608.ece
210,2020/02/27,JD(U) rejects speculation of ‘closeness’ with RJD,"JD(U) State unit president Vashishtha Narayan Singh said that JD(U) is with the NDA and will remain so.

The ruling JD(U) in Bihar on Thursday rejected speculation stemming from the alleged ‘nazdeekiyan’ (closeness) witnessed in the Assembly premises in Patna over the last couple of days between Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Opposition RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and said it is firmly with the NDA.

JD(U) State unit president Vashishtha Narayan Singh pointed at the ‘vishvaman’ (spewing of venom) by Mr. Yadav against the State government in his public statements when asked about his meeting with Mr. Kumar inside his Vidhan Sabha premises chamber on Tuesday.

Pictures of Mr. Kumar and Mr. Yadav having tea with Speaker Vijay Kumar Chaudhary after the day’s proceedings on Wednesday went viral on social media.

“Koi nazdeekiyan nahi (there is no closeness with RJD)....We (JD(U)) are firmly with the NDA and will remain so,” Mr. Singh told reporters in Patna, answering their questions on it.

“In public life people do meet each other despite political differences. Coordination at some level between the government and the Opposition is required. This helped in passing the resolution against National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) unanimously. Nothing further should be seen in this,” he said.

“While hazarding a guess with regard to our relations with Mr. Yadav’s party (RJD) please do keep in mind his ‘vishvaman’ against us for getting a clearer perspective,” Mr. Singh said.

The 20-minute-long meeting between the Chief Minister and Mr. Yadav had followed heated exchanges during a debate on an adjournment motion moved on CAA-NPR-NRC by Mr. Yadav and others with the demand that the House pass a resolution against these like many other States.

The Chief Minister had read out from a letter written by the State government to the Centre requesting that the contentious clauses be dropped from the NPR form and suggested that it be treated as a resolution, endorsed by the House and the Centre be notified about the same.

Mr. Kumar had also admonished Mr. Yadav on the floor of the House for making personal attacks against him. He had said, “Your father [Lalu Prasad] has a right to do so, but not you.”

After the meeting, which was seen as a rapprochement gesture on the part of the embarrassed Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader, the post-lunch session saw the Budget being tabled by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi.

Following this, the Speaker moved a resolution proposing that the NRC be deemed unnecessary and the NPR be held as per the previous format, wherein details such as places of birth of parents were not required.

The resolution was passed unanimously, virtually taking the sting out of the Congress-RJD combine campaign in Bihar against CAA-NPR-NRC since the Bharatiya Janata Party, which is a partner in power in the State too acquiesced, though it expressed bewilderment afterwards.

Mr. Singh also sought to make light of the star-studded rally under way at the Gandhi Maidan, where intellectuals and artistes from across the country have gathered to lend their support to Communist Party of India (CPI) rising star Kanhaiya Kumar’s drive against CAA-NPR-NRC.

When parties seem to be left with no concrete programmes, their people embark on tours for saving the Constitution, the Rajya Sabha member remarked.

The Janata Dal (United) machinery, he said, has geared up for the Assembly polls due within nine months and the party’s might will be on display at a ‘Karyakarta Sammelan’ on March 1, which is expected to be attended by not less than two lakh people.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jdu-rejects-speculation-of-closeness-with-rjd/article30934243.ece

The Delhi government will provide books and uniforms to schoolchildren who lost them during the violence and arson in northeast Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Thursday.

He made the announcement at a press conference here.

“If children have lost books, the Directorate of Education shall provide books and notebooks free of cost to children of both government schools as well as private schools,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“Disbursement will take place from the respective schools. Similarly, new sets of uniforms shall also be provided free of cost,” he said.

At least 34 people were killed and over 200 injured in the communal clashes that broke out in northeast Delhi after violence between supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and those opposing it spiralled out of control on Sunday.

Frenzied mobs torched houses, shops, vehicles, a petrol pump and pelted stones at locals and police personnel.

Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Babarpur, Yamuna Vihar, Bhajanpura, Chand Bagh and Shiv Vihar areas were mainly affected by the riots.

Schools have been closed in northeast and east Delhi for three days.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has postponed class 10 and 12 exams scheduled to be held on February 28 and 29 in the violence-hit northeast Delhi and parts of east Delhi following a request by Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia.

“In view of a request received from the Delhi government and to avoid inconvenience to students, staff and parents, the exams scheduled for February 28 and 29 in northeast Delhi and other affected areas stand cancelled.

213,2020/02/27,Maharashtra’s loan waiver scheme must cover farmers hit by untimely rains: BJP,"Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the current cut-off date for the scheme will leave out cultivators who suffered losses due to untimely rains in October last year.

The Maharashtra government’s loan waiver scheme should cover farmers who suffered crop losses due to unseasonal rains in October last year, the Opposition BJP demanded in the Assembly on Thursday.

Speaking during the Question Hour on availability of crop loans for farmers affected by unseasonal rains last year in Solapur district, Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis of the BJP said the cut-off date for the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule farm loan waiver scheme is September 30, 2019.

This will leave out cultivators who suffered crop losses due to untimely rains in October last year, the former Chief Minister said.

“The State witnessed unseasonal rains in October due to which crops spread across 95 lakh hectares were damaged,” Mr. Fadnavis said, demanding to know if the scope of the loan waiver scheme will be extended till October 31, 2019.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said the farm loan waiver implementation, which started this week, will be completed in three months.

“We will try to see how farmers benefit,” said Mr. Pawar, who appeared non-committal on Mr. Fadnavis’s demand.

When Mr. Fadnavis sought a clear response to his demand to extend the cut-off date for availing loan waiver benefits, Mr. Pawar, who holds the finance portfolio, merely said “suggestion for action”.

Sudhir Mungantiwar (BJP), former Finance Minister, objected to Mr. Pawar’s reply.

“On one hand, you say you want to make farmers tension-free and on the other hand you are not giving a clear answer on whether you intend to help farmers affected by unseasonal rains,” Mr. Mungantiwar said.

Reacting to this, Mr. Pawar said, “appropriate decision will be taken.”

Early this week, the State government began depositing loan waiver amounts under the scheme, which covers crop debt up to ₹2 lakh, in bank accounts of farmers.

The first list of beneficiaries, released on February 24, covered 15,358 farmers.

Earlier, replying to the main question regarding crop loans to farmers in Solapur, Cooperation Minister Balasaheb Patil said till January 2020, 26,641 cultivators were given loans for the rabi (winter) season.

He admitted that farmers in Solapur district were not able to repay their pending loan amounts in time due to crop losses they suffered in natural calamities.

Hence, they were facing difficulties in getting fresh crop loans, Mr. Patil said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bc19yu/article30687466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtras-loan-waiver-scheme-must-cover-farmers-hit-by-untimely-rains-bjp/article30932510.ece

Two petitions have been filed in the Delhi High Court challenging election of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy CM Manish Sisodia for allegedly violating poll campaign norms in the recent assembly elections in the national capital.

Justice V. K. Rao issued notice to Mr. Sisodia, the Election Commission’s Media Certification and Monitoring Committee (MCMC) and the returning officer seeking their stand on the petition moved by one of the candidates who lost against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader.

The two petitions seek that elections in the two seats, from which Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Sisodia won, be declared as void and fresh bypolls be held there.

218,2020/02/27,Meghalaya Governor suggests ‘Tiananmen treatment’ for Delhi riots,"Perhaps there is a lesson there on how to handle the engineered disturbances of NE Delhi, tweets Tathagata Roy

Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy has suggested India could resort to the method China used in tackling the Tiananmen Square protest to handle the communal violence in Delhi. The Governor later deleted his tweet on Tiananmen and Xiaoping.

At least 300 people died on June 4, 1989, after Chinese soldiers cracked down on pro-democracy protesters, mostly university students, in Beijing’s landmark square.

“Remember Tiananmen Square, Beijing in 1988 (sic)? And how Deng Xiaoping handled it? Perhaps there is a lesson there on how to handle the engineered disturbances of NE Delhi! I’m sure all comrades will agree!” Mr. Roy tweeted from his Twitter handle on Wednesday.

Responding to a Twitter user, the Governor wrote: “Of course! Deng rescued China from the murderous cult of Maoism and took it to today’s dizzy heights! Remembering some of his quotes: “It is glorious to be rich”! “I don’t care whether a cat is black or white so long as it can catch mice.”

Trump visit

This thread was preceded by another tweet claiming that the disturbances in Delhi were timed with U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India.

“Disturbances in NE Delhi (communal, as per Times Now) were engineered to coincide with the U.S. President’s visit. Trump, like a true statesman, did not discuss India’s internal matters like Art 370 abrogation, ban on Teen Talaq or CAA. Egg on the face of Left-Islamists,” his tweet read.

On Thursday, the Governor took on Democrat and U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for tweeting on “widespread anti-Muslim violence” in India.

Claiming the violence claimed more Hindu than Muslim lives, he tweeted: “Next Bernie Sanders is going to say most victims of 9/11 were Muslims! The first victim was a policeman called Ratan Lal-can’t he distinguish a Muslim name from a non-Muslim one? God help U.S. if he gets elected President. And God help Vermont anyway!”

Mr. Roy was on a two-month leave purportedly for medical reasons from the Raj Bhavan in Shillong from December 2019.

219,2020/02/27,"We need freedom from rioters, says CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar at Patna rally","CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar concludes his Jan Gan Man yatra with a rally in Patna’s Gandhi Maidan

What the country needs today is freedom from rioters, Communist Party of India leader and former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar said on Thursday.

Addressing a large gathering at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan, which also concluded his Jan Gan Man yatra, Mr. Kumar said he was not against giving citizenship to someone, but he was certainly against the “business of hatred in the name of giving citizenship.”

Mr. Kumar has so far addressed as many as 62 public meetings in the course of his month-long yatra, covering all 38 districts of Bihar, to create awareness about Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register. Mr. Kumar had kicked-off the yatra from Bhitiharwa Gandhi Ashram of West Champaran district on January 30 along with State Congress leader and party MLA Shakeel Ahmad Khan and other CPI leaders.

Before addressing the meeting, Mr. Kumar requested all those present to observe a minute’s silence to condole those who died in northeast Delhi’s riots in the last four days. “Today in this country those who chant Gandhi zindabad have been sent to jail and those who say Godse zindabad have been sent to Parliament… We must remember that the Muslims of this country chose Gandhi and not Jinnah,” he said amid loud cheers and applause from the mostly young crowd.

Deviate and rule

He expressed surprise that some groups were taking out marches and rallies in support of the CAA. “How can one do this when the CAA has become a law now?… Protests by those who are against it is understandable, but by those in support of it is not.” The Britishers, he said, adopted the policy of divide and rule. But this BJP government’s policy was deviate and rule.

Mr.Kumar’s cavalcade was attacked nine times at different places during his Jan Gan Man yatra. Groups of youth shouting pro-CAA, NRC, NPR and “Kanhaiya Go Back” slogans threw stones, slippers, shoes, ink, eggs and engine oil at his entourage. Mr. Kumar escaped unhurt each time, but window panes of some vehicles in his carcade were damaged.

Medha slams Nitish

A large number of people, especially youth, turned up at every public meeting to hear Mr. Kumar. Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinath; Mahatma Gandhi’s great grandson Tushar Gandhi; social activists Medha Patkar and Shabnam Hashmi; State Congress leaders Shakeel Ahmad Khan and Awadhesh Narayan Singh; and a host of young student leaders too addressed the rally to the accompaniment of “azadi songs” popularized by Mr. Kumar.

Ms Patekar slammed Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for “confusing the people” on CAA, NRC and NPR. “You [Nitish Kumar] have to make it clear whether you are with the BJP or the people of Bihar,” she said to loud cheers from the gathering.

Meanwhile, Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh has also begun touring Seemanchal (border) areas of northeast Bihar to convince people of the need for CAA, NRC and NPR.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xrwoqg/article29349605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KANHAIYAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cpi-leader-kanhaiya-kumar-to-address-rally-in-patna-on-february-27/article30928942.ece
220,2020/02/27,Children will be taught not to watch porn sites: Nitish Kumar,"The Unnayan scheme, which was initially started in Banka district, has been extended across the state from September 5, 2019

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Wednesday said that an awareness drive would be carried out under the “Unnayan” scheme, which is already in action in State-run schools, to keep children off from porn sites as they were a “leading cause of crimes against women”. Mr. Kumar had earlier written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 16, 2019 urging him to ban all porn sites on the Internet.

Under the programme, students of 9th and 10th standards in state-run schools are imparted lessons using information technology as supplement to classroom teaching in a bid to make learning more interesting as well as receptive.

The Unnayan scheme, which was initially started in Banka district, has been extended across the state from September 5, 2019.

“Dangerous and obscene contents are being watched on porn sites across the world. People are viewing vulgar stuff on mobile phone. Children are becoming victims of it...We are against porn sites and have written to the Centre for a complete ban on it,” Mr. Kumar said.

222,2020/02/27,Rally in Bhopal calls for action against BJP leader Kapil Mishra,"Violence in Delhi state sponsored, alleges protester

“First, there was incitement, then stones were thrown and finally gunshots rang through the sky. This trajectory shows violence in New Delhi was premeditated,” alleged Aurangzeb Azam, a mechanical engineer, protesting here on Wednesday against the clashes that have snatched 23 lives, and injured scores of people in the national capital since Sunday.

Claiming that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) attempted to divert the focus from the continuing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he alleged, “It wants the issue to take a communal tinge, become a Hindu-Muslim tussle. In all this confusion, the truth is lost.”

Arrest demanded

Around a hundred protesters gathered at the Rangmahal Road in Bhopal, demanding the arrest of BJP leader Kapil Mishra, who led a rally in favour of the contentious law on Sunday, following which violence erupted between factions in north-east Delhi. They alleged the complicity of Delhi Police in the arson.

“The Centre is frightened by the unity of those protesting and the Shaheen Baghs across the country,” said Anil Sadgopal, educationist.

Pointing out that the BJP did not consider the possession of a Voter Identity Card as proof of citizenship, he said, “By the same logic, is the government trying to say that it is invalid too, because it was formed after millions voted for them using the card?”

‘Causing confusion’

Even if no new questions were asked during the National Population Register update exercise, it did not cease to be contentious, he added. “The Centre has made diabolical statements hinting at the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The Home Minister has already stated from the highest platform in a democracy, the Parliament, that it will be implemented nationwide,” Mr. Sadgopal said.

Mr. Sadgopal alleged that the BJP’s standard practice was to make distinct remarks from different platforms to confuse everyone. “If the NRC is not going to be implemented all over the country, then why don’t they issue a notification stating that?” he asked.

Terming the violence “state sponsored”, Vijay Kumar, an activist, alleged, “People were shot in front of the police, which didn’t even react.”

For the past three months, there was no violence, he said, yet in the past three days the situation spiralled as supporters of the Citizenship Amendment Act took to the streets. “This clearly points to their active involvement in inciting violence,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rally-in-bhopal-calls-for-action-against-bjp-leader-kapil-mishra/article30925873.ece
223,2020/02/27,Delhi violence makes Kolkata’s anti-CAA protesters cautious,"‘We are making sure no one makes a speech that is even remotely provocative’

Anti-CAA protesters in Kolkata, who have been staging a sit-in at the Park Circus Maidan for over 50 days now, on Wednesday said they were taking extra precautions after the violence in Delhi to make sure no one made speeches that was even remotely inflammatory.

“What has happened in Delhi is shameful, they are simply killing humanity. But I am not scared. If I was scared I wouldn’t have started this protest in the first place. Our protest is not political or against any community, but against a law that divides people on communal lines,” Asmat Jamil, the housewife who began the protest on January 7 along with other women in the neighbourhood, told The Hindu.

‘Bengal isn’t Delhi’

“We are making sure no one here makes a speech that is even remotely provocative. We were already cautious about it, we are now being extra cautious. What helps is that this is Bengal and not Delhi, where the police is openly biased. Here, even the West Bengal government is against CAA,” Ms. Jamil said.

The protesters in Kolkata are eager to drive home that a parallel should not be drawn between Park Circus Maidan and Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, where the ongoing protest has hit the traffic. “Here, we are making sure that the traffic and normal life is not affected by our protest. We even changed the positions of the loudspeakers so that children studying for their exams are not disturbed,” said Debu Shaw, one of the volunteers at the venue.

“Every participant is now a volunteer, whose job is to watch out for potential mischief-makers and caution speakers against provocative speeches. We are also keeping an eye on new faces walking into the venue,” said Mr. Shaw, a hardware engineer.

Ms. Jamil said: “We want to keep this protest peaceful. We simply cannot afford anything going wrong or else the whole purpose will be defeated. The fight is to turn India into Mahatma Gandhi’s India, to rid the society of hatred. We are not going to stop until we have achieved this.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/delhi-violence-worries-kolkata-protesters/article30927018.ece
224,2020/02/27,Lobbying begins in BJD for RS seats from Odisha,"Ruling party likely to win three seats

Intense lobbying has started in the Biju Janata Dal for ticket to contest the biennial elections to four Rajya Sabha seats from Odisha.

The aspirants became further active after the Election Commission on Tuesday announced that polling for 55 Rajya Sabha seats, including four from Odisha, will be held on March 26.

While one seat was vacated by BJD’s Anubhav Mohanty following his election to the Lok Sabha last year, the terms of Narendra Kumar Swain, Sarojini Hembram of the BJD and Ranjib Biswal of the Congress were due to end on April 2 this year.

Many leaders had been holding meetings with senior BJD leaders to brighten their chances of fetching a party ticket to secure a berth in the Rajya Sabha.

Going by the number of MLAs different parties have in the State Assembly, the BJD is placed in a comfortable position to win three seats. In such a scenario, both BJD and main Opposition BJP are likely to fight for the fourth seat.

While the BJD has 113 members in the 147-member House, the BJP has 23, Congress has nine, CPI(M) has one and one is an Independent legislator.

Numbers game

According to political analysts, the BJD may succeed in winning the fourth seat too since the BJP does not have the required number of members to win a seat on its own and there is little chance of the Congress extending support to the BJP nominee.

If the BJP fields a candidate, the person will win only if the BJD decides not to field its candidate for the fourth seat. BJP MLA and Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Pradipta Kumar Naik said that the party would soon decide about fighting for the fourth seat.

The Congress is unlikely to contest the polls since it cannot field a candidate on its own. The party can field a candidate with the support of the CPI(M), but it would be difficult to win since members of neither the BJD nor the BJP are likely to extend support to the party.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lobbying-begins-in-bjd-for-rs-seats-from-odisha/article30926999.ece
225,2020/02/27,Kapil doffs hat to Kiwi consistency,"Adds India has the wherewithal to bounce back in the series

Former India captain Kapil Dev gave credit to New Zealand for its performance in the first Test at Wellington in the ongoing series.

“In the last 50 years one thing that New Zealand has shown is big commitment to the game. They may not have big names but they are able to perform consistently,” said Kapil at an event organised by IT giant HCL Technologies.

Interesting read: New Zealand vs India: Why India pacers struggled in Wellington

Kapil regaled the audience with a trip down memory lane. “I never had a plan B because plan B makes you weak. Plan A is always about winning and I am not a weak person.”

Kapil did not agree that India may encounter issues on the bouncy pitch at Christchurch. “We have won on bouncy pitches in the past. We have won at Melbourne. We have won at Perth. No one in this team is scared of short pitched bowling. The players are professional, understand the game well and I am sure they will come hard at New Zealand.”

Burnout issue

When asked if the players face burnout issue, Kapil said, “if burnout is the issue let them not play IPL. Country will always be more important than club. For me every Test is important. If that was not so let them not talk about statistics. They have to respect the opponent because winning is what counts at any level of cricket.”

India has not gained much from Virat Kohli and Japreet Bumrah so far in the Test series. But Kapil was not perturbed. “Bumrah is coming back from injury and will take time to find his rhythm. Virat is a great player and it is rare that he fails consistently. They have both proved and it won’t be long for them to come back. It is a matter of one innings and one spell.”

View on Dhoni

On M.S. Dhoni’s future, Kapil took a philosophical view. “It will not be just about Dhoni. It will be also about some talented youngsters also. I am big fan of Dhoni. He may be on his last leg but remember that he has done so much for Indian cricket. As a fan I want him there but as a professional he also has not played for a long time now. Performance in IPL is about youngsters coming through for the future of Indian cricket.”

Kapil lauded the Indian women cricketers for their performance in the current T20 World Cup in Australia. “They are playing very well and we are all looking up to women’s cricket. Respect to BCCI for providing facilities and opportunities to the girls. They are being handled better than they were 15 years ago.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/r0uhke/article30934305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28KAPIL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-kapil-doffs-hat-to-kiwi-consistency/article30934306.ece
226,2020/02/27,"ICC Women’s T20 World Cup | Healy, Mooney lead Australia to crushing win over Bangladesh","Australia’s 189 for one, the highest total of the tournament, proved too much for Bangladesh who could manage only 103 for nine.

Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney hit attacking half-centuries in a dominating 151-run opening stand as Australia hammered Bangladesh by 86 runs in their ICC Women’s T20 World Cup match, in Canberra on Thursday.

The partnership between Healy (83) and Mooney (81 not out) is Australia’s highest for any wicket at the Women’s T20 World Cup.

Also Read: Women’s T20 World Cup: India beats New Zealand by 4 runs

Australia’s 189 for one, the highest total of the tournament, proved too much for Bangladesh who could manage only 103 for nine.

Healy began with bristling intent, peeling three boundaries from Jahanara Alam’s opening over.

Salma Khatun opted to take pace off the ball with five overs of spin in the powerplay but Healy rocked back and cleared long-on to take the score to 53 without loss from the first six overs.

The keeper-batter made it look easy as she struck sixes over long-off and then mid-wicket from Khadiza Tul Kubra, bringing up a brutal 26-ball fifty.

Mooney turned over the strike before showing her own strength down the ground with three boundaries in as many overs to bring up the first T20I century partnership for the openers.

Their first reprieve came when Rumana Ahmed beat Mooney’s bat but Nigar Sultana Joty was ponderous in whipping off the bails.

The breakthrough finally came when Healy sliced to point off Salma, departing for 83 from 53 balls.

Ashleigh Gardner had licence to swing and did just that in the penultimate over, carting Salma for three boundaries in her 22 from nine balls.

Bangladesh’s reply began with Murshida Khatun (8) lofting Megan Schutt down the ground at the start of the fourth over but departed two balls later as Jess Jonassen took a fine catch pedalling back at mid-on.

Sanjida Islam found the third man boundary from her first ball but was comprehensively bowled by Schutt in the next ball as an eventful over ended with the scoreboard reading 23 for two.

Annabel Sutherland’s first T20 World Cup spell yielded a maiden wicket as Sanjida was strangled down the leg side for three, with the score on 26 for three.

Nigar stroked Nicola Carey through the covers for four when Meg Lanning turned to spin, and Sutherland leaked more runs as Fargana stroked two boundaries from an over that cost 13.

Nigar and Fargana, who struck Carey for a handsome off-drive, brought up Bangladesh’s second fifty partnership at the T20 World Cup, and it ended there on when Nigar skied one to Lanning off Carey on 19.

Rumana made a sprightly 13 from 12 balls but picked out Wareham on the midwicket fence to make it 95 for five and Schutt had her third when Fargana’s top-edge was gleefully caught by Healy.

Three wickets in three balls rounded it off --Jonassen clean bowling Jahanara before Salma and Khadija were run out in successive balls.

Brief Scores:

Australia: 189 for 1 in 20 overs (Alyssa Healy 83, Beth Mooney 81 not out; Salma Khatun 1-39)

Bangladesh: 103 for 9 in 20 overs (Fargana Hoque Pinky 36; Megan Schutt 3-21, Jess Jonassen 2-17).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/upemf8/article30932402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOONEY-HEALY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup-healy-mooney-lead-australia-to-crushing-win-over-bangladesh/article30932403.ece
227,2020/02/27,"Can’t make silly mistakes with harder games coming up, says Harmanpreet Kaur","Bhatia is optimistic that their batters will definitely come good in the remaining matches of the tournament.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur on Thursday rued the inability of her batters to capitalise on good starts and cautioned them against making “silly mistakes” as they gear up for bigger matches in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup.

India’s unpredictable middle-order has repeatedly squandered good starts to eventually settle for low scores.

On Thursday, India again posted a below-par 133 for eight against New Zealand but still managed a narrow four-run win to enter the semifinals of the showpiece, thanks to a splendid performance from the bowlers, who restricted their opponents to 129 for six.

With this win, India on Thursday became the first team to seal a semifinal spot at the T20 World Cup.

“It’s a great feeling when your team performs day in day out. Still we made the same mistakes after a good first ten overs, we got a good start but couldn’t carry the momentum,” Kaur said after the match.

“We can’t make silly mistakes with harder games coming up. Shafali (Verma) is giving us good starts, her initial runs are crucial for us,” she added.

Young Shafali was adjudged the player of the match for scoring a 34-ball 46 and the 16-year-old was elated with her performance.

Also read: India beats Bangladesh by 18 runs in Women’s T20 World Cup

“Feeling good, very happy with the performance, want to continue doing this. I waited for the loose balls and converted those,” said Shafali.

New Zealand captain Sophie Devine commended her team’s bowling effort for restricting India to a small total.

“I thought we did a fantastic job to restrict them after Shafali’s start. We adapted to the conditions, adjusted our lines and lengths, tied them down,” she said.

“The way the team nearly closed out the game was fantastic, Amelia Kerr did a fantastic job to nearly win it for us in the end. We certainly can’t dwell on this or sulk about it for too long, we have Bangladesh next.”

We read and handle situations better now: Bhatia

Wicket-keeper batswoman Taniya Bhatia says the Indian team has got better at reading and handling different situations, which was evident during the recent tri-series in Australia.

Also Read: Women’s T20 World Cup: India beat Australia by 17 runs in opening match

In the T20 tri-series, played just before the World Cup, India had beaten both England and Australia while chasing huge totals before losing the final to the host by 11 runs in Melbourne.

“In the last 12 to 14 months, we have improved a lot as a unit. We’re in a really positive position. We’ve been playing well ever since the tri-series. I think we’ve got a lot better as a team in working out how to handle and read situations well,” Bhatia said.

“The results are in our favour, but we need to keep up the momentum. If we do that, we will do well and hopefully we can win the final,” Bhatia added.

Invited to bat, India posted a below-par 133 for eight in the group A match with Shafali Verma top-scoring with a 34-ball 46 and Bhatia chipping in with a 25-ball 23.

They, however, produced a disciplined performance with the ball to restrict New Zealand to 129 for six to register their third successive win in the tournament and seal a last-four spot.

With this win, India topped Group A, having beaten Australia and Bangladesh in their last two outing.

Bhatia is optimistic that their batters will definitely come good in the remaining matches of the tournament.

“We’re playing well, it’s just one or two odd games where our batters failed to perform. Shafali is giving us a good start and the rest of us batters will take up responsibility,” she said.

Bhatia said she is open to bat at any position for the team’s cause.

“I can bat well up the order and I know I’m capable of scoring runs there,” she said.

228,2020/02/27,SA vs AUS first ODI: Pressure on de Kock ahead of ODI series against Australia,"Quinton de Kock has been his country's leading run-scorer in five of the six series and the second-highest run-scorer in the other.

South Africa's Quinton de Kock claimed he had not felt under pressure as captain after a tense one-run win in a Twenty20 international against England earlier this month.

“I was still calm the whole way,” he said, citing confidence in the knowledge his players understood if they stuck to the basics they could prevail in a tight finish.

De Kock's calmness has been tested considerably since then — and the challenge is set to be ratcheted up in a three-match one-day series against Australia, starting at Boland Park in the Cape Winelands on Saturday.

On the face of it, De Kock, 27, has been handed an almost impossible task.

Several of South Africa's most experienced players, including former captain Faf du Plessis, fast bowler Dale Steyn and consistent scorer Rassie van der Dussen, have been rested.

Aaron Finch will be leading what looks like a full-strength touring side with the exception of Glenn Maxwell, who is missing because of surgery.

Steve Smith and David Warner, who returned to the scene of the sandpaper scandal in Wednesday's victory at Newlands retain their places.

Already this season, De Kock has carried the burden of being South Africa's best batsman as well as being wicketkeeper and skipper.

South Africa's crushing defeat in the third Twenty20 international against Australia earlier this week meant they have lost five out of six series across all formats since the start of their tour of India in September.

The only exception being a rain-affected one-day series against England.

During that time they have won only five out of 17 completed matches.

In four of those wins De Kock has been South Africa's top-scorer and in three of them he has been man of the match.

He has been his country's leading run-scorer in five of the six series and the second-highest run-scorer in the other.

As an opening batsman, De Kock has top-scored for his side in six out of ten white-ball matches.

When he fails, as he did when bowled in the first over by Mitchell Starc in the first and third T20 matches, the rest of the batting has crumbled.

'Still learning'

Never entirely comfortable and seldom articulate in facing the media, De Kock struggled to explain Wednesday's loss.

“I'm not too sure,” he said. “It was just another blow-out.”

When De Kock was appointed, Cricket South Africa's acting director of cricket, Graeme Smith, described his “unique outlook and manner in which he goes about his business”, adding he was “tactically very street smart.”

There has been some evidence of that in some of his on-field decisions but journalists seeking meaningful insight from the captain are likely to be disappointed.

De Kock acknowledged he is not the finished article.

“I'm still learning,” he said on Wednesday.

“There's a lot of things that I didn't see as a normal player. I just hope I can get better and start putting results on the board.”

De Kock repeated the reasoning of coach Mark Boucher in explaining the absence of players unlikely to be still pushing for places in the 2023 World Cup.

“Now is probably one of our better chances to give some of the younger guys an opportunity. The ODI World Cup is still a while away. Whether they take the chance or not is entirely up to them,” he said.

Teams

South Africa: Quinton de Kock (captain, wkt), Temba Bavuma, Beuran Hendricks, Heinrich Klaasen, Keshav Maharaj, Janneman Malan, David Miller, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Tabraiz Shamsi, Lutho Sipamla, Jon-Jon Smuts, Kyle Verreynne.

The Barsapara Stadium in Guwahati will host former champions Rajasthan Royals’ first two home matches during the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League, the BCCI said on Thursday.

“They will now play Delhi Capitals & Kolkata Knight Riders on April 5 and April 9 respectively in Guwahati. Both games will have an 8 PM IST start,” BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a release.

Rajasthan Royals will play their remaining five home matches at their designated home ground of Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.

The Steve Smith-led Rajasthan Royals will open their campaign with an away match against Chennai Super Kings on April 2.

“The Royals are bringing the IPL to the Northeast for the very first time, expanding cricket’s footprint in the region. See you in April, Guwahati!,” Rajasthan Royals wrote on their official twitter handle.

Last year, Rajasthan Royals had made a request to play few of their matches in Guwahati and have been in talks with the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) for quite sometime. The move, which is backed by the IPL Governing Council, was however challenged by a PIL at the Rajasthan High Court earlier this year.

The reason behind such a move was Royals’ unhappiness with the ailing cricketing ecosystem in the state and also their poor relation with the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA).

The Royals also had been incurring losses due to reasons such as high demands for free tickets and mandatory allotment of seats to RCA.

230,2020/02/27,Indian Premier League 2020 | Warner back as Sunrisers Hyderbad captain,"Warner, who led the Sunrisers to the trophy in 2016, will take over from New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson.

Explosive Australian batsman David Warner was on Thursday reinstated as IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad’s captain, a position that he had to give up after the ball-tampering scandal in 2018.

The 33-year-old Warner, who led the Sunrisers to the trophy in 2016, will take over from New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson for the season starting March 29.

“I am thrilled to be given the captaincy for this coming IPL 2020. I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity to lead the side once again,” Warner said in a video posted by the Sunrisers Hyderabad.

“I’d like to thank Kane (Williamson) for the way you guys led the team throughout the last couple of years and I’d be leaning on you guys for support and insight to the game as well,” he said.

“To the management thank you for the opportunity and I’m sure I’ll be doing my very best to try and lead us and lift again the IPL trophy this coming year,” he added.

Warner had stepped down as captain after he was barred from participating in the 2018 season of the tournament in the aftermath of the ball-tampering scandal.

In March 2018, during Australia’s third Test against South Africa in Cape Town, Cameron Bancroft was caught using a sand paper to tamper the ball.

Warner and then captain Steve Smith were both slapped with one-year bans for conspiring to do it, while Bancroft was suspended for nine months.

After serving the ban, Warner made a successful return to international cricket before last year’s ODI World Cup where he was the second highest run-getter with 647 runs at an average of 71.88, just one run behind India’s Rohit Sharma.

The dashing opener was also awarded the Allan Border Medal for the third time earlier this month.

He was Australia’s best batsman at the World Cup and excelled in Twenty20 series against Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

Warner took apart Pakistan’s young bowling attack in the two-Test series that followed, including a career-high 335 not out in Adelaide.

Warner also a enjoyed a fruitful season with the Sunrisers in the IPL last year.

The southpaw amassed 692 runs, hitting an unbeaten century and going beyond the fifty-run mark eight times in 12 games.

In the absence of Warner, the Williamson-led Sunrisers had finished runners-up in 2018.

The Hyderabad franchise had lost to the Delhi Capitals in the eliminator last year.

231,2020/02/27,Jemimah Rodrigues: ‘It warms my heart to see young girls take up sports’,"The 19-year-old cricketer Jemimah Rodrigues, who is currently in Australia at the ICC Women’s T20, on playing for India and women’s sport in the country

Jemimah Rodrigues is the new generation woman cricketer, athletic and aggressive. The 19-year-old has talent and confidence, which she showcases with a flair rarely seen in Indian women’s cricket. Promising to play an important role in India’s campaign at the ongoing ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in Australia, Jemimah talks about her dedication to the sport while retaining her fun-loving personality, and on playing for the country. Edited excerpts from an interview.

Your thoughts on your journey to the World Cup?

As a young girl, I always wanted to play cricket for India, and ever since I got selected for India, it was my dream to represent our country at the World Cup. Now, after so many years when I look back, those hours and hours of practice, sacrifices, and fitness have finally paid off, as the day has come when I am finally playing the World Cup. It's very special for me and I hope I do well.

You have brought in a lot of fun to the team. How does it help?

I think it's very important to maintain that balance in cricket. Along with focus, concentration, and dedication, it's important to have some fun and to enjoy what you do. So, for me, it's simple. I don't try to do anything extra. I just try to be the person I am, and I am a fun-loving person.

How serious are you with your love for music and playing guitar?

Honestly, I am more serious about cricket than I am about music. I just play guitar as a hobby. I am not able to get that much time [with music currently], but I hope to learn guitar professionally and get better at it.

What brings you joy on and off the field?

I think it will be my family. I know [that regardless of] whether I have a good day, my family will always love me for who I am. Another thing that really warms my heart is to see young girls take up sports and come out to play — Powerade’s campaign #PowerHasNoGender [which she endorses] celebrates these women, who put in long hours of practice, every single day to achieve their dream of representing India at the global level.

Do you believe this team has changed the mindset of people towards women’s cricket?

Definitely. Especially after the 2017 World Cup, women's cricket has drastically changed the mindset of people towards women playing the sport — hats off to these girls. Even this World Cup now, is important for us to do well as a team, and as individuals because that is going to set the tone of women’s cricket in India. Winning the World Cup will hopefully inspire other young women, who are passionate about sports and wish to pursue it at an international level.

What would you like to change about women's sport in India?

I think more than anything else, [a sense of] self-belief needs to be maintained — that there's nothing that a woman cannot do.

What is your fitness regimen?

Throughout the week, I have strength and conditioning training each on alternative days. Sundays are rest days. Personally, there are a few things that I never compromise on: I never miss a workout, hydrate regularly, and get proper rest. We require liquids that build endurance and can replenish lost body salts. My personal favourite is Powerade.

What is the influence of W.V. Raman, the coach and how does that percolate to you?

I think Raman Sir has been very helpful for each and every player in our team. More than anything else, it’s the experience that he has. The best part about him is that he can relate to us, as he understands what we face as cricketers.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/v9n1wt/article30929484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1208345587,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jemimah-rodrigues-it-warms-my-heart-to-see-young-girls-take-up-sports/article30929488.ece
232,2020/02/27,"NZ vs IND second Test: Confuse the Kiwis, Rahane’s advice to colleagues","While net sessions are important, it’s the instincts in match situations that counts, he says.

The mind-games have begun. A lot is at stake in the second Test, beginning, here, on Saturday.

A win for India will level the series. A draw or a win will give New Zealand the series. Then, there are 60 points of the World Test championship up for grabs.

Interesting read: The influencers in Indian cricket in the last half century

Ajinkya Rahane comprehends the value of the second Test. He’s a smart man, thinks about his game. And he is clear in his mind that India has to show intent.

Stress on self-belief

At the Basin Reserve the little stroke-maker promised much in the first innings but couldn’t kick on. He is determined not to let another opportunity slip.

Also read: India’s batting was bit of surprise but they will come hard: NZ coach Stead

Rahane said on Thursday, “You need self-belief as a player and a batsman. You need to show to the bowler ‘I’ve come to counter-attack’.

“That doesn’t mean you need to play lots of shots.”

The Mumbaikar said, “It could be subtle changes like stepping out or a walk down the pitch. If the batsmen can show that intent then it puts doubts in the bowlers’ minds. You can stand outside the crease, inside the crease or before the off-stump, just to make the bowler think.”

Rahane said the Indian batsmen needed to adapt. “On pitches where the ball comes slowly, or has tennis-ball bounce, you have to let the ball come to you.”

He, however, added, “The India-A guys played here and Hanuma [Vihari] was telling us that the wicket was much better. There is good pace and bounce on this wicket. We will have to see and assess the conditions very quickly on the first day and play accordingly.”

Tight reins

Rahane said the New Zealanders bowled very well in the first Test making it hard for the Indians to score. “I thought they bowled really well. Pujara was trying his bit, he was actually looking to score runs, showed intent. But Boult, Southee and all their bowlers did not give away much.”

On India having to choose between R. Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, Rahane said, “Both are quality spinners.”

He expected Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami to bounce back in the Test.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/uyojzr/article30929228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rahanes-mantra-for-2nd-test-show-more-intent-and-negate-angles-created-by-nz-pacers/article30929229.ece
233,2020/02/27,Women’s T20 World Cup: India beats New Zealand by 4 runs,"India women enter semifinals

Shafali Verma’s 34-ball 46 followed by a superlative performance from the bowlers helped India notch up a narrow four-run win over New Zealand in a crucial group A match of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in Melbourne on Thursday.

Invited to bat, India posted a below-par 133 for eight against New Zealand in the crucial group A match with Shafali top-scoring with a 34-ball 46 and Taniya Bhatia chipping in with a 25-ball 23.

India, however, produced a disciplined performance with the ball to restrict New Zealand to 129 for six and register their third successive win in the tournament.

With this win, India topped Group A, having beaten Australia and Bangladesh in their last two outing.

Defending the total, India introduced spin straight away but Deepti Sharma bled 12 runs with opener Rachel Priest (12) hitting her for two boundaries.

But experienced pacer Shikha Pandey removed Priest in the next over when she had her caught at mid wicket.

With Shikha and left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad bowling in tandem, New Zealand played with caution to reach 28 for one.

Back into the attack, Deepti then cleaned up Bates with a beauty of a delivery as New Zealand slipped to 30 for two.

Poonam Yadav and Radha Yadav then mounted the pressure on the Kiwis and soon the Black Caps were 34 for 3 when the former dismissed skipper Sophie Devine (14).

Maddy Green (24) and Katey Martin (25) then tried to resurrect the innings with a 36-ball 43-run stand.

However, Gayakwad returned to remove Green, who danced down the pitch only to end up with an outside edge as Bhatia did the rest.

Radha then dismissed Martin to leave New Zealand at 90 for 5 in 16.3 overs.

Needing 44 off 21 balls, Kerr (34) blasted four boundaries to accumulate 18 runs in the penultimate over bowled by Poonam to bring the equation down to 16 off six balls.

In the final over, Heyley Jensen (11) and Kerr cracked a four each but Shikha held her nerves in the end to complete the win.

Earlier, 16-year-old Shafali provided the fireworks as India scored 49 for one in the powerplay overs. But they lost six wickets for 43 runs to squander the good start.

Smriti Mandhana (11), who returned to the playing XI after missing the last match due to illness, departed early but Shafali and Taniya (23) kept the scoreboard ticking, adding 51 runs for the second wicket.

In the 10th over, Taniya was caught by Amelia Kerr at backward point, while Jemimah Rodrigues (10) was caught by Kerr in the 12th over as India slipped to 80 for 3.

Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur’s (1) poor form also continued as she was soon back to the hut after being caught and bowled by Leigh Kasperek.

Shafali, who was dropped at long-on in the 8th over and at mid-wicket in the 10th over, then holed out to Jensen at deep extra cover. She had four hits to the fence and three maximum shots in her innings.

Left-handed batter Deepti Sharma (8) and Veda Krishnamurthy (6) brought up the 100 in the 15th over but both departed soon as India slumped to 104 for 6.

Radha Yadav then blasted 14 off nine balls, which included a six in the final over, to give some respectability to the total.

Brief Score:

India women: 133 for 8 in 20 overs (Shafali Verma 46; Amelia Kerr 2/21).

New Zealand women: 129 for six in 20 overs (Amelia Kerr 34 not out; Shikha Pandey 1/21).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/n9fv2e/article30929180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAFALI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-t20-ind-vs-nz/article30929181.ece
234,2020/02/27,"Prithvi skips practice with swollen foot, call to be taken on Friday","At one point, Shastri walked up to Gill and was seen giving some technical inputs.

Young opener Prithvi Shaw missed Thursday’s training session due to a swelling on his left foot, increasing Indian team management’s worries ahead of the second Test against New Zealand beginning on Saturday.

According to sources, Shaw will undergo a blood test on Thursday to ascertain the reason of the swelling.

In case the medical report is favourable, a call will be taken during Friday’s practice session on his availability for the second Test. If Shaw is not comfortable while batting, he will not make it to the playing XI.

Shubman Gill had a good net session on Thursday and it is expected that he would be asked to open the innings alongside Mayank Agarwal if Shaw is unable to make it.

During Thursday’s nets, head coach Ravi Shastri was seen paying extra attention to Gill’s session.

At one point, Shastri walked up to Gill and was seen giving some technical inputs about footwork to Gill and what’s required to check his uppish drives.

The Indian team management is hopeful that the swelling will not be a serious concern for Shaw.

The Mumbai opener didn’t even take part in the customary warm-up session where players had a good time playing touch rugby.

Shaw had a poor outing in the first Test in Wellington, getting dismissed cheaply in both the innings.

Tim Southee got him for 16 with an unplayable delivery in the first innings and he also found Trent Boult’s short ball difficult to negotiate when he was on 14 in the second essay.

Skipper Virat Kohli has already said that he has confidence in Shaw’s ability to come good because of his destructive ability and will certainly play him if he is fit.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cu4m2b/article30929133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PRITHVISHAW,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/prithvi-skips-practice-with-swollen-foot-call-to-be-taken-on-friday/article30929134.ece

An official privy to the inquiry said that four calves which died after distributed to beneficiaries on February 10 did not belong to the cows with which they were given as mother-calf pair.

“Many calves given to the beneficiaries along with cows as pair do not seem to be with their real mothers. All the deceased calves were deprived of milk as the cows did not allow them to have it,” said the official on conditions of anonymity.

The official added that most of the cows given to 30 beneficiaries of Irula community from places such as 24 Veerapandi, Anaikatti, Dhumanur, Kondanur, Kondanur Pudur, Sembukkarai and Thoovaipathi also were aged ones.

District Collector K. Rajamani ordered an inquiry after two cows and six calves given to seven beneficiaries died within two weeks of distribution.

“All the cows and calves are insured. Beneficiaries who lost cows and calves will get new cows in place of deceased ones. The beneficiaries have said that local varieties of cows procured from places near Anaikatti would be ideal for them other than diary farm breeds given to them now,” added the official.

The contractor, who procured the cows and calves for the Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department, through which the scheme is implemented, had earlier told The Hindu that all the cows and calves were cross breeds of dairy cattle such as Holstein Friesians and Jersey.

“The patient was under close observation of the medical team during the post-operative period. In non-related kidney transplantation, the chances of the body rejecting a transplanted organ are high.

The team led by State deputy secretary Shankari told presspersons the police should invoke a few other sections that were left out in the First Information Report, and also the administration should provide the requisite assistance to the family.

Last Saturday, the girl was talking to the 16-year-old boy near Vepanapalli bus stand when two of his friends offered them cold drinks. The trio reportedly spiked her drink, took her to an isolated place and sexually assaulted her.

Further, the use of alcohol in the crime shall also attract Section 77 of the Juvenile Justice Act, Ms.Shankari said. “While the police have acted promptly, they have not exercised diligence in attracting the other relevant sections that needed to be invoked,” Ms.Shankari said.

243,2020/02/27,Works in Children’s Park to be completed in a month,"Development works at the Corporation’s Children’s Park are expected to be completed in a month after which it will be thrown open for public use.

Under the Smart City Mission project, development works began at V.O. Chidambaranar Park (V.O.C. Park) and the Children’s Park at ₹ 6.42 crore last year.

The works include creation of lawns, redesigning play area and layout, construction of compound wall and toilets, providing lighting facilities, landscape, fountains, footpaths and additional sports equipment for children.

Though the parks were closed in April 2019, the works began only in August 2019.

The delay irked the people and disappointed the children as there is no central park in the city.

On Thursday, Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan inspected the works at the parks and held discussions with the officials. He instructed them to expedite the works and complete them on time.

Mr. Elangovan said that works at the Children’s Park would be completed in a month and the park would be opened thereafter.

He said that the works in V.O.C.

244,2020/02/27,Telecom service restored on Bargur ghat road,"Optic fibre cable damaged during road works

Ten days after the optic fibre cable was damaged during road widening works on Bargur ghat road, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) replaced the cable for four km and restored the telecom service on Thursday.

At present, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is carrying out the double lane works on Anthiyur – Kollegal road and the project is executed by a private company.

Earthmovers, drillers and other equipment are used to remove boulders on the ghat road that led to damaging the cable in the past four months. BSNL staff carried out restoration works and 50 joints were fixed in the eight-km-long cable.

However, on February 18, the cable was again damaged and the telecom service in the hilly area was disrupted. Since BSNL is the only service provider in the hilly area, the people wanted the service restored at the earliest.

Collector C. Kathiravan chaired a meeting in which he asked the private company to replace cable for three km while BSNL was asked to replace for one km.

The private company handed over the cable to BSNL.

The work that began on Tuesday was completed on Thursday.

A senior BSNL official said that re-laying the cable in forest area was challenging and they completed the work in three days.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/80gnv5/article30935842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA28BSNL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/telecom-service-restored-on-bargur-ghat-road/article30935843.ece
245,2020/02/27,"Companies go green with production process, get certified","About 20 companies in Coimbatore, Tiruppur, and Erode districts and 48 in the State that have GreenCo certification.

A couple of years ago, a garment factory in Tiruppur started looking at ways to reduce the resources used within the premises and make the production process greener.

Investing less than ₹1 lakh, the company - Syndicate Impex - now boasts of a monthly saving of ₹75,000. “All that we did was take small measures and tighten monitoring the use of resources,” says A. Kathiresan, one of the company directors.

For instance, “We used to buy polybags for nearly ₹50,000 a month to wrap the fabric. Now we have switched over to cloth bags. The 350-odd sewing machines have direct drive motors that result in lesser use of electricity. The regular lighting is replaced with LED lamps,” he lists.

The measures were extended to the workers’ accommodation and canteen too. The water use came down from 230 litres per person per day to 95 litres and the food wasted is almost nil, he adds.

These efforts helped the company get silver rating in GreenCo certification and it plans to try for gold rating next year. For gold rating, the entire supply chain should look at making the production process environment-friendly.

Syndicate Impex is among the 20 companies in Coimbatore, Tiruppur, and Erode districts and 48 in the State that have GreenCo certification.

Speaking at a conference on Green Manufacturing, organised here by Confederation of Indian Industry on Thursday, KA Unni Nayar, chairman of CII GreenCo Forum, Chennai Chapter, said 285 companies in the country have the GreenCo rating and the plan is to enable 1,000 companies get it by 2022.

Manufacturers usually go in for green buildings or social audits that largely focus on social wellbeing of the workers. These are based on customer demands too. GreenCo is about the production process, says Mr. Kathiresan.

The savings are from materials used, resources resued, and energy conservation, explained Mr. Nayar. The Indian Railways is one of the institutions that is going green in a big way, he added.

Speaking at the conference, J. Ganesh Kumar, chairman of CII Coimbatore Zone, urged factories to have green as an element in the vision document and to set targets for lesser carbon footprint.

Arjun Prakash, vice-chairman of CII, Coimbatore, said sustainability is also an important marketing tool and several foundries and textile units are into sustainable products and production systems.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/companies-go-green-with-production-process-get-certified/article30929626.ece

247,2020/02/27,Ashok Gehlot questions Justice Muralidhar’s transfer,"The Rajasthan Chief Minister asked what message the Centre was trying to convey by transferring Justice Muralidhar

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday raised a question over the transfer of Delhi High Court Judge S. Muralidhar to the Punjab and Haryana High Court on the timing of the Law Ministry’s notification.

A Division Bench headed by Justice Muralidhar had on Wednesday asked the Delhi Police to take a “conscious decision” on registration of First Information Reports against Bharatiya Janata Party leaders who had allegedly made hate speeches.

Mr. Gehlot asked what message the Centre was trying to convey by transferring Justice Muralidhar. “People have so much faith in the judiciary... The government’s attempts to undermine the justice system are very unfortunate,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted.

Justice Muralidhar had earlier, in a midnight hearing on Tuesday, ordered the Delhi Police to provide safe passage to about 20 persons injured and stranded in the Mustafabad locality during the violence, to a government hospital in another area of the national capital.

Third-most senior

The Supreme Court Collegium had recently recommended Justice Muralidhar’s transfer to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, which was protested by the Delhi High Court Bar Association. He was the third-most senior Judge in the Delhi HC.

Mr. Gehlot said a Congress delegation, led by party president Sonia Gandhi and former prime minister Manmohan Singh, had submitted a memorandum on the Delhi violence to President Ram Nath Kovind. “The entire Congress party is worried to see how an environment of hate and communal tension is being created in the country,” the CM said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a0lapo/article30868632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI3192019000046B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ashok-gehlot-questions-justice-muralidhars-transfer/article30933789.ece
248,2020/02/27,CBI brings back child taken to Dubai by her father in defiance of Delhi HC order,"He smuggled child out via Nepal despite court impounding passport

The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday brought back a three-year-old girl who was taken to Dubai by her father in alleged violation of court directives.

Following a Supreme Court directive, a CBI team visited Dubai to bring back the girl along with her father, Aman Lohia.

It is alleged that Mr. Lohia took his daughter abroad about six months ago. The Delhi High Court had given the child’s custody to her mother, with a condition that Mr. Lohia could meet his daughter for a few hours on three days of every week. As directed by the Court, he had deposited his passport.

However, when the child came to meet Mr. Lohia on August 24 last year, he took her to Dubai via Nepal, using a passport allegedly arranged from the Commonwealth of Dominica, an island country in the Caribbean. A maid and a family friend had accompanied them.

The Delhi High Court directed the CBI to register a case. On the agency's request, the Interpol issued a “Yellow Notice” to trace the girl. The agency also filed a chargesheet on December 19, 2019, against Mr. Lohia, his mother Meena Lohia and two others.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/h69mbx/article30933511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-parent-child-father-custody-child-pixabay,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cbi-brings-back-child-taken-to-dubai-by-her-father-in-defiance-of-delhi-hc-order/article30933407.ece
249,2020/02/27,Delhi violence | Death toll rises to 38 as national capital limps to normalcy,"Arvind Kejriwal announces ₹10 lakh for kin of those killed; 514 held for violence; AAP corporator booked.

The death toll in the communal violence that rocked the national capital since Sunday rose to 38 on Thursday, with 11 more persons succumbing to injuries at various hospitals. The national capital was, however, spared any major clashes, shifting the focus on treatment, investigation, relief and rehabilitation.

A police spokesperson said 48 FIRs had been registered and 514 suspects detained or arrested for questioning so far. Special teams also carried out raids in the Delhi-National Capital Region to arrest rioters. Late in the day, a case of murder and arson was lodged against Aam Aadmi Party corporator Tahir Hussain and other unidentified persons at the Dayalpur police station.

While Mr. Hussain denied any involvement in the riots or the killing of an Intelligence Bureau man whose family had pointed fingers at him, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal Kejriwal called for “double punishment” if any partymen are found involved.

Mr. Kejriwal also announced that the Delhi government will provide an ex gratia of ₹10 lakh to families of those who lost their lives in the violence. The government will also pay for the treatment of those injured at private hospitals under the Farishtey scheme now extended to riot victims. He also announced ₹5 lakh each for those sustaining permanent damage, and ₹2 lakh and ₹20,000 respectively for those with serious and minor injuries.

Mr. Kejriwal said the office of the Divisional Commissioner will be the nodal point for all relief and rehabilitation activities from the North East district headquarters.

The investigation into the violence was transferred on Thursday to Delhi Police’s Crime Branch, and the cases will be probed by two Special Investigation Teams.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah also held a review meeting after which it was decided that prohibitory orders under Section 144 will be relaxed for 10 hours on Friday as no major incident had been reported over 36 hours.

The Lieutenant Governor (L-G) of Delhi also held a review meeting with senior police officers . The L-G instructed the Special Commissioner of Police (Vigilance) to meet the injured persons and families of the deceased personally. Special Commissioner S.N. Srivastava visited Chand Bagh, one of the worst hit areas, to see the destruction caused by rioters and talk to residents. Around 350 meetings were conducted with local peace committees in the city.

Shops reopened in the riot-hit areas amid large scale deployment of police and paramilitary personnel. Civic agencies also began clearing roads strewn with burnt vehicles and debris.

However, people in the violence-hit areas remained fearful. Many residents stayed away though the police had been deployed. Residents also complained that the police had not responded to their calls to the emergency “100” number since Monday.

The Central Board of Secondary Education announced the postponement of Class 10 and 12 board examinations scheduled to be held on February 28 and 29 in up to 86 centres in violence-affected areas of east and north-east Delhi. It also announced fresh exams for students who have not been able to appear for the papers in other parts of the national capital due to the violence.

250,2020/02/27,Delhi violence: Congress urges President to remove Amit Shah,"Party delegation led by Sonia Gandhi submits a memorandum to Ram Nath Kovind; urges him to remind Centre of its raj dharma

A Congress delegation led by party president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday asked President Ram Nath Kovind to remove Union Home Minister Amit Shah for ‘abdication of duty during the communal violence in Delhi’ and urged him to remind the Centre of its raj dharma (duty of the rulers).

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called the riot-related deaths as “a matter of national shame and reflected a total failure of the government in controlling the riots”.

In a memorandum submitted to the President, the Congress argued that though the violence had taken place over the course of four days the seeds of this division were deliberately sown by inflammatory remarks of BJP leaders in the run-up to (and even after) the Delhi elections.

After submitting the memorandum, Ms Gandhi read out parts from it in which she said both the Centre and the Delhi government remained ‘mute spectators’ instead of trying to take remedial measures to control the mindless rage, designed violence and organised looting of property that continued unabated.

“We call upon you and the constitutional office you hold, that the life, liberty and property of the citizens is preserved, secured and protected. You should immediately call for the removal of the Home Minister given the gross ineptitude, abdication of duty and his inability to contain the situation,” Ms. Gandhi read out before reporters after meeting Mr. Kovind.

“We owe this to the citizens who have lost their loved ones, their homes and their livelihood and most of all their long cherished amity and brotherhood. We hope you will take decisive action on this matter,” she said.

“Rashtrapatiji, you are given the highest possible responsibility under the Constitution of India: to act as the conscience keeper of this government and to remind it of its constitutional duty and the pillars of ‘raj dharma’ by which any just government must abide,” she said.

Apart Ms. Gandhi and Dr. Singh, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ahmed Patel, P Chidambaram, K.C. Venugopal, Mallikharjuna Kharge, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Anand Sharma, A.K. Antony, Kumari Selja and Randeep Surjewala comprised the delegation.

Ms. Gandhi questioned the role of Mr. Shah as well the Delhi government when the violence spread across north-east Delhi.

“What was he [Amit Shah] preoccupied with since last Sunday that he was unable, apparently, to give his attention to these grave events? For that matter, the Delhi Chief Minister, and the newly-elected Delhi government were also completely missing from the scene,” she said.

Dr. Singh said, “We called upon his Excellency the President of India to suggest to him that what is happening in the last four days in the national capital of India, is a matter of deep concern and it is also a matter of national shame…We requested the President to use his power to call upon the Central Government to protect and preserve its Raj Dharma so that the citizens of this country and this national capital are assured of peace tranquillity and justice,” .

The memorandum said it was a “shameful indictment” of the Central government, the Home Ministry and the Home Minister himself that the Delhi High Court had to step in.

“It is how the leaders and institutions of a country react in times of crisis that defines how we are remembered by history and the rest of the world. We cannot be found wanting in this hour where certain groups seek to divide the people of our great nation for their parochial and petty gains,” it read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pwifo3/article30720204.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SONIAGANDHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-violence-sonia-gandhi-led-congress-delegation-meets-president-kovind/article30929710.ece
251,2020/02/27,"Delhi violence | International criticism ‘misleading and inaccurate’, says India","U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders and a number of other leading American lawmakers have expressed concern over the Delhi riots.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) condemned widespread international criticism of the Delhi violence as “misleading and inaccurate” and urged various leaders in the U.S., media, and international organisations not to make “irresponsible comments at a sensitive time” for India.

On February 27, the government faced statements from the U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), several Democrat and Republican leaders in addition to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the communal violence since February 24 that has left at least 38 people dead.

Also read | Delhi violence updates | How the situation in Delhi deteriorated on February 25 and 26

“These [statements] are factually inaccurate and misleading, and appear to aimed at politicising the issue,” said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, referring to comments coming from the U.S. “Our law enforcement agencies are working to prevent violence and ensure restoration of confidence and normalcy…. Prime Minister [Modi] has publicly appealed for peace and brotherhood,” he said.

The USCIRF, which is holding a public hearing on India and the impact of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on March 4, expressed “grave concern” over reports of violence and “mobs specifically targeting Muslims” in Delhi.

Sanders’ statement

Presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren issued statements on Twitter, urging the Trump administration to take a tougher stand on the violence, while the Chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee Eliot Engels said he was “deeply troubled”. On Thursday, a day after President Donald Trump returned from his India visit, senior official Alice Wells said the U.S. “echoes PM Modi’s call for calm and normalcy and urges all parties to maintain peace, refrain from violence and respect the right of peaceful assembly.”

On Wednesday, the co-chairs of the powerful Senate India Caucus — a crucial body for U.S. policy and legislation towards India, welcomed the outcomes of the Trump visit but expressed alarm at the Delhi violence.

“As co-chairs of the India Caucus, we welcome the commitments made by the U.S. and India during President Trump’s recent visit to India to expand the partnership between our two countries and our two peoples. Both countries agreed to continue working together to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific region, secure 5G and an open internet, increase our defence trade, strengthen our energy partnership, expand counterterrorism, maritime, cyber, and space cooperation, as well as to expand educational exchanges – all of which will benefit both of our countries,” Senators John Cornyn (Republican, Texas) and Mark R. Warner (Democrat, Virginia ) said in a statement.

“At the same time, we are alarmed by the recent violence in New Delhi. We continue to support an open dialogue on issues of significant concern in order to advance our vital long-term relationship,” the Senators said.

The MEA also responded sharply to critical comments from OHCHR Commissioner Michelle Bachelet. She drew attention in her annual speech at the Human Rights Council to the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, saying no steps had been taken to “address allegations of excessive use of force and other serious human rights violations by security forces”, while 800 people remained in detention. She also expressed concern over “reports of police inaction in the face of attacks against Muslims by other groups, as well as previous reports of excessive use of force by police against peaceful protesters”.

In its response, India said that “peaceful protests and demonstrations are part of India’s democratic traditions”, but violence doesn’t. “ We have taken all measures and restored peace and normalcy in the affected areas in Delhi,” the government claimed at the session in Geneva.

To a statement from the 56-member OIC that selectively “condemned the recent and alarming violence against Muslims in India…and arson and vandalism of mosques and Muslim-owned properties, but didn’t condemn the violence against Hindus and others”, Mr. Kumar said it too was “misleading, inaccurate and irresponsible”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ewzrlb/article30923250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CHANDBAGH-SANDEEPSAXENA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-violence-international-criticism-misleading-and-inaccurate-says-india/article30929288.ece
252,2020/02/27,DGCA agrees to look into Kunal Kamra’s representation claiming airlines violated CAR,"Comedian Kunal Kamra has been banned him from flying certain airlines for allegedly heckling journalist Arnab Goswami on a flight.

The Delhi High Court on Thursday was informed by aviation regulator DGCA that it will look into stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra’s representation against the airlines which banned him from flying for allegedly heckling journalist Arnab Goswami on a flight.

Justice Navin Chawla recorded the statement by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and asked it to take a decision on Kamra’s representation within eight weeks.

With the direction, the court disposed of the comedian’s plea which had claimed that all the airlines imposed the flying ban on him without there being a complaint as required under the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR).

Mr. Kamra, represented by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and advocate Ujjwal Sharma, had said he was banned by IndiGo for a six-month period before it even received a complaint.

He had further said in his plea that the complaint, as per CAR, has to be made by the pilot of the flight, but in the instant case it was not done and despite that the airline constituted an internal committee.

During the brief hearing, the committee set up by Indigo told the court that it has approved a flying ban on Mr. Kamra for three months, instead of the six months imposed by the airline initially.

The court gave Mr. Kamra liberty to challenge the committee’s decision and the indefinite ban imposed by the other airlines — Air India, SpiceJet and GoAir.

Mr. Kamra in his plea had claimed that the other airlines banned him for an indefinite period without even setting up an internal committee to enquire into the issue.

The court on the last date had said the DGCA ought not to have “certified” action of the airlines, other than IndiGo, which imposed an indefinite flying ban without an inquiry on Mr. Kamra.

The comedian had sought directions to the DGCA to direct the airlines to revoke the ban and also action against them for alleged violation of CAR.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/awk54n/article30686450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TH-KUNAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dgca-agrees-to-look-into-kunal-kamras-representation-claiming-airlines-violated-car/article30929204.ece
253,2020/02/27,‘Need to bring all anti-CAA movements together’,"Activists say protests in Northeast and rest of country reject religion-based citizenship, should be brought under one banner

The anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests that started in Assam and other northeastern States in December and spread to the rest of the country were united in their opposition to religion-based citizenship under the Act and there was a need to bring these movements together, activists said on Wednesday.

The group of activists spoke at a press conference organised by academics under the banner of the Free Akhil Gogoi Campaign, which is demanding the release of Mr. Gogoi, a peasant leader in Assam who has been under arrest since December 12 in the wake of the anti-CAA protests.

Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India party and Hum Bharat Ke Log said while there were different concerns of the anti-CAA movement in the Northeast, where the fear was “indiscriminate inclusion”, and the rest of the country, where “unfair exclusion” was the worry, the movements needed to be brought under one banner. He said the movements rejected religion-based granting of citizenship under the CAA, which fast-tracks citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who came to India before December 31, 2014.

Holiram Terang, former MLA from Assam, said the government had tried to spread “propaganda” that the northeastern States that have Inner Line Permit or come under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution would be exempted from the CAA. But, he said, the government had settled refugees from then-East Pakistan in the 1960s at two locations in Assam’s Karbi Anglong district, where a tribal council had been in place, without even informing the council. He said the “binary of Hindu-Muslim” was not there in the Northeast, however, the concern was that the region would not be able to accommodate more refugees once they are given citizenship.

A ll-India protests

Avik Saha of the All-India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee said the working group of the body would meet on Friday to discuss plans for all-India protests to demand the release of Mr. Gogoi, who is a member of the group as well.

Pranjal Kalita, a student leader with Satra Mukti Sangram Samiti, said Mr. Gogoi had been arrested on charges of being a Maoist due to a photo of him at an event attended by a Maoist in 2009.

“If that was the case, then what was the Assam government and the Home Ministry doing for 10 years? Those arrested after the anti-CAA protests, including Akhil, are not being asked about any Maoist link, but about when they will contest elections,” he said, adding that he was asked the same when called in for questioning earlier this month.

Supreme Court advocate Colin Gonsalves said the use of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) was intended to keep the person in jail, and not conviction. Mr. Gogoi has been charged under the UAPA and the case handed over to the NIA.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/s4belx/article30927013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27YADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/need-to-bring-all-anti-caa-movements-together/article30927014.ece

“I have lost a young son. But no, this is not enough to drive us out of India. When the Partition could not send us out, how can this do so now?” Majid, the brother of Mahroof Ali (32), who was shot during the violence in north-east Delhi, quoted his father while waiting outside Lok Nayak Hospital for over 24 hours now.

“I cannot go home leaving him [Mahroof] alone here,” the brother said.

Mahroof’s body has not been handed over to his family yet. Talking about the family, Mr. Majid said, “We are in no hurry. After all, where will I take him? The area where we lived is still burning and our family members have left. Only my father is at home.”

Mahroof, who ran a small shop that was also burnt down, leaves behind two children aged nine and six.

“We have been living in north-east Delhi for 37 years now. And what we saw in the last two days was something beyond our wildest nightmare. The children and women are scared and in shock. They left the area on the first day of violence. They have lost the courage to return to their own houses now. All we can do now is just wait and watch,” said Mr. Majid.

“We are just middle-class people who are getting used and being killed for political gains. Sadly, no politician has bothered to speak up on our behalf. Today we feel abandoned,” he added.

Death toll

Lok Nayak hospital administration maintained that 42 patients had been admitted in the past two days, adding that seven are still undergoing treatment with two deaths reported so far. At GTB hospital the death toll rose from 17 on Wednesday morning to 27 by late evening. More injured patients who reported in on Wednesday were shifted to various hospitals across the city.

Speaking to The Hindu Hari Singh, the father of 26-year-old Rahul Solanki, who was killed on Monday during the violence in Shiv Vihar, said: “On Monday evening, my son stepped out to buy milk. Someone fired a bullet which hit him on the right shoulder near the neck and he died. Today[Wednesday], we took his body to our house in Babu Nagar. We want the police and the paramilitary forces to provide us protection when we would go to the cemetery for his final rites.”

Meanwhile, 28-year-old woman, Sahana, also claimed that her family was caught unawares when returning from work. Her father, who was hit on the head with a stone during the violence, brother and uncle are admitted in the hospital.

“They were returning from work on Tuesday evening when they were caught in the violence. While my brother and uncle managed to reached home, my father was hit on the head and lost consciousness. He was brought home by two persons who spotted him on the road. We rushed all three of them to a nearby hospital but today they were transferred here [Lok Nayak]. My father had shown no signs of recovery,” she said.

She added that her family, which owns a small tailoring shop, may consider going back to their village in Uttar Pradesh. “How can we stay here when we are scared to even open our windows? We all have locked ourselves in our houses. We are not allowing children to step out,” she said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/my-sons-death-will-not-drive-us-out-of-india-says-father/article30926986.ece
255,2020/02/27,IB man’s body found in Chand Bagh drain,"He was missing since Tuesday

The body of an Intelligence Bureau (IB) staff was recovered on Wednesday from a drain in north-east Delhi’s riot-hit Chand Bagh area, officials said. He was a resident of the area.

The police said that the deceased has been identified as Ankit Sharma (26) who had been missing since Tuesday, adding that he might have been killed during the violence.

His body was shifted to GTB Hospital for an autopsy.

Ankit’s father Devendra, who works with the Delhi Police, said his son had returned home around 5.30 p.m. on Tuesday and left soon after to “assess the situation outside”. “As he did not return even after hours, we started looking for him. We also went to GTB and Lok Nayak hospitals to see if he was admitted, but failed to find him.

“We kept searching for him till 3 a.m. on Wednesday. Later, around 10 in the morning, we were informed that his body was spotted in a drain. We had never thought that he would be killed,” the father said. Ankit’s mother Sudha was inconsolable.

Ankit’s elder brother Ankur alleged that the family was told by some women from their colony that they had seen people throwing his brother in the drain. “They [women] said that when the people, who had allegedly come to dump my brother, saw the women, they were threatened with dire consequences if they told about it to anyone. He sustained several stab wounds,” Mr. Ankur claimed.

“I have been told by locals that Ankit was dragged to the house of Tahir Hussain, a local leader. Tahir is the main culprit,” Mr. Ankur alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ib-mans-body-found-in-chand-bagh-drain/article30926981.ece
256,2020/02/27,"First came petrol bomb, stones, then they shot at me: reporter","Several other journalists allege threat or assault by rioters

Lying in a bed in Ward 14 of GTB Hospital here on Wednesday, news reporter Akash Napa (34), who sustained a bullet injury few centimetres from his chest, shook his head before he said in a feeble voice that “there was no police”.

A journalist with JK 24X7 News, Mr. Napa got shot by rioters on Tuesday afternoon while he was covering the riots in north-east Delhi. Mr. Napa was yet to undergo a surgery as doctors were waiting for him to get a “little more stable”, his family said. Mr. Napa told The Hindu that he was shot by a mob in Yamuna Vihar, who first pelted stones and threw a petrol bomb before opening fire at him.

Scores of other reporters, who have been covering the violence, have alleged that they were either threatened or assaulted by the rioters in north-east Delhi.

“Mere saat jo tha, woh chala gaya [The guy, who was with me, has died],” Mr. Napa said with a sense of loss. The reporter claimed that he was shot by anti-CAA protesters.

Mr. Napa had got married about one-and-a-half-years back and has a son. “If something happens to him, what will happen to my grandson and my daughter-in-law?” said Mr. Napa’s father Ramprakash .

Mr. Napa had left his house in Krishna Nagar on his motorcycle around 12 p.m. on Tuesday after receiving a phone call regarding the violence in Mustafabad. “I did a live session from Bajanpura. Then I thought I should check what was happening in other areas and went to Yamuna Vihar. I parked my bike and asked a man how the situation was. He told me to go with him and I went.”

“First a petrol bomb was thrown, then there was stone pelting. We were trapped. There was no place to run,” Mr. Napa said. “The people were protesting on a culvert in Kardampuri,” he said.

“He has been targeted because he is a journalist. They [rioters] do not want their crimes to be recorded,” his father said.

Saurabh Shukla, a reporter with NDTV, said he and his colleague was attacked by a group of rioters and he had to show his “rudraksha” to convince them that he was a Hindu.

Multiple reporters claimed they were stopped by the rioters from taking photos or videos in north-east Delhi and that their phones were also checked.

Though not shot, other journalists also faced the wrath of the rioters. Sanchit Khanna (25), a photojournalist with Hindustan Times, said his bike was set on fire by rioters on Monday in Bajanpura. “First they burned my bike. I was at the terrace of a building and as the rioters entered the building and started thrashing another photojournalist, I ran out. But another group caught me on a narrow street and made me delete the photos of the violence I had clicked.”

Somrita Ghosh, a reporter with New Indian Express, said: “On Monday, I was told by rioters in Karwal Nagar and Bajanpura not to click photos. One walked up to me in Bajanpura and said, ‘We are talking to you politely since you are a woman. Keep your phone inside and leave’.”

“I was stopped twice and asked to show my phone. They wanted to make sure I did not have any photo or video of the violence,” said Sourav Roy Barman, a reporter with The Indian Express. “They did not directly ask my religion, but they asked my name,” he replied when asked if the rioters enquired about his religion.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rcubs4/article30929051.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27REPORTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/first-came-petrol-bomb-stones-then-they-shot-at-me-reporter/article30926971.ece
257,2020/02/27,"Jamia students protest outside CM’s house against riots, detained","They were seeking effective measures to control violence

Scores of protesters under the banner of the Jamia Coordination Committee who attempted to gherao Chief Minister Kejirwal’s residence, demanding action over riots in north-east Delhi, on early Wednesday morning were allegedly water cannoned and detained.

Following a late night call to hold demonstrations at the CM’s residence to demand effective measures be taken to control violence in north-east Delhi, the JCC in a statement said, “At about 3.30 a.m., water cannons were used to disperse the protesters”. It added that protesters stood their ground but were allegedly beaten up by the police and detained at Civil Lines police station.

MLC procedure

Around 8 a.m. on Wednesday, at least 41 protesters were taken to Aruna Asif Ali Hospital under the pretext of treatment to the injured and releasing them, but were forced to undergo medicolegal cases (MLC) procedure under heavy police presence, the JCC alleged. “Doctors at the hospital are being pressurised to give a ‘normal’ report in the MLC,” the group said.

While many protesters remained detained during the day, a member of the JCC said that all those detained were later released.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jamia-students-protest-outside-cms-house-against-riots-detained/article30926954.ece
258,2020/02/27,Violence affects lives of people across religions,"Some mourn the death of loved ones, others still searching for missing relatives; injured queue up at city hospitals

From a 22-year-old, who was allegedly shot and hacked to death less than a fortnight after his wedding, to a 50-year-old who was returning home to tend to his ill wife, the violence that erupted in several parts of north-east Delhi over the last three days transcended and impacted lives beyond religions, occupations and repair.

Victims continued to be wheeled into Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital throughout the day on Wednesday. While a majority of them were rushed to the emergency ward with visibly serious injuries, some were driven solemnly towards the mortuary.

Amid loud crying and shrieks of grief outside the mortuary, the family members of those who lost their lives in the violence were inconsolable, with many blaming the alleged absence of police and paramilitary personnel for the deaths of their loved ones.

On the other side of the hospital campus, injured people, who had received initial medical treatment, recounted tales of unbridled and inhumane horror.

“When we saw his body at the nursing home, there were injuries under the eye and on the head. His body was burnt and the clothes were sticking to it,” said Yasmin (35), the sister-in-law of Mehtab, 22, who was mentally unwell and allegedly killed by a mob.

“He was little slow mentally from birth, but he worked as a labourer and fed the family. He wanted to drink tea. He said the situation was normal and stepped out to buy milk around 5 p.m. He returned without milk by 5.20 p.m. By that time, people from the Hindu community in our area had locked a gate that leads to our houses,” Ms. Yasmin said.

As Mehtab started to walk away from the gate to take a different route to the house, Yasmin alleged, a group of people stopped him. They, she claimed, were chanting “Jai Shri Ram” and were wearing helmets and had sticks in their hands. They allegedly took Mehtab away by force as he yelled “Bhabhi, bhaiyya, save me...”. By the time the family got the keys [of the gate] from a neighbour, the group had left the area and it was too late, Ms. Yasmin said.

“We were shouting and shaking the gate, but could not open it. Then we got a call on Mehtab’s younger sister’s mobile phone and the caller claimed: ‘Mehtab ko aag ka hawala kar diya’. When we reached the nursing home later, he was dead. Mehtab did not even hear us for the last time. There was no policeman. The police was hand-in-glove with the [rioters],” she alleged.

The family of garment trader Vir Bhan Singh, 50, a resident of Karawal Nagar, had gone to a relative’s house in Krishna Nagar on Monday. “Around 4 p.m. on Tuesday, he was returning to his house in Karawal Nagar where his daughter Khushi (14) and unwell wife were present, when he was shot from a building,” said his brother-in-law Bhagat Singh. “He was shot from the area of the Muslims. Here every street has been blocked by them,” said Rajat Sadh (27) a relative.

“He got married just 11 days ago,” said Asma Khatoon whose 22-year-old nephew Ashfaqe Hassan was allegedly was killed after being shot multiple times and attacked with swords in Old Mustafabad. “The doctors told us he had sustained five bullet injuries as well as injuries inflicted by a sword. He got married on February 14. We don’t know how to face his wife,” she said.

Meanwhile, Mohammad Samad was sitting on a pavement opposite the emergency ward. The 21-year-old had a swollen right eye and reluctantly showed the other which had blood trickling down from it.

“I was attacked while I was praying at Farooquia Masjid in Mustafabad, by a mob on Tuesday afternoon. There were 100-150 people who barged inside the mosque. None of them said anything. They just started assaulting us,” he alleged.

Mohammad Asif, a 20-year-old tailor who stays on rent in Ghonda and had multiple fractures, said: “My landlord asked me to vacate the house. I packed my things and walked out of the house and was caught by a mob. They asked my name. I told them and they began hitting me with iron rods,” he alleged.

There were many people searching for missing family members at the hospital. Mohammad Qadir, from Bijnor said: “My 18-year-old brother, Aftab, is missing since yesterday [Tuesday]. He had come to Delhi for a welding job. We lost touch with him last morning. I called up his friends whom he was scheduled to visit. They said he was beaten up badly by a mob and is in the hospital. I am looking for him since morning.

259,2020/02/27,Students in riot-hit areas worried about reaching Board examination centres,"School principals can ask for special relief for students, says CBSE Secy.

For students living in parts of north-east Delhi, fears of violence and curfews have exacerbated the stress of examination season.

The Central Board of Secondary Education postponed Class 10 and 12 Board examinations at 86 centres on Wednesday and Thursday.

However, many students worried about the uncertainty of later examinations. Those who live in violence-affected areas but have examination centres elsewhere were especially worried.

Swati*, a Class 12 student who lives near Karawal Nagar was worried about how to reach her exam centre near Karkardooma Court for Thursday’s English paper.

“I live inside the narrow lanes. Everything is calm here now because the whole neighbourhood was awake last night and guarding themselves. But I really do not think it will be safe to go for my exam because I have to pass through Bhajanpura to reach the exam centre which is the most affected area,” she told The Hindu on Wednesday morning.

Her worried family asked her to contact the CBSE and she called the number found on the board’s website.

“I do not know who picked up the phone. They just said, ‘You have to manage by any means’,” she said.

CBSE Secretary Anurag Tripathi later clarified that school principals could approach the board with proposals for relief for specific students.

However, Swati was still worried. “I do not think that my principal will go to request to CBSE for just one or two children,” she said.

Muhammad Iftikhar, a resident of Kanti Nagar extension, said his Class 10 brother had to brave riot-hit areas on his way to his exam centre in Preet Vihar on Wednesday, riding pillion on a scooty. “My family considered the possibility of him skipping the exam because of safety concerns, but in the end my elder brother showed some courage and dropped him off,” he said.

On Tuesday night, a man with an iron rod was caught in their locality, worsening their fears. “We handed that man over to the police, but we cannot trust the police department,” he said.

Class 12 student Pulkit Arora tweeted a video of police announcing a strict curfew in his Maujpur area and wondered how he would make it for Thursday’s examination in Vasundara Enclave.

“Many are saying leave the exam, but it’s not possible for us and our family...After Class 12, I am thinking of clearing the NEET exam,” said the medical aspirant.

Arvind, who lives in the Babarpur area adjoining curfew-hit Maujpur said that he was looking for ways to smuggle his Class 12 son out to a friend’s home on Wednesday, so that he could write his examinations without any difficulty.

Apart from travel issues, he noted that the unrest in the area has been very stressful. “He has been struggling to concentrate since Sunday when riots started,” he said.

On Twitter, several parents expressed concerns about mental stress and the impact of the violence on young students, asking CBSE to consider further postponement of the examinations.

260,2020/02/27,Gurdwaras open door to victims of violence,"Volunteers offer langar, safe space

In the aftermath of communal violence in north-east Delhi over the past three days, several gurdwaras across the city said that victims who required help were welcome to take shelter within the premises.

Volunteers at Nanaksar Gurdwara, located near Bhajanpura, said that several people had come to the shrine to take shelter on Monday night.

Many parked vehicles

Balbir Singh, a volunteer at the gurdwara, said: “Lots of people came on Monday night to keep their vehicles here as we have a huge parking lot. They wanted to save their cars from being burnt by the mob. They had langar here also. They came later to take their vehicles away.”

“Whoever comes to us for shelter, we are ready to help them with whatever resources we have,” Mr. Singh added.

At Rakab Ganj Gurdwara, volunteers said that no victims of mob violence had arrived yet, but “they are always welcome”.

Sardar Dharmendra Singh, general manager of the shrine, said: “Considering that the situation is so bad, I do not think it is possible for anyone to step out of the area yet. Who is going leave his home to come this far. But the doors of the gurdwara are always open.”

Volunteers at Majnu Ka Tila Gurdwara and Bangla Sahib Gurdwara said that even if victims show up, approval would be required from the management at Rakab Ganj before they would be permitted to stay.

“As we fall under the Rakab Ganj management, we need to seek permission from there before we can permit people belonging from Delhi to stay here. However, the gates to the gurdwara are always open and whoever wishes to have langar is free to do so,” said Balbir Singh, an official at Majnu Ka Tila Gurdwara.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gurdwaras-open-door-to-victims-of-violence/article30926920.ece
261,2020/02/27,"Leaders, activists and residents call for peace, stage sit-in protest","Protesters blame Home Ministry and police for the situation; Yechury emphasises the need for Army deployment

“This isn’t like any other protest in Jantar Mantar, this is much bigger. Our Delhi is burning,” said activist Kavitha Krishnan addressing a varied crowd of citizens. While parts of Delhi witnessed a curfew after three consecutive days of violence, residents here organised a sit-in protest on Wednesday at Jantar Mantar demanding peace.

The gathering was also attended by CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, writer Arundhati Roy, National Federation of Indian Women general secretary Annie Raja, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh and others who alleged the riots to be State-sponsored and discussed the inaction of Delhi Police in this critical situation. Placards reading ‘Arrest Kapil Mishra’, ‘Stop the Violence’ and ‘Delhi wants Peace’ were held high by the protesters.

Mr. Yechury said, “This is the not the time for speech or applause. Today our foremost concern is that peace should be restored in Delhi. We all need to stand united and fight the enemy together. People, our brothers and sisters, who were affected by the violence should know that Bharat stands with them in this time of distress.”

Emphasising the immediate need for Army deployment, he said the situation demands prompt action and can’t be controlled without the interference of the Army.

Gujarat-like riots

“What is happening in Delhi now is a chilling replay of 2002 Gujarat riots, when the current Prime Minister was the State Chief Minister,” said Mr. Yechury. A similar comparison was made by other speakers as well.

Navsharan Singh from NGO Karwan-e-Mohabbat explained the attempts being made for the betterment of the situation. She informed that volunteers consisting of lawyers, doctors and activists are operating from their offices and working towards assistance required in the affected areas. “We have reached a point where institutions are not responding to the needs of the citizens. We have to take the matter in our hands now,” she said.

Several speakers held the police and the Home Ministry responsible for not nipping the outburst in the bud.

Wearing black bands in protest and calling for peace in the city, Congress workers led by party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra marched from the AICC headquarters to Gandhi Smriti on Wednesday.

Addressing the gathering, Ms. Vadra called for the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and said that the Central government has failed in its job of providing safety and security to the people of Delhi.

“This is our city and today, our city is burning as people are spreading hate. The Congress helped in the freedom struggle and it is our duty as members of this party to take steps to bring peace and maintain harmony. I request all of you to go home after this march and take steps to spread the message of love and brotherhood,” Ms. Vadra said.

She urged party workers to visit the affected areas and spread the message of brotherhood.

‘Stopped by police’

Ms. Vadra accused the government of having “destroyed” Delhi, where people from across the country come to seek employment. “We wanted to walk till the Home Minister’s house and demand his resignation, but the police stopped us,” she said. She added that the Congress needs to spread the word that politics of violence needs to stop.

Besides Ms. Vadra, other senior leaders who attended the march included Mukul Wasnik, K.C. Venugopal, P.L.

263,2020/02/27,"Delhi violence | In darkness, a ray of humanity","Hindu neighbours in Shiv Vihar risk life to shelter fleeing Muslim families

A couple of Hindu households in north-east Delhi’s Shiv Vihar area offered shelter to 20 members of two Muslim families when mobs went on the rampage targeting people and establishments belonging to the minority community.

The families fled their homes on Tuesday and were housed by Hindu families in Gali Number 4 of Shiv Vihar. The police reached the spot on Wednesday and evacuated them to a safer location.

Mohammad Rizwan, who works at a salon, said that they had been living in the Hindu-dominated area for the past 30 years and had never witnessed any communal violence.

His shop was located on the ground floor of the house and a majority of his customers were Hindus.

“I do not know what happened... a mob entered my shop and vandalised it. I somehow managed to save my life while my family members were rescued by my neighbour Pankaj Gupta. As we share a terrace, he jumped to our side and helped my family get to his terrace... he safely took them to his house,” he said.

The other family was also saved in a similar fashion by Vikas Singh, who rescued seven members of a Muslim family and gave shelter to them in his house.

Rukshar, a housewife, said she was in the kitchen when she heard a commotion in the lane outside her house. Before she could understand what was going on, her brother-in-law burst in shouting about a mob heading towards their home.

“We rushed to our neighbour for help and they gave us shelter. Our two-wheeler parked outside was torched,” said Ms. Rukshar.

Muslim families from Mustafabad have started leaving the area after the violence that lasted three days. The families said that armed men wearing masks came and set fire to slum dwellings and vehicles in different parts of the area.

Shaukat Ali, a resident of Mustafabad, said that after three days he managed to come out of the place where he had taken shelter when riots broke out. “My children are untraceable after the violence. My house was torched during the riots and I have lost everything that I had saved in my life.

264,2020/02/27,"CM says people from outside, some political elements behind violence","Kejriwal says he has requested Home Minister to call in Army to control situation

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia visited riot-hit Shiv Vihar in north-east Delhi on Wednesday night to take stock of the situation and interacted with residents.

“I have been in touch with large number of people whole night. Situation alarming. Police, despite all its efforts, unable to control situation and instil confidence. Army should be called in and curfew imposed in rest of affected areas immediately. Am writing to Hon’ble HM to this effect [sic],” Mr. Kejriwal said in a tweet on Wednesday morning.

“I had requested the Home Minister this morning [Wednesday] and now, through this House, I would like to appeal to him again that if necessary, the Army should be called in to control the situation in the city,” he added.

Earlier in the day, speaking at the Delhi Assembly House, the Chief Minister said that the violence in north-east Delhi, in which over 20 people were killed, was unleashed by people from outside and some political and anti-social elements.

“Whatever happened in the last three days was not done by Delhi’s common man. It was done by people from outside, some political and anti-social elements. Because of these people’s actions, some pockets of Delhi are burning,” he said.

The Chief Minister also said that the Delhi government will give ₹1 crore as compensation to the family of head constable Ratan Lal, who died while on duty in the riot-hit area, and one person from his family will be given a government job.

“We are hearing that it is a Hindu-Muslim fight. Hindus and Muslims are not fighting in Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He then read out the names of people who have died in the violence in north east Delhi and said that both Hindus and Muslims have died in the violence.

“Hindus and Muslims in Delhi never want to fight. Everyone has suffered losses in the riots. Over 20 people have been killed. Veer Bhan has died, he was a Hindu. Mohammad Mubaraq has died, he was a Muslim. Parvesh was killed, he was a Hindu. Zakir has died, he was a Muslim. Rahul Solanki has died, he was a Hindu. Shahid and Muhammad Furqan have died, they were Muslims. Rahul Thakur has died, he was a Hindu. Hindus and Muslims have died in the riots. A policeman was also killed. I also have a list of the injured. Hindus and Muslims both have been injured, both are suffering,” he said.

Stories of unity

“Many stories of unity were also heard from several parts of the city. It was observed that all the Hindus got together to save a Muslim residing in their area. Somewhere it was learnt that there is a Hindu in the Muslim-dominated area and all the Muslims saved his life. This is our Delhi. This is the future of Delhi. The situation is very sensitive,” the Chief Minister said.

265,2020/02/27,He keeps His word,"While the Dasavataras of Vishnu are celebrated by the Azhvars in their verses, the avataras are not listed in order under one section by any of them, except Thirumangai Azhvar. In two places in his Peria Thrumozhi, he gives Vishnu’s avataras. In one section of his Peria Thirumozhi, he devotes one verse to each of the first nine avataras. In the last verse, he sums up all the nine briefly, and finally adds the Kalki avatara too, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. In another instance, he talks about the ten avataras of Vishnu, but here he omits the Balarama avatara and includes instead the Hamsa avatara. Parasara Bhatta, in his commentary on the Vishnu Sahasranama, shows how the names of the Lord can be taken to indicate His avataras.

Each avatara has its own uniqueness. In the Vamana avatara, we see how the Lord helps those who seek His aid, and yet at the same time, He ensures that He keeps His word to others involved in the matter. When He killed Hiranyakasipu during His Narasimha avatara, He gave a promise to Prahlada that He would not kill any descendant of his. Mahabali was Prahlada’s grandson, through his (Prahlada’s) son Virochana. While Mahabali was banished to the netherworld, the Lord did not kill him. First of all, Bali was not wicked, and so, did not deserve to die. But more importantly, he was the grandson of Prahlada, which meant that the Lord would not kill him, for He had already given His word to Prahlada.

The Vamana avatara shows how he retrieved Indra’s rajya from Mahabali, and at the same time spared Mahabali’s life. And the Lord’s promise to Prahlada continued in the Krishna avatara too. Krishna spared the life of Banasura though He was wicked. The reason was that Banasura was also a grandson of Prahlada.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/he-keeps-his-word/article30934683.ece
266,2020/02/27,Memorial to Seshadri Swamigal at Vazhur,"A Manimantapam is being raised at the birthplace of the seer, who revealed Bhagawan Ramana to the world

Ramana Maharishi, who shone as a beacon of enlightenment, made Tiruvannamalai the final destination of souls in quest. Ramanasram continues to draw people thirsting for peace and solace. Those who are familiar with the life of Bhagawan know of Seshadri Swamigal, who revealed the ascetic to the world. Although they were apart in terms of age, Swamigal (most senior, b 1870), Ramana Maharishi (b 1879) and Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati (b 1894) were contemporaries and had high regard for each other.

Seshadri Swamigal was born on January 22, 1870, in Vazhur, near Vandavasi town in Tiruvannamalai district. The child was a blessing of Goddess Kamakshi to Varadarajan and Maragadam, who were childless for many years. The couple lived in Kanchipuram. Young Seshadri endeared himself to neighbours and was known for bringing luck. Vendors and shopkeepers vied with one another to hand over an item to him because the entire stock got sold within minutes. The child was called ‘the boy with a golden hand.’ With the passing of Varadarajan, Seshadri and his mother moved to Vazhur, where his grandfather Kamakoti Sastri lived. The family moved back to Kanchipuram, when Seshadri was 17. His mother died, with the cry of ‘Arunachala’ on her lips. The seed, perhaps was sown then.

Well-versed in Vedanta and sastra, Seshadri was guided by a wandering mendicant, to go to Arunachala. He also initiated 19-year old Seshadri into sanyasa. The period of 40 years, which Swamigal spent in Tiruvannamalai, is part of Arunachala lore. Although his unpredictable behaviour and mood swings frightened the people, soon they saw the yogi in him. Restless in spirit, Swamigal never was still. When he sat it was in Swastik Asana. Homeless, he was seen at several places at the same time. Draupadi Amman Koil and Easanyan Mutt, the inner prakaram of Durgai Amman Temple, Kambathu Ilaiyanar, Pathala Lingam and Arunachala Yogiswarar Mandapam were some of his favourite meditation spots. Curiously Swamigal never went to the top of Arunachala although he would enter the caves in the slopes. It was in one of these slopes that he found young Ramana meditating in Patala Linga cave, oblivious of the anthill that had come up around him, insects eating into his body. Swamigal brought the emaciated form outside and declared him as Maharishi. For this reason, Swamigal is referred to as Parvati and Ramana as Subramanya.

Work in progress at Manimantapam site

Apart from Arunachala, Swamigal worshipped Kamakshi and Rama. In Arunachala, Swamigal saw Liberation. He urged people to visit Tiruvannamalai — mere thought of which Adi Sankara says grants Mukti — likening the circumambulation of the hill to a visit to Mount Kailash. He often said that in the serene hills, Sri Krishna played his flute and Siva danced. He spoke highly of Thirupugazh, calling it Mahamantra. He directed a seeker to Vallimalai, who became Sri Vallimalai Tiruppugazh Swamigal.

Seshadri Swamigal decided to shed his mortal coil in 1928 and indicated it to devotees in the month of November. He allowed himself to be bathed and dressed in fine clothes but fell ill soon after. It is said that for 40 days his human form suffered the ailment, deteriorating in the process. On the 41st day, he made his last visit to the Arunachala temple and died within a few days, at the age of 59. A stunned Tiruvannamalai town overcame its collective grief to organise a funeral, which is remembered as one of the grandest of its kind. With Ramana Maharishi joining the mammoth procession at Agni Tirtham, the Mahan’s mortal remains were interred a short distance away. The samadhi is on Chengam Road, now within Seshadri Ashram.

Although there never was a dearth of awareness regarding Seshadri Swamigal, efforts were renewed recently to raise a memorial to him at Vazhur. Many years ago, guided by Mahaswami, Bharanidaran, the late author and dramatist, traced the house in which Swamigal lived in Chinna Kanchipuram during 1870-89. Consecration was done, a portrait was installed and the house named ‘Sri Kamakoti Seshadri Swamigal Nivasam.’ There is another temple in Chennai at Madambakkam for the Swami, built by a disciple, (guruji KVLN) Sharma. The abode enshrines 18 siddhars.

Mahaswami’s guidance

Sri Seshadri Swamigal (Vazhur) Trust has taken up the construction of the Manimantapam at Vazhur, a charming village. A Perumal (Sri Sundaravadana) temple, at which as a young boy, Sri Seshadri spent long hours, and a Sivan temple (Brahmapuriswarar-Kamarasavalli) are located in Vazhur.

The Siva temple, is close to Swamigal’s ancestral house. It has been eulogised by Arunagirinathar and has ancient inscriptions. A beautiful tank with steps, one side of which is named Kamakoti Padithurai belongs to the temple. The basil plant niche (Tulasi Maadam), which Swamigal’s mother worshipped has been preserved in the house, where Manimantapam work is on in full swing.

The members of the Trust firmly believe that they are guided by Mahaswami. “This was a project started nine years ago but was stalled. Mahaswami appeared in the dream of Veeramani, a devotee in the U.S., and ordained him to go to Vazhur and help with the Manimantapam task. Veeramani did not know the background and it took him three months to locate Vazhur. Things moved fast after that, he got in touch us and now work is in progress,” says Mahalakshmi Subramaniam.

The Manimantapam, in which a statue of Seshadri Swamigal will be installed, will be protected by a compound wall. The premises will include a kitchen, office room, etc. The life of Swamigal will be depicted through photographs. Taking into account the consecration of the Mantapam, daily pujas, regular maintenance, celebration of festivals, etc., the project is estimated at ₹2 crores.

267,2020/02/27,Faith | What is wealth?,"What is wealth? It would seem this question is easy to answer, but Tamil poets have not gone by the conventional definition of the word. Thiruvalluvar says that the only indestructible wealth a man can possess is education. Instead of viewing wealth as material wealth alone, Thiruvalluvar saw good actions and a virtuous way of life as constituting wealth, said Malayaman in a discourse.

Thiruvalluvar shows us the importance of education in four sections. Listening to the speech of scholars and morally upright men adds to one’s wealth of knowledge, and this is clearly shown by Thiruvalluvar in a verse, where he says that of all possible forms of wealth, that which we acquire through listening is the best.

The Tamil work Vivekachintamani explains why education is the best wealth one can have. It says that education is not lost in a flood; it cannot be destroyed by fire; it is not diminished if you impart knowledge to others; it cannot be stolen by thieves.

Apart from education, Thiruvalluvar also includes humility in the category of wealth. If one has material possessions in plenty, then humility becomes an additional wealth, said Thiruvalluvar. Treating others with kindness, viewing their problems with concern and extending a helping hand to others — these are qualities that distinguish a good man. A wicked man may be rich, but only he who cares for others is truly rich, says Thiruvalluvar. To be without desires of any sort is also a form of wealth, says Thiruvalluvar. Many undesirable acts are a result of our greed. To live without desiring anything gives a man peace of mind and can there be anything more desirable than this? That is why Thiruvalluvar puts the lack of desire also in the category of wealth.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/faith-what-is-wealth/article30927002.ece
268,2020/02/27,Faith | No repeated births,"In his Deivamani Malai, Vallalar asks if Brahma can give him another birth, or Yama take his life at will. The answer, obviously, is in the negative, because Vallalar has placed his trust in Muruga. Vallalar recalls past incidents when Brahma and Yama were taught a lesson, said M.A. Manickavelu in a discourse.

Once Brahma went to pay his respects to Lord Siva, but he ignored Muruga. Muruga then asked Brahma a series of questions. To Muruga’s questions, Brahma replied that he (Brahma) was the creator, and that he knew the Vedas. Muruga then asked him to explain the meaning of the pranava mantra. Brahma was unable to do so. Kachiappa Sivachariar, in his Kanda Puranam, says that Muruga with his twelve hands, gave hard knocks on all of Brahma’s four heads. Muruga also imprisoned Brahma! Vallalar refers to this punishment in Deivamani Malai, and says Brahma could not have forgotten what he received at the hands of Muruga.

Arunagirinatha, in his Kandar Alanakaram, expresses similar sentiments. Muruga is the One who split the Krauncha hill and killed Soorapadman. And it was Muruga who punished Brahma. Will Brahma dare to give another birth to Muruga’s devotees? If he tries to do so, he will end up having his hands shackled again, says Arunagirinatha. Another Kandar Alankaram verse mentions Brahma in a different context. Arunagirinatha praises Muruga as the One who is Vishnu’s nephew and God of the celestials. He is the One who gives jnana. Arunagirinatha wishes that Brahma, the creator, had given him four thousand eyes to enjoy the beauty of Muruga. Vallalar and Arunagirinatha were jnanis, who knew that life on earth can lead to many sorrows. Warning us of the danger of repeated births, they urge us to surrender to God.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/faith-no-repeated-births/article30927033.ece
269,2020/02/27,‘Farewell’ prayers to a village,"Villagers of Thanedarpally, to be submerged in Kondapochamma reservoir, move to new houses

Singam Kanakaiah is a native of Thanedarpally village in Mulugu mandal. Along with his father Yadagiri and brother Mahender, he performed Polala Panduga on Wednesday night.

The whole village was lit with oil lamps. Women carrying Bonalu with an earthen lamp on the top went around the village and offered prayers to Durga Mata, Pochamma and other village deities. Every family prepared special dishes to offer to the goddess. They prayed to the almighty to bless them with a bright future, as the entire village is going to get vacated very shortly, as it is one of the villages that would get submerged under Kondapochamma reservoir.

Already the oustees of Thanedarpally tanda had vacated the tanda and shifted to their newly allocated houses at Tunkibollaram after performing pujas on February 1. Now it was the turn of Thanedarpally village to vacate.

A total of three villages and one tanda — Thanedarpally, Thanedarpally tanda, Mamidyala and Bahilampur will submerge under Kondapochamma reservior.

“We were forced to sell our lands to the government for construction of Kondapochamma reservoir. Many of us are unable to buy lands with the amount offered by the government. But there was no other option. We had become landless farmers about three years ago and this will continue for ever, unless luck smiles,” said a villager on condition of anonymity.

According to the villagers, houses were allotted for 127 families of Thanedarpally at Tunkibollaram in December 2019 and keys were already handed over. Many of the allottees had already got their new houses modified according to their liking, spending between ₹ 2 lakh to ₹ 5 lakh.

“The authorities had promised to arrange pujaris to perform housewarming rituals tomorrow (Friday). Hence, all of us offered last prayers in the village wishing a bright future for everyone. Houses were allotted to me, my father and brother,” Kanakaiah told The Hindu.

He is happy that all of them got houses and he spent about ₹ 3 lakh for modification of his house, including compound wall and toilets.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ifduvk/article30935638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28THANEDARPALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/farewell-prayers-to-a-village/article30935639.ece

271,2020/02/27,"‘Hyderabad Metro was not given extra land, fares are bare minimum’","Fare hike linked to annual inflation; operating agency has right to increase it every year: N.V.S. Reddy

L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad (L&TMRH), the concessionnaire which built the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) project phase one across three corridors and operating, has not been given any extra acre of land than what was specified under the Detailed Project Report (DPR) prepared by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) or Concessionnaire Agreement (CA), said HMR managing director N.V.S. Reddy.

“There is a talk even now that the Metro rail project has been gifted away a lot of land and fares are high but it is not true. Despite HMR being a Public Private Partnership (PPP) project, where funds have been sourced from commercial banks unlike other metros funded by Centre-State governments, we have not allowed unfettered property development and fares have been kept to the bare minimum,” he asserted, in an interaction with the media at Metro Rail Bhavan.

The Managing Director said even when the PPP was not initially conceived DMRC prepared DPR had mentioned 269 acres was needed for the project.

Initially, it was conceived for two routes during the Telugu Desam regime in 2003 from Miyapur to Chaitanyapuri and Secunderabad Station to Falaknuma, but it did not take off.

The next Congress government expressed inability to fund such a huge project which was when he along with the then GHMC Commissioner and later Chief Secretary S.P. Singh came up with the PPP mode, adding a third route between Nagole and Hi-Tec City/Raidurg, after studying the best Metro systems around the world.

“We have given 269 acres, including 212 acres, for depots only as was specified in DPR and can be compared to other metros (See Box -1). CA allows 30% of 100 acre each land allotted for depots in Nagole and Uppal for commercial exploitation. L&TMRH was supposed to have built 6 million sq.ft of the 18.5 million sq.ft by time of commercial operations but they built just 1.3 million sq.ft only due to delays and cost overruns,” he explained.

Mr. Reddy gave a comparative figure of fares in other metros and explained that L&TMRH as ‘Metro Regulation Authority’ as specified under the Central Metro Act has the power to fix fares.

Fare hike is linked to annual inflation rate and operating agency has the right to increase it every year.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/rgze56/article30984092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-hyd-gr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ltmrh-not-given-extra-land-fares-bare-minimum/article30935495.ece
272,2020/02/27,Umrah pilgrims left in the lurch,"COVID-19 restrictions come into force

Dozens of Umrah pilgrims from Hyderabad who were scheduled to fly to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia were not allowed to board a Saudia Airlines flight at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The move was attributed to the kingdom’s policy of tacking the COVID-19 outbreak.

According to sources, the pilgrims, clad in ahraam, were unable to board Saudia Airlines flight SV 755. These included women and senior citizens who needed wheelchairs for mobility. An estimated 100 pilgrims were affected.

The flight was scheduled to leave at 12.55 p.m. and pilgrims began to reach the airport around 9.30 am. The sources said that till 9.45 am, the Saudia Airlines counter did not inform passengers that they would not be allowed to board. Several calls to Saudia Airlines for clarification remained answered.

Travel agents, including Mohammed Shoeb from Link Travels and Habeeb Quli from Bismillah Travels, confirmed that they received correspondence from the Saudi Arabia’s national carrier informing them of the travel restrictions which came from the Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Apart from India, the travel restrictions will affect South Asian and Central Asian countries such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Singapore and Thailand.

“Aside from Umrah in Mecca, the visit to the Prophet’s Mosque in Medina is also off limits till further notice. Seven of my passengers were unable to board the flight,” said Mr Quli. The restrictions are also for those who were scheduled to travel on visit visa.

Meanwhile, Mr Shoeb pointed out that around 40 of his clients scheduled to travel on Friday would not be able to make the trip. “Around 1,000 people go to Umrah from Telangana every week. However, we are told that those who work in Saudi Arabia and are going back will not be affected,” Mr Shoeb said.

It is unclear whether the travel restrictions would affect Haj pilgirmage, which is scheduled to begin in July. When The Hindu spoke to Masiullah Khan, Chairman, Telangana State Haj Committee, he said no instructions from the Centre had been received. “The Central Haj Committee has not said anything about this. It is hoped that all will be well by July,” he said.

According to travel agents, several carriers operate daily direct or indirect flights to Saudi Arabia. While Saudia Airlines has a daily flight at 12.55 pm, Air India operates three flights per week. Oman Air and Gulf Air operate indirect flights to Saudi Arabia.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/umrah-pilgrims-left-in-the-lurch/article30935454.ece

The GHMC Standing Committee, at its meeting on Thursday, cleared proposals pertaining to installation of traffic signals at new junctions, and operation and maintenance of the existing signals.

The committee approved the proposal to establish signalling system at 155 new junctions, apart from 221 existing junctions. Another proposal was cleared to outsource the operation and maintenance of the existing signalling systems for the next three years from March, 2020.

Operation and maintenance of the signals is being handled by Bangalore-based Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL).

Another important proposal that received the stamp of approval is for establishment of 98 new pelican signals for facilitating pedestrian crossings on busy roads. All the three proposals together were estimated to cost close to ₹60 lakh.

The standing committee also gave its nod for two proposals for property acquisition, respectively for development of T junction in Madhapur, and for a slip road in Gachibowli.

Another proposal to extend the pilot project for sanitation at major tourist locations, including Charminar, Salarjung Museum, Mecca Masjid, and Secunderabad Railway Station was extended by two months. The corporation awarded maintenance of sanitation around these locations to a private agency on pilot basis.

Participating in Pattana Pragathi programme held at the district headquarters on Wednesday, Mr. Harish Rao said despite repeated appeals, people were not heeding the advice and throwing garbage in vacant places and not segregating wet and dry garbage.

“Every empty plot is transforming into a dump yard. It’s our responsibility to keep our lane neat and clean in addition to our houses. We will impose a fine of ₹500 against those who are violating the rule,” said Mr. Harish Rao, while visiting 20th and 30th wards.

278,2020/02/27,Bird race records improving habitat,"85 birders spotted about 217 species of birds in the dawn-to-dusk exercise

The 11th edition of annual bird race in Hyderabad has spotlighted the improving habitat for birds in the city and its surrounding areas. As 85 birders began the dawn-to-dusk exercise of racing through the city while counting as many avian species they spotted, the tally was higher than last year or the year prior to that.

“The participants have recorded about 217 species of birds in total, and learnt about the finer points of bird-watching from the experts,” said Srikanth Bhamidipati of Deccan Birders.

“This year, the bird sightings were good with species such as Peregrine Falcon, Kestrel, Booted Eagle, Ultramarine Flycatchers, and Eurasian Wryneck, among others. A good number of geese, few owls and many other species were also being spotted. Out of the 18 teams, about 10 crossed more than 100 species mark,” he informed.

The Bird Race is a dawn-to-dusk race against time, where teams of bird-watchers spend the entire day birding around demarcated bird habitat in and around Hyderabad.

Waterbodies and their surrounding areas are a favourite hunting ground for birders as they present mixed habitats with a range of avian fauna in the shrubland surrounding it and a higher density of water birds. The bird race is considered an index of health of ecology and creates an awareness about bird conservation and protection of its habitat.

In the 2018 bird race, 211 species were counted by 15 teams, the number in 2019 was 213 logged by 16 teams. This year, the 18 teams that participated in the race recorded 217 species showing a gradual improvement in the habitat for birds.

The number of bird-watchers too has gone up as Deccan Birders along with Yuhina Canopy and HSBC have been organising this programme in Hyderabad for the past 10 years.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qq3nn2/article30926052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy26Bird,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bird-race-records-improving-habitat/article30926049.ece
279,2020/02/27,Certain aspects of NPR ‘under process of finalisation’: RTI,"I will be filing a first appeal shortly, says activist S.Q. Masood

With just over a month for the National Population Register (NPR) exercise to begin, the NPR Division of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), in response to a Right to Information query, has indicated that certain aspects of the exercise are still being finalised.

These include a provision to assure respondents that the enumerator has entered the correct information, and the terms of reference between the NPR app developing agency and the Government of India.

The MHA responded to a set of questions asked by RTI activist S.Q. Masood, who told The Hindu, that he wanted clarity on a host of issues connected to the exercise before it is scheduled to begin with the first phase of House Listing and Housing Census on April 1.

In its response to the method of data capturing – whether there will be two devices, or if the same device with two apps will be used – the MHA’s NPR Division stated that the ‘NPR and Census are two different exercises’ and ‘there will be different applications for Census 2021 and NPR 2020’.

Growing apprehensions

Given that there are growing apprehensions among citizens, especially those within the Muslim community, the RTI activist also sought to know whether there exists a provision for respondents to know if information entered by the enumerator is correct. The RTI response reads that ‘it is under process of finalisation’.

Another question seeks information about the agencies which have been engaged by the Union government to develop NPR application and related software, and a copy of the terms of reference between them.

The response to this too is that ‘it is under process of finalisation’.

The response to a request to provide screenshots of the NPR app showing data capturing too did not yield much.

“There is a lot of fear about NPR among citizens. The timing of NPR with Census could ruin both the operations as many have called for a boycott of the NPR. I wanted clarity on the several aspects. Unfortunately, in the RTI reply I received form MHA last month, the clarity I was hoping for was not there. I would be filing a first appeal shortly,” Mr Masood said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/certain-aspects-of-npr-under-process-of-finalisation-rti/article30926076.ece

For its first trip to India, One Rusty Band is doing quite well. After stealing the limelight at Global Isai Festival in Chennai, it performed at the Mumbai edition and is now in Pune.

The French duo has garnered attention in the city for its dirty blues style of music, the kind of rock and roll which demands that you move to it.

Greg, the musical half of the band, plays guitars, both blues and electric, keeping time on the snare drum and cajon with his feet, alternating between harmonica and vocals — all simultaneously, in an impressive sight.

Naturally, he looks lost in a world of his own. Not to worry, standing next to him engaging the crowds to get up and dance is his partner Lea. With ‘adorkable’ expressions, she does acrobatics and tap dancing.

Lea is the rhythm half of the duo — her dancing isn’t just a visual component, but adds a layer of percussion to the music. She also plays the tambourine and washboard, which she wears like a breastplate. If they remind you of European street artistes, it is with good reason.

It all began in the streets of Toulouse, France, for Greg and Lea, who are married and have been together for 11 years now. This project, they say, is their baby.

“We started as street performers five years ago,” says Greg. “Before that she actually worked with a circus in Mexico, and I was in another rock band.” He points to Lea sitting beside him on a couch at Starbucks in Phoenix MarketCity. They have just finished their performance at the Global Isai Festival when we meet. Packing the wide set of instruments they travel with has taken them over half an hour, and they are now unwinding with hot tea.

“It is difficult as it is for artiste couples, but staying in different countries made it even more so. We wanted to live together, and we realised that the only way to do so would be to work together,” chips in Lea.

Lea started learning how to tap dance for this project, calling it her one big challenge, and YouTube, her friend. “About a couple of years ago, I finally went to an actual dance school and realised that what I do is not tap dance at all,” she laughs. Traditionally, tap is danced to jazz music, but Lea modifies the choreography to go with the rock and roll, blues-y music they create.

Yes, though it is Greg who first thinks up the harmonies, it is after he jams with Lea, who dances and brings in the rhythm to it, that the song finally takes shape. One of their songs, ‘Train to New Orleans’, uses harmonica and the tambourine to sound like a train chugging along, and into a station before it stops to a grand halt.

The X factor

Being a visual band, style is just as important to them. Greg has fashioned a mic out of the speaker of an old rotary telephone, and made three guitars — one shaped like a cigar box — all of which he plays.

Lea declares Greg a ‘one-man band’, and he says, “I need to separate the instruments in my brain, each follows its own reading like boom tah boom tah…” he starts vocalising. “You just have to keep training.”

She interjects, “The first time he tried it, I remember him complaining, ‘It is not possible, I can’t do it, I can’t do it’.” She looks toward him, brushing his arm, and adds, “But you picked it up in one month, it was so impressive.”

While Greg cites Jimi Hendrix and ‘70s blues as his inspiration, Lea is a big fan of Stomp, a US-based percussion group. “They create percussion with absolutely anything… A table, glasses, feet…” In India, Lea has danced with kathak dancers and jammed with a tabla player.

Though they are touring many countries now, they look back fondly on the days they played on the streets. “Here, people come to listen to us. But on the streets, there was always a chance that you touched someone who was a stranger to our music,” says Lea.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/5h5l3s/article30932162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPOneRustyBand2018color--18jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/one-rusty-band-brings-the-french-street-artiste-life-to-indian-stages/article30932166.ece
281,2020/02/27,A rewarding performance,"While Ustad Shahid Parvez impressed with the intensity of his artistic expression, Sanjeev Abhayankar showcased all the essential features of Mewati gayaki at different events in the Capital

Mujhe aap ne bulaaya, ye karam nahin to kya hai / Mera martaba badhaaya, ye karam nahin to kya hai?” (you have invited me and raised my stature, what is it, if not your kindness?) the Urdu couplet was the emotional outpouring of Ustad Shahid Parvez, after receiving the Kalajyoti Lifetime Achievement Award, instituted by Pandit Birju Maharaj in memory of his father Guru Achchhan Maharaj, on the concluding evening of 22nd Vasantotsav organised by Kalashram at a packed Kamani auditorium. “An award becomes meaningful,” he explained, “when it comes from the buzurg (seniors), whom I have admired since childhood and have understood the crux of art from him. This is definitely the most precious award for me,” Parvez gushed

Though short, his performance had an exceptionally soothing element. The tonal quality of hissitar and the delicate nuances, tender like a silken thread, captured the subtle shades of emotions during his inspired rendition of raga Pilu, one of the favourite ragas of his Etawah Imdadkhani Gharana.

The delicate melodic embroidery during the poignantalaap adorned with elongated meends of 4, 5 notes and the enticing shades of the all-time favourite songs like “Mohe Panghat pe Nandlal Chhed Gayo re…” and “Nimbua tale…” created perfect preface for the rich repertoire comprising the choicest gems of compositions from treasure trove of his illustrious Gharana, including some of his own freshly minted ones.

Parvez reached the intensity of artistic expression, not just through ‘sur’ but also with the intricacies of ‘laya’ (rhythm), the two components of music. Perhaps, he was inspired by the irresistible instant appraisal coming from Pt. Birju Maharaj, appreciating each of his intricate nuances.

Opening with a Thumri-like composition set to Chaanchar Theka of the 14 beats time cycle of Deepchandi Tala, for instance, Shahid astonishingly fitted the Tisra Jati Chhand in the Misra Jati contour of the composition, adjusting the fractional intervals ofsix beats (tisra) into the seven beats (misra) combinations with utmost precision, while reposefully rendering the raga.

There was another composition in Teentala with its ‘Sam’ on ‘Avagrah’ simply a void, offering awesome surprise. Many of his unusual rare compositions laced with quicksilvertaans, inspired Akram Khan on tabla to pick up the ‘mukhda’, the opening phrase from 'khali', instead of the mandatory ‘Sam’, in umpteen ways.

Earlier, Vidushi Malini Awasthi rendered Thumri-Dadra in the leisurely style of Purab Ang Gayaki.thumri Mishra Kafi “Tum toh karat barjori…” was sprinkled with the intricate nuances of Tappa as well. There was a rare Hori in raga Khambavati and a traditional Dadra too. The texture and tension of her well-groomed, full-throated, earthy voice is the forte of her effortless renditions that she enjoys unabashedly. The tender touches of Pt. Dharmanath Mishra’s harmonium and the Banarasi Laggi of Ram Kumar Mishra’s tabla enhanced her lively performance. The concluding Hori “Rang darungi Nand ke Lalan par…”, composed by Bindadin Maharaj, created vibrant ambience of the festival of colours. Malini’s daughter Mamta, a disciple of Pt. Birju Maharaj, plunged into an impromptu Kathak Jugalbandi with the vocalist. She was later joined by Saswati Sen turning it into a delightful floral Holi.

Night-long festival

Sanjeev Abhayankar

Natya Tarangini celebrated ‘Mahas Shivaratri’ with a night-long festival of music and dance at the Raja-Radha Manch featuring Sanjeev Abhayankar and Pt. Channulal Mishra. With a voice that is a close facsimile of his esteemed guru Pandit Jasraj, Sanjeev has truly comprehended the characteristic features of Mewati Gharana. His swaras sounded exquisitely contoured and his music showcased all the essentials of this gayaki.

Accompanied by Pt. Vinod Lele on tabla and Dr Vinay Mishra on harmonium, Sanjeev opened with raga Jog. The spacious alaap and fine phrasings in bada khayal set to vilambit Ek-tala were rendered with a planned strategy. The slow, deliberate and perfect diction of the anguished bandish “Nahin parat chit chain / Jahi lage so hi jaane, Sanware ke sain” (my heart is getting no relief from pain, my predicament could be understood only by someone whose heart is also pierced with the penetrating glance of the dark-skinned Krishna), sensitively augmented the bhava.

And this trait of giving importance to proper pronunciation, bringing out the meaning musically with the gradual elaboration of the raga throughalaap, bol-alaap, sargam and akaar taans was evident not just in this raga but also during the Rupak and Teentala compositions of the following Gorakh Kalyan and the concluding bhajan “Gale bhujanga, bhasma anga….” rendered in raga Desh. One was disappointed though with the selection of their ragas. Neither Sanjeev nor Pt. Chhannu Lal Mishra who sang Hamsadhwani, Shyam-Kalyan, Thumri Khamaj, Dadra and Hori thought of the most appropriate ‘Shankara’, the panta-tonic evening raga to evoke ‘Shankar’ on Maha Shivaratri.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/7w4ibj/article30931146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28DFR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/a-rewarding-performance/article30931150.ece
282,2020/02/27,This French musician collaborates with Kerala artistes to highlight the importance of nature conservation,"French singer-composer Ziako says music speaks a universal language for him

For French musician Ziako, music speaks a universal language. So when he realised that “man-made” hazards have been irreversibly damaging the very planet he’s living in, he took recourse to his passion to try and inspire a change. “Universal themes need a universal medium. Music goes beyond language barriers. Also, its catchy,” Ziako says in French, duly translated by Praveen Muraleedharan, with whom the artiste is collaborating for a series of concerts in partnership with the International Solidarity and Education Association (ASIE).

Ziako brings “French music in blues style” with the originals that he himself wrote and composed. “The key themes of the songs are nature conservation, awareness against use of plastic and the need to make the world a better place to live,” says Ziako, who also plays the guitar. “Whether its France or Kerala, the problem is the same and that nature has been either exploited or polluted. But our rather half-cooked solutions have been inconsistent and woefully insufficient,” Ziako adds.

The musician says he has penned the lyrics keeping the “core message” in mind that are primarily aimed at the young, who, he feels, “wield the power for change” and inspire future generations as well to understand that “prevention is indeed better than cure.” So we have songs such as ‘The Seven Continents’ that wants to spotlight how all the seven continents are turning into “massive plastic islands” that are perhaps moving towards a point of no return.

“The songs convey the message that the permanent solution is not to clean up but to stop the use of plastics altogether,” says Praveen, who accompanies Ziako on the box-shaped percussion instrument cajon. The duo is joined by playback singer Saju Sreenivas, lead vocalist of the band Pathayam for their gigs. Ziako was in the city for a performance, organised in association with Alliance Francaise de Trivandrum, at Christ Nagar International School on Thursday. The ensemble will hold another performance on February 28 at Mar Ivanios College, Nalanchira, at 2.30 pm. The group has already performed in Kochi and Madurai before this stopover in the capital city.

Another number, ‘Boheme’, which signifies ‘liberty’, speaks about the concept of “the whole world being one’s home.” “‘Boheme’ extols the need to be free-spirited and talks about travelling with the ideas of fraternity, altruism and oneness in mind,” explains Ziako, a native of Chateauroux in central France.

The 45-year-old’s journey in music began with the French group Zodiane in 1997 as a singer-guitarist, before turning independent artiste. In 2018, he released a solo album, titled Ziako — Ne En Voyage (Born on a trip). In fact, Zaiko is his artiste name, a phrase borrowed from Malagasy language spoken in Madagascar that means ‘healing music to share’. His real name is Johann Brard.

Praveen says his company, Team Eco Ventures that promotes eco-friendly tourism, has been joining hands with ASIE for the past 11 years for similar cultural exchanges. Alain Payen, President of ASIE, who’s part of the entourage, says “the group’s songs brim with the spirit of life and positivity.” Apart from South India, ASIE has already organised “solidarity missions” with Ziako in China and Uzbekistan.

The ensemble aims to take the collaboration beyond the concerts with a “French-Malayalam” project that is in the pipeline. “Soon, we are recording nature-themed songs incorporating lyrics in French and Malayalam to reach a wider audience,” adds Praveen.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/1muh7f/article30931132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvmZiakoandPraveen,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/this-french-musician-collaborates-with-kerala-artistes-to-highlight-the-importance-of-nature-conservation/article30931133.ece
283,2020/02/27,How Padma awardee Ajoy Chakrabarty pursued music against odds,"As his biography “Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty – seeker of the music within” hits the stands, Padma Bhushan Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty talks about his eventful musical journey

When it comes to the Padma Awards in classical music, Bengal, widely accepted as the land of the world renowned intellectuals and artists, hasn’t received its due. Even the ardent admirers of musicians have been of the opinion that in the arena of khayal singing, this undisputed land of music lags behind miserably. Till 2019, there was no Bengali khayal exponent to stake a claim on even a Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian award, till the arrival of Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty in the hallowed zone this Republic Day.

Chakrabarty, an extremely well-read musician candidly answers, “Because the problem lies here. For centuries, Bengal nursed music in a way that no musician could do without offering his/her art here. The local musicians such as Tarapada Chakraborty, Prasun Banerjee, Sukhendu Goswami, Meera Banerjee, Malabika Kanan, and several other legends, therefore, hardly ventured out of Bengal. Also, as was the trend, Hindi belt and its language and dialects bore little or no importance for them. This blocked the authentic aroma of khayal. In comparison, musicians who cared to embrace the language and tradition blossomed on the national level.”

Going by his new biography, “Pandit Ajoy Chakrabarty – seeker of the music within” (authored by Shyam Banerji and published by Niyogi Books), he does not live the tradition either! When reminded of it, he simply admits, “True. I came from a very humble background but my father, my first guru, never allowed me to be complacent. He always wanted to be a vocalist himself but his traditionalist father did not allow him to accept the stipend and offer of learning music from Ustad Inayet Khan, the then court musician of Gouripur. So, he ran away from home, accepted a life of relentless struggle and reared me by pumping passion for music with a fixed goal to make it real big.”

The biography, like a jod-raga, runs in double streams of stirring soliloquies and deferential descriptions. According to one such narrative, “When Ajit (Chakrabarty) heard Ajoy sing for the first time…he remembered that Premananda Tirthaswami Maharaj had prophesied that his son would one day become a very well-known singer.” A true believer, Ajit decided that come what may, he will ensure this; and he did!

Unconditional love

Sitting in the music room of his sprawling official bungalow within the ITC SRA’s emerald draped campus, Chakrabarty recalls, “Driven by sheer poverty, I was lured by several distracting offers, but Baba stood his ground like a rock. Ironically, my first guru Pannalal Samanta led me to his teacher Kanaidas Bairagi, who in turn took me to his Guru, Jnan Prakash Ghosh! All of them drenched me with their unconditional love-driven music of diverse genres and I simply soaked in what I received. For this, Baba encouraged me to develop my own way of writing notations. Then, one day, Guruji took me to Ustad Munawwar Ali Khansaheb.”

This started his tryst with a Gharana, and a powerful one like Patiala! Soon after a chance meeting with Pandit Vijay Kichlu, the founder-director of the newborn Sangeet Research Academy, facilitated his entry into the world of homogeneous music fraternity of Hindustani classical music wherein ‘Hindustani’, with its language and culture, reigned supreme and in full glory.

A ‘princely’ scholarship beyond his imagination, concert platforms, honorariums and admirations, and ensuing marriage, this was a huge turning point that placed him beyond national boundaries. It sounds like a fairy tale! “But to retain the story in my favour, I had to work harder and harder,” he says.

Every resident of the SRA knows about his ‘whole night riyaaz’ sessions. What urged him to do so for years? The ringing truthfulness of his tone is touching, when he admits, “I was music hungry. SRA offered me a feast that forced me to egg on. Moreover, here I got the opportunity to observe such masters such as Latafat Hussain Khan, Hirabai Barodekar, Nivruttibua Sarnaik, Nissar Hussain Khan; and saw the fruition of a young genius like Rashid (Khan). Such was his impact that aami abhibhuto hotaam (I used to get dazed). There were many instances when I was not considered but musicians from the Hindi belt were. I got hurt but at the same time I tried to analyse the reason?”

New vistas

Such experiences sharpened his awareness and hunger for more knowledge, he says. “I tried the way Ustad Amir Khan melodically meditated on stage and the way his music emanated peace is our very own treasure. Indian music is known the world over for its intrinsic spiritualism. It demands nishtha (dedication), chintan (reflection), parishram (toil) and aahuti (surrender). These have no colours of isms.”

He maintains despite being handed down from generation to generation, all this was never explained to them. “Because earlier taking orders from elders and teachers was the norm and asking question was a taboo. But today, young students come up with every conceivable question and this opens up new vistas of analysis for a passionate teacher like me. Once a student asked me, ‘what is a raga?’ and refused to accept the traditional ‘ranjayate iti’. To satiate his quest, I had to write a definition logically and scientifically.”

Connectivity of notes

Chakrabarty is a great guru in the real sense who teaches by giving practical examples, based on his own experiences at the feet of numerous gurus. A persistent ‘jijnaasu’ (learner), he believes in the principle of ‘Guru-tattva’. Focused on his vision of educating the keen students the secrets of Indian music-making, he shares a few points but not before clarifying that unlike Western music, notations cannot describe the Indian science of connectivity of notes which convert them into swaras.

“Science jekhane shesh shekhane philosophy shuru (where science ends, philosophy begins),” he says. “The touch notes connect and add life to swaras that are movable and living. To make a child understand this philosophy, one must explain that inhaling air is life, exhaling is music. So, respect the air and practise pranayama with sur. This helps build a steady voice. Sustaining long notes is India’s very own. This not only brings the listeners in the musician’s canoe of melody but also allows them to settle down peacefully.”

Blend of Carnatic and Hindustani

Another important subject, he adds, is learning the musical alphabets or position of notes to write the story of a raga.

“Though vivisection of art is disfiguration of beauty, this exercise helps understand that Sa is not an alphabet, it is a sentence, a story too which helps portray the deep emotion that dominates a raga. In this journey, lyrics play an important role. So does the laya or the time-zone between the two beats and the logic behind the usage of mnemonics. Dha-dhin is not simple 1 and 2. The tala’s gait and its beauty have to be internalised by clapping. This technique of Carnatic music needs to be blended with Hindustani music’s sensibilities. Also, the art of accompaniment needs to be reorganised to reduce the cacophony.”

Chakrabarty accepts the Padma Bhushan as a humble ‘patra’ (carrier) of the ‘highest art’ which came with the blessing of his parents and gurus. Kolkata’s music fraternity, led by ITC SRA, is gearing up to felicitate the master for this achievement.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/psr4tp/article30931065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28DFRAJOYCHAKRABARTY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ajoy-chakrabarty-the-seeker/article30931067.ece
284,2020/02/27,Driven by the ganjira’s sound,"B. Shree Sundarkumar on why he chose to pursue the instrument

Ganjira artiste B Shree Sundarkumar articulates his views as resoundingly as he plays the instrument. He strongly believes that all artistes are equal on stage, regardless of vocal or instrument, age or tenure.

His first concert was at age five on the mridangam. His father and first teacher, Dr. KBS Mani, put his all into grooming Sundarkumar. A practicing veterinary doctor, Mani did not take up music professionally. Both Sundarkumar’s sisters, B Lakshmishree and B Vijayashree, are vocalists and his maternal uncles are all into music — AS Krishnan - morsing, AS Ranganathan - mridangam, AS Shankar - ghatam and AS Murali – vocal. At six, he joined Guru Karaikudi Mani for further instruction in mridangam, along with Mani’s older students. Sundarkumar soon got opportunities. “Sri Yagnaraman of Krishna Gana Sabha promoted talent, regardless of age. As a result, I got to play with veterans like N. Ramani Sir, Thanjavur Venkatesa Iyengar Sir and OS Thiagarajan Sir, even as a child.”

A concert he attended at The Music Academy in 2001 was a game changer — Trichur Ramachandran with Umayalpuram Sivaraman and G. Harishankar on ganjira. He recollects the mridangam maestro doing the thani avartanam for a very early piece in Adi talam one kalai. Sundarkumar wondered how Harishankar could possibly translate in one hand what had been done with two. “I was just blown away. I could not even see Harishankar Sir’s hands.” He promptly went to Saptaswara Musicals and bought a ganjira. “My mother (AS Vijayalakshmi) scolded me for wasting money when we already had mridangams at home.”

He spent hours practicing, playing alongside recordings, listening, observing Harishankar and translating his mridangam skills on to the ganjira. “I learned to produce a full and complete effect on the ganjira with far fewer available tones,” says Sundarkumar. In six months, he showcased his skills to Guru Karaikudi Mani, who told him to switch over to the ganjira.

Says Umayalpuram Sivaraman, “Sundarkumar modulates the tone of the ganjira in different colours. Achieving this dexterity requires sadhaka but appropriate channelisation showcases the artiste’s skill. Sundarkumar possesses this in abundance.”

At a Sadashiva Brahmendar festival in 2002, he played for veteran flautist N. Ramani. Sundarkumar floored everyone. “Ramani Sir and Srimushnam Raja Rao Sir (who played the mridangam) were most appreciative.”

Ganjira exponent BS Purushotham says that Sundarkumar can replicate with one hand anything played with two on other percussive instruments, including strokes played on mridangam, thavil, tabla, drums…He draws attention to Sundarkumar’s detailed delineation of sankeerna nadai which “few have tried exploring.”

Sundarkumar’s Kanjira Man Foundation promotes solo concerts of percussion instruments and organised a three-day festival last year. “A dedicated event celebrating percussion was necessary to promote them and give them their due.”

He worked on the movie Sarvam Thaala Mayam by Rajiv Menon with music by AR Rahman. He has collaborated on several fusion projects including with drummer Ranjit Barot, playback singer Kailash Kher on MTV Unplugged, lyricist and singer Amit Trivedi on Coke Studio, L. Shanker, late fusion violinist Balabhaskar, drummer Sivamani, and more. Guitarist Darryl Dobson and he released a Jazz CD in the U.S. titled Ninth Wave. Sundarkumar had also formed a fusion band called MAyA with veena artiste Rajhesh Vaidhya, drummer Gino Banks and flautist Naveen Kumar. Their first album received the Best Instrumental Fusion Album award at Palm Expo in Bombay.

Shree Sundarkumar feels music should be put at the forefront with the artistes seeing themselves as mere instruments to communicate the artform.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/rt3zpb/article30931062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28frshreeSundarkumarjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/driven-by-the-ganjiras-sound/article30931063.ece
285,2020/02/27,BTS bares its musical soul,"The hugely popular K-pop band’s new album, ‘Map of The Soul: 7’, is a heartwarming story of their journey

When K-Pop Supergroup BTS became a global phenomenon, it was widely speculated that they wouldn’t last long. However, the septet has proved the sceptics wrong by continuing to rule the popularity charts. With the release of its latest album, looks like the band is here to stay. ‘Map of the Soul: 7’ shows the group’s ability to look beyond K-pop with the album being a mix of styles — ballads, rap, electro-disco, Latin, progressive and some Disney-esque music.

“The emotions in our songs are something that our generation and everyone around the world can relate to,” said leader RM at the Map of the Soul: 7 global press conference that was streamed live on YouTube.

The album, which has a total of 20 tracks, of which 15 are new and five part of the previous album ‘Map of the Soul: Persona’, was released on February 21. It is said to be one of their biggest and most intricate productions, since the launch of Connect: BTS — a global project that connected 22 artistes and five cities. Their latest offering weaves in Carl Jung’s philosophies and tells the story of the band members’ journey along with references to their earlier works.

For me this album ranks below their ‘Wings’ (2016), ‘You Never Walk Alone’ and ‘Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever’. ‘Map of the Soul: 7’ begins with five of their earlier tracks and works perfectly to tell the story that the band’s intended to.

“We debuted seven years ago; sometimes we were uncertain, and every time that happened that shadow and fear inside of us grew,” said Suga at the press conference. The first new track on this album, ‘Interlude: Shadow’ is Suga’s solo, where he looks back on his childhood dream of being a rap artiste and as he grew in fame, his shadow became bigger, it was harder to find himself.

‘We Are Bulletproof: The Eternal’ is my favourite song on the album and speaks of how they were just seven members but with their fans they became bulletproof, a nod to their name which translates to ‘Bulletproof Boy Scouts’, no matter what happens they will always be here.

The title track ‘ON’ is a stadium-like anthem. While it is a reversal of their 2013 hit ‘N.O’, the music style and the lyrics are quite different. This track also has a digital version of the song which features vocal powerhouse Sia. ‘Louder Than Bombs’, which is co-written by Suga, RM and J-Hope alongside South-African born Australian singer Troye Sivan, is not just haunting and gives a nod to some of Sivan’s earlier works but also is a perfect fusion of all the elements that reflect the BTS of now.

‘Friends’ is sung by V and Jimin and also marks the latter’s official production debut. It traces their life together since they met each other, references little personal experiences and overall is heartwarming as they sing of how they will stay by each other’s side even after the cheers fade away and close the song by singing to the other ‘You are my soulmate’. ‘Respect’ is the subunit song that features RM and Suga. When it was first announced, fans wondered how the two with very different music styles are going to work together. This song seems to be a novel experience. ‘Jamais Vu’ featuring Jungkook, Jin and J-Hope was part of the last album, but to have included it in this album means offering a full package.

The members also have their solos — V’s ‘Inner Child’ is an ode to his past, Jimin’s ‘Filter’ is Latina influenced; it is not just a lovely song to listen to but also a great salsa number, Jungkook’s ‘My Time’ is an R&B influenced track that weaves in the emotions he went through as a young boy who was training for a life in the limelight and Jin’s ‘Moon’, a heartfelt thank you letter to fans - ARMY. The vocal line of BTS, Jungkook, V, Jin and Jimin also showcases their abilities on ‘00:00 (Zero O Clock)’ that runs with the underlying message of no matter what happens, every day is a fresh canvas for one to paint on, so we shouldn’t dwell on past mistakes.

‘Intro: Persona’, RM’s solo is another song from their previous album ‘Outro: Ego’, a solo by J-Hope is the last track. It is reminiscent of the music style that J-Hope showed us in his solo mixtape ‘Hope World’.

286,2020/02/27,Gurbani: Flavour of Sikh devotion,"Dr. Alankar Singh sang gurbani to the lilting accompaniment of rabab at an event in Chennai

On Saturday last, Viswa kala Sangama presented a team of promising artistes at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Chennai. Pt. Janardhan Mitta, disciple of Pt. Ravi Shankar, set the tone with a prayer song.

The concert began with the soothing strains of raag Puriyadhanashri on dilruba. Sandeep Singh, disciple of Ustad Dilshad Khan, nephew of the renowned Ustad Sultan Khan of Sikar Gharana of Jodhpur is a much sought after artiste from Jalandhar.

He performs both solo and in the company of Dr. Alankar Singh, artiste of the evening. Both have presented recitals at prestigious musical gatherings, including the Hariballabh and Tansen festivals.

Sandeep Singh is the recipient of the Ustad Latif Khan Award from Ustad Alauddin Khan Sangeet Academy, Bhopal. Dr. Alankar Singh is an Assistant Professor of Hindustani classical Music in Punjabi University, Patiala. He is a disciple of the late Prof. Tara Singh, Madhurima Kishore and Pt. Ganesh Prasad Sharma, a disciple of Ustad Wajid Hussain Khan of Rampur Sahaswan Gharana. Dr. Alankar Singh, incidentally, is the recipient of the Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar Award for gurbani singing.

Accompanying Alankar on the tabla in the concert on Saturday was D. Chandrajith, disciple of Pt. Abhijit Banerjee. After an elaborate alap, which showcased the beautiful nuances of the raga, Sandeep Singh set out to play gat, jod and jhala in the tantrakari style. Alankar Singh’s gayaki was laced with sargams and bol-bants and bol-taans.

Executing meends in the melodic rendition of different raags, beginning with Shud Kalyan, a favourite of Patiala Gharana musicians, he presented a composition in vilambit ektaal, “Jab hee ghar aave,” followed by two compositions in dhrut of Pt. Ganesh Sharma — “Aayo re manmeet’ and “Eri aali aaj piyarwa’ to the accompaniment of dilruba.

A Punjabi composition in Raag Nand, also known as Anandi Kalyani, followed. “Toon tan saadi peed n jaani, jaani pausiyan panwa kaak udawa” in teen taal, presented a vivid imagery of the crow announcing the arrival of the lover as his beloved draws lines on the wall starting a countdown. Finally came “Man japoh Ram Gopal” — the much-awaited gurbani composition of Guru Arjun Dev (fifth) in raag Kanhada in Pad taal. The last shabd — ‘Mehrbaan, Sahib mera mehrbaan’ — in Bhairavi was a request of Pt. Janardhan.

The gurbani shabds were sung to the accompaniment of rabab by Ravinder Singh. Rabab is associated with the Sikh sacred music and can be traced to Guru Nanak Devji’s bhajans, almost 500 years ago.

Sarod maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan first spotted wife and Bharatanatyam artiste Subhalakshmi Barooah performing in Kolkata, but his romance with the art of Bharatanatyam began much earlier, a tale that hardly anyone knows.

“Rukmini Devi Arundale was my wife’s guru, but our association far precedes that. Her brother actually used to learn vocal music from my father in our hometown, Gwalior!” he says.

As Khan continued to court Subhalakshmi, tracking performance to performance in the hope of marrying her one day, his association with Rukmini Devi grew. Her spirit and unilateral passion for her art spoke to him, transforming Kalakshetra from his wife’s home into his very own.

Almost 25 years after their last visit to the campus, the family was back recently to perform on the familiar stage to pay tribute to whom Khan calls “a consummate artiste.”

It’s a stage that sons Amaan and Ayaan, who joined their father in this presentation, remember well, for a multitude of reasons. And yet, they say this show was “one of a kind.”

“My mother, who often does not travel with us for performances, is here with us. After all, Kalakshetra was her home for 15 years and the final performance of her career was on this very stage in 1985,” says Ayaan during a conversation before the performance.

They call it ‘the happiest of fates,’ as Subhalakshmi sits with her grandchildren, watching her two worlds merge. And while she no longer takes the stage herself, it’s the music of her family, Amaan says, she performs through. “An artiste is always an artist after all,” he adds simply.

And in the case of the Ustad and his sons, the artistry and the inspiration evolves from Subhalakshmi, as well as lessons learned over decades of practice, performance, and artistic evolution.

Speak to the three musicians and the nuggets of wisdom are endless. For instance, the veteran musician is often quoted saying: “As an artiste, it is not your job to be the best, but to be the most-loved.”

There’s also his rather unique understanding, passed on to his sons, that the audience functions as a messenger of the divine, conveying God’s appreciation and approval of one’s art through their love and sustained support.

“Talent with humility is what sustains us. We are here because of the love of our audience and it has allowed us to flourish,” says Amaan.

A product, no doubt, of the multiple global audiences that the family has cultivated over decades of propagating the sarod. Ask Khan, for instance, about his fondest memories of Chennai, and he waxes eloquent about the prowess of contemporaries and collaborators like the late Lalgudi Jayaraman and M.S. Gopalakrishnan, as well as the genius of legendary artistes that came before them.

“I have never thought of myself as a Hindustani musician, simply because, I belong to every God, every religion, and every aspect of sound across all waters,” says the maestro.

And there is another burst of nostalgia as he shares his most lasting memory of Rukmini Devi and the bond they shared.

“She was generous enough to host our wedding reception, Subhalakshmi’s and mine, under Kalakshetra’s famous banyan tree. It was a spiritual reception of blessings, with students chanting Sanskrit shlokas. After the chanting, Rukmini Devi turned to me and said, ‘if you wish, you can now chant your Arabic shlokas. I laughed in response and replied, ‘there is no need. I can feel your blessings already,” he recounts with a smile.

After seven decades of tours, workshops, residencies, performances, and over 20 self-composed ragas, the sarod exponent is now on a new mission, hoping to bring the world together through the power of seven, simple notes.

“Our new project, Strings for Peace, is a sarod and guitar collaboration with guitarist Sharon Isbin. It strives to preserve the essence of Indian and Western traditions so they can flow seamlessly into each other without artistic compromise,” informs Ayaan. The project is one of many upcoming ventures that the trio is working on.

“You see, people get caught up in the grammar, the technicalities of it all. You have let your craft metamorphise into the poetry that it is destined to be,” Ustad Amjad Ali Khan concludes.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/az9a4l/article30930484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FRUSTAD,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ustad-amjad-ali-khan-on-his-memories-of-rukmini-devi/article30930487.ece
288,2020/02/27,‘Madurai Mani could not have been a rude man’,"So said R.K. Shriramkumar about Madurai Mani Iyer, whose music reflected his personality

For three hours last Sunday, P.S. Higher Secondary School’s Vivekananda Hall was overflowing. Its 80-seat capacity proved at least 30 too few as rasikas squeezed into any nook available — on the window sill, around the dais, under door jambs — to drink from the inexhaustible chalice that is Madurai Mani Iyer’s oeuvre.

Madurai Mani Iyer, a prodigious talent, hailed from an illustriously musical family, publicly performed at the precocious age of 12 and reigned thereafter. But his music wasn’t just a product of heritage. He seems to have possessed the ability to deliver his music with an ear to the ground, the singular quality that makes artiste connect with rasika and thereby ‘transport.’

The Madurai Mani Iyer Rasikas Association gathers every so often in Mylapore, Chennai, to keep the Ganakaladhara’s legacy alive and fresh. In their special listening sessions, they DJ old high-quality recordings of the doyen with an aim to rekindle and re-enliven the past master’s music through critical and contextual analysis. And this time around too, the playlist was a gift that kept on giving.

The “people’s and pundit’s musician” that he was, the session showcased his mastery over both ‘arithmetic’ and ‘aesthetic’. Ultimately, his intent was bliss, or ‘aanandam,’ pointed out chief guest Vidwan R.K. Shriramkumar. Recounting some telling sarvalaghu phrases common to Mani Iyer’s style, the accomplished violinist admitted how challenging he would have been to accompany, in a nod to T. Chowdiah’s brilliance.

When Shriramkumar, himself an example of humility in excellence, speaks passionately about the importance of musical integrity and points to Mani Iyer as its paragon, you prime yourself to observe closely in the listening session that ensues.

Be it ‘Tatvam Ariya Taramaa’ in Rithigowla, ‘Manasu Nilpa’ in Abhogi, or ‘Durmaargachara’ in Ranjani, the vintage 78-RPM recordings, collated and preserved meticulously by dedicated rasikas, are real gifts for us in the YouTube age.

“Madurai Mani Iyer is a standing example for the adage ‘Sruthi-mata, Layah-pita,’” asserted Shriramkumar, addressing the misconception that Carnatic Music values pedantic correctness more than melodiousness. He challenged the audience to pinpoint a single instance of off-key singing in any MMI rendering.

Mani Iyer is known to have eschewed negativity in his repertoire. Shriramkumar went further to assert that he had an intrinsic capacity for happiness: “You can decipher his (soft and kind-hearted) personality from the music,” adding that “he could not have been a rude man.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/93pua1/article30930370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FRMADURAIMANIIYER,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/madurai-mani-could-not-have-been-a-rude-man/article30930372.ece
289,2020/02/27,"‘Unhide’, directed by Ramya Nambessan, asks questions about abuse, the male gaze and consent","The three-minute video, with dialogues in Tamil, features Ramya and Sshritha Shivadas

Actor-singer Ramya Nambessan turns director with a power-packed, three-minute video Unhide. Released a week ago on her YouTube channel, Ramya Nambessan Encore, the video with dialogues in Tamil, explains what consent is all about.

Powerful visuals of a woman dressing up shows her scrutinising herself in the mirror. As she tries to decide what to wear, she is plagued by questions. “Is my neckline too low? Is my hemline too high? Is my sari too revealing? Does my dress cling to my curves and bulges? No matter what you wear, someone will have a problem with it. It is time woman realise that the problem lies with the way men look at a woman and not with what you choose to wear,” says Ramya.

Written in Tamil by her friend and director of her next film, Badri Venkatesh, Unhide, sung and recited by Ramya herself, does not stop with a woman’s choice of clothing. It takes off from there to explain the importance of consent in any kind of a relationship, the abuse that women suffer and how it is upbringing that can bring about a change in the way a man perceives a woman.

“This has been in my mind for quite some time. Each time I heard or read about a woman being abused, I was dying to do something to express my outrage. As an artiste, I wanted to turn to the medium I am familiar with to express my angst and anguish. A poet might vent through her verses and so I turned to cinema,” explains Ramya.

Food for thought

She adds that in addition to creating content to entertain, she also wants her channel to have matter that makes people think and discuss contemporary issues. So she wanted to include music and videos that would provide food for thought for her viewers.

“I wanted the channel to be an outlet for my social responsibility as a citizen today. I think Unhide has reached out to people because of the positive feedback I have received. Ever since it was released, I have been getting compliments. While some said that it disturbed them, others remarked that it made them cry as they watched the different ways women are abused,” says Ramya.

Whenever there is some issue about a woman being molested or abused, it is the woman and her actions that come under the scanner, says an indignant Ramya. Pointing out that there are men and women who are guilty of trying to put the onus of responsibility on a woman when she is abused or molested, she says: “The questions range from why she was alone to what she was doing late in the night to why she was in a particular area and why she was travelling and so on. It was shocking to hear the accusatory tone in their voices. This video is also for those men and women.”

Man and society

She continues: “I want to tell them that perhaps the fault is with the way we have shaped the men in our society and brought up our sons. Perhaps, it is the way they see women that is wrong. Many a time, it is their upbringing that makes men view women in a commodified way. If parents teach their sons to look a woman in the eyes when they speak to her and see her as another human being, then perhaps this commodification of women might stop.”

Sshritha Shivadas | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

The visuals have been enacted by Ramya and Sshritha Shivadas. Shot at her home in Kochi and in the Kalikotta Palace in Tripunithura, Unhide has also been produced by Ramya.

“It was an impulsive project. I chose Tamil for the verses because I felt the emotions expressed would be more poetic and dramatic than in Malayalam. Since I cannot write poetry, Badri told me he would give voice to what I had in my mind and write the dialogues. He motivated me to go ahead with it. So once the lyrics were done by him, the same day I went to my brother Rahul Subramaniam’s studio in Kochi and completed the recording. The next day, we finished most of the shoot.”

Once the team saw the visuals, they were convinced that they were on the right path and went ahead with the shooting on the second day. Ramya hopes that the video proves to be an eye-opener.

“That is what made me create something like this with whatever resources and talent I have. I feel such conversations are the need of the hour. I am grateful that these spaces exist for us to talk about such themes,” she adds.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ghqkk/article30922221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvfRamya1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ramya-nambessans-vide-unhide-questions-abuse-the-male-gaze-and-consent/article30922223.ece

Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM) national convener R. Sundaram said here on Thursday that Union government should not sell profitable public sector undertakings like BPCL and units in strategic sectors like telecom and civil aviation to meet regular expenses.

“We prefer public issue of shares rather than strategic sale, since PSUs are like family silver. They must not be sold to cover fiscal deficit. The concept that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector is untrue. Corrections at the management level can improve the state of affairs,” he said.

Policies must be employment centric than GDP centric, since India has a working population of 90 crore. The SJM is focussed on improving the lot of small-scale industries as they generate employment and even aids in export. The Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement by 16 countries will adversely affect India on many counts as it will further increase the influx of Chinese goods, said Mr. Sundaram.

“Moreover, our dairy farmers will suffer if dairy products from Australia and New Zealand are imported.

293,2020/02/27,Farmers keen to shift to MD2 pineapple variety,"It can be easily processed and has more shelf life than dominant Mauritius variety

Pineapple farmers in the State are keen to switch at least a part of their holdings to the MD2 from the dominant Mauritius variety as the former fruits can be easily processed and have much longer shelf life.

The MD2 variety will encourage a shift in focus from fresh fruit consumption to processing and exporting, says veteran farmer Baby John at Vazhakkulam, the heart of pineapple country in the State.

Joe Jose Joseph, secretary of the Pineapple Farmers’ Association at Muvattupuzha, said farmers were given a presentation on the MD2 variety recently as part of the pineapple festival at Kalloorkkad. The presentation also dwelt on the advantages of the variety.

Mr. John said there is widespread interest in the MD2 variety. If at least 20% of the crop is shifted, there will be a marked difference in the business.

One of the problems for the farmers is the availability of suckers. T. Maya, scientist in-charge of the Vazhakkulam Pineapple Research Station, said Kerala Agricultural University had been developing tissue culture suckers since 2008. However, the cost was a factor that was keeping farmers away from buying them. A government package would be helpful for the farmers, she said.

Mr. John said apart from the price factor, tissue culture suckers are also too small for being directly planted into the fields. But shifting at least a part of the crop will help. The MD2 variety also helps mechanised processing and there is less waste as the skin and core are thinner, he said.

At the same time, the farmers think that the traditional Mauritius variety should be continued in part so that the fresh fruits business is not hampered in the future. The table variety from Vazhakkulam has a reputation across the country, Mr. John added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/farmers-keen-to-shift-to-md2-pineapple-variety/article30934349.ece

295,2020/02/27,KWA to even out city water supply during summer,"Kochi short of water by nearly 70 million litres a day

The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has decided to meet the increasing demand for water in the city during the summer months by evening out the distribution to all areas as any increase in the production of water is impossible.

With 290 million litres a day (mld) of water produced from the Aluva plant and 100 mld at Maradu, the city’s twin-river supply system was incapable of meeting the demand as the summer peaked, officials of the KWA said. Equitable distribution is sought to be achieved by halting the supply of water to one area and directing it to other areas in turn. This could lead to many areas in the city getting water only on alternate days.

Even as there is no shortage of water at present with the two rivers flowing at the usual levels, the government has proposed to take a few steps to tackle the situation in a few regions of other districts where the river levels are marginally low or the ground water level is not satisfactory.

In Ernakulam, the Periyar and the Moovattupuzha rivers can supply all the water that the city needs. However, the problem lies in the faulty system of distribution, sources said.

With the demand for water going up with the increasing temperatures and many new connections being given, especially in areas such as Thrikkakara, there is a shortage of water of nearly 70 mld.

However, Thripunithura, which gets its water from Moovattupuzha, is now much better placed, even though the people in the town continue to get water only on alternate days. This is because the distribution network is old and water fails to reach all areas when pumped.

Even though Thripunithura is getting almost 20 mld a day from the earlier 7-10 mld, it is unable to distribute it to all households.

In order to rectify this problem, changes need to be brought about in the distribution network for which Thripunithura division of the KWA has submitted a proposal. However, officials are not sure whether the project will be taken up any time soon.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kwa-to-even-out-city-water-supply-during-summer/article30932443.ece
296,2020/02/27,Workers in city bear the brunt of patchy implementation of job scheme,"Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme not generating enough jobs for beneficiaries

Half-hearted implementation of the State government’s Ayyankali Urban Employment Guarantee Scheme (AUEGS) by the Kochi Corporation means that beneficiaries and work days are scarce this year.

The action plan chalked out by the Corporation for the 2019-20 financial year set an ambitious target of providing 6,83,718 work days at a cost of ₹24.43 crore.

But Sindhu Unni, a resident of Palluruthy who has had an AUEGS job card almost since the scheme’s inception in 2011, said that this year, the ward’s 10 beneficiaries have not yet clocked in any work days. “I had around 60 days spill over from the previous financial year into April and May 2019. Work last year (drain cleaning) had been allotted only in March and we could not complete it before the end of the financial year,” she said. She is expecting a similar situation this year and is hoping that after the dry spell, worked would be allotted soon, before the end of the financial year.

The work had dwindled a bit after the AUEGS was merged with the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), which seeks to benefit the homeless and the landless, Ms. Unni pointed out. Assuming that PMAY beneficiaries participated in the construction of their homes, 90 days of wages at a rate of ₹271 per day was being provided to each beneficiary as an additional benefit after the two schemes were converged in 2018, said S. Subodh, AUEGS project officer for the State.

The convergence had switched the focus of the scheme from generating employment to disbursing funds to PMAY beneficiaries, said AUEGS officials at the Corporation. Each PMAY beneficiary is being given ₹24,390 after the third phase of house construction. Of the targeted crores, only ₹56 lakh, allotted by the State, was spent so far by the corporation this year, and a large chunk went to PMAY beneficiaries, they said.

People with AUEGS job cards, almost 90% women, are usually allotted work like cleaning canals, drains and ponds, and planting trees. This financial year, the corporation has provided 60,162 work days, out of which only 3,113 days were to AUEGS beneficiaries not linked to PMAY. Only 23 beneficiaries this year had received 100 days of work, mostly for cleaning school premises as per government order late in 2019, and for a few other cleaning jobs.

Despite ₹75 crore being laid out for AUEGS in the 2019-20 State budget, officials at the Corporation attributed the poor implementation of the scheme to a shortage of funds. “Additional amounts are allotted based on the percentage of utilisation of the funds given,” Mr. Subodh said. While ₹56 lakh had been disbursed by the State this year, none was given last year, the officials said. The 2020-21 State budget has hiked the amount for the scheme to ₹100 crore.

Around 6,130 people, including PMAY beneficiaries, have been given job cards under the scheme, but several were inactive, particularly in the central areas of the city where there were no active workers, the officials said. Of the 56 workers who had initially registered, only 16 were now active in Tharebhagam, said Preethy K. H., councillor representing the area.

Regular allotment of work could ensure people remained active, said V. P. Chandran, councillor representing Chambakkara. “The scheme is an important one for the State but the corporation has failed in its implementation. Funds will be disbursed by the State only if a percentage of already allocated funds is used up. The scheme could have been put to use for creating rainwater harvesting pits or even for solid waste management. But the funds now are going to PMAY beneficiaries and there is little job creation involved,” he said.

A.B. Sabu, who was, till recently, the Welfare Standing Committee chairperson, said that the scheme’s performance hinged on the willingness of workers. There were only around 300 active workers in the city, he said.

Ritty Sebastian, a resident of Nazreth near Mattancherry, has held a job card for six years and is all praise for the scheme which has brought several women out for paid work. But the wage, still at ₹271 per day — same as that under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme — with an additional ₹5 as transport allowance if workers are required to travel, is meagre considering high expenses in the city, she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/f9qf0r/article30926449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ki26labour,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/workers-in-city-bear-the-brunt-of-patchy-implementation-of-job-scheme/article30926450.ece
297,2020/02/27,When the drums speak,"The 10th edition of Keli’s Classical Rhythm series will unveil the evolution of indigenous percussion with its star performer, Mattannur Sreeraj

Showcasing the talent of prodigy turned seasoned maestro Mattannur Sreeraj, the Keli Classical Rhythm Festival 2020 brings to Mumbai a reverberant display of indigenous percussion in the vaunted Thayambaka tradition. Sreeraj’s honorific refers to Mattannur, the municipality in Kerala’s Kannur district that is known for its rich roster of performers classically trained in chenda, the ethnic drum that lies at the very heart of a Thayambaka recital. Over three days, Sreeraj will lead performances by improvising rhythm patterns to the beats provided by supporting percussionists. In the process he will gradually unveil the evolution of the art form itself.

Pillars of percussion

The son of the nationally reknowned Thayambaka doyen, Mattannur Sankarankutty, the 37-year-old Sreeraj has come into his own rather spectacularly in the past decade and a half. According to Ramachandran Keli, the prime mover behind the Keli cultural festivals he’s tirelessly been organising in Mumbai since 1992, it rivals the manner in which tabla exponent Zakir Hussain took the torch forward from his illustrious father, Alla Rakha. “Sreeraj is the genius of the century. Nobody can replicate or challenge his rhythms and the spontaneity and ease of his improvisations,” gushes Ramachandran. Sreeraj stands on the shoulders of other giants as well.

This edition, the tenth in the Keli’s Classical Rhythm series since 1999, is dedicated to the memory of yet another Thayambaka legend, Thrithala Kesava Poduval, who passed away in 1989, at a young age. According to the Malayalam writer Manoj Kuroor, who wrote a poem on Poduval, “He [subverted] the rigid conventional structure of Thayambaka and revelled in wild flights of imagination while performing on stage.” These are attributes more than shared by Sreeraj, a performer in the mould of Poduval, given to electrifying theatrics (‘throwing his stick into the air mid-performance’) and innovative beat cycles.

“In the arts of percussion unique to Kerala only the drums speak. There is no barrier of language or community. The beats, that lie within all of us, are arranged into patterns in all manner of permutations and combinations,” says Ramachandran. In the very first Classical Rhythm Festival, held in 1999 at the Horniman Circle Gardens in Fort, three traditional forms of percussion were presented, namely Thayambaka, Melappadam and Panchavadyam. Noted critic and writer Shanta Gokhale wrote, “Over five dozen players played as one, creating constantly changing sound patterns that rose up to greet the gods themselves. For me, the performance was like a rolling ocean of rhythmic sound, but for many it was clearly a reverberating call from home.”

Widening the canvas

Although the Keli festivals have been regularly courting audiences beyond the large Malayali diaspora in Mumbai, forms like Thayambaka remain lesser known despite being immensely gratifying to audiences who’ve experienced recitals first-hand. One of the reasons they haven’t crossed over into the national space, apart from sheer regional insularity, is because they’ve only recently (very gradually, from the 1970s onwards) emerged out of the temple premises in which they’ve thrived for centuries, albeit not necessarily as part of rituals.

Sreeraj’s first outing to Mumbai was during the 2007 festival where he was felicitated with the Promising Artiste of the Year Award. He and his brother, Mattannur Srikanth presented the Malamakkavu style of Thayambaka on the second day, following their father’s majestic opening-day act. His father’s performance — a seven-beat cycle called Adantha Kooru — will be emulated by Sreeraj on the first day of this year’s festival. Even if each day’s itinerary takes place at different venues across the city, from Nariman Point to Anushakthi Nagar to Nerul, the performances are thematically linked and should be savoured in succession.

Keli Classical Rhythm Festival 2020: February 28 at Y.B Chavan Centre, 6. 45 p.m.; February 29 at Anushakthi Nagar, 6.30 p.m.; March 1 at 7 p.m. at Terna auditorium, Nerul. Free entry on all days.

298,2020/02/27,Bhikhari Thakur: Voice of the marginalised,"Entertaining and thought provoking, “Bhikhari Naama” exposes the contradictions of the feudal system

Known as the Shakespeare of Bhojpuri, Bhikhari Thakur (1887-1971) was a playwright, poet, singer, actor-dancer and social activist. In recent years, contemporary theatre practitioners of Bihar have been showing keen interest in his life, art and times. A few leading practitioners consider him as the pioneer of modern Bhojpuri theatre, describing his style as Bidesia. Some compare his play “Gabarghichor” with Bertolt Brecht’s “The Caucasian Chalk Circle”. Arguably, Satish Anand initiated a keen interest in the theatre of Bhikhari Thakur, highlighting the elements of Brechtian theatre in Thakur's Bidesia. Sanjay Upadhyay is exploring the wealth of theatre music in the works of Thakur. More recently, Jainendra Dost has added a new dimension to Thakur's musical theatre with a sharp social satirical tone. Dost has written and directed “Bhikhari Naama”, which was presented by Bhikhari Thakur Repertory, Chhapra, Bihar, at the just concluded 21st Bharat Rang Mahotsav 2020 at Shri Ram Centre. A neat production, it entertained, provoked and brought to the fore the social contradictions of Bhikari's times.

Special focus

A Ph.D. in Launda Naatch tradition with special focus on Thakur’s contribution to the form, Dost is passionately involved in preserving and enriching Thakur's theatre and regrouping all those performers of Thakur's style and exploring his social concerns and their contemporary relevance. A founding director of Bhikhari Thakur Repertory and Research Centre, he has invited some veteran artists of Thakur's days to work at his centre.

In terms of format, “Bhikhari Naama” tends to be a docu-drama but beneath the comic surface the contradictions of a feudal system and its cruelty towards lower castes is revealed. While conceptualising the design of his production, Dost has retained the traditional style with accent on the epic theatre. Upstage a platform is formed which is occupied by folk instrumentalists and singers. On either side of the centre stage costumes are placed on stands, aesthetically. The main performer, who frequently steps out of the character of narrator to act as Bhikhari Thakur, changes costumes in full view of the audience. The instrumentalists and vocalists offer thrilling moments with the narrator playing the vital role in establishing a lively rapport with the audience.

The narrator takes us to a little known rural landscape of Bihar, providing us with vignettes of poverty-stricken families who are the victim of social injustice. Just after the birth of Bhikhari Thakur, the area is swept away by flood and with it the jhuggi of the parents of the newly born. After the flood recedes, the parents of the infant erect another slum. The narrator highlights the struggle for survival of the poor and the marginalised. He further tells the audience in a satirical tone, “You know about Thakur – the owner of landed property – not about Bhikhari – the beggar. Wait, Thakur also means barber, the landless low cast.” This is the milieu in which Bhikhari Thakur is born, brought up which shaped his consciousness. The narrator then reads out an official order of the Colonial period which says, “Lower castes are duty-bound to serve upper castes."" They are paid pittance, hardly enough to survive.

Now the narrator enters the character of Bhikhari Thakur, depicting his early life, his school days, poverty forcing him to stop attending the school, the torture inflicted on him by upper castes while doing arduous errand for them during odd hours. In this heartless world, Bhikhari comes in contact with a few kind-hearted people who develop his interest in reading and writing and local folk performing art. Abysmally poor, Bhikhari does what his peers have been doing — migrating to Calcutta for a livelihood, leaving his bride back home who keeps on waiting for the return of her husband. Out of this suffering of such young wives, Bhikhari evolves his theatre form known as Bidesia. Then, the narrator takes us to a new chapter in the life of Bhikhari that transformed him into a poet, social reformer and pioneer of a new art form in Bhojpuri.

Bhikhari's interactions with this ‘wonderland’ is painted in comic colour, manifesting curiosity, hope and exposure to new art forms, especially to Ramlila and then the greatest moment of his life comes – he goes back to his lovely bride, identifies with his people, their sufferings and mirroring prevailing social evils, composing new songs, singing before thousands of people to entertain, to make them socially aware as well as of their creative potential.

The members of the cast included old-timers like Ramchandra Manjhi, the recipient of Sangeet Natak Akademi Award. He brought spontaneity and mature artistry to the performances. Sarita Saaz, as the main singer and bride of Bhikhari Thakur, enthralled the audience with her soulful musicality. Jainendra Dost as the narrator and Bhikhari Thakur was the cynosure of all eyes.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/xvlaa2/article30931326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG4998,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/bhikhari-thakur-voice-of-the-marginalised/article30931327.ece
299,2020/02/27,Vinodhini Vaidyanathan talks about her journey in theatre,"Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, whose plays are coming to the city this weekend, says there is hope for theatre only if the audience comes looking for more than just entertainment

The two plays are at least five years old yet there is a buzz whenever they’re on tour. Vinodhini Vaidyanathan wrote Nadaga Express for The Hindu Theatre Festival in 2015, and Nagercoil Express even earlier for the Short+Sweet Theatre Festival. Now on a double bill tour, Nagercoil Expressum Nadaga Companyum, written and directed by Vinodhini Vaidyanathan, will play in the city on Sunday.

Vinodhini explains that both are now “larger in form and content. I’ve added more layers in terms of plot and theatre.” Originally Nagercoil Express was just a 10-minute play, “then I added two more characters for an Evam production in 2016-17.” For Nadaga Company, she has included many more forms including therukoothu. “Earlier the dance moves were choreographed internally. This time we made sure that we learnt the traditional therukoothu moves. Veteran artist Akkur Ezhumalai taught us and generously shared his repertoire of songs.”

Reading the list of the cast, one tends to stop with Alexander Babu and Bhargav Ramakrishnan. Ask Vinodhini about casting stand up comics, and she tartly points out there are “only two” and both have done theatre before. “Only in the last few years have they become popular stand up comedians. I see them as actors.” Another aspect is that both plays are social satires and comedies. “I want actors with good comic timing and an understanding of comedy in a script. Both Alex and Bhargav have this and that’s what makes them good stand up comedians as well.”

Mentors Gil Alon: The Israeli artist whose theatre I love. I worked on a play with him in 2007 and stayed in touch. Being part of his workshops changed how I look at being creative or how I approach theatre.

Na Muthuswamy: Founder of Koothuppattarai whose writing I try to emulate. His works are known for their absurdism and he was writing absurd theatre even before it was a thing in India.

Vinodhini has been an actor (theatre, web series and cinema), playwright and director. Cinema is not too complicated, she says, and explains why she casts herself in her plays: “It’s very rare that theatre actors get good roles with different groups. As an actor, I want to be on stage and explore as many roles as possible.” The roles in films are limited due to stereotyping, she rues. “I use the stage I create as an opportunity to put myself out there as an actor.” Which of these roles does she prefer? The actor, she says. But it is challenging to keep them separate. “I depend on my co-actors to bring in 180° feedback.”

Her preferred medium is theatre. On television, “I’ve done only one small show so I don’t even count that”, but accepts that OTT platforms are seeing some good work. She has worked with Sudha Kongara and SP Charan for two web series and the roles were “good, contentwise. People are willing to experiment, and the content is watched across the world. There is scope of actors who want to do good stuff.”

Live theatre, however, holds her heart. Vinodhini entered theatre 17 years ago; her first play with Magic Lantern was in 2003. There have been positive changes, she muses. “There is more exposure to live arts now. When I joined Koothu-P-Pattarai in 2006, theatre was still niche. Today, schools and colleges have drama as a subject and kids are open to working full time in theatre.” The flip side is that the economics haven’t changed. “People don’t want to buy tickets for a play; they ask us for free ones. But they will pay for a music show or stand up comedy.” She terms theatre as “more rewarding than watching a stand up comedian spout jokes,” but adds this “is only my personal opinion”. Speaking of which, she candidly admits that having Alex in the cast has helped sell tickets. “We sold out so quickly for some shows.” But she is not sure that this will happen always or with other shows. “It’ll still be a struggle,” she concludes. Theatre will pick up only when audience look for more than just entertainment. “Participative viewing is still an alien concept. We are better at being couch potatoes, which is why OTT platforms have boomed.”

Nagercoil Expressum Nadaga Companyum Starring Alexander Babu, Aravinth Sundar, Bhargav Ramakrishnan, Naresh D Raj, Shravan Ramakrishnan, Vatsan M Natarajan, Vikas M and Vinodhini Vaidynathan

Both plays are in Tamil and open to anyone over 13 years

On March 1 at Sitra Auditorium, off Avinashi Road

Tickets available on BookMyShow

Finally I ask if she has a dream role. “It is not a small role; always a small actor playing a role that makes it small,” she retorts. She is willing to play any role that “is given to me and punch it so that it stands out.” Her aim is not to overshadow other actors but “to think of what I can bring to the role and make it stand out in that scene.”",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/3bwf9j/article30930765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Vinodhini-Vaidyanathan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/vinodhini-vaidyanathan-talks-about-her-journey-in-theatre/article30930768.ece
300,2020/02/27,A delightful and lively concert,"Sanjana Rajesh of Upadhye School of Dance, Bengaluru, performed for the first part of Tamil Isai Vizha being held at Rajah Muthiah Mandram on the fourth day of the 45th anniversary series.

Sanjana Rajesh titled her performance as ‘Avardhana’, paying respects to the Brahma, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer. She began the programme with ‘Brahma sandhi kavutuvam’. She then went on to perform Pada Varnam ‘Paramashiva nanu paripalimpa’, by Panyam Seetharama Sharma, and Raga Dharmavathi. The Varnam had three sanchari, viz Nandanar Charitram, Kannappar Charitram and Sri Kalahasthi (episodes pertaining to Lord Shiva).

The Varnam did not only test the stamina of Sanjana but her training, skill, imaginative faculty to improvise and to successfully alternate between pure dance and abhinaya, all these came together, and it was a visual delight. She concluded the ‘Avardhana’ with an item on Lord Vishnu viz Venkatesa, and a fine Thillana.

The prime time was that of Embar Kannan, violinist and his disciple Rengapriya Shankaranarayanan, with Sumesh Narayanan on the mridangam. He started with Mallari in Pancharatnam (5 ragas) in Gambeeranattai.

His next song was ‘Tatvamariya taramaa’, on Lord Ganesa in Reeti Gowla by Paapanaasam Sivan, which set the pace of the concert.

His next selection, ‘Thaye Tripurasundari’ by Periyasamy Thooran in Raga ‘Suddhasaveri’, brought the Goddess of Thiruvanmiyur Marundeeswarar Temple, which is one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, to the memory of the audience. Kannan then went on to play ‘Arul seyya vendum’, by Koteeshwara Aiyyar in Ragam Rasikapriyaa, which was well applauded by the rasikas.

The main or rather a long song was ‘Devi Neeye Thunai’ on Goddess Meenakshi, by Papanasam Sivan in Raga Keeravani. It was played in its unique, meditative, calming character, bringing forth devotion and deep peace. This was followed by a brief Tani by Sumesh, who played the perfect foil.

Kannan also intermittently tried his voice to make the audience understand the instrumental music better. Other songs of the day included ‘Kanavendamo’ in ‘Sri Ranjani’ (Gopala Krishna Bharathi), ‘Adikondar’ in ‘Mayamalava Gowla’ (Muthu Thandavar), ‘Thamatham Thagathayya’ in ‘Mohana Kalyani’ (Lalgudi Gopala Iyer) and at the request of the audience ‘Chinnanjiru kiliye’ by Bharathiar. The concert was delightful and the duo were lively and the duration was used judiciously.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/npeg47/article30939366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28MDUVIOLINSKANNAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a-delightful-and-lively-concert-tamil-isai-vizha-madurai/article30935983.ece

302,2020/02/27,Compound wall of Adi Dravidar hostel remains with a wide gap,"Steps have not been taken to rebuild the collapsed portion

MADURAI

Adi Dravidar Hostel for Women in Chokkikulam, which comprises seven sections for school and college students, is yet to safeguard its premises, as a large portion of the compound wall, which has collapsed over a month back, lies along a channel on Gokhale First Street. The damaged portion of the wall is yet to be rebuilt.

A student, who does not wish to be named, says, “Several young women stay on the premises. It is a scary thought that anyone can enter the premises and steal our belongings or do something worse,” she says.

S.R. Kannan, a resident of the area, says it may be difficult for miscreants to enter the premises by crossing the channel that lies between Gokhale Road and the hostel. However, he says, there are places where the channel is narrow, allowing possible crossing.

A warden at the hostel says there is a strict curfew after 6 p.m. and all the students must be inside by then. They are not allowed to go outside even if they wish, she says, adding, “Our hostel is very secure and it is unlikely that anyone can enter it.”

B. Pandiaraja, member of Madurai District Vigilance and Monitoring Committee of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and Child Welfare Committee, says proactive steps must be taken by the administration to ensure safety of the inmates. “It becomes a necessity for the State machinery to ensure the safety of girl children. Though the complaint about the wall collapse came a month ago, action is yet to be taken. Security must be a basic prerogative,” he adds.

S. Dhanalakshmi, Adi Dravidar Welfare Officer, says the officials have taken cognisance of the issue and the work will be completed by March.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/6dd1tc/article30939357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28MDUADIDRAVIDARHOSTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/compound-wall-of-adi-dravidar-hostel-remains-with-a-wide-gap-madurai/article30935236.ece
303,2020/02/27,Minister inaugurates park with medicinal trees at Palani,"Announcement for this initiative was made in the Assembly in 2017

Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan inaugurated a park full of medicinal plants around Vaiyapuri tank in Palani on Thursday. The park which has a total of 78 varieties of medicinal plants was specifically inaugurated to serve pilgrims who come to Palani temple, he said.

The medicinal tree park was a move by the Tamil Nadu government to increase green cover in barren lands, the Minister said. “We have been taking initiatives to ensure that the State breathes cleaner air by planting more saplings. For late Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, inaugurated planting of 72 lakh saplings which will be completed by the end of the year. This is one more initiative by the government,"" he said.

The park spreading over an area of 0.4 hectares was formed after the announcement for this initiative was made in the Assembly in 2017 for a total of ₹30 lakh. By then, officials from the Forest Department had raised and planted a number of trees around the tank and on its bund.

Subsequently, they created a walking pathway for the public and created toilet facilities too.

The Minister said that the main aim of the project was to raise awareness about Siddha and Ayurveda system of medicines among the public.

“Palani is one of the abodes of Lord Murugan Since, it has several pilgrims who may practise traditional medicine, we hope the park is extensively used by them,” he said.

He added that researchers, school and college students should make use of the park.

The Minister also distributed 252 free cycles as part of the State government’s initiative for students of Class 11 at Dharmathupatti Government High School and inaugurated a photo exhibition of the achievements of the State government over the last three years.

304,2020/02/27,Fire at Dindigul dump yard rages on,"A blanket of smoke enveloped Palani Road leading to poor visibility

A fire that broke out in Murugabhavanam compost yard of the Dindigul Corporation on Thursday caused lot of inconvenience to the local people.

The fire that spread to over an acre caused a blanket of smoke that enveloped the Palani Road.

Senior officials said that the fire broke out as a transformer burst near the compost yard.

As of 8 p.m. four fire tenders- two from Dindigul, one from Palani and one from Oddanchatram- were pressed into service to contain the fire.

The corporation provided additional water supply when the fire tenders exhausted their resources.

A senior official from the corporation said that plastic, construction debris as well as biodegradable waste had accumulated in the dump yard for 50 years.

The first signs of smoke from the dump yard were noticed at around 3 p.m. when the call to the fire services was placed.

Murugabhavanam is located at the border of Dindigul town and Kurumbapatti panchayat where over 1,000 houses are located.

305,2020/02/27,Minister inspects removal of ‘seemai karuvelam’,"Minister for Khadi and Village Industries Board G. Baskaran inspected the work that is under way to remove ‘Seemai Karuvelam’ (prosopis juliflora) trees along the 42-kilometre stretch of the Vaigai running across Manamadurai and Tiruppuvanam, here on Wednesday.

District Collector J. Jayakanthan and Manamadurai MLA S. Nagarajan were also present during the inspection.

Around 20 earthmovers were deployed to remove prosopis juliflora from inside the Vaigai and the banks of the river. The removal of the wild growth of prosopis juliflora is part of the larger project of rejuvenating the Vaigai river.

Speaking during the inspection, the Minister said that the removal of wild growth will augment the storage capacity of the river and therefore help the farmers.

Mr. Baskaran also said that the recent announcement of linking of the Vaigai and Gundar river by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami was in the interests of the farmers. “The CM has allocated funds for the first phase of the project and Sivanganga farmers will benefit the most from this project,” he said.

The three subsurface dykes that were built across the Vaigai in the district have reaped benefits. After the recent rains, the subsurface dykes have helped in recharging the groundwater level for areas in 10-kilometre radius. This has ensured sufficient water for irrigation for farmers and has helped in addressing drinking water issues, the Minister said.

He said that the rejuvenation of irrigation channels of Periyar and Manimuthar is also under way.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bd169t/article30935151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28CLEANINGRMD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/minister-inspects-removal-of-seemai-karuvelam/article30935153.ece

307,2020/02/27,"Protesters condemn Central govt., police for Delhi clashes","They say their fight against injustice will go on till CAA is repealed

MADURAI

Hundreds of members of Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath staged a demonstration at Goripalayam here on Thursday, condemning the ruling BJP government at the Centre for ‘instigating violence against protesters in Delhi’ and blamed the Delhi police for failing to maintain law and order in the city.

The protesters raised slogans against the government and demanded the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah for the violence against the protesters.

“For the past 60 days, protesters have been raising their voice against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in a peaceful manner. However, the recent clashes in Delhi between anti-CAA and pro-CAA protesters since Sunday evening have claimed more than 36 lives and injured more than 150 people. Hundreds of shops were gutted and innocent people were attacked during the clashes. But, the Delhi police have remained silent over these brutal clashes and this shows the fall of democracy in the country,” said P. Abdul Rahman, State vice-president, TNTJ.

He also said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had proved that his government supported and instigated the violence against the protesters by failing to visit the injured and the families of victims.

The protesters also said that the violence promoted by the government would not weaken their fight against injustice.

308,2020/02/27,HC orders departmental inquiry into medical negligence case,"The case pertains to the death of a 22-year-old pregnant woman in Madurai

MADURAI

Taking a serious view of dereliction of duty on the part of a health official and an Inspector of Police in a case of medical negligence, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday directed departmental action against them.

The court was hearing the petition filed by S. Manimuthu of K. Pudur in Madurai, seeking compensation for the death of his 22-year-old pregnant wife M. Sakthikali in September last year due to medical negligence.

With the authorities concerned pointing fingers at each other for serious lapses, Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, who had earlier asked why the reasons for the woman’s death were not informed to the petitioner, observed that the officials were liable for the lapses.

The court directed the Deputy Director of Health Services, Madurai, to initiate departmental inquiry against the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) Multipurpose Health Supervisor/ Birth and Death Registrar. Similarly, the Madurai Commissioner of Police should initiate departmental inquiry against the Inspector of Police, K. Pudur, the court said.

The court directed the Madurai Commissioner of Police to hand over the investigation in the case to another Inspector, who should conduct the investigation as expeditiously as possible.

Taking cognisance of a government order issued by the Health and Family Welfare Department in 2018 on the rules prescribed for the minimum facilities of clinical establishments, which included staff and equipment, the court directed strict compliance of the rules.

If the required facilities were not available in any hospital, the officials concerned should not wait for the patient to reach a critical condition and then refer her to the District Headquarters Hospital or other hospitals where facilities were available.

After administration of first-aid, such patients should be referred to hospitals where necessary facilities were available with necessary caution, the court said, and directed the State to issue circulars in this regard.

In his petition, Mr. Manimuthu had said that his wife was admitted to K. Pudur Urban Primary Health Centre (UPHC) for her first delivery. After a check-up, the duty doctor assured him of a normal delivery and left the clinic. Within minutes, his wife experienced labour pain, he said.

There was no one to attend to her for hours except a nurse. Also, there was a delay in referring her to the GRH. A commotion ensued at the UPHC with the staff unable to deal with the situation. Later, his wife lying in a pool of blood, breathed her last, he said.

It was only after the intervention of the court that the death certificate was handed over to the family of the deceased. The court adjourned the case till the first week of June for hearing the progress of the departmental action against the two officials.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/yn27ov/article30939383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28MADURAIBENCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-orders-departmental-inquiry-into-medical-negligence-case-madurai/article30933928.ece
309,2020/02/27,Dedicated development plan must for Vaigai rejuvenation,"MADURAI

Several works of ancient Tamil literature have described the Vaigai as a perennial river which used to flow through the vast expanse of the Pandya kingdom.

But now, the river is slowly giving up to the onslaught of urbanisation in the forms of encroachments, mixing of sewage, dumping of solid waste and excess sedimentation after losing its link with tanks and channels.

Currently, Madurai Corporation is executing Vaigai Riverfront Development Project under the Central government’s Smart Cities Mission at a cost of ₹81.41 crore. Under the project, two check dams have been built across the river near A.V. Bridge to help in groundwater recharge.

As part of the beautification works along the riverbanks, the civic body has also proposed development of parks with walkways and bright lights at two spots. To decongest traffic in the core city, the Corporation and the State Highways Department are constructing a two-lane road on either side of the river from Arapalayam to Viraganoor.

Concerned residents, however, say these are additional projects aimed to supplement the exponential urbanisation at the cost of the river, rather than rejuvenating and restoring its natural ecology. They say there is a need for a dedicated development plan to revive the Vaigai and sustain its functional and cultural integrity.

Although officials promise that widening of roads on either side of the Vaigai will decongest traffic, environmentalists say it will lead to shrinking of the river.

A senior Corporation official says they are extending the width of the bund roads to 16 metres from the existing 7 metres after constructing a retaining wall. “We have received a ‘No-Objection Certificate’ from the Public Works Department and as the order, we are ensuring that a minimum river width of 220 metres is maintained. Also, the retaining wall will prevent the release of untreated sewage into the Vaigai – a problem that plagues the Corporation. The wall will also help in avoiding erosion along the riverbanks,” says the official.

A PWD official, however, says in the name of economic development and urbanisation, the width of the river has been reduced from 400 metres once to 280 metres now. This can increase the velocity of the water that flows in the river and can potentially lead to flooding of low-lying areas during heavy rains, says former PWD Executive Engineer S. Suthanthira Amalraj. In this context, he cites the case of the Kiruthumal, which shrank in width at several places because of intervention in the form of a development project and encroachments. Now it has changed from a ‘river’ to a ‘sewage channel’, he adds.

The construction of check dams, which is another component of the project, has helped in increasing the groundwater level in several areas, including Sellur, Ismailpuram, and Alwarpuram, says PWD Executive Engineer (Periyar-Vaigai division) T. Subramanian. “The construction of check dams has also enabled to divert water from the river to Mariamman Teppakulam through Panaiyur channel,” he says.

In a few years, the check dams will also help in improving the deposit of sand along the river, says Mr. Amalraj. “However, the non-perennial Vaigai is currently plagued because of sewage being discharged through tanks and channels. As a result, sewage stagnates and leads to mosquito breeding,” he adds.

With the dearth of open spaces in the city, construction of parks along the Vaigai is definitely a welcome move, says S. Ganesan, a resident of Narayanapuram. “It will help in restoring the lost link that people had with the Vaigai,” he says.

However, this project does not aid the task of resurrecting the river, say environmentalists.

S. Praveen Kumar, Project Executive, Water Knowledge Centre, Dhan Academy, says there is a need to follow the wisdom of our forefathers by restoring the traditional water systems. “It is important to understand that other than the Moola Vaigai, the river receives water from a chain of interconnected tanks and channels. Hence, maintenance of these tanks is important to ensure the flow of water into the Vaigai,” he says.

At many places indiscriminate sand mining has lowered the riverbed, while the supply channels remained at a higher elevation, says former Superintending Engineer of Agricultural Engineering Department R. Venkatasamy. “This issue also has to be addressed as supply channels become dysfunctional even when there is normal flow of water,” he says.

For a non-perennial river like the Vaigai, measures must be adopted to completely arrest mixing of sewage, says Mr. Amalraj.

Mr. Praveen Kumar says there is also a need to focus on developing and regulating land use on the riverbanks and restore the riparian rights to ensure continuous flow in the river.

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan says the civic body is taking all possible measures to arrest flow of sewage into the river. “We are constructing underground drainage (UGD) for 15 wards in the north of Vaigai river. Similarly, we are proposing to lay UGD pipelines in wards situated south of Vaigai. We are also building a sewage treatment plant near Panthalkudi channel, which drains into the Vaigai. These measures will prevent pollution of the Vaigai and help in its revival,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ta4qdj/article30939373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28MADURAIMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dedicated-development-plan-must-for-vaigai-rejuvenation-madurai/article30933445.ece

311,2020/02/27,Farmers see red as police enter meeting hall,"The incident happened during the grievance day meet held at the Collectorate

Entry of a police team into the meeting hall when the monthly grievance day meeting was being held at the Collectorate on Friday, incensed the farmers who were raising issues they were facing from an insurance firm.

At one point, they threatened to stage a walkout from the grievance day meeting when the police continued to remain inside the meeting hall.

As the meeting commenced with Additional Collector (Revenue) Vishnu Chandran in chair, the participant farmers raised the issue of the insurance firm that reportedly chased them away with the help of police when they had gone to its office premises on Victoria Extension Road, recently. Since the insurance firm, which has received the premium for crop insurance, is yet to disburse the benefits to the agriculturists after crop loss, the farmers had gone there recently to get explanation from them for the delay.

Moreover, the firm is also yet to link the farmers’ accounts they had with the rural banks, which is another reason for the delay in the online payment of insurance benefits.

“After taking the premium from us, the insurance company is chasing us away with the help of police when we went to their office premises to get information about the delay in the disbursal of insurance benefits. The meeting should discuss this issue first before taking-up the agenda,” the farmers demanded in one voice.

The official representing the insurance firm explained that they had not pressed the police to chase the farmers away. “Since the farmers had gathered there in large number, it caused a traffic snarl on the road and hence, the police, who had come to the spot on their own and without any information from us, moved the farmers away from the place,” he said, which prompted the farmers to raise their voice.

As pandemonium prevailed in the meeting hall for a while, the policemen, who would usually be deployed on the Collectorate premises, entered the meeting hall. The farmers got agitated, saying that the bureaucrats were attempting to stifle the farmers’ voice with the help of police.

“While the insurance firm is intimidating us with police force, the district administration is also threatening the farmers by inviting the law-enforcers into the meeting hall when we air our genuine grievances. Is it the sign of democracy or ‘police raj’?” the farmers started shouting even as Collector Sandeep Nanduri entered the meeting hall at 11.45 a.m. after attending a few functions scheduled earlier.

Pacifying the agitated farmers, Mr. Sandeep brought back normalcy in the meeting hall as the police left the spot.

The Collector informed that paddy had been cultivated on 15,329 hectares against the target of 18,500 hectares while cultivation of millets had exceeded the target as it had been raised on 63,579 hectares against the target area of 53,700 hectare, thanks to excess rainfall during north-east monsoon last year.

He also said the officials had collected 342 fertiliser samples and 581 pesticide samples for analysis to check the quality.

On the payment of insurance benefits, Mr. Sandeep said ₹2.14 crore had been paid in the accounts of beneficiary farmers during 2018 – 2019 and 76,494 corn farmers had received the benefits to the tune of ₹118.94 crore.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/4504bc/article30932532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28FARMERSTUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/farmers-see-red-as-police-enter-meeting-hall/article30932533.ece

Sixteen cows and two calves were charred to death and four other animals sustained grievous burn injuries when a fire broke out at the cattle shed of a farmer near Usilampatti on Friday morning.

The police suspect that electrical short-circuit could have triggered the fire in the shed owned by P. Manoharan (52) where fodder was dumped in large quantity.

Within few minutes after it was first noticed at around 10 a.m., the fire spread fast among the dry fodder. While the local people managed to set free some goats and few cows, they could not get near the spot where the other animals were kept tied.

Eventually, 16 cows and two calves were killed on the spot. A car that was parked in the shed was also gutted. Fire and Rescue Services personnel from Usilampatti put out the fire after struggle.

314,2020/02/27,Officers told to take steps to prevent water scarcity during summer,"App developed to help supply water through tankers in rural areas

District In-charge Secretary Maheshwar Rao on Wednesday directed the officers to take necessary steps to deal with drinking water scarcity during summer in Udupi district.

He was chairing a review meeting on development works in the district at the Deputy Commissioner’s Office, here.

Mr. Rao said that last summer, there was severe water scarcity in the district. Hence, steps should be taken to see that there was no drinking water problem till the end of May this year.

He directed Udupi Municipal Commissioner Anand Kallolikar to discuss with Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha before taking any decision to reduce the supply of water in the city. Steps should be taken to see that people did not suffer from drinking water problem, he said.

Mr. Jagadeesha said that an app had been developed to supply drinking water through tankers in rural areas of the district. Tahsildars had been trained to use the app during its trial, he said.

Mr. Rao said that a call centre should be opened to deal with the drinking water problem. The farmers living along the river course in the district should be told to adopt drip irrigation system instead of using water directly from the rivers.

He directed the officers of the Agriculture and Horticulture departments to hold a meeting with the farmers under the Deputy Commissioner and convince the farmers about it.

He directed the Health Department to take up more awareness campaigns to prevent the spread of malaria and other diseases. Steps should be taken to see that water was not allowed to remain stagnant at construction sites to prevent breeding of mosquitoes.

The municipality should amend its bylaws to impose heavy fines on building owners in this regard. A team of municipal officers should be regularly visiting the construction sites, he said.

He directed the officers of the Agriculture and Horticulture Departments to check if there could be any value addition to empty tender coconut shells that people throw after consuming tender coconut water.

The businessmen who came forward to do value addition to empty tender coconut shells should be given land to establish their firms and also subsidy, Mr. Rao said.

318,2020/02/27,Attempts made to push for bifurcation of existing train?,"Residents have long been opposing it

Attempts were reportedly being made by KRCL at the inter-railway timetable committee, being held in Bengaluru from Wednesday to February 28, to push for the bifurcation of the existing Bengaluru-Karwar overnight express and reject the new dedicated train announced by Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi.

Bifurcation of the existing train is being opposed by both residents of Karwar and Mangaluru region on the ground that it serves no purpose.

While the bifurcated train could just save 50 minutes of journey hours for Karwar people, it snatches the berth availability to Mangaluru passengers, they claim.

320,2020/02/27,KRCL puts the brakes on proposed Bengaluru-Vasco da Gama train,"Union Minister Angadi had announced the new service on popular demand

Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd., (KRCL), which has been accused by residents of the coast of neglecting the interests of Karnataka, has now objected to a dedicated daily special train between Bengaluru and Vasco da Gama, announced by Minister of State for Railways Suresh C. Angadi.

After efforts to get a speedy train towards Karwar were negated by KRCL, South Western Railway (SWR), on Mr. Angadi’s direction, proposed the special train from Yeshwantpur to Vasco da Gama, both of which lie under its jurisdiction. The general manager of a zone has the discretion to run a special train that does not normally require concurrence either from the Railway Board or the other zones.

SWR thought of doing away with KRCL’s concurrence, though the train has to pass through the latter’s network between Thokur and Madgaon.

KRCL Chairman and Managing Director Sanjay Gupta said that SWR did not consult the corporation before proposing the special train and hence the Railway Board has now put the decision on hold. “We were prepared to water and fuel the existing overnight express (Bengaluru-Karwar/Kannur) at Madgaon after it was bifurcated at Subrahmanya Road and operated via Padil bypassing Mangaluru,” Mr. Gupta told The Hindu.

However, KRCL on January 14 rejected SWR’s proposal of January 7 to bifurcate the overnight express saying it cannot water and fuel the train at Madgaon or any other station. KRCL does not have watering and fuelling facilities at any of its stations in Karnataka.

SWR’s January 30 proposal to run a bi-weekly train from Yeshwantpur to Vasco da Gama via Karwar too was cold-shouldered by KRCL. During the February 4 meeting at Railway Board, Shobha Karandlaje, MP, agreed for bifurcation of the existing train.

This has not gone well with the residents of the coast, who claimed that the bifurcation could reduce just about 50 minutes of travel time and was of no use. Upon their demand, SWR on February 10 announced the new special daily train.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/krcl-puts-the-brakes-on-proposed-bengaluru-vasco-da-gama-train/article30926002.ece
321,2020/02/27,"Fund houses should build buffer, says SEBI","‘Stress scenario requires cushioning’

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has suggested that asset management companies (AMCs) should keep a buffer of liquidity, especially for overnight funds and liquid funds, to deal with stress situations.

Speaking at a mutual fund conference, SEBI whole-time member G. Mahalingam said that while the regulator had nudged the industry to maintain a minimum buffer, fund houses should gauge the liquidity pressure in a stress situation and build a buffer across maturities.

“What I would wish is that the industry itself is going to operate on a cycle where it actually is able to gauge what is going to be the liquidity demands on stress scenario, and it is able to build up the liquidity buffer by building up a ladder of liquidity maturities,” Mr. Mahalingam said at the CII Mutual Fund Summit.

Also Read RBI lifts ban on Bandhan Bank network expansion

Past instances

This assumes significance as there have been a few instances in the past wherein corporates defaulted on their payment obligations and fund houses had to take a hit and were inundated with redemption requests.

In September 2019, the capital markets watchdog had made it mandatory for liquid funds to invest 20% in liquid assets.

The SEBI member also highlighted the nature of credit funds and said that investors needed to be told that there was an inherent risk involved in the product.

“I think it is the duty of the industry and the distributors to bring forth clearly this risk into perspective so that the retail investor does take a calculated call,” Mr. Mahalingam said.

Mr. Mahalingam, who was earlier with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), also made it clear that the capital markets regulator did not prefer fund houses to invest in structured products.

“It is better for the industry to keep a distance away from structured obligations, which really don’t make things very clear,” he said.

“I think it is for the industry to take a clear call on what kind of investment products that they would get in, which would actually give them a reasonable return, a good liquidity, and at the same time as safe risk proposition,” he added.

On a different note, he said that fund houses who are an important category of institutional investors should play a more proactive role in terms of enhancing the corporate governance levels in companies where they held stake.

He highlighted that mutual funds abstained on about 12% of the company resolutions and said that over a period of time this number should be brought down as much as possible.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nf1e1v/article30935478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/fund-houses-should-build-buffer-says-sebi/article30935479.ece
322,2020/02/27,Telcos seek help on ‘priority basis’,"Seek adjustment of GST credit in AGR dues, doing away with bank guarantees

Reeling under pressure to clear their adjusted gross revenue-related dues, telecom companies have sent an SOS to the government seeking measures on a ‘priority basis’ to facilitate reduction of financial stress in the industry.

In a letter to various government departments, including the Prime Minister’s Office, industry body COAI highlighted that banks were currently unwilling to take any risk with regard to the telecom sector and there was a need to give a clear message to banks that the government was there to support the sector.

Also Read SC hauls up telcos for not paying AGR dues

“The banks are constantly asking telcos to reduce their exposures by refusing to issue new bank guarantees or even to renew the bank guarantees,” COAI Director General Rajan Mathews said, adding that the requirement for financial bank guarantees (FBGs) to secure payment of licence fee should be done away with.

“However, if DoT is still of the opinion that FBGs are still required, then it should at least be reduced to one quarter’s license fee.”

The letter written to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash has also been marked to the Telecom Minister, Finance Minister, Principal Secretary, PMO, Cabinet Secretary, DPIIT Secretary, DEA Secretary and Niti Aayog CEO.

Also Read SC hauls up telcos for not paying AGR dues

On AGR dues, Mr. Mathews requested that as individual firms were stretching to make as much payment possible in a stressed financial situation, the government could adjust the GST credit due to the telcos from the government. Following this, the payment of the balance amount may be allowed in a staggered manner. “It is requested that a moratorium of 3 years be provided, as we expect that it will take at least that much time to recover the health of the sector, followed by a payment tenure of 15 years at a simple interest of 6%,” the industry body said.

As an alternative, Mr. Mathews said the government may consider granting loan equal to the AGR amount at 6% rate of interest so that the AGR liability may be discharged immediately.

COAI also reiterated its demand for reduction in licence fee, spectrum usage charges as well as rationalisation of universal service levy.

The industry body has also pitched for implementation of floor price for telecom tariffs April 1, 2020 onwards. “Floor pricing is imperative to ensure the sector is sustainable, and in a position to bear the deferred spectrum and AGR dues, while continuing to invest in world class networks and services,” it said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/qga8f9/article30935399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBUMOBILE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/telcos-seek-help-on-priority-basis/article30935400.ece
323,2020/02/27,"Not in sound financial state; can meet liabilities only with govt. support, says Vodafone Idea","It said adjustment of GST credit due from the government could help in meeting its AGR payment.

Troubled Vodafone Idea has written to the telecom department expressing its inability to pay full AGR dues unless the government takes urgent measures, including allowing staggered payment, reduction in levies and implementation of floor prices in the crisis-ridden sector.

The letter to the communications ministry comes at a time when the company is confronted with AGR dues of over ₹53,000 crore and has paid a mere 7% of its liabilities so far.

Warning that it is “not in a sound financial state”, Vodafone Idea said the company would be in a position to meet its liabilities only if the government initiates steps including allowing set offs for GST credit accumulated so far, and permitting staggered mechanism for payment of balance amount of interest, penalty, and interest on penalty.

It said adjustment of GST credit due from the government could help in meeting its AGR payment.

Citing its losses over last few years, the company said the financial stress in the telecom sector is widely acknowledged. The company underlined its current subscriber base of 300 million, and employee base of 10,000 direct staffers while making a strong plea for “urgent support from government“.

Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) said it can settle the balance of its self-assessed principle if the Centre allows set-offs of ₹8,000 crore worth of GST credit lying with the government.

In fact, the amount when fully set off will even pay in part the self assessed interest, it said in the letter to the telecom department seen by PTI.

The company has sought a moratorium of three years on payment of interest and penalty, and subsequent payment timeline of 15 years at an interest of six per cent.

Also Read DoT asks telcos to submit supporting documents

The letter, similar to the one written by industry body COAI, has also batted for grant of loan, equal to AGR amount at six per cent interest rate “so that the AGR liability may be discharged immediately”.

When contacted, a VIL spokesperson refused to comment on the issue.

VIL, in its letter, further pitched for reduction in licence fee to three per cent from the current eight per cent, and also sought reduction in spectrum usage charges (SUC) to zero or a uniform rate of one per cent for all spectrum.

Blaming the below-cost pricing of telecom services, compelled by competitive pressures as being the root cause of financial stress, the company sought immediate implementation of floor price in tariffs.

VIL said a floor price needs to be immediately made effective, say from April 1, 2020 to ensure that the sector is fully sustainable and in a position to pay deferred spectrum and AGR dues and still invest to create world-class network and services.

The company said the introduction of floor price will enable revenue of the telecom sector to nearly double from the current level of ₹1.75 lakh crore.

“Revenue of VIL is likely to touch the revenue levels which existed five years ago i.e 2015-16 and ensure that enough cash is generated to pay for deferred auction spectrum dues and deferred AGR payments of interest, penalty and interest on penalty,” it said.

VIL Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has in the past made it clear that the company will fold if it is forced to make payment of over ₹53,000 crore dues. Birla has held multiple rounds of discussions with the finance minister and the telecom minister over the last few days to explore options to keep the company afloat.

In all, as many as 15 entities owe the government ₹1.47 lakh crore — ₹92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another ₹55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

These dues arose after Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The Supreme Court earlier this month rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and VIL for extension in the payment schedule and asked them to deposit an estimated ₹1.47 lakh crore in past dues for spectrum and licences.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/i1791c/article30930947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VODAFONE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/not-in-sound-financial-state-can-meet-liabilities-only-with-govt-support-says-vodafone-idea/article30930948.ece

With the telecom industry plunging into a deep, unprecedented crisis, the association has raised an alarm over banks’ unwillingness to take any risk with regard to the sector, and asserted the “need to give a clear message to banks that government is there to support the sector”.

“Banks are currently unwilling to take any risk with respect to the telecom sector and are constantly asking telecom service providers to reduce their exposures by refusing to issue new bank guarantees or even to renew bank guarantees,” COAI Director General, Rajan Mathews said in a letter to Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash.

COAI has also said that the requirement of financial bank guarantees for securing licence fee payments should be done away with.

In case Telecom Department is of the view that financial bank guarantees are needed, the same should be reduced to one quarter of licence fee, as per the industry body.

COAI also sought an immediate cut in licence fee levy to 3% from 8% and reduction in spectrum usage charges.

Citing India’s low average revenue per user compared to markets like China, Brazil and Russia, it further said data prices in India are a fraction of those in markets are U.S., China, Germany, France and others.

“Therefore, floor pricing is imperative to ensure the sector is sustainable and in a position to bear the deferred spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, while continuing to invest in world class networks,” COAI said.

COAI’s letter, dated February 26, came even as Vodafone Idea has reportedly made it clear to the government that it won’t be able to pay court mandated AGR dues in entirety, unless a bailout is extended immediately.

In all, 15 telecom entities owe the government ₹1.47 lakh crore in unpaid statutory dues — ₹92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another ₹55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

Of the estimated dues that include interest and penalty for late payments, Airtel and Vodafone Idea account for about 60%.

These dues arose after the Supreme Court, in October last year, upheld the government’s position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fee to the exchequer.

The Supreme Court, earlier this month, rejected a plea by mobile carriers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for extension in the payment schedule and asked companies to deposit their past dues for spectrum and licences.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/puu9cf/article30929672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TELECOMSECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/coai-rings-alarm-bells-asks-govt-to-ease-terms-for-agr-dues-payment/article30929673.ece

326,2020/02/27,Apple to open 1st India flagship store in 2021: Tim Cook,"The Cupertino-based tech giant is currently selling its devices in India via third-party offline retailers and e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon.in.

Bullish on its growth in India, Apple is set to open its first branded retail store in the country in 2021, CEO Tim Cook has told shareholders.

Speaking to investors at the annual shareholder meeting at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on Wednesday, Cook confirmed the company will open its first offline retail outlet in the world’s second biggest smartphone market next year, reports Apple Insider.

“I don’t want somebody else to run the brand for us,” he was quoted as saying.

“We wouldn’t be a very good partner in retail. We like to do things our way,” the Apple CEO mentioned.

Apple currently has third-party reseller outlets to sell its devices in the country.

There are reports that Apple has leased a location in Mumbai for its upcoming branded retail store but the company is yet to reveal the location.

Apple’s exclusive online store is expected to start functioning in the third quarter this year. The Cupertino-based tech giant is currently selling its devices in India via third-party offline retailers and e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon.in.

Welcoming the government’s decision to ease the 30% local sourcing norm in single-brand retail (SBRT), Apple said last year: “We appreciate the support and hard work by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team to make this possible and we look forward to one day welcoming customers to India’s first Apple retail store.”

According to Navkendar Singh, Research Director, IDC India, Apple is known for its retail stores, the experience they provide in terms of purchase, staff knowledge and other services.

“Considering the importance of offline as a channel in a diverse country like India, where consumers love to touch, feel and experience the products, the stores are a very important touch-point for any consumer company,” Singh told IANS.

The plan for opening owned stores will certainly help Apple in giving a controlled experience of its devices and services as it intends and designed them to be.

“In a third-party retail environment, many such things cannot be controlled by the brand. This will only add to the strong premium positioning Apple enjoys in the country,” Singh added.

Apple reached a record 75.6% market share in the fourth quarter of 2019 in India owing to the stellar performance of iPhone 11 and price drop on previous generation models.

Apple’s India shipments grew by a healthy 17% in the calendar year 2019.

According to the International Data Corporation (IDC), in the premium ($500 or ₹36,000 and above) segment, Apple reached a record 75.6% market share.

Apple registered double-digit growth in India for iPhones in the holiday quarter (October-December period), Cook announced in January. Apple also registered a good growth in wearables in India.

The iPad 2018 model also helped Apple register strong growth in India in 2019.

Going forward, thrust on manufacturing high-end iPhones locally along with the first-ever flagship retail store would give Apple a booster in the price-sensitive smartphone market in 2020, according to industry experts.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/eck7io/article30327884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THAPPLEARCADE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/apple-to-open-1st-india-flagship-store-in-2021-tim-cook/article30929222.ece

The Indian rupee appreciated by 5 paise to 71.60 against the U.S. dollar in early trade on Thursday amid easing crude oil prices and weakening of the greenback in the overseas market.

Forex traders said easing crude oil prices and weakening of the American currency vis-a-vis other currencies overseas supported the rupee, while weak opening in domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows weighed on the local unit.

At the interbank foreign exchange the rupee opened at 71.65 then gained further ground and touched a high of 71.60, registering a rise of 5 paise over its previous close.

On Wednesday, rupee had settled for the day at 71.65 against the dollar.

On the domestic front, market participants will be keeping an eye on third quarter GDP number and better-than-expected number could extend gains for the currency, traders said.

The domestic unit, however, could not hold on to the gains and was trading at 71.67 against the dollar at 1004 hrs.

Meanwhile, investor sentiment remained fragile amid concerns over the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the global economy, forex traders said.

The death toll from the new coronavirus epidemic now stands at 2,744 in mainland China and there are now nearly 78,500 cases in total, according to the National Health Commission.

Domestic bourses opened on a negative note on Thursday with benchmark indices Sensex trading 289.66 points lower at 39,599.30 and Nifty down 87.45 points at 11,591.05.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net sellers in the capital market, as they sold shares worth ₹3,336.60 crore on Wednesday, according to provisional exchange data.

Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, fell 1.12% to trade at 52.83 per barrel.

Market benchmark Sensex dropped over 200 points in opening session on Thursday as incessant foreign fund outflow and coronavirus overhang weighed on global investor sentiment.

The 30-share index dropped 202.44 points, or 0.51 %, to 39,686.52, while the NSE Nifty fell 62.75 points, or 0.54 %, to 11,615.75.

Top losers in the Sensex pack included HCL Tech, HDFC Bank, TCS, M&M, IndusInd Bank, Sun Pharma, ICICI Bank and Reliance Industries.

On the other hand, Titan, NTPC, Nestle India and Kotak Bank were trading with gains.

In the previous session, the Sensex settled with a loss of 392.24 points, or 0.97 %, at 39,888.96, and Nifty plummeted 119.40 points or 1.01 % to end at 11,678.50.

According to analysts, intense spread of coronavirus is pushing investors away. There is sharp foreign fund outflow led by strong dollar index, as investors reduce their exposure to emerging markets amid global uncertainty.

On a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth ₹ 3,336.60 crore, while domestic institutional investors bought shares worth ₹ 2,785.67 crore on Wednesday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

Stock exchanges in Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo were trading with losses, while bourses in Shanghai were positive.

329,2020/02/27,Debating water quality,"The competitive politics of Delhi election has brought the issue of drinking water to centre stage

A significant outcome of the controversy surrounding the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) report of November 2019 on drinking water status is that the issue of water quality has got politically prioritised. The fact that water should be treated as an urgent concern for public health and the ecosystem of the country cannot be denied. The threats to human health due to poor water quality, except when they appear as an epidemic, are largely imperceptible. This generally subjects the population to subtle health problems without its knowledge or consent.

The controversy started with the release of the BIS report for 21 major Indian cities, in keeping with the objectives of the ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’, which aims to provide safe piped water to all households by 2024. The study is scheduled to cover all districts in the country within a year. Supply of potable water obviously requires first compilation of information on the existing status. The fact that drinking water in Delhi was ranked the most unsafe, as the samples failed in 19 out of 28 parameters, was challenged by the Government of Delhi and the Delhi Jal Board (DJB).

India is on the throes of a severe water crisis, not only because of a gradual reduction in per capita availability of water due to a rising population, but also because of rising and unchecked pollution in the country’s rivers and water bodies, a fact which is mostly overlooked in the deliberations on water resources management.

As per published estimates of the Central Pollution Control Board, the country has a treatment capacity of only about 30% of sewage generated in the major cities, not to talk of other urban and rural areas where the sewage finds its way to local water bodies or rivers without treatment.

Impending water stress

A 2018 Report of the NITI Aayog has observed that currently 600 million Indians face high to extreme water stress and about two lakh people die every year due to inadequate access to safe water. The crisis is only going to get worse. By 2030, the country’s water demand is projected to be twice the available supply, implying severe water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people.

In Delhi, according to the Census 2011 data, there are about 33.41 lakh households of which 27.16 lakh households, i.e, 81.30%, are provided water through a piped supply system. However, only 75.20% of the households are supplied treated water. The treatment method is conventional — involving sedimentation, filtration and disinfection through chlorine and chloramine — whose effect is contingent upon the overall quality of water. For the water coming from the Yamuna released from Haryana, the DJB has to often stop the supply for a few days if the concentration of methane goes up beyond a certain level. This is because the tri-chloromethane that may be produced during the disinfection process is highly carcinogenic. The effect may surface on human health not immediately, but over a period of time.

The capital’s high pollutant load

Moreover, Delhi, which constitutes less than 1% of the total catchment of the Yamuna, contributes more than 50% of total pollutant load in the river, discharged over the 22 km-stretch between the Wazirabad and Okhla barrages. Delhi has 7,000 km of sewer line as on date, against a requirement of 24,000 km. The 17 sewage treatment plants being operated by the DJB are able to take care of not more than 30% of sewage treatment. There is no sewerage system at all for over 45% of the population in unauthorised and even regularised colonies and rural areas. As of now, there are 18 major drains carrying sewage, garbage and industrial effluents into the Yamuna.

It is not only the untreated sewage water and industrial effluents, but also the solid wastes and construction material discharged by individuals, companies and municipal bodies that have caused the suffocation of the Yamuna. Also, floodplains have been encroached upon by settlements. Hence, ensuring supply of quality drinking water is not only expensive, it also needs improvement in governance. It needs technical knowledge on measurement and regulation of water quality. It is not the fault of the DJB or the Delhi government alone that they have not been able to ensure 100% supply of quality water to the citizens of Delhi, considering the constraints they face, especially those concerning the water resources management and laws in the country.

We must appreciate that the Jal Jeevan Mission, even if it has not been so far structured, conceptualised and funded adequately, has begun the important work of gathering information on the scale and scope of the problem and making it available in an open and transparent manner. The best outcome is that the competitive politics of the Delhi election has ensured a political debate on water quality.

330,2020/02/27,"When a court pronounces a verdict, without giving reasons","Non-speaking orders undermine judicial integrity

In a highly unusual move, a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court resorted to a non-speaking order as it ruled affirmatively on the preliminary issue arising out of the Sabarimala review petition.

The importance of a ‘reasoned decision’ in a constitutional democracy committed to the rule of law, besides being self-evident, cannot be overstated and this curious departure from the norm merits close analysis.

Time and again, the Supreme Court has unequivocally endorsed and underlined the requirement of giving reasons in support of an order. It has often chastised subordinate institutions for their failure to supplement their orders with reasons.

Juristic basis

The juristic basis for this has also been explored in a number of cases. In various decisions, the court has ruled that speaking orders promote “judicial accountability and transparency”; “inspire public confidence in the administration of justice”; and “introduce clarity and minimise the chances of arbitrariness”. In addition to being a “healthy discipline for all those who exercise power over others”, recording of reasons has been described by the Supreme Court as the “heartbeat of every conclusion”; the “life blood of judicial decision making”; and a cherished principle of “natural justice”. In his dissenting opinion in the Madhya Pradesh Industries Ltd case, Justice Subba Rao K. stated: “The condition to give reasons introduces clarity and excludes or at any rate minimises arbitrariness; it gives satisfaction to the party against whom the order is made; and it also enables an appellate or supervisory court to keep the tribunals within bound... A speaking order will at its best be reasonable and at its worst be at least a plausible one.”

The need for a court to provide an intellectual substrate for its decisions is also implicit in the expression “pronounce judgment” in Supreme Court Rules, 2013. According to settled decisions, the same signifies “judicial determination by reasoned order”. However, when it came to applying the principle to its own verdict, the apex court has inadvertently devalued the importance of concurrent reporting of reasons. The court seems to have downplayed the fact that it may be coming across as inarticulate at best and indecisive at worst. Besides undermining institutional integrity, a decision’s authority as a binding precedent is also potentially compromised by this omission.

Culture of justification

The term “transformative constitutionalism” has recently found currency in constitutional adjudication (Navtej Johar and Joseph Shine). The Supreme Court is yet to articulate a comprehensive theory of the concept but it has been fleshed out in other jurisdictions. For example, Pius Langa, former Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of South Africa, argued that “transformative constitutionalism” entails a transformation of legal culture from one “based on authority” to the one “based on justification”. Karl Klare (the scholar who coined the term) posited that it may be legitimately expected of constitutional adjudication to “innovate and model intellectual and institutional practices appropriate to a culture of justification”.

In the light of the above, it can be concluded that the practice of issuing non-speaking orders and giving post-hoc rationalisations later is an anathema to the principle of constitutional governance. Duty to give reasons is an incident of the judicial process and constitutional justice should not be a matter of afterthought.

331,2020/02/27,"Still no finality, the third time round","There are indications that the new Bodo accord does not spell closure of the statehood movement by Bodo groups

The experiment of power sharing and governance under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution was expected to be the panacea of the ethno-nationalist identity questions in Northeastern States. Euphoria as well as anger over the third Bodo Accord have, however, held the mirror reflecting the complexities of exclusion of communities in such ethno-centric power sharing and governance model.

The new Accord signed by the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU), United Bodo People’s Organisation and all the four factions of the insurgent outfit- National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) with Delhi and Dispur on January 27 promises more legislative, executive and administrative autonomy under the Sixth Schedule to Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) and expansion of the BTC territory in lieu of statehood. The Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD), the autonomous region governed by BTC, will be known as Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) after demarcation of the augmented territory.

The previous Bodo Accord signed by the erstwhile insurgent outfit, Bodo Liberation Tigers (BLT) with Delhi and Dispur on February 10, 2003 led to creation of the BTC as a new experiment of territorial autonomy under the Sixth Schedule. However, the constitutionally mandated legislative power of the BTC has been reduced to a farce as the Assam Governor has not given assent to any of the legislations passed by the BTC Legislative Assembly.

Activating faultlines

Bodo groups have suspended their statehood movement, but the new Bodo Accord has triggered the intensification of the movement for Kamatapur State by organisations of the Koch-Rajbongshi community. The territory of the demanded Kamatapur State overlaps with the present BTAD, proposed BTR and demanded Bodoland. Clamour for Scheduled Tribe (ST) status by the Koch-Rajbongshis, Adivasis and several other non-ST communities has also grown.

Deeper ethnic faultlines in an ethno-centric power sharing model will become exposed when the Koch-Rajbongshis and the Adivasis are granted ST status, as promised by the Modi government. For, the reservation of seats of BTC is for the STs and not exclusively for the Bodos. The new accord has no clear answer to such critical questions.

Also Read Accord drives divide in Assam’s Bodo domain

In BTAD, the ST communities account for 33.50% of the total population; 2011 Census figures show that of the total 31,51,047 population in the BTAD, the ST population is 10,55,732. The Bodos account for over 90% of the ST population in the BTAD. The ST populations are an overwhelming majority in territories overseen by nine other autonomous councils under the Sixth Schedule in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura.

Such a demographic composition in the BTAD has allowed the space for political mobilisation of other non-Bodo communities and articulation of the campaign that the BTC is a faulty model as it allows the minorities to govern the majorities. The organisations of these communities have been demanding exclusion of villages with less than 50% Bodo population from the BTAD. Bodo organisations have a counter argument that non-Bodo is a political identity construction articulated to capture power in the BTAD by certain political forces. The new accord promises to increase the current strength of BTC to 60 from 40 but “without adversely affecting the existing percentage of reservation for tribal[s]”.

The new accord promises to appoint a commission by the Assam government to look into the demands for inclusion of villages with ST majority and contiguous to the BTAD, and exclusion of villages which are contiguous to non-Sixth Schedule areas and have majority non-ST population. However, the core area of the BTAD will continue to have many villages with majority non-ST population which were included for contiguity.

Also Read Karbis against ST status for hill Bodos in Assam

Framers of the Constitution perceived such complexities and prescribed constitutional provisions after elaborate debate in the Constituent Assembly on the Sixth Schedule. One such provision is the setting up of autonomous regions. Sub-paragraph 2 of the first paragraph of the Sixth Schedule provides that, “If there are different Scheduled Tribes in an autonomous district, the Governor may, by public notification, divide the area or areas inhabited by them into autonomous regions.” However, constitutional amendments were made following the previous Bodo Accord to ensure that this provision shall not apply in respect of the BTAD.

The erstwhile Pawi-Lakher Regional Council was the only regional autonomous council in the country. Following upgradation of the then Lushai Hills district of Assam into a Union Territory in 1972, the Mizo District Council was abolished. In 1972, the Pawi-Lakher Regional Council was trifurcated first into three regional autonomous councils. These three councils were later upgraded to full-fledged Autonomous District Council under Sixth Schedule in the State of Mizoram.

The provision of setting up regional autonomous councils under the Sixth Schedule can be explored to create the space for communities aggrieved by exclusion from the power-sharing model of BTC.

Pivot of mobilisation

Euphoria among the Bodos over the accord is also fast evaporating with efforts to unite all the four factions of NDFB having turned futile; the factions are divided in two camps: one group with the present ruling party of BTC-Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), an ally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in Assam and one group siding with the opposition party, the United Peoples Party Liberal backed by the ABSU. The new accord will be the pivot of political mobilisation in the BTAD during the forthcoming BTC elections due in April.

A shift in the political equilibrium in the BTC resulting from a likely expansion of the ST list in Assam has the potential to keep the Bodos out of power in the BTC and push Bodo organisations to reviving their homeland demand. Peace will continue to be fragile in Assam’s Bodo heartland until an all-inclusive power sharing and governance model is evolved under the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.

332,2020/02/27,Signs and substance: On outcome of Trump visit,"PM Modi must leverage his rapport with President Trump to clinch the trade deal

President Donald Trump’s India visit can easily be cleaved into two separate parts: the symbolism of the joint rally with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with their obvious personal rapport, and the actual bilateral outcomes of their Delhi meeting. On the former, it is clear that the public address at Ahmedabad’s Sardar Patel Stadium reflected an unprecedented relationship between the leaders of India and the United States, with each expressing admiration of the work they had done in their own countries. Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Modi as a “true friend”, and a “tremendously successful leader”, who he credited with India’s progress. A day later he described Mr. Modi as “a very religious man… a very calm man, but a very, very strong person”. Mr. Modi in turn complimented Mr. Trump for his leadership, and thanked Mr. Trump’s family for what he described as a historic visit that will open a new phase. The invitation to Mr. Trump was in itself a political endorsement, given that it came in an American election year, months after Mr. Modi referred to the slogan “Abki Baar Trump Sarkar” at his Houston rally. Mr. Modi would have been particularly pleased on three counts: with Mr. Trump’s refusal to speak about restrictions in Kashmir, about the arson over the CAA that darkened Delhi’s skies even as the two leaders met, and Mr. Trump’s endorsement of Mr. Modi’s belief in “religious freedom”. This was some relief given earlier briefings by U.S. officials that these would be raised.

In contrast, the visit’s concrete outcomes were not as dramatic or historical as the Trump-Modi rally images were. Although the External Affairs Ministry had said at least five MoUs would be ready for signing, the three made ready were two on health care, and one Letter of Cooperation on LNG pipeline infrastructure. There were a few major deals signed around the visit as well, and at least two that had been expected could not be completed — the conversion of an MoU for Petronet to invest in American gas company Tellurian into an agreement, as well as a commercial agreement for Westinghouse to build six nuclear reactors in Andhra Pradesh. The agreement signed for defence purchases worth $3-billion, including American helicopters, has led to both sides signalling more cooperation in defence, military exercises and technology sharing. And while the two leaders shared strong language in references aimed at China’s hegemony in the South China Sea as well as the Belt and Road Initiative, they did not broach the next steps in the Indo-Pacific partnership including possible militarisation as well as joint funding to counter the challenge from Chinese loans in the region. The two governments must now strive to complete the unfinished agreements and set the course for their newly designated ‘Comprehensive Strategic Global Partnership’. More immediately, with the political backing of both leaders, negotiators must move towards the much anticipated yet elusive trade deal.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/signs-and-substance-the-hindu-editorial-on-outcome-of-donald-trump-visit/article30925379.ece
333,2020/02/27,Sex and power: On Harvey Weinstein conviction,"Weinstein’s conviction is a vindication of the #MeToo movement around the world

Former Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been convicted of two felony sex crimes and potentially faces 29 years in prison. His New York courtroom trial, during which six women testified that he assaulted them, was a touchstone for the global #MeToo movement and for holding powerful, wealthy men accountable for the sexual harassment and assault of women. The prosecution’s case was tricky because, given the length of time that had passed since the alleged incidents, there was a lack of physical and forensic evidence that might have supported the allegations against Mr. Weinstein. As a result, the trial became a painful struggle for the survivors to prove their credibility. Matters were complicated by some of the survivors acknowledging having had consensual sex with him after being attacked by him, which gave the defence opportunities to argue that the women had wanted to further their careers. However the survivors, including a production assistant who said he had forced her to have sex in 2006, and a former actress who said he had raped her at a hotel in 2013, said that he was a predator whose premeditated actions included not only the attacks on the survivors but also attempts to leverage his power over their professional lives to buy their silence. While he was ultimately found guilty of a criminal sex act in the first degree and of rape in the third degree, he was acquitted of the more serious charges of predatory sexual assault involving two other women.

The Harvey Weinstein story | From studio to courtroom in 40 years

The #MeToo movement was kicked off in 2006 by activist Tarana Burke as a battle against traumatic, widespread and under-reported incidents of assault on women, in many — but not all — cases in the workplace. While it began in Hollywood and mostly in the U.S., it spread like wildfire and reverberated through India too. Soon, social media platforms became the means for women to tell their stories about high-profile men, specifically allegations of sexual impropriety detailing the alleged acts, and naming the men involved publicly. The outpouring of stories of abuse — often by multiple accusers for one man — centred on men of considerable professional standing in India. In many cases the accused person was fired or resigned, or, less often, has filed a lawsuit alleging defamation.

334,2020/02/27,State stands 15th in digitisation of land records,"The list is led by Madhya Pradesh

Karnataka stands 15th in the Land Records and Services Index (N-LRSI 2020) released in Bengaluru on Thursday by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER).

Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu have emerged as the top 5 States in the index. Gujarat occupies the 19th place.

The N-LRSI assesses the extent of digitisation of land records and the quality of these land records in the States and UTs of India.

Karnataka’s digitisation is at 40.9% while that of Madhya Pradesh is 74.9%.

As per an NCAER statement, the N-LRSI is an integral part of the NCAER Land Policy Initiative (NLPI) launched in 2019 with the aim of filling the gaps in economic research, policy analysis, and systematic data on land.

“Access to land is a critical factor for economic growth and poverty reduction. For government, industry, and citizens to be able to use this asset effectively and to minimise disputes, it is important to have access to reliable land and property records,” said the report.

According to Dr Shekhar Shah, Director General, NCAER, N-LRSI aims to understand the extent of this progress and existing gaps, and to identify measures to improve land records in each State.

The 2020 N-LRSI is based on data collected over 2019-20 on two aspects of the supply of land records — the extent of digitisation of land records and the quality of these land records. The first component, which aims to assess whether a State has made all its land records digitally available to citizens, looks at three dimensions: the text of the land records (also called the record of rights), the official map associated with a land record (also called cadastral maps), and the property registration process.

NCAER is part of the Property Rights Research Consortium, a multi-institution research consortium.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/state-stands-15th-in-digitisation-of-land-records/article30935696.ece
335,2020/02/27,Doctor dies after coming under wheels of BMTC bus at Bengaluru’s Shantinagar,"He tried to get off the moving vehicle

A young doctor working in Chamarajanagar, who had come to Bengaluru to enquire about higher education courses in the city, fell under the wheels of a moving BMTC bus at Shantinagar bus stand on Thursday.

The deceased, Dr. Andanur Chinthan, 26, hails from Davangere. He had completed his MBBS in Mysuru and was working as a tutor with the department of pathology at the Chamarajanagar Institute of Medical Sciences, said the police.

Witnesses told the police that Chinthan boarded the bus around 2.45 p.m. “He wanted to go to Majestic. When he boarded, he asked the conductor whether the bus would stop there. When she said that it wouldn’t as it was headed towards Shivajinagar, he tried to get down,” said a police officer.

By then, the bus had started moving. He slipped and came under the rear wheels of the bus. When they realised what had happened, passengers on board immediately alerted the bus driver and got him to stop.

“They rushed out but it was too late. The wheel had crushed his head and he died on the spot,” the police officer added.

BMTC officials said that the bus driver had driven for a few metres when Chinthan enquired about his stop with the conductor. “The passenger tried to get down from the moving bus and fell.”

Based on a complaint filed by a witness, Basavaraj, the Wilson Garden police have booked BMTC driver Thayanna for death due to negligence. “He started driving without ensuring that the doors were closed, which led to the accident,” the senior police added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hhweiy/article30939500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGANANDURCHINTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/doctor-dies-after-coming-under-wheels-of-bmtc-bus/article30935247.ece
336,2020/02/27,BIFFes off to a rough start,"Passes for the film festival issued at the last minute, resulting in fans missing several shows

Chaos and confusion marked the first day of the twelfth edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival (Biffes), which opened at Orion Mall on Thursday. For the first-half, attendees were not watching films, but trying to get their delegate passes.

Though fans had to book their passes online on the ticket booking platform BookMyShow.com, they still had to collect physical copies at the venues. The passes were to be issued from February 22 onwards, but that did not happen.

The anger was palpable as over 500 people had reportedly made a trip to Orion Mall on Wednesday to collect the passes, but returned empty-handed.

Muralidhar K., a Biffes regular and a film enthusiast, said, “The organisers should have at least informed us of the situation in advance. I travelled all the way across the city on Wednesday for no reason.”

As a result, there was chaos at the ticket counters on Thursday morning with thousands of people trying to collect their passes. As the crowd became increasingly irate over the mismanagement, organisers were compelled to acknowledge the problem and apologise to film enthusiasts.

Sunil Puranik, chairman of the Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, told irate delegates that BookMyShow was supposed to open its counter on Wednesday to issue passes. “Unfortunately, they didn't, and that's why there’s such a crowd today.”

Everyone who came to collect passes early had to wait for a long time and missed some of the shows. Delegates taking objection and engaging in a war of words with Mr. Puranik played out all through the day.

Schedule and catalogue not available

To make matters worse, the schedule and catalogue for the festival were not available till late Thursday evening. Pradeep Kumar B.M., Managing Director, Adarsha Film Institute, who had come with a team of around 50 students, said that with neither schedule nor the catalogue readily available, it had become very difficult to decide what films to watch.

Mr. Puranik had a tough time placating him. Later in the day, he held a press conference and apologised for the chaos at the festival. “We have organised the festival in a short time of 48 days following my appointment as the chairperson. We have done our best in the available time. But we acknowledge the inconvenience caused and apologise,” said Mr. Puranik.

He attributed most of the confusion to online booking and issuing of passes by BookMyShow.com. “We tried something new only to ensure we become a plastic-free festival, but it backfired. The portal took an inordinately long time to print passes. They had assured us that they would issue passes a few days before the festival. However, they began doing so only on Thursday morning at the venue, which led to the chaos and confusion. We will seek an explanation from them,” he said.

Need for a permanent festival directorate

Regarding the delay in the availability of catalogue and schedule, Mr. Puranik said the cause of all the confusion at successive festivals is the lack of a permanent festival directorate.

N. Vidyashankar, Artistic Director, Biffes, who was at the press conference, said, “I am not part of the government and work on the organisation of the festival only for a few months. We need at least six months to prepare for the festival. But this year, we got less than two months.”

He reiterated that the quality of the films being screened has not been compromised despite the lack of time. “We have the best collection of international films. But these administration issues can be sorted out only if we start early and a festival directorate is put in place,” he added.

Mr. Puranik added that they have raised this concern with the chief minister. “We hope that we will be able to institute a permanent festival directorate in the next few months,” he added.

National anthem not played

This year, the national anthem was not played before the screening of every film. Sources said that PVR Cinemas, where the festival is being organised, has discontinued the practice.

In the past, BiFFEs had seen multiple incidents of people not standing up during the anthem being assaulted by other delegates.

Film enthusiasts from Kodungallur had moved the apex court, which had said that playing the national anthem before the screening of a movie in cinemas is not mandatory.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fkd8lt/article30934313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGBIFFES2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/biffes-off-to-a-rough-start/article30934314.ece
337,2020/02/27,Biffes 2020: No separate queue for senior citizens,"Organisers cite shortage of seats as registrations cross the 11,000 mark

The twelfth edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival (Biffes) seems to have got an overwhelming response from film buffs. Every year, the number of registrations average around 7,000, but this year, the number crossed the 11,000 mark.

“Around 60% of them are film enthusiasts who have paid and got a delegate pass for the festival,” said N. Vidyashankar, Artistic Director, Biffes.

“There may be some chaos at the festival, but it indicates the tremendous response of film buffs to the festival,” he added.

The large numbers expected at the festival has meant some adjustments, including the lack of a separate queue for senior citizens. This decision has not gone down well with many delegates.

“The wait for some films can be over an hour, as the queues are long. It is very difficult for people like me to stand for that long. This is an unfriendly move that does not take into consideration the needs of the elderly,” said Prakash K., a film buff.

Sunil K. Puranik, chairperson, Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, the organiser of the festival, said that the seats available is less compared to the number of registrations, and separate queues would hamper the chances of people getting to watch a film. “But we will be considerate and facilitate those who cannot stand in long queues,” he said.

Day passes will not be issued for now.

“Usually, we do not issue daily passes till the weekend is over. This year also we will follow the same practice. We will take a call on whether to issue day passes on Monday morning, but not before that,” said Mr. Vidyashankar.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/x2bed1/article30934284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGBIFFES1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/biffes-2020-no-separate-queue-for-senior-citizens/article30934285.ece

339,2020/02/27,Searches unearth 60 kg of unaccounted gold,"Commercial Tax officials find suppression of GST to the tune of ₹ 1.3 crore

In one of the biggest searches on jewellers, commercial tax officials unearthed 60 kg of unaccounted gold ornaments worth nearly ₹21 crore that involved suppression of GST to the tune of ₹1.3 crore.

The surprise searches in the Chickpet area, which houses a large number of gold and silver jewellers, on Tuesday were based on information that was cross-checked with the data available with the department. The inspection and searches were conducted on 23 jewellers in Ranganatha Mansion and Sakalajee Market, and 60 kg of gold jewellery in their stock did not have valid documents.

“The dealers were showing less turnover. An analysis of their input tax credit and turnover made us suspicious,” said M.S. Srikar, Commissioner, Commercial Tax.

This follows a similar modus operandi used by silver traders in Raja Market on Avenue Road, and the department had unearthed unaccounted silver ornaments in December 2019.

The modus operandi was that gold traders from other States supplied jewellery to local traders without an invoice. During the inspection, the officials caught two persons carrying 3.5 kg of gold ornaments in their bags without valid documents.

“The department is keeping an eye on inter State movement of gold and silver jewellery without invoice,” Mr. Srikar said.

According to Additional Commissioner (Intelligence) Nitesh Patil, the department got the information that gold and silver jewellery were being carried by persons travelling by bus and trains from Mumbai, Coimbatore, Chennai and a few places in Kerala.

“E-way bills have been exempted for gold and silver articles for reasons of safety. These persons were misusing the exemption. Transactions between those bringing these articles from other States and the wholesale dealers in Bengaluru were taking place without any document,” he added.

During the search and inspection of business premises of wholesalers, officials found that a portion of the business was conducted without documents, and excess and unaccounted stock was a testimony to this.

“Persons carrying jewellery come to wholesalers with jewellery in the guise of showing them designs, but end up selling the jewellery to them without documents. Such transactions happen only with trusted and known customers,” Mr. Patil said.

In all, the department collected GST at the rate of 3% and similar amount as penalty, all totalling ₹1.3 crore.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/searches-unearth-60-kg-of-unaccounted-gold/article30933842.ece

341,2020/02/27,"It is still possible for India, Pakistan to resolve issues: Ranil Wickremesinghe","Former Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe says others can insist that they do so at least to get the SAARC summits moving

From a failed political coup to the deadly Easter Sunday attacks in April last year, Sri Lanka’s former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s last term in office, from 2015 to 2019, witnessed several challenges. His then government tried moving forward with post-war reconciliation and a constitutional settlement to the national question, but could complete neither exercise before November, when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa came to power with a big mandate. Mr. Wickremesinghe, now in Opposition and leading the United National Party (UNP), spoke on a range of subjects from bilateral ties to domestic political issues. Edited excerpts:

During his recent visit to New Delhi Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa sought a three-year moratorium in repaying the debt Sri Lanka owes India, but it doesn’t seem like New Delhi has got back yet. Do you think such a moratorium might help?

For 3% of the debt? Even if we include China and everyone else, the debt [owed to those countries] is less than 20%. It is the sovereign bonds that amount to most of Sri Lanka’s outstanding debt.

You spoke of regional and strategic integration. Your government had tried taking steps in that direction, where do you see that process now?

It has to be taken forward. As far as our government was concerned, the last government, we started discussing with India, a deeper FTA (Free Trade Agreement). And we made progress on many areas. We signed an FTA with Singapore and we also were to commence discussions with Thailand. Bangladesh too was interested in an FTA. It’s just [about] carrying that process forward, because we are countries whose economies are complementary. If four of us can certainly come to an arrangement, then the rest of the pieces in the whole subcontinent will fall into place. Malaysia and Singapore will also have some sort of understanding. India already has an agreement with the ASEAN countries, others will follow and maybe it’ll strengthen India and all of us in coming to an agreement with RCEP (the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) agreement. Now that India has opted out [of RCEP], the best would be to have the agreement here, but we should try and have an agreement which is deeper than RCEP.

Would that mean a freer trade regime?

Well, yes in some instances it can be in respect of tariffs, and in some it can be about the non-tariff barriers and the other standards. It doesn’t mean that all your tariffs have to be less than what is given in the RCEP. It also means you can handle your non-tariff barriers and your standards, which can go beyond RCEP.

You have stressed on the importance of SAARC, and that it would be good for the region if India and Pakistan were to sort out their differences. Is that something you had raised with PM Modi on the many occasions you met him?

We have talked about it and he has explained to me the issues of terrorism and the efforts that he has made. But you have to do this — we are talking of security integration. Look, the Indo-Pakistan tension is a global issue like ours, and for the first time you have the President of the U.S. even talking of intervening. So, it will be a matter of time. If you don’t resolve it yourself, there may be other outside actors who feel that they should come in.

I feel that it’s still possible for India and Pakistan to resolve their own issues, it will take time. And resolving it also means resolving some of the connected issues including Kashmir, but if it’s a slow process, it can [happen]. All that has to be done is to get the summits moving, and then continue the discussions.

How do you think Sri Lanka, which has good relations with both India and Pakistan, could contribute to improving this dialogue?

This is really a bilateral matter. But we can, not only Sri Lanka but also others, insist that they gradually come to a resolution to at least get SAARC summits moving. As President Jayawardene said, ‘we’ve got to have everyone around the table and talk’.

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa made it very clear during his recent visit to New Delhi that the deals signed during your government’s time were not going to be taken forward, particularly referring to the MoU signed in 2017. Why is it so difficult to move forward on those projects like infrastructure in Trincomalee?

These were agreements between two governments. The delays we were having were not policy issues, they were more procedural issues, like environment, or some of the agreements we had with other parties.

But remember, as far as the LNG [projects] are concerned, both for India and Japan, the Mahinda Rajapaksa government granted them permission for a coal power station in Sampur (Trincomalee district). Originally, India discussed Foul Point (Trincomalee) with us, then went for Sampur. There were issues that came up. Similarly, another permit was given to the Japanese.

Then, after the Paris Climate Agreement, President Sirisena decided that we will not have any coal power stations. Then the Indian and the Japanese governments asked us whether we are going back on the agreement and we said this has come. They asked can it be LNG. We need power so he said yes, it’s LNG.

Then our authorities pointed out that if it’s LNG it should be in Colombo. So that’s all, we are just continuing it. Because the policies changed in regard to the fuel that has to be used for the power stations.

Of the other agreements, the Trincomalee oil farm is an old one, which we had agreed to. And it would just make Sri Lanka a hub for oil storage and delivery to India, and to any other country like Bangladesh that is interested, then we could expand on it. So, there’s a lot of potential and once we have an oil hub, getting industry there is not difficult at all. If you are now going back on it what do you want to do with those tanks? They were used to fuel the British and the American war effort in World War Two.

Even so, the accusation was that you were Prime Minister for about four years at a stretch and yet there was very little movement made on so many agreements. In fact, you said at one point that PM Modi was frustrated.

Even I felt frustrated. The East Container Terminal [at the Colombo Port] had been cleared by us, and that has been implemented, with Japan also coming in. So that is out of the way. But these are the two that really got held up. And then we were discussing the Mattala airport (near Hambantota). In the last stages we were waiting for a reply from the Indian side, that I remember. I was pushing hard for it.

India didn’t get back?

They came back towards election time. In the meantime, we got moving on Palaly (airport in Jaffna) and the ground work was done on Batticaloa (airport in the Eastern Province), that also has to be completed. Palaly is very important to us. India is already doing Kankesanthurai (port redevelopment in Jaffna), it is important. We had many other discussions with India on the Trinco-Dambulla highway. I don’t know what they [Rajapaksa government] want to do, because if you go back on it, it’s going to be a blow for Indo-Lanka relations. It is also in Sri Lanka’s interest to develop all this.

Following the November elections, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and PM Mahinda Rajapaksa have said Sri Lanka will pull out of the UNHRC process on accountability and reconciliation. Then, they dropped the Tamil national anthem — reintroduced by your government in the Independence Day celebration. How do you read this shift?

Firstly, as far as the resolution is concerned, we are co-sponsors till the end of the resolution, which is in 2021. You can’t just pull out. After 2021, you can decide whether you want to co-sponsor the next resolution or not. The resolutions are based on a commitment given by President Rajapaksa, at that time when he was President, to inquire into these matters and to take action.

And if you look at the cases, they’re all the cases pertaining to the fighting and the war, including some investigations which had been launched during the time of President Rajapaksa, which were concluded. We only had investigations in respect of the disappearances of certain journalists, which was an election issue.

But other than that, what they are talking of — they’re not talking of the journalists — about what we’ve been doing so far, is actually about us going ahead with what they started. If they didn’t start it, then there wouldn’t have been a question for us to get involved in.

Secondly, we couldn’t say no, because he had already started. He had already had a trial in respect of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka and the White Flag incident. So, they’ve had their first trial, the parties had been jailed and they were inquiring into the others. How can you back out of such a process? We couldn’t back out of a process they started.

On the question of power devolution to the Tamils, your government tried bringing in a new constitution — not necessarily speaking about the 13th Amendment — but couldn’t complete the process. Your successor government — and even the Indian PM — are now talking about the existing 13th Amendment again. Is Sri Lanka going back in time?

Actually, our devolution proposals were based on the 13th Amendment. Furthermore, there is a report prepared by the chief ministers of the seven [southern] provinces, excluding the north and east, on devolution. All seven chief ministers were from the UPFA (the alliance that the Rajapaksas led). So we have only taken their reports.

Do you see Sri Lanka moving in a majoritarian direction? PM Rajapaksa told The Hindu that there will be no decisions taken on devolution that are not acceptable to the majority community

He has said that for the simple reason that first you will need to go for a two-thirds majority [in parliament] and a majority of the MPs are Sinhalese. You may have to go in for a referendum. But whatever it is, it must be based on the 13th Amendment, how do you go beyond 13th Amendment, and it should be acceptable to the Sinhalese also. It’s not just me, it’s Mr. Sampanthan (Tamil National Alliance leader), who has said even if you don’t require a referendum, you should have a non-mandatory referendum.

So you think that is the process?

It is the process. It has already been laid down by Mr. Sampanthan. There’s no question.

Turning to your past government, you had your differences quite openly with President Sirisena. You had come together at a very important time in Sri Lankan history, for a crucial election in 2015. How do you feel about the fact that he has rejoined forces with the Rajapaksas’ Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)?

If he has rejoined forces with the Rajapaksas, it means they accept what he did. He has not yet disowned what he has done. So if they are going to accept what he did, then they can’t say what we did is bad. That is what their own supporters are saying, those who’re against Sirisena coming. How can you now go to the country and say what we did was bad? I expected Sirisena to do this. Some people in my party thought Sirisena was only against me and not against them.

Do you think it is just politics as usual, or a conspiracy of some sort?

In 2018, Sirisena pushed [for the] Rajapaksas to come into the government. And he put me out. Mahinda Rajapaksa came in, but I do not know whether he [Rajapaksa] trusted it. For Mahinda Rajapaksa, he felt he had broken the alliance between both of us (Wickremesinghe-Sirisena). But the fact was that anyway it was broken. I don’t think Mahinda Rajapaksa actually manoeuvred it, so the question is whether Mahinda Rajapaksa was able to get his way by swearing himself in as Prime Minister, or whether Sirisena used Mahinda Rajapaksa in a manoeuvre that was unsuccessful.

Right after the elections you stepped down. It is considered a controversial decision in the sense that many in your party feel that maybe you should have stayed till the parliamentary elections.

Actually, we could have stayed on till the elections, but I must say that what the Pohottuwa (lotus bud, the symbol of SLPP) indicated was, if that was so we must have elections early. That was a matter of negotiations. There were members in my party who felt that we should wait for the longest possible time, even if it means going into the Opposition. And some of the ministers resigned as a result of it. Then I discussed with the members and thought the only option available for us is to go into the Opposition. That was an internal matter of the party. But some of the members of Parliament pointed out that when President Sirisena won, the UPFA had a majority, but we asked the then Prime Minister to resign I became the Prime Minister (minority). So, you are only establishing a precedent. There was only a short time. If it was a matter of two, three years it would have been different. In 2015 also it was a matter of a few months, and in 2019 also it was a matter of few months [before general elections].

There is a perception that you are reluctant to make way for a new leader of your party?

Maybe. In fact, I didn’t want to take on the post of the Leader of the Opposition. I said let Sajith [Premadasa] be there, or someone else, we will try out some new people. Because I have been there earlier. And we have to groom a lot of new people to come in. And after this [general election] you will see who are the ones who do well.

For party leadership?

No, for leaders of the party. Because at this stage one will have to be the leader. Then, it has to be a group. When there is leadership change, there is a group and someone from that emerges later on.

But shouldn’t it be Mr. Premadasa, he is your deputy, and was a candidate?

That is for the party to decide, not me. Many of those people will come after the elections and let them have a hand at reorganising the party, and prove themselves.

One of the first things that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa said after his election was that he wants to get rid of the 19th Amendment (a 2015 legislation clipping the President’s executive powers and empowering parliament) that you have been a strong advocate of. How do you see that?

I thought the intention was all against his brother. You cut down the Prime Minister’s power, then it’s the President who is powerful. As it is, the parliament is powerful, so what do they want to do? This is not a question for me to answer, you put it to the wrong person. I think it’s good and we should keep it, but in this context, it is not a matter for me to decide.

You said the Indian Ocean Region should not become an area of contestation between the U.S. and China. During your time as prime minister, did you feel pressure from both sides?

You could see a sort of polarisation taking place, we want to avoid that. Basically, there should be freedom of navigation that is inclusive, like Prime Minister Modi said. Secondly, there should be no military aspects. Thirdly, our areas need connectivity.

So, if people come with different programmes, as long as there are no strings attached to it in regard to the military side, any country has the option to look at it. And let’s draw the rules of the game in the Indian Ocean. And then let anyone come — it can be U.S., or China. But then, U.S. also must come back and get involved on the economic side. What’s happening now on the Asia Pacific side is that they are pulling out of the economic and the trade side.

You don’t think this blue dot initiative is important? It doesn’t make money?

Yes. And the contradiction that is coming up is that for economic affairs they have to deal with China, and for security affairs they’re dealing with the U.S.

But your government also sent out conflicting signals. In one sense, there was Hambantota being handed over to the Chinese and on the other, you were negotiating a SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement) with the U.S.?

SOFA has already been there. And Hambantota agreement was basically to run the port. There was no way you could run a port and make money when there’s no hinterland. Either I had to not pay the loans or, I had to come back with some arrangement where the Chinese help develop a special economic zone there and we signed the agreement.

But you have to remember that in regard to the Trivandrum port you’re building, they want a minimum of 60 years for returns. So we have only made it 77, they can cancel it tomorrow if you pay them compensation. So it’s no different.

Our government said that we will have the naval southern Command in Hambantota and we are in charge of security, and at the same time in Hambantota was the headquarters of one of our infantry divisions.

What is going to be the impact of the U.S. imposing this travel ban on your army chief?

Earlier, after 2009, there had been a travel ban on Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, when he was the minister. I myself have intervened. But American rules are such that these are internal matters. We were not successful.

Then former Army Commander Jayasuriya was refused entry into the U.S.A. He was our Ambassador in Brazil. Then, General Wiranto was refused permission and even Prime Minister Modi. So all you could do was talk to them. But no one made a big issue whether in India, Indonesia or here earlier, because right or wrong the question of allowing people to come into your country is an internal affair of that country.

But we had taken it up and told them that we didn’t agree with the decision on Fonseka. Same was said of Prime Minister Modi when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat. And the Indonesians said the same thing of General Wiranto, who was Minister of Defence, and he collaborates with the U.S. on defence.

So you don’t think it will have much of an impact on U.S.-Lanka ties?

I don’t think so. What we were anxious about was that this should not affect the military cooperation with the U.S., especially the chances that our armed force personnel were going to get in the U.S., for training and exposure. I myself told them that whatever happens, this is a matter of individuals.

You have been in Parliament for over four decades and PM more than once. The 30-year-war pulled back the country, and now 10 years after the war how do you see the lingering conflict being resolved?

A lot of these issues are over for the Tamils also. Main issue is missing persons and compensation, we have to sort that out. The other is that we still have war-damaged lands to be returned but that process is going on. In the Vanni most of it has been done. The building of houses is going on with the help of India, it’s a question of lifting the economy. That’s why we started with tourism, Palalay. Other than that, unless you are going to reopen the wounds, it will just heal. We are trying to hasten the process.

But in terms of the Tamils’ pending demand for devolution, you said the majority has to agree. Do you think they will resist?

No, it depends on what the powers are. I think police powers and all are questions, but not other things. I think Mr. Sampanthan was correct when he said I want the Sinhalese also to accept it.

Where do you see Sri Lanka in the next five years, with this new government? The Opposition is decimated… you have to rebuild your party

We have to rebuild but I think we will have a strong Opposition because in the last few months they [Rajapaksas] have not performed.

But do you foresee an ability to rebuild… because the party appears divided?

I think we can rebuild it. We also have to look at the fact that people opted out of the traditional politicians for someone who was not a politician. Well, you have seen that in U.S.A. Even in the U.K. they put the mayor of London. Generally, it’s a seasoned House of Commons parliamentarian who goes in. So there are changes, and I think our parties have to respond to that.

Are you worried about, what some fear might be, a shrinking of democratic space in Sri Lanka under the new government?

We won’t allow that. People also won’t allow that. They have to face Opposition both inside and outside the Parliament if they try that.",interview,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/xo1rla/article30935546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28RANIL,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/it-is-still-possible-for-india-pakistan-to-resolve-issues-ranil-wickremesinghe/article30935547.ece
342,2020/02/27,"The further you are from power, the more you see: Gary Younge","The award-winning British journalist and author talks of politics, journalism and the politics of journalism

Gary Younge, who served as The Guardian’s editor-at-large and long-time U.S. correspondent, left the newspaper recently, after 26 years as a staff writer and 20 years as a columnist. His political commentary, grounded in his reporting experiences, has offered readers world over clarity and perspective on both key global developments and their local manifestations, while zooming into oppression and exploitation in those societies. The award-winning British journalist and author has now taken up a teaching assignment at Manchester University as Professor of Sociology. In an interview over Skype, Mr. Younge spoke on politics, journalism and the politics of journalism.

When you look back at your reporting trail what would you say were the most valuable lessons professionally and personally?

Personally, one was to always try and add value somehow. On election night in 2008 with [Barack] Obama, [I thought] why go to Grant Park [Chicago, U.S.]. Everybody else is there. What am I going to add at Grant Park? Whereas if I go to a bar in the South Side, a black area, where there are no cameras, then maybe I can add something. So, I went to a bar the night before. I found a guy, and I went and voted with him the next day.

I watched the results come out and I saw how emotional he was. He was a telecommunications guy – and it was when he was explaining his vote that he started crying.

In the bar I sat next to this woman who didn’t believe it was going to be possible [for Obama to win] because she thought America was too racist. I saw some scales fall off her eyes as the night went on. And then I remember this woman said, ‘My man is coming home, he is in Afghanistan’. And I thought, no he’s not. Obama is supporting that war.

You saw the beginnings of this fantasy about Obama, about what he would and wouldn’t do, without really listening to what he was saying. I don’t think I would have gotten all of that in Grant Park. And in any case, the further you are from power, the more you see.

If you travel with Obama’s entourage or Tony Blair’s entourage, you don’t really see anything. I travelled with Tony Blair in 2001 just for a week and I didn’t see anything, because you’re being taken from place to place to see what they tell you to see and the story is going on somewhere else, really. This particular story is really not so interesting, it’s not what I came to journalism to do. There was a lesson about how people experience these things as opposed to the meta story of the politician, the election and so on.

Sometimes the things that aren’t stories should be stories, and the news agenda is skewed towards power and the powerful. Also, the people in the newsroom think if it’s not happening to them, it is not news in the same way.

There is this phrase in journalism, ‘When a dog bites a man, that is not a story; when a man bites a dog, that’s a story’. And I understand that. But sometimes you have to ask yourself: who owns these dogs, and why do they keep biting people, why do the same people keep getting bitten?

One of the other things was learning that there is news in what appears to be banal. And that often what is banal for the people who create news is deeply traumatic for large numbers of people. And so, I try to find ways to make what people think they know new and different.

Long before ‘intersectionality’ became a buzz word, race and class were recurring themes in your writings. You especially emphasise inequality cutting across races — a politics that, in your latest column, you credit your mother for exposing you to. How has class as a framework helped you think and write?

I grew up around white people, working class white people. My introduction to politics was really though Marx and Trotsky, not through Malcolm X and Amiri Baraka. That came later.

On a personal level, there was this wrestling with some people saying it’s about class and others saying it’s about race and thinking, well, I exist as a working-class black man. Those two things don’t stand in contradiction. I need to find a place where those two things can work together, intellectually and socially, where nobody’s asking me to put one of those things at the door.

And I would say, although I am less fluent in the language of this, there was also gender there. I remember as a young man, meaning 16-17, thinking of feminism as something that posh white ladies did. And I found them annoying, when they were saying, ‘you are part of the problem’. I was like, ‘no you are a massive problem, and I see no kinship with you’.

And then when I taught in Sudan for a year when I was 17, I did my reading. I read Women, Resistance and Revolution by Sheila Rowbotham. It was all about gender, class and how they interact and intersect. Almost straight after, I read The Color Purple, which is not a massively polemical book but still, the penny dropped.

Well, yes, of course, either everybody is free, or nobody is free. You can’t have socialism without feminism, you can’t have socialism without ending racism, none of this stuff makes sense unless you include identity in it. The people who try to pit one against the other are not going to understand.

And on ways in which my understanding of class really informed my writing — I could think of a few direct examples. My first big assignment was the first election in South Africa. I was watching and just thinking, so what’s going to change for these people, the poorest people, the people in the townships and who’s going to make out like a bandit here.

Coming back a few years later, I saw this realignment of white capital and black politics coming together at a certain level. There was always a black bourgeoisie there, but it wasn’t moneyed. Seeing it now get money, seeing this rapid transformation of a handful of people — it was inevitable and likely — I felt that this is a way to understand what has happened here. It [South Africa] had reached a certain level of democracy which is not in any way incompatible with massive inequality. That contradiction, given that there was a mass movement, will assert itself — and it has and is.

Similarly, with Obama, I can understand the symbolic value of a black president, but the substantial value will be contingent on the degree to which black people improve, which they didn’t really. The gap between black and white grew. When you have to deal with the contradictions in class and the politics of that, you see that sometimes working-class people support things that aren’t in their material interests because they have other interests.

I remember making a lot of people angry writing about Brexit and saying you can’t just say that people are being tricked because they don’t vote for their material interests, they have other interests. I may not like those interests. I am relatively well off and whenever I vote for a Left-wing party, I vote against my material interest because it’s something else that I want. We shouldn’t think that working-class people are any different. And then, we have to unpick what those interests are.

In Obama’s case, it was a lot of black people — for them the symbolism may not have been enough materially, but it was something. Similarly, there are people who think abortion is more important than anything else, or that the tiny sliver of racial privilege they have is more important than whether they lose or win, or other people get richer. In Britain, it’s mostly about white people who think ‘my sense of being British and Britain being independent are more important than whether this factory closes down, because this is not my factory anyway’.

A class analysis doesn’t necessarily simplify things. It can complicate in some ways, and clarify in others.

Whenever I see people talk about race or gender or sexual orientation or religion, any of those things without a class analysis, I see what they are saying run into the ground really quickly in terms of anything other than a form of fundamentalism really. And I’m against all fundamentalisms you know, of race, class, colour, religion and nation.

Whether in the U.S., U.K., or South Asia, the politics of hate based on identity is on the rise. What could the media do in such times?

Well, the first thing they could do is not make it worse, which in Britain a lot of the media do. And a lot of the media are also fomenting this politics. The media’s role is to inform and tell the truth. I don’t believe in objectivity. I think it’s a farcical notion. Stories demand choices, so it’s not objectivity it’s fairness, clearly.

But there is a responsibility if you are in the media to explain why there are no jobs. And there is no plausible explanation for the economic collapse that involves immigrants and refugees. They did not cause the collapse. Misinformation and disinformation help breed and caffeinate this ‘enemy’ and polarisation. No sane, engaged, respectable, responsible, plausible reporting would lead you to a notion that poor people, immigrants, migrants and refugees caused the economic collapse. And so, if you do that, you’re contributing to them.

I think the media has a job to do in terms of insisting on people’s humanity — not restoring their humanity because humanity never went away — but the media stripped people off their humanity.

Ultimately, we have to stop thinking of the media as being outside politics and society. I am not sure that we can separate the media from the politics and say how does the media remedy the politics, because they are symbiotic. But I do think that if the media followed some basic precepts about factual reporting, curiosity, not ‘I know why that happened but why did that happen’, we would be in a different place.

You have reported extensively from the U.S. (2003-15) and the U.K. From Donald Trump’s election to Brexit, the last few years have witnessed major political shifts in these two Western democracies. Did you see them coming?

No, I didn’t. I didn’t think that Trump would be the nominee. I thought he could win but didn’t think he would. I thought Brexit could happen, but I didn’t think it would. I try not to make predictions in my work anyway, because I think journalists are far better at describing than predicting. Our job is not to foresee the future, it is to make sense of the present. Maybe thereby having a sense of what might happen.

I did see some of the things that made them possible. During the Blair years I did see a disaffection, a disinterest, with politics. There was a lower turnout, and people were alienated. I didn’t know exactly where that would go, but I knew that it was not going to go anywhere good.

While in America, I saw the rise of [George W.] Bush and the war, and the collapse of the war. And there were these moments, like with Obama’s campaign, when you saw how much desire for change there was, but then he was a completely inadequate vessel, that was always clear to me. I didn’t know where the disappointment in him would go among white people, but I knew it had to go somewhere.

I do remember seeing in 2008 the Sarah Palin phenomenon — it was really a precursor to Trump, it was beginning of the cohering of all of that — and thinking that could get really ugly and dangerous.

I did think white people are about to become a numerical minority in this country and they are not going to take that sitting down. I wondered how that would pan out.

The other thing was the completely inadequate neo-liberal social democratic response. Hillary [Clinton] was the worst possible candidate you can put up against Trump. When somebody said ‘Make America Great Again’, she said, ‘America is great already’. But there were all these people in poverty, whose wages hadn’t increased in the last 40 years. And when she was asked how much she got paid, or why she took so much money from Goldman Sachs, she said because that’s what they offered.

Similarly, in Britain, during the Brexit campaign, their campaign was like: ‘If you’re going to vote for Brexit, that’s because you’re stupid’. And people said: ‘Well then, I’m not going to vote for you if you think I’m stupid’. When they did vote for Brexit, they said, ‘You’re too stupid to know what you think’. And people said: ‘In what world do you know my interests better than me? And why do you keep calling me stupid?’

In both cases, the social democratic wing of neo-liberalism had reached such levels of arrogance and disconnection that in hindsight there was going to be some sort of very fundamental reactionary response. And this was it.

In the summer of 2017, you travelled across the States — from Maine to Mississippi — to find out what ordinary Americans were thinking at that time. In 2019, you went on a journey in search of the American Left. Based on these travels, how do you view the ongoing U.S. presidential race and the resistance to the politics that Trump represents?

There has been considerable resistance. The resistance has grown. There have been these movements — ‘Black Lives Matter’, ‘Me Too’, ‘Extinction Rebellion’ in Britain, ‘Anti-Fracking’, ‘Occupy Wall Street’ — they burn very brightly, and then they fade. And another movement comes along. They do good things, they raise consciousness, but they’re not really movements in the traditional sense. Occupy Wall Street was closer to that.

But it’s not like if you go to Chicago, there’s a Black Lives Matter office, or officer. They have no institutions to sustain them through the lean times. Not everything about the Civil Rights Movement was a march or a demonstration, there was organising, there were letters to be sent, there were structures.

The Unions were very actively involved, weren’t they?

Yes, at the least the union leadership was during the civil rights era. Quite often lower down the union hierarchy they were quite resistant to the hiring of black workers. But yes, people forget that in 1963, it was a march for jobs and freedom. And we don’t have much of a union movement any more. Current ‘movements’ explode, and then they fade. They are caffeinated by social media. They fast-break.

And that produced some of the biggest demonstrations we have ever seen and yet the weakest of, or almost non-existent, actual movements. America has had four of its five big demonstrations during the last three, four years since Trump was elected. And still the primary vehicle for resisting or opposing Trump remains the Democratic Party which I believe is inadequate for the task. It is dominated by corporate interests. Its energies are almost entirely electoral, so nothing that impedes on the next election will be entertained.

Whereas that’s not how Trump came through. Trump came through thanks to the Tea Party, came through a series of defeats actually, but each one raising the consciousness of a certain group of people.

This is true in Britain as well. If you look at Nigel Farage, the head of Brexit, who never won an election in Britain — he won in the European election but in the British election he never even came close — and yet was able to transform our relationship to the European Union and our politics arguably.

In a way more people are involved on the Left politically than they have been for a long time. I covered the 2016 election from Muncie in Indiana. And when I went back a year later everybody who I spoke to who was a liberal was doing something that they have never done before, or more than they have ever done before. Saying, ‘I have to... I have to... I can’t just let this [happen]’. And yet while there is resistance, there is no movement. There is this inability to cohere the resistance and find a home for it that isn’t hostage to electoralism, to corporate interests and to co-option.

I am still grateful for the resistance there is. Who’d have thought Bernie Sanders will be anywhere close? Or Elizabeth Warren, who’d have been unthinkable, for years and two months ago. No one would have thought it was possible and here we are with a man who calls himself a socialist. In whatever way he is going to disappoint us later, here he is, and he is leading. So long as we are looking for this through the Democratic Party, we will be disappointed, it would be compromised. That is not a problem, everything gets compromised in a movement. But it will be compromised in ways which make it far less useful.

The media world, in the last two decades, had some dramatic moments around the sensational revelations by whistle-blowers like WikiLeaks, Edward Snowden and the Panama Papers. How did those impact the practise of journalism and how the media is perceived?

I am just thinking of them all. On the one hand, it has shown the power that the media can have, in terms of exposure, making changes. It has also shown the frailty — well look what happened to Edward Snowden, look what happened to Julian Assange — he is a far more complicated figure — still look what has happened to him. Panama Papers and things like that are slightly separate because there was no one individual who could be highlighted, scapegoated and targeted.

But it’s not Watergate. It’s something or somebody going ‘boom! there you go’. In that sense, the challenge for news organisations is in terms of fortitude. Someone’s giving you these things, do you have the wherewithal, bravery and resources to print them and stand by them? Do you have the capacity to convey them as stories? Quite often with these stories, people can get overwhelmed with the process, without really showing people why they matter.

If there has been a criticism of some of those stories, it has been the inability to explicitly insist on their relevance to the ordinary person, which I don’t think is difficult but it is a challenge. And quite often with this journalism people can just get wrapped up in the ‘you know what we’ve got’, and not ‘what this means’.

Given that independent newsrooms world over are thinking hard about their resources, how does the future of sound reportage and storytelling look to you?

It is going to be hard. It is hard. The kind of reporting that I’m interested in takes time. You can’t just walk up to someone with a microphone or notebook and say, ‘what’s going on?’ It takes time to get them to trust you, investigations take time, mounting a legal defence takes time, so you need resources. That is always compromising, where your resources come from.

Advertising models are breaking down. And the fact that advertising models are breaking down is a worry, but I think it’s also an opportunity. Maybe soon for many outlets it is not going to matter what advertisers think, so we can liberate ourselves from that, but people still need to be paid.

Almost antithetically to our Left-wing selves we are going to have to become more engaged consumers. And if you like something, you have to think about how you support it because that is the only model ultimately that is going to work. I do think it is sustainable and that it would demand us doing better work. Work that you can point to and say, ‘if you want it, you got to pay for it’, and getting people into the mindset that it is not free and that they have a responsibility. At the moment, that is the only way I see us continuing with an independent media. I’m not against commercial interventions in the media, I just think we have to be careful about whose terms it is on.

In one of your columns on the British media, you observed that 21st century journalists act not as critical interlocutors but convenient conduits. Arguably, the observation could be applied to many other contexts, including India. What drives these actions that appear to range from silence and self-censorship – in contexts where there is fear - to subservience and wilful alignment with the establishment/ruling class?

As you illustrated, it is different in different places. I am quite sympathetic to journalists who think they are going to get killed unless they do a certain thing, or get out of journalism, but I get that.

In Britain and I think much of the West there are two things – first of all, there is access. If I do this, they will keep talking to me. What is the price of this access? But even tied to that, in a way I think that it was less true before, they are essentially of the same class.

In Britain, the percentage of columnists who went to private schools and Oxford or Cambridge is higher than it is in the House of Lords. Then you have this group of people who know each other, even if they don’t personally know each other. Not necessary electorally, but socially they have the same interests. Where did you go skiing? I went skiing there. Where did your son go to school? My son goes to school there. Where did you study, I studied there. Then there is a kind of collusion. It is all informal, none of it is stated, none of it is written down, none of it is probably even recognised. And yet all of this is fully very clear if you’re on the outside.

So when there are these ruptures — and this is as true for Trump as it was for Jeremy Corbyn in Britain — then they kind of band together, and the journalists become like political actors and as gatekeepers and they become affronted personally by the presence of these interlopers who have been selected by the great unwashed. And they find it much more cozy, comfortable to be in these much smaller cliques that represent quite a narrow band of political ideology.

In this period of polarisation, you have this kind of clumping at the centre and this disdain for the margins, which is not even political opposition to — it is as well — but it is like, ‘where did you people come from; this is our house’. I see that quite a lot.

In Britain with [Jeremy] Corbyn to even claim that this is something that we should try and understand, not support necessarily but understand, and lo and behold, if you said ‘actually I think some of this is good, and he has a point’, it really casts you out of polite company.

So it was a very peculiar few years, the last few years, where, even though overwhelming numbers of the Labour party supported him, and even though in 2017 Labour did get a higher vote share and gain seats, way better than anybody expected, in 2019 they didn’t, it was still considered a kind of a form of idiocy that was career damaging. And who wants to damage their career?

When you have the generation which in its formative years saw the Soviet Union collapse, capitalism is the only thing, the only game in town, [Francis] Fukuyama’s End of History — everything else is childish, and romantic and utopian and ridiculous.

Any opposition to the neo-liberal project is folly. Nobody stamps this on your hand, nobody makes you sign a paper but if you want to go on, this is the way to think. Stop talking about socialism, that’s what silly people’s talk about, it’s finished, it’s gone. They lost.

This is the world these people grew up in and it has collapsed. It collapsed with the crisis and they have really struggled to get their bearings since then. And that is how they become stenographers [putting out] whatever the last powerful person said to them, so long as their power is in some way connected to the neoliberal project.

Social media has changed the media landscape in ways that many of us didn’t imagine. There is a common refrain that social media has made journalists instant, armchair commentators while rigorous, old-fashioned reporting is on the decline. How do you view the relationship between journalists and social media?

I generally use social media to post my stories and insights. Four years ago, when I was covering the caucuses in Iowa I live-tweeted what I was seeing. I thought most people aren’t going to get to the caucus. And most of this is not going to go in a piece, so I thought it would be interesting.

I try not to reply to people... people I don’t know, or don’t care about. And whenever I violate that rule, I usually regret it. I don’t think Twitter is the real world. It is a part of the world, but it is not the world. And I worry, quite a lot actually, about younger journalists, activist-journalists for whom it is their world.

Similarly, you get these stories about a Twitter storm. I think, well, did it rain anywhere else or was it just a storm on Twitter? And it is very alluring. I understand that people can build big followings, big profiles, and I would never say don’t do it. I use it sparingly.

Facebook I mostly use because I have a diasporic family who can see my kids grow up. And if I have a piece up, I put it, or if I want a book recommendation or I’m looking for something. But I see mostly younger journalists get into furious battles and I want to tell them, read a book, take a break, go on holiday. This is taking up too much time and too much energy. You are using it as a proxy for the world. The world doesn’t need a proxy, there is the world so go out.

If you were to give one, crucial tip to journalists, what would that be?

Always be curious. However smart you are, you don’t know the answer to the question you have asked until you’ve gone and looked for it. And some things you assume are often wrong. And even if they are right, they may not be right for the reasons that you thought they were. So, go and find out if you can.

Quite often I have seen something and thought, ‘typical’ and it has not been typical at all and not always in ways that I wanted.

I did a story about a school in Mississippi, where everything was split – there was a black principal, and a white principal. A black cheer leaders’ team, a white cheer leaders’ team, black year and white year – I just thought that’s crazy, that is stupid and of course it is in a way but then when I got there, I found out why. It was that when desegregation happened, in order to make sure that the white kids would go to the school, they said, look, we’ll keep separate things, so it won’t just be a black school. It is not great, but it is better than what happened elsewhere, which is that white kids just moved somewhere else. They said we’ll keep this transitional phase. Then, the area changed demographically, and the black people were in the minority. And then, the white people said, let’s get away with this black principal and white principal, and black people said no, it was good enough for you, why should we not have protection. This is still a racist place and while you’re in the majority, you feel none of this is necessary. Well, some of this is necessary, and that doesn’t necessarily mean I think it was a good idea, but it wasn’t just stupid which is what I thought it was.

Another example. I thought Corbyn was this enormous rise in Left-wing energy. It was in a way. But not in the way I had imagined. I went to these rallies and it really wasn’t. It was just people saying I think we have to get back to more of what we were and that I think that Labour should be more for the working person. I went to three rallies and socialism was mentioned once. Neoliberal globalisation wasn’t mentioned at all. It was far more tame than I thought it was.

I remember covering the tea party in the States, 2010 in Las Vegas. I was trying to find some people to go out canvassing with from the Tea Party and I couldn’t find anyone. That was a revelation that the Tea Party didn’t exist. It’s just a name for a range of right-wing people and groups who hated Obama but it is actually not an organisation. They have the same problem as we do in terms of Black Lives Matter. And all of those things come from a sense of curiosity where you think you know something and then you don’t.

Perhaps an odd question to someone who has told so many powerful stories. Is there one story that has stayed with you and that you carry all the time?

There is, actually. Claudette Colvin. In 2000, I wrote a piece. When I wrote my first book about the deep south I kept coming up with this name of this girl who was kicked off a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, before Rosa Parks, who they decided not to hold up as a symbol because she got pregnant and she was 15.

Any good book on the civil rights era and Montgomery would mention her, but none of them that I read at that time would give you more than a paragraph about her. I was like, who is this, what happened here? When I was travelling through the deep south I asked around and I got a number of a cousin. She had left the town and I called the cousin, and this went on for months. Eventually I got Claudette’s number and she was in the Bronx. I went and I interviewed her.

It is this shocking story of this young girl who is smart and politically active. She is the one, she is kicked off the bus, she pleads not guilty, she has been involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], she has letters from all over the country from people saying, ‘thank you, you are so brave’, and then they just drop her. And then, the Rosa Parks story is told in this very American, neoliberal individualistic way — the cross winds of history met at that bus stop at that time. It shows that one person can change the world, and she is just a little old lady who was tired. The story actually denigrates her because she was a political activist, doing work for a long time. She didn’t believe in non-violence, she was more Malcom X than Martin Luther King, so it denigrated Rosa Parks and obliterated Claudette.

It is partly a story about Claudette and this young, smart, dark-skinned woman who gets pregnant, she is not married, and has to leave town because she has taken on the power structure and nobody is supporting her. It is also about how we understand history as individuals and as someone sprinkling magic dust at a certain point.

That is the story I am proudest of because I found her. Since then they have been children’s books and bigger books, but at the time, there hadn’t been a lot of work, she wasn’t easy to find.

344,2020/02/27,"Answers to life, death and everything in between","TT Srinath’s ‘Facing ‘My’ Mirror’, helps the reader navigate towards a more purposeful existence

Religious texts have long shone a torch on the path to enlightenment, happiness and gratitude, yet we walk the aisles of book stores in search of a compass that will help us navigate resentment, grief and modern love. Sensitivity trainer TT Srinath has been at this for a while now — asking existential questions since he lost his father as a teen, struggled as an entrepreneur and trained thousands as a human interaction facilitator before finding his voice as a writer of four books and a column in MetroPlus. Over the past few years, his ‘Conversations with Self’ that appears on our Health pages has engaged with the world, warmly without being preachy.

When we meet to discuss his latest book, Facing ‘My’ Mirror – What It Means To Live In This World, Srinath, from a well-established industrialist family, looks back on the tough years that shaped his life and thinking, with disarming humanism.

“What I would now define as setbacks in life primarily because of circumstances that were beyond my control were actually instances when life was presenting me a fork in the road; asking me to make a choice. While I made those choices, I did not like the consequences. But choice also gives you the power to be responsive rather than reactive. When I came to appreciate that it led to who I have become,” says Srinath. “I realised that there is no point being futuristic, no point of worrying about the past. Every day is a gift.”

While Srinath had enough material from his own journey to help others accept or avoid life’s minefields, the idea for the book originated in early 2018, when he was unwell and juggling a training workshop — he has trained nearly 30,000 participants and worked with 120 organisations across the world. A member of the Indian Society for Applied Behavioural Science, Srinath holds a doctorate from Anna University, Chennai, in Organisational Behaviour. His first introduction to existentialism came from a Jesuit, Father John Prabhu, while pursuing a post-graduate degree in Human Resource Management at XLRI, Jamshedpur. “He lent me Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl. The book could not have come to me at a better time — I was still low from the death of my father, I was trying to find my place in my extended family. It helped me recognise that there are certain givens — you are born and you will die. So between those two posts, how do you embrace life, embrace people. And accept the pain that comes with the choices you make. The only choices we have are — can I learn to appreciate my uniqueness, celebrate it and, therefore, celebrate the other; can I take charge of my life and find my authenticity.”

Frankl continues to remain an important part of Srinath’s book that had a soft launch, anchored by historian Pradeep Chakravarthy, earlier this week. Industrialist Suresh Krishna received the first copy from N Ravi, director, Kasturi and Sons. While Krishna spoke on how the book defines the weighty concept of existentialism in simple language, Ravi spoke on how it was a reflection of the writer who “has transformed many times over in the four decades I’ve known him. It does not handout bailouts for a perfect life; instead it suggests how to find a path”.

Nirmala Lakshman, director, The Hindu Group Publishing, who has also written the foreword for the book, said, “This is a book that must be dipped into often, a much-needed manual that can show us who we really are.”

The book begins at what we consider the ‘end’ — death, and demystifies a subject that many do not wish to dwell upon. It is also an outpouring that the path to happiness is to not be in pursuit of it at all.

Facing ‘My’ Mirror, published by Shakthi Forms, will be launched on February 28 at Higginbothams, Anna Salai, at 6.30 pm. The author will be in conversation with Vinay Kamath, Senior Associate Editor, The Hindu Businessline, and author-playwright-poet Shreekumar Varma.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/zbtogy/article30931253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MPSRINATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/answers-to-life-death-and-everything-in-between/article30931254.ece
345,2020/02/27,InKo Centre director awarded,"One of K-Pop top divas will be performing in the city as part of cultural exchange

In recognition of India-Korea Cultural Centre (InKo Centre) Chennai’s contribution to activities on India-Korea cultural exchange since 2006, Young-seup Kwon, Consul General of the Republic of Korea in Chennai awarded a certificate of merit to Rathi Jafer, Director of InKo Centre in on Thursday.

This is the first time such an award is being presented to someone from South India by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Korea. InKo Centre was setup in 2006 to work across performing and visual arts.

“We are looking for more and more opportunities to bring together both the cultures. Our organisation celebrates the singular aspects of these two cultures and similarities. There are many trade and language links between the two nations,” said Ms. Rathi Jafer.

Mr. Kwon said that there are lot of similarities between Korean and Indian cultures. “Korean and Tamil languages have lot of similarities,” he said. To create more awareness about Korea in Chennai, a series of programmes are being planned. In the first half of this year, South Korea will present a nonverbal performance from Korea – Fireman - in August 2020 in Chennai. One of the K-Pop top divas will also be performing in the city and will judge to select the Best Performance of Chennai for the World K-Pop Music and Dance Competition.

In the second half of this year, Korean music, films and food festival will be held. The Consulate would provide a dedicated tea area for ‘Tea Ceremony : Time Travel to Mindfulness and Meditation’ presenting the aromatic experience from Korea to the hometown of Bodhidharma who first introduced ‘Zen’ in Korea.“Korea also has a very long tea culture, but it is not well known in India,” said the consul general.

Venu Srinivasan, chairman, TVS Motors and Goodwill envoy for culture and diplomacy of the Republic of Korea, said that he wanted to do something that will actively contribute to greater understanding between Korea and India. “What Ms. Rathi has done with Inko centre has created great understanding in Chennai about Korean culture and about Indian culture in Korea,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/loecbp/article30930454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INKO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/inko-centre-director-awarded/article30930456.ece
346,2020/02/27,University of Madras not to appoint faculty for now,"Vice Chancellor bound by GO to not make fresh appointments at the end of his tenure

With less than three months left for the incumbent Vice Chancellor P. Duraisamy to demit office, the University of Madras is facing a huge backlog of vacancies in faculty positions.

Mr. Duraisamy will complete his tenure on May 26. A State government order prevents him from making appointments beginning 90 days from the expiry of his tenure.

Several issues contributed to the delay in recruitment. The Supreme Court verdict on considering a university as a unit for reservation of posts had led to suspension of recruitment for nearly two years. Earlier the university was without a V-C for two years.

Though the States were later informed that they could carry out the recruitment as per the State’s reservation policy, the general elections in 2019 further delayed the process. The University Grants Commission denied it permission to run distance education programmes citing faculty shortage. The VC transferred faculty from some departments to ensure that the IDE programmes could be run.

The university’s finances were poor and the State government cut back on the grants following audit objections. Finally in February, the government announced that since the university had corrected some of the errors it would be provided a special grant to pay the pension due to its non-teaching faculty.

Legal hurdles

Now the university, with 78 departments, is facing a series of hurdles from aspirants who have sought legal intervention. According to a Syndicate member, the sanctioned strength in the year 1996 was increased to 540 faculty posts.

One group has challenged the State government’s decision to allow Bharathidasan University to follow the Central government’s reservation rules when the State Act governs State Universities. A few candidates have questioned the university’s decision to not recognise post-doctoral research experience from institutions other than universities or from abroad. These cases are still pending in court.

According to Mr. Duraisamy, during his tenure as many as 170 faculty had been awarded promotions.The promotions under career advancement scheme had been pending for quite a few eligible professors and his aim had been to implement the CAS.

“We followed the University Grants Commission norms, including in the constitution of panel of experts for assessing the candidates,” Mr. Duraisamy said. The interview panel comprised three external subject experts, the VC and the Head of the Department as observer. A woman member was included if the candidate was a woman and an SC/ST faculty member, if the candidate was an SC/ST, he added.

Mr. Duraisamy said he would complete the process and resolve the court cases so that the next VC would be able to appoint faculty immediately.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fubaqf/article30929345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/university-of-madras-not-to-appoint-faculty-for-now/article30929346.ece
347,2020/02/27,"Better look, feel and facilities: Corpn. hospitals in for upgrade","New logo, standardisation of services to be rolled out across 181 facilities

The Chennai Corporation will start a project for branding its hospitals, giving them a unique name, logo and design to attract more beneficiaries. As many as 181 facilities, including 21 standalone dispensaries, are expected to get a makeover.

A meeting of senior officials of the Corporation’s Health Department was held on Tuesday to discuss the proposal for branding the 181 facilities.

“We want to bring Chennai Corporation hospitals on a par with other hospitals. We will have a common logo, with standardisation of services,” said an official.

The initiative of branding Chennai Corporation hospitals is expected to improve services in 140 urban primary health centres.

Attract more patients

“At least 150 to 175 outpatients visit the primary health centres every day. This number is expected to double after the branding is done,” said an official.

“Currently, 36 polyclinics of Chennai Corporation are offering specialised services from 4 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. at the primary health centres. Specialists visit the hospitals six days a week to offer free services. We plan to increase the number of specialists at the hospitals,” the official said.

Polyclinics in areas such as Tondairpet, S.M. Nagar and Pulianthope TB Hospital attract many patients from the locality.

“Every polyclinic of the Chennai Corporation offers services to at least 100 people every day. This has to increase,"" said another official.

Specialists to increase

“We want to improve the quality of services, ambience and manpower. We will engage more specialists,"" he added.

The Corporation will also improve the secondary care services at 16 urban community health centres, including dialysis centres, in areas such as Lakshmipuram, Perungudi and Nungambakkam.

The facilities will also offer emergency care and services relating to maternity and neonatal care. The branding will also cover the Communicable Diseases Hospital in Tondiarpet.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bedj3c/article30926881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THPHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/better-look-feel-and-facilities-corpn-hospitals-in-for-upgrade/article30926882.ece

The sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Washermenpet in Chennai entered the 13th day on Wednesday.

The violence in the locality on February 14 led to a Shaheen Bagh-like situation, with hundreds of women launching an indefinite protest against the CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR). Two of the locality’s narrow alleys — Sajja Munusamy Street and Aziz Mohamed Street — have been packed with more than 1,000 women and children wearing anti-CAA and NRC bandanas and raising anti-CAA and azadi slogans.

On the 13th day of the protest on Wednesday, the protesters conducted a baby shower function for a pregnant Hindu woman in a grand manner. The woman, Bagyalakshmi, is a resident of the area and was brought to the stage.

The protesting Muslim women adorned her with bangles and flowers. They blessed her and offered sweets and fruits, besides wishing her a safe delivery. They distributed thambulams carrying the message: “Muslims have an umbilical cord relationship with this society.”

Members of Islamic outfits sat in protest in Pulianthope and Mannady areas.

350,2020/02/27,Pizza delivery executive nabbed for harassing woman customer,"He with his three associates circulated her number

A delivery executive of a leading pizza outlet in the city and his three other associates were apprehended by the city police after they reportedly circulated a woman customer’s number after she scolded him for delayed delivery.

The victim, Gayathri Sainath, 40, a child artist in the Mani Ratnam film Anjali, willingly revealed her identity in order to send a message to other young women to be careful while using the mobile application for food delivery. She is now a fashion designer.

On February 9, she ordered pizza online using a mobile application. After a while, the delivery executive of the pizza outlet repeatedly called her complaining that he could not locate the address. While she was guiding him over the phone on the direction to her house, he was rude to her.

Ms. Gayathri explained, “I asked him whether he was not aware of the location of the house as he was delivering pizza every week and hence could be familiar with the location.

He retorted very rudely asking me if I wanted the pizza or not. I was shocked by his reply.”

She remained patient as her children were hungry. After he finally delivered the food, she questioned him and a minor quarrel ensued. She managed to take a picture of him and he left the place after delivery.

“Two days later, I received a flurry of unwanted/nuisance calls from unknown persons. I did not take half of those calls. Four of them spoke in an obscene manner. One of the callers asked whether I was a sex worker. I was aghast at the call and shouted back at him. The caller apologised for his mistake. I was curious to know on how my number was circulated”, said Ms. Gayathri.

Then, one of the callers disclosed that her number was circulated on a WhatsApp group of a pizza delivery executive’s collegemates, describing her in badlight. Following an enquiry, the All Women Police, Teynampet, nabbed the pizza delivery executive Parameshwaran and his three friends.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pizza-delivery-executive-nabbed-for-harassing-woman-customer/article30926792.ece

352,2020/02/27,Acclaimed violinist honoured,"Chandrasekaran given Sathguru Thyagaraja Hamsadhwani Award

Acclaimed classical violinist M. Chandrasekaran was conferred the Sathguru Thyagaraja Hamsadhwani Award at the 30th annual music, dance and drama festival organised by Hamsadhwani at Kalakshetra Foundation on Wednesday.

Presenting the award and citation to the violin maestro, Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu said that Mr. Chandrasekaran was a symbol of perseverance and determination and occupied a place of pride in the quartet of violin maestros, including Lalgudi Jayaraman, T.N. Krishnan and M.S. Gopalakrishnan.

Praising cultural organisations like Hamsadhwani for playing a significant role in making Chennai the Carnatic music capital, he called upon corporate entities and philanthropists to extend patronage to cultural organisations and preserve the country’s cultural heritage. “Our cultural diversity must remain a vehicle of unity, peace and joy. It is a platform needed to build the future of the nation,” he said.

‘Celebrate diversity’

Mr. Naidu said that the riots in Delhi were ‘disturbing’ and added that in a democracy, everyone had the right to express their views. The cultural diversity of the country must be celebrated with a common spirit of understanding. “We need this sense of understanding now, when rifts threaten to divide us. Music is a contributory factor to give peace. I think people who are trying to create disturbances need good music,” he said.

Schools must sensitise children to different cultures and ways of life through exchange and cultural programmes, Mr.Naidu added.

The award was instituted by Preetha Reddy, vice chairperson, Apollo Hospitals Group and Vijayakumar Reddy to recognise Carnatic musicians who have contributed to promotion of compositions of Thyagaraja.

353,2020/02/27,Mullai Nagar’s nursery of talent gets a new lease of life,"Corporation lays fresh astro turf at a cost of ₹29.60 lakh

The players are back at North Chennai’s popular football ground in Mullai Nagar.

On Wednesday, more than a month after the ground was taken up for refurbishment, players resumed training sessions, practising their dribbling skills, and trying to perfect their passes on the newly laid artificial turf.

The love for football is not new in this part of Chennai. The ground has served as the training space for several youngsters in and around Mullai Nagar for many years.

Now, the Chennai Corporation has given a facelift to the football ground by laying new astro turf at a cost of ₹29.60 lakh, according to officials.

It was in 2014 that the Corporation developed the ground with artificial turf, floodlights and mesh for youngsters in the locality.

However, the turf showed signs of wear and tear in the last few years, posing problems to the players.

N. Umapathy, founder and chief coach, Slum Children Sports Talent and Education Development Society, said around 300 children and youngsters from areas in and around Mullai Nagar such as Sathyamurthy Nagar and Kalyanapuram have been training at the ground. Children as young as four years of age train at the ground.

Added turf

“New turf has been laid at the existing 6,000 sq. ft. field. In addition, they have covered another 1,000 sq. ft. area that had no turf earlier. This area, located within the ground, used to get waterlogged during rains. Now, with a turf laid, the advantage is that we can accommodate more children and utilise the space for dribbling and goal-keeping practice,” he said.

He added that the Corporation completed the work two days ago after which they had resumed practice sessions. In the interim, they were practising at a nearby ground at Samandhipoo Colony.

D. Akash, a Class IX student who took to formal training in football owing to his admiration for Cristiano Ronaldo four years ago, said earlier the ground was uneven owing to the damaged turf. He loves the new and bright green turf.

Uma Shankar, a resident of Udaya Suryan Nagar, who started to train here 12 years ago and is now playing for a football club in Bengaluru, said, “The ground is really good now. It is far better than what it used to be. There is no risk of injuries for the players now,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yb18in/article30926700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THMULLAINAGARFOOTBALLGROUNDSTEDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mullai-nagars-nursery-of-talent-gets-a-new-lease-of-life/article30926701.ece
354,2020/02/27,Tamil Nadu police starts WhatsApp group to dispel rumours,"Group will also provide information on law enforcement

Several fake messages do the rounds on WhatsApp. While some are not significant, others could have an impact on law and order.

Considering the impact that such fake messages can have on society, the Tamil Nadu police have started a WhatsApp community broadcast group to dispel rumours and provide information on the activities of the law enforcement department.

Growing membership

Members can just type JOIN and send it to 9498111191 on WhatsApp and they will start receiving the broadcast messages. As on date, there are 10,000 members in the group.

“There are 12 police personnel in the Tamil Nadu police social media team and it is headed by Inspector K. Ambedkar and it is monitored by V. Vikraman, Superintendent of Police, Office Automation and Computerisation,” said a police officer.

The first message that is received upon joining is: ‘Welcome to the official WhatsApp account of TN Police. Please do not report crime here. In case of emergency dial 100. Save this number on your contacts to get regular updates. Help us to serve you better.’

“After this, the members will start getting messages on a regular basis. On normal days, it will be about the good work done by the police. Whenever there are rumours, we will design a poster and post it on the group stating that it is fake,” said the officer.

Free ride scheme

A recent message talked about the police launching a free ride scheme for women at night, between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. “It carries the control room number of the Punjab police. But people believed it and started calling the number. We are also combating it through a series of messages stating that it is fake,” the officer added.

The same messages are also posted on Tamil Nadu police’s social media handles. “We are planning to start such WhatsApp community groups at the district level too. So that rumours can be nipped in the bud itself,” he explained.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-nadu-police-starts-whatsapp-group-to-dispel-rumours/article30926693.ece
355,2020/02/27,HC summons officials to explain relaying of roads without milling,"Judges point out how platform around War Memorial has sunk below road level

The Madras High Court on Wednesday summoned the Municipal Administration and Rural Development Secretaries as well as the State Highways Secretary to the court on Friday to explain as to why most of the roads and highways across the State were being relaid indiscriminately without milling the existing tar.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan passed the order on a writ petition filed by Mayiladuthurai Chamber of Commerce seeking a direction to the local body to ensure that the civil contractor concerned laid a new road at Pattamangalam Street, a business locality, only after scrapping out the damaged tarmac.

The petitioner body complained that the shops had gone below road level due to contractors laying new roads on top of the existing tarmac in order to avoid costs incurred in milling. They also accused the civic body of not giving enough attention to the issue.

Concurring with it, the judges, in their interim order, said, that indiscriminate laying of roads without any concern for the buildings abutting it leads to inundation during rains. When residential houses and commercial buildings get flooded with water, it also leads to blockage of drainage and other consequential problems.

“The classic example is the War Memorial in Chennai. The memorial has got a platform surrounding it. In the 1980s, the height of the platform was about five feet and it was very difficult to climb the said platform from the road. In due course, the road has been repaired and relaid without milling.

“The present condition is that the height of the road has gone up and the platform has gone down. When that is the position in the arterial road in the city of Chennai, one can understand the position of the roads in other Corporations, Municipalities, towns, urban areas and villages. No contractor is milling/scraping the road before relaying the road,” the judges said.

Holding the corporation officials responsible for not properly monitoring the work done by the contractors, the judge said that the only solution to the perennial problem was that the officials concerned should be identified and taken to task whenever a contractor fails to ensure milling before relaying the road.

The judges also took note that the first Division Bench of the High Court had dealt with a similar case in 2018 when the government officials assured the court that henceforth no road would be relaid without milling.

“In spite of giving such an undertaking before the First Bench of this court and the direction issued by the First Bench, no proper steps have been taken,” the judges said and insisted upon blacklisting errant contractors.

People should also be provided with a mechanism to lodge complaints whenever roads in their locality were relaid haphazardly, they added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/m4hutq/article30926670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26FEBTHROADLAYING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-summons-officials-to-explain-relaying-of-roads-without-milling/article30926671.ece
356,2020/02/27,Trouble lurks behind the bilateral bonhomie,"Trump’s visit has aided U.S.-India ties; it has set the frame too on the extremes to which each leader will go with the other

When history looks back upon the evolution of the India-U.S. bilateral relationship through the 21st century, it will likely reflect a consensus that the world’s largest and oldest democracies held fast to a steady upward trajectory in their mutual engagement by capitalising on synergies and adroitly sidestepping roadblocks.

That assessment is certainly applicable to the current phase in the ties that bind New Delhi to Washington. U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India this week has catalysed progress on outcomes in trade, defence, security and energy cooperation even as it has implicitly set parameters on how far either Mr. Trump or Prime Minister Narendra Modi will go to publicly or privately challenge each other’s governments on areas where they have faced criticism from other quarters.

Consider first the momentum that Mr. Trump’s visit, a two-day extravaganza in Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi, has imparted. At the Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad, Mr. Trump largely stuck to script, praising the peaceful rise of India as an “economic giant” that has lifted 270 million people out of poverty in a decade. Segueing to the accomplishments of two successive Modi governments, the President went on to praise the rapid increase in Indians’ access to basic sanitation and cooking fuel and the construction of highways across the country. His comments were, in a sense, the mirror image of the words uttered by Mr. Modi at the ‘Howdy Modi!’ rally in Houston, Texas, in September 2019, when Mr. Modi went so far as to imply an endorsement of Mr. Trump for a second term in office when he said, “Ab ki Baar, Trump Sarkar”.

It’s not all hurrah

It is at this juncture that the first wrinkle in the bilateral space becomes evident. For the best part of 20 years now, India has been a policy subject of bipartisan consensus in the U.S. government, including the White House and Congress. Yet, even as the extant polarisation of public opinion was further embittered through the election campaign and first term of Mr. Trump, a section of U.S. Democrats, traditionally seen as being the party whose support for India ran deeper, began to splinter away from the mainstream on this subject.

From presidential nomination frontrunner Bernie Sanders, who said in recent days, “Instead of selling $3 billion in weapons to enrich Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed, the U.S. should be partnering with India to fight climate change,” to Pramila Jayapal, Indian-American Congresswoman from Washington state, who was denied a meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar for criticising India’s violation of minorities’ right to religious freedom, there is a growing disenchantment with several major policy planks of the second Modi government, including its Kashmir policy and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or the CAA, and the National Register of Citizens.

Now, both Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi appear politically unassailable in their respective countries presently, Mr. Trump enjoying a relatively high approval rating across multiple demographic cohorts and Mr. Modi riding strong on the wave of popular support that catapulted him to a landslide victory in the 2019 Indian general election. Yet at least as far as U.S. politics is concerned, oppositional forces to an incumbent tend to mount through a slow boil. It is quite likely that the apparent distaste for the consensus on globalisation and the economics of competitive advantage, as well as for the Bretton Woods institutions that mediated this process, grew steadily through the two terms of former U.S. President Barack Obama, and perhaps even his free-marketeer predecessor, George W. Bush.

Similarly, if Mr. Trump continues to turn a blind eye to the deep-seated concerns over allegations of human rights and religious freedom rights violations the world over, including by the current Indian administration, that would only add to the litany of criticisms levelled at the 45th President, alongside charges relating to the abuse of presidential power, obstructing Congressional inquiries and disregarding conflicts of interest. Is it thus wise for India to take a hostile position toward certain U.S. Democrats in the confidence that Mr. Trump is going to be around for a second term to bat for India’s position on sensitive matters?

Glossing over violations

Setting aside the potential stumbling blocks in the longer term, the optics of Mr. Modi playing host to an American President, including motifs of peace such as their visit to Sabarmati Ashram and the spinning of the charkha before a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, appeared jarringly insensitive given that parts of the nation’s capital were in flames over riots that had distinctively communal undertones. Rampaging mobs in the north-eastern parts of New Delhi were attacking Muslims on the streets, vandalising their shops and setting vehicles and homes on fire, even as law enforcement officials appeared to be standing by mutely, perhaps outnumbered, watching the spectacle unfold.

While Mr. Trump said in his press conference that he had discussed the CAA with Mr. Modi in their private parleys, he appeared satisfied with the assurance that the Prime Minister gave him that the issue was being dealt with. Over the longer term, this tactic of turning a blind eye to rights violations by the government of a trading partner may run afoul even of conservative elements in the U.S., including Republicans who have historically been unabashed about expressing support for religious freedom rights abroad.

Progress but also trade woes

Second, let us consider the major areas of policies in the bilateral space, where there has been substantive progress. In defence manufacturing and trade Mr. Trump’s visit has nudged a deal for India to purchase $3-billion in U.S. military equipment toward completion, including the sale of Apache and MH-60 Romeo helicopters. On security cooperation, there is much to look forward to by way of improved coordination between the two countries’ governments in terms of joint military exercises and interoperability, as well as in fighting international crimes such as drug trafficking, narco-terrorism, human trafficking, organised crime and violent extremism.

India is also set to significantly increase its energy imports from the U.S., particularly LNG, after ExxonMobil signed a deal to improve India’s natural gas distribution network.

The only area where the full potential for bilateral cooperation may not have been realised is on trade. Mr. Trump’s sharp focus on reducing the U.S.’s trade deficits with major trading partners, including India, has made for a bumpy ride in South Block over the past few years. In an escalating tariff war, Washington first slapped duties on Indian – and global – steel and aluminium in 2018, then pulled India out of its Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) in June 2019. Unsurprisingly, India responded with counter-tariffs and now U.S. dairy and medical device exporters are feeling the pain. With the White House recently reclassifying India as a “developed country” to deny it any concessions on trade subsidy investigations, and with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer cancelling a visit planned around the summit meeting, it appears unlikely that India will be returned to GSP or that even a limited trade deal might be announced any time soon.

Putting the trade deal question in perspective, Alyssa Ayress, Senior Fellow for India, Pakistan, and South Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that ultimately more economic openness would be to the benefit of not only India’s trading partners but itself.

Indeed, given the ongoing slowdown in the Indian economy, it is meaningful reform that: improves the efficiency of land and labour allocation; makes investment in infrastructure attractive, and puts job creation front and centre on the policy agenda, all of which might keep India on a strong footing vis-à-vis its strategic partners and make it unnecessary for its leaders to yield to the temptation of stirring the toxic cauldron of communal politics.

360,2020/02/27,Visit by Trump,"Several questions have been raised from various quarters on the deliverables over U.S. President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to India. But, one must know that not every visit by global political leaders can have big ticket deliverables. Nonetheless, one important question that is often raised is that: are these bilateral visits really needed when leaders hold talks on the sidelines of multilateral global events. As India rolled out a red-carpet welcome to Mr. Trump, which had the added element of a huge rally in Ahmedabad, questions were been raised on the cost of such grandiloquent shows, as the estimated cost of the ‘Namaste Trump’ event at Motera stadium was reportedly anywhere near ₹100 crores. Notwithstanding, New Delhi can take some positives out of Mr. Trump’s visit. Importantly, his visit has provided an opportunity to showcase India’s rich culture and tradition to a powerful leader, and that the country has the puissance to host such larger than life events that reach out to other nations across the globe. Also, diplomats believe that with the existing geopolitical dynamics, soft diplomacy is also required with tough negotiations to handle tricky international situations, and for that bilateral visits such as Mr. Trump’s are vital.

R. Sivakumar,

Chennai

It is to be understood that Mr. Trump is the President of the oldest and a powerful democracy. As the largest democracy, there is nothing wrong in India welcoming him with some amount of pomp and show, in keeping with our traditions. For India, cordial relations with the U.S. are of utmost importance for its citizens and for the millions of Indians working in the U.S. and for improvements in trade and commerce. If the trends are any indication, Mr. Trump could win a second term in office and developing a good rapport with him will be in the country’s interest. With international equations changing every day and China too willing to stamp its authority in the Indian subcontinent, it is better to be on good terms with a mighty superpower that is more than willing to partner with us. We have come from a stage where Richard Nixon, former U.S. President, used unparliamentary words against our former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, to a position where the U.S. President called our Prime Minister a true friend. Let not the failings of Mr. Modi on the home front obliterate the positives emerging in our bilateral relations.

That the ‘None of the Above’ (NOTA) option averaged just 1% in the last two Lok Sabha elections, despite growing aversion for certain politicians and political parties among a section of the public, proves that it has not realised its intended objective. At the backdrop of ever-increasing criminalisation of politics, one can conclusively say NOTA never forced any political party to accept the will of the people and field candidates who are known for their integrity. Even factors such as money power, muscle power, caste, religion, etc. cannot fully explain the paltry share of NOTA. It is a toothless option for sure; but, more importantly, it is a faceless option, it lacks a human element. Indeed, NOTA is not psychologically appealing to us. This perhaps stems from our primitive urge to second guess the motives and intentions of fellow human beings, all candidates satisfy that urge, for better or worse; unfortunately, NOTA does not. Hence, even if NOTA is put in the first position in the ballots, perhaps, it may not guarantee a dramatic change in the political landscape (Editorial page, “More psychological than an empowering voter option,” Feb. 26). It is the time to look beyond NOTA to clean up politics.

361,2020/02/27,All under control,"Are the sentences reported in the news item (News page, “Delhi situation under control, says Amit Shah,” Feb. 26) incomplete, or is this really what was said? When parts of Delhi are burning and many people are running away abandoning their homes and all their worldly possessions, some bureaucrats and politicians are saying that everything is under control and there is nothing to fear? The question is: under whose control? Is it under the control of leaders who have been working for many years to create communal discord in the country; or is it under the control of the law enforcement personnel? A flag march took place on Wednesday, more than three days after the violence began. Was the police’s delay in action because of lack of personnel, considering that many were on duty because of the U.S. President’s visit?

Mathew Gainneos,

The communal riots in Delhi have shown no signs of abating and the death toll too has been on the rise (Editorial, “A test of governance,” Feb. 26). Hundreds of people have been injured and looters, arsonists and anti-social elements have been having a field day targeting innocents and even the media. The Delhi police whose copybook has been blotted in recent times after they allegedly went on a rampage in Jamia, AMU, etc. have again been found wanting and their complacency in restoring law and order has only served to fuel the unrest even further. With the NCR’s administration led by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and the Lt. Governor Arun Baijal wringing their hands in despair as they have no jurisdiction over the Delhi police which reports to the Union Home Ministry, things have only been going from bad to worse. The riots had been in the offing for quite some time as the kettle had been on the boil all along. The CAA has become a pretext to agitate but what Delhi is witnessing is a full scale communal riot and the localities that have witnessed unrest are those where either the Hindus or the Muslims are in a majority. Paramilitary forces should have been called in much earlier before the situation got out of hand. The seeds of this communal conflict had been sown during the election campaign itself with leaders spewing vitriol and venom and a bitter harvest is now being reaped. The Delhi police might well choose to guard their flanks and lay the blame squarely on their political masters for lack of direction but this can by no means absolve them of guilt as their inaction has been the principal reason for the riots not only spreading to several parts of the capital but also for the violence spiralling totally out of control.

362,2020/02/27,The religion check,"One disgusting feature of the Delhi riots is that they have given rise to an unsavoury situation in the violence-hit areas where communal mobs are asking law-abiding citizens for proof of their belonging to a particular religion. This not only poses a threat to the religious pluralism in our country but also impinges on the right of hundreds of thousands of non-believers to move around freely and fearlessly. Religion should be an extremely private affair. It is not a passport to travel across the country and outside. India is a secular, democratic country where religion is not even an essential prerequisite for anyone to live sociably with others. Having said that, the chronology of events leading to the communal violence in northeast Delhi reveals a shocking pattern of police inaction, indifference and excesses. The police acted to suit the interests of their political masters. At times, the Delhi police made themselves scarce, giving the rioters a free hand. At other times, they chose to ignore the hate speeches of Ministers and leaders from the ruling party (“Violence continues in Delhi for third day, toll climbs to 13,” Feb. 26).

Abdul Assis P.A.,

Thrissur, Kerala

The violence that raged across northeast Delhi for three days on end and left over 20 dead and 200 injured exposed the religious fault-lines and the fragility of the social fabric in our country. It was instigated by rabid right-wing fanatics like Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Mishra and Anurag Thakur. The inability of Hindutva hardliners and hate mongers to bear the sight of peaceful anti-CAA protests proved very costly in terms of lives. Communal rioting or sectarian violence of the kind we witnessed in Delhi is underpinned by religious hatred, something injected into herd-like people for political gain. Evidently the rioters identified members of a particular religious community by their names, dress and looks and targeted them with lethal weapons. They consciously spared those who could prove that they were their co-religionists. One reporter ‘caught’ filming the rioting escaped from the mob unhurt by reciting lines from Hindu scriptures.

The visuals of weak and vulnerable Muslims surrounded and hit by armed mobs did not jibe with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan, Sabka Vishvas. It is a nightmare situation that citizens’ survival and space hinge on their religious identity in our ‘secular democracy’.

No riot happens unless the state wants or allows it to happen. In other words, no riot happens without the consent, connivance, complicity or collusion — tacit or otherwise — of the state. The rioters are sock puppets driven to the streets by political manipulators masquerading as community leaders. Instead of preventing the eruption of riots and quelling them, the Delhi police stood watching them passively and manifested its partisanship. The Delhi High Court pulled up the police and deservedly so.

If the Delhi violence is anything to go by, we are treading on a perilous path. A nation divided against itself for whatever reason cannot be at peace with itself; it cannot progress and prosper. The antidote to the poison of religious hatred is a large dose of humanity.

G. David Milton

Maruthancode, Tamil Nadu

A web of self-aggravating factors exacerbated by fear and hatred led to communal violence in Delhi. The immediate priority should be to restore peace and harmony in the riot-hit areas. The painful exercise to reconcile differences and heal the wounds of violence demands an impartial and fearless look at the contributing factors. While police laxity and polarised Delhi Assembly election campaign led to the build-up of a climate of suspicion and fear, one has to acknowledge that belligerent posturing and sloganeering witnessed in the course of the protracted anti-CAA protests have unnecessarily inflamed passions by stoking exaggerated fears about the government’s motives. The protesters must introspect on the wisdom of imposing their grievances, both real and imaginary, on the society far beyond what neutral observers may approve as fair and reasonable and that too in disruptive ways. They must sense the dangers of fringe elements hijacking the protests to further divisive agendas. A suspension of the protests is imperative to restore peace. If the opposition is only in respect of a single law, why not wait for judicial adjudication?

363,2020/02/27,Dance of the divine,"Artistes performed different classical dance forms as part of the Sivaratri festival in Thrissur

A wealth of young talents from across the country exhibited their artistry at the nine-day Sivaratri festival at Sree Vadakkunnathan Temple, Thrissur.

The festival opened with a Bharatanatyam recital by Shafeekudeen and Shabaana. Following a short depiction of Sankaracharya’s ‘Viswanatha ashtakam’, the dancers presented ‘Natanamaadinar’, the composition of Gopalakrishna Bharathiyar in Vasantha and Adi. The blissful dance of Siva in Chidambaram, on request by sages, was the leitmotif. While Shafeekudeen’s adavus were noted for their masculine appeal, Shabaana exuded an intrinsic feminine charm.

The Atana varnam ‘Ninne nammi naanura Krishna’ had well-balanced nritta and nruthya. The composition of Turaiyur Rajagopala Sharma was replete with anecdotes of Krishna’s life, including his childhood antics. ‘Aliveni enthu cheyvu’, the noted padam of Swathi Thirunal, was a solo by Shabaana. The performance concluded with ‘Adum padanai anudinam’, a composition of Ambujam Krishna in Latangi. A solo by Shafeekudeen witnessed a variety of striking postures of Nataraja.

Flowing movements intrinsic to Mohiniyattam were discernible in ‘Ananda Ganapathi’ with which RLV Ramakrishnan commenced his one-hour recital. The composition of Kavalam Narayana Panicker in Puranir focussed on Ganesha. Ramakrishnan’s terpsichorean talents were rich in lasya. He performed the jathis and vaytharis distinctive to the Kavalam style with élan. Sankaracharya’s Panchakshari sthothram, beginning with ‘Nagendra haraya’ in Ragamalika, had a vivid narration for each line.

The two numbers that followed were full of bhakthi. ‘Varukalamo ayya’ in Manji from Nandanar Charitam was touching. He ably portrayed the harassment Nandanar had to face at the hands of the landlord, the mood of supplication and Nandanar’s inexplicable joy over having darshan of the diety. His abhinaya soared in ‘Pibare Ramarasam’ in Ahir Bhairavi. The sancharis selected were appropriate and they included anecdotes highlighting the devotion of Valmiki, Jatayu and Hanuman.

Vindhuja Menon and her daughter Neha Rajesh | Photo Credit: KK Najeeb

Vindhuja Menon and her daughter, Neha Rajesh, opened their Bharatanatyam performance with ‘Siva shakthi’ anchored on the concept of ardhanareeswara. Vindhuja’s nritta was noted for ‘angasudha’. The piece concluded with the dancers paying obeisance to Nataraja. ‘Nandi chol’ was noteworthy on account of the mridangam syllables and adavus. The dance number concluded with the Nandi mantra, ‘Om Nandikeswaraya Nama’.

A Kuchipudi tarangam presented by the duo to ‘Neelavarna pahimam’, a composition of Irayimman Thampi in Surutti, was interesting. It provided ample opportunities for the dancers to exhibit their competence in abhinaya and nritta. Interestingly, the roles of mother and child were reversed as Vindhuja donned the role of Krishna and Neha, Yashoda. The duo performed the pancha jaathi jatis in unison. Visually, the performance could have been more appealing if the distance between the dancers was less. The recital was a rendezvous of three generations with Vindhuja’s mother, Kalamandalam Vimala Menon, at the nattuvangam.

Jaya Bhatt | Photo Credit: KK Najeeb

Jaya Bhatt’s Kathak recital began with ‘Gajanam Bhootha Ganadhi sevitham’, an invocation to Siva. It was followed by a Ganesh paran that included bols of the pakhawaj to enhance the progression of dance. Teel taal of 16 beats with Thaat was instrumental in bringing out the intricacies like kasak-masak, which depicts the rhythmic movements of wrist and chest. In Amad, the sound of the gunghurus was drowned by the high-decibel rendition of the song. However, the tihai and ladi were attractive.

The abhinaya piece ‘Eso bheji shyam rang’ was composed in Thumri. Radha disguises as Krishna and the Gopis are unable to identify her. But as Krishna is able to recognise her, she turns an embodiment of bashfulness. The concluding number, a Dhrupad piece in Atana composed by the Gundecha brothers, ‘Siva, Siva, Siva, Sankara Vasudeva’, began with salutations to Siva.

Parvathy Menon | Photo Credit: KK Najeeb

A recital of Kuchipudi by Parvathy Menon began with ‘Kapali nee’ on Nataraja. Her virtuosity in nritta was revealed as she accomplished the jatis in chaturasra, khanda, misra and sankeerna gathis, all in tisra, with exactitude. After Swathi’s ‘Sri Ramana vibho’ in Arabhi, she came good in a tarangam based on Narayana Theertha’s composition, ‘Krishnam kalaya sakhi sundaram’. Laudable was her abhinaya as the rare story of Krishna and Siva playing rasaleela was taken for sanchari. The roles of the two were reversed – Krishna, the embodiment of masculine energy, and Siva, feminine energy.

The feats on the plate while enacting the same were praiseworthy, just as her mukhabhinaya. Swathi’s bhajan ‘Visweswara’ was the last number.

Madhulita Mohapatra | Photo Credit: KK Najeeb

Madhulita Mohapatra and her disciples enthralled the audience with five rare compositions of Odissi of which ‘Shoonya Swarupa’, a solo by her, was noteworthy for its philosophical content.

The devotee yearns for the ultimate realisation of the Divine that is formless but still is manifest everywhere – in dancing peacocks, prancing deer, raindrops, Draupadi’s disrobing et al, which the dancer performed evocatively. ‘Bajuchhi Sahi Bajare’ was an exposition of abhinaya presented by Madhulita and Meghna. The sakhi warns Radha about the latter’s overtures to Krishna that had turned scandalous in the bazaar. Pallavi, the last number, was a celebration of the nuances of Odissi nritta. Named after the raga Janasammohini, it was set to Ektali. Chuzhippu was more pronounced and adavus remarkably graceful in a Mohiniyattam recital by Swapna Rajendrakumar. ‘Kottichetam’ was striking for the tandava of Siva and lasya of Uma. Madhulita, unfortunately, had to brave the fireworks in connection with Sivaratri celebrations to present her dance pieces.

While the organisers’ wanting to accommodate as many dancers as possible was welcome, it appeared counterproductive since the schedules were unduly delayed. Also, the garish backdrop of the stage was perhaps not conducive to dance performances.

Balivadham Kathakali, vocal recitals by Chenkotta Harihara Subramanian and Gayatri Venkitaraghavan and a number of Mohiniyattam recitals, especially on the day of Sivaratri, were part of the festival organised by Sree Vadakkunnathan Kshetra Upadeshaka Samithy.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/ilg0g/article30928769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvfShafeek,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/dance-performances-in-thrissur-as-part-of-sivaratri-festival/article30928773.ece
364,2020/02/27,Desi delicacies at your doorstep,"The folks behind The Table and Magazine Street Kitchen will launch a new Indian delivery service

Food Matters, the company that has launched The Table, Magazine Street Kitchen and the soon-to-launch Mei 13 is spreading its wing further, by bringing chef Amninder Sandhu onboard as its first chef partner. Sandhu is perhaps best known as the chef of Arth, the Bandra restaurant that expanded to Pune as well. She was also the only Indian participant for the Netflix show, The Final Table.

Widening the base

Says Gauri Devidayal, one half of the husband and wife duo behind Food Matters, “We’re very comfortable and very established in South Bombay and I think there’s potential to do more there.” Speaking about the decision to welcome Sandhu as the ten-year-old company’s first chef partner, Devidayal says, “We’re at a point where we’re not just starting out as a company, we’re established. Sandhu is a known talent, she’s an established chef and being rewarded for her talent. It’s not like we’re working with a new chef, and that’s why we’ve been brought her on as a partner.”

To start with, the team will be launching Iktara, a delivery service from Magazine Street Kitchen in Byculla, but there are plans to expand further, with a second kitchen opening in Colaba next month. On the menu for the Indian offerings are dishes like kebabs, chaats rolls, biryani and Indian food from a cross section of Indian regions. So, you’ll find signature dishes like the Sandhu Saab’s Chicken, Iktara Raan (flambéed with Old Monk rum), baingan bharta and biryani by the kilo for when you’re entertaining. Going forward, When asked about future plans, Devidayal laughs and says, “Its not like we brought on chef just to delivery for us.” She’s tight-lipped about future restaurant plans but seems to acknowledge the eventuality.

Bonding over food

As for Sandhu, she clearly feels a kinship for Devidayal and husband Jay Yousuf. Describing her interactions, she says, Yousuf especially, “is obsessed with chefs,” and works very closely with them, and, she, “totally gets along,” with him. The dishes at Iktara, stick with Sandhu’s food philosophy of slow cooking, the use of good ingredients. She sums up, “The attempt is to elevate the standard of food that is delivered to your home and not just compete in terms of pricing, but to up to the standard of the food.”

In the past, Sandhu has worked with people who, “Just have the money to start a restaurant,” but in this case, she says, “I have immense respect for both Jay and Gauri because of the way they’ve handled their businesses.” Devidayal and Sandhu say they’re both on the same page and it has made working together a lot easier. Devidayal ultimately sums it up as the trio having bonded over a love of food, irrespective of cuisine.

365,2020/02/27,The drama is unlimited at Proxy Bar and Cafe in Hyderabad,"The hand-picked dishes that make a dramatic entry, keep you happy and satisfied

Drama unfolds at Proxy Bar and cafe in Kondapur. Except for a glass of water nothing here is served without a dash of smoke. If you think smoke is passé, then expect your beverage, being served in a glass, covered in a stunning coloured powder. Not too keen of powders in your food? How about a dressing of a scented edible flower? Amid this, the showstopper has to be the main course — chicken curry that comes with a blanket of ash-less and smokeless fire.

Proxy Bar is a glass house and surprisingly with the rising temperature it wasn’t stifling. The outdoor seating minus the air-con too didn’t seem a bad choice. Since I wanted to laze on a couch I chose to be seated indoors. I noticed larger groups of diners (mostly office crowd) preferring the longer tables with high chairs.

Proxy is all about fusion food that makes a dramatic entry to your table. Also, considering the cocktails served here are something to look forward to, this place is what you might want to consider to hangout with your girlfriends or a with the bunch of friends who have a good appetite for food and is appreciative of foot-tapping music.

Since I was famished I ordered for their signature prawn fritters in the poutine section. The butter-garlic prawn poutine will be a delight for those who love potatoes. The prawns are served over a bed of potato fritters that are more addictive and are best as a dish to be passed around the table.

Since the chef recommended their version of KFC, I went for that as well. KFC is Kerala fried Chicken with the masala dust on top as a garnish and the fried curry leaves giving it a very homely feel.

The menu at this bar and cafe offers everything from burgers, dimsums, pasta, baked specialities, pizzas and offers roti-naans and rice with curries as well. The menu is planned in such a way that everyone in a group will have something to order.

In the menu what you should definitely avoid is the Andhra fish curry with onion-ghee pulao. This dish is served with dried bonito flakes which has a pungent taste. Stay away especially, if dry fish isn’t your No 1 preference. Otherwise, it is the rice that is flavourful, the fish and curry was anything but Andhra. Making up for this is the ‘Railway mutton curry’ that is served with laccha paratha/naan. The meat disintegrates the moment you put it you mouth. The curry is a burst of amazing flavours that are mild but come together to create a symphony in your mouth. There is a gongura mutton curry as well on the menu. Personally, I would have preferred it sour by a few more notches. Proxy’s version however cannot be dismissed. Especially while enjoying a cocktail like the super flavourful tai tai.

Proxy according to me is an apt place for a mindless fun over tons of finger food. Having said that main course shouldn’t be written off. However, it might be a bit too much of food if you want to pack most of it over one lunch or dinner.

366,2020/02/27,Why royals and Bollywood stars frequent this Dubai restaurant,"Frequented by Bollywood stars and royalty, Al Ustad has a lot more to offer than just kebabs. Though those are delectable, too.

When you walk into Al Ustad, a popular kebab joint in the heritage neighbourhood of Bur Dubai, the first thing that will catch your eye are the hundreds of photos that adorn its walls.

On a closer look, you can spot many a popular face posing with the restaurant owners, clearly happy after a satisfying gastronomical experience. The men common in all the photographs are Majeed Anssari and Shahabuddin Anssari, co-owners of the always crowded Iranian food joint. And, those posing with them are the likes of Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor, John Abraham, Arjun Rampal and Zareen Khan, to name a few. Not just Indian stars — the patrons include royalty and celebrities from across West Asia, including Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, the Crown Prince of Dubai.

What makes this Iranian kebab joint so popular? “The ambience and the taste we dish out,” says Majeed, who can easily converse in Indian languages like Hindi, Punjabi and Malayalam, apart from Arabic and English.

Mohammed Kazim, an Emirati businessman and a licensed tour guide who dines here frequently, agrees. “It’s a family-run restaurant and you get to interact with them, it’s very authentic and casual. It’s a place for everyone, which is exactly what Dubai represents. The food is also on another level: the taste is very pure to the culture they have lived in, and they use spices from the region,” says Kazim. The vibe is also a plus, with currencies from all over the world on display, as well as some vintage items.

Stars of the menu

Salman Khan and Zareen Khan have visited more than once. Majeed clearly remembers a visit by Shah Rukh Khan. “The star visited our restaurant with four of his friends and they ordered the mixed grill platter,” he recalls.

Asked about the most sought-after dishes by Indians, Majeed points to the kebabs. “Shish kebab and joojeh kebab are two dishes that are ordered most frequently by Indian visitors. The key ingredients are lime, salt, black pepper, yoghurt and, in some cases, saffron,” he says.

Majeed also shares a secret behind the taste — the meat is marinated for more than 24 hours. In a majority of dishes, dried lime is also used as a spice. Traditional Iranian dishes include mutton and chicken kebabs marinated in garlic yoghurt, as well as fragrant rice served with saffron and sumac, with a side of grilled tomatoes, onions and cucumbers. Fresh lavash is served piping hot, and for dessert, sticky dates are served with a delicious nutty sauce and mint tea.

Back for more

The food is affordable compared to other kebab joints. The cheapest on the menu is hummus, which will cost you seven UAE dirhams, while the most expensive dish is the Sultani dinner at 47 dirhams.

The restaurant receives a great flux of people through the week. There is no difference whether it is a weekday or weekend, say regulars. “It’s always full. There are no reservations, it’s first come, first served. We see about 400 walk-ins on normal days and around 500-600 people on weekends,” adds Majeed.

“I have sweet memories of this place. My father used to bring me here when I was a child. Old habits die hard and I’m a regular visitor,” says Kazim.

The restaurant was set up by Mohammed Al Ansari, who left Gerash in southern Iran for Dubai in 1941. He first ran a grocery shop and bakery in Bur Dubai before setting up the restaurant 41 years ago, working there until he passed away in 2015 at the age of 83. His sons Majeed, Shahabuddin and Taleb now jointly run the restaurant.

And, what is Majeed’s special pick for a first-time Indian visitor? “I would recommend the mixed grill for Indian tourists. It works well when you are with a group of people or your family. The platter can work for an individual and also extend to serve 7-10 people.”

And whether or not you are pinned along with King Khan on this restaurant’s wall of fame, is up to you.

367,2020/02/27,Pioneering chef Ananda Solomon brings his favourite Thai cuisine to Mumbai,"Thai cuisine once more

Chef Ananda Solomon is back to where he belongs — his kitchen in Mumbai. A man who gave Mumbai, its earliest tastes of real Thai food at Thai Pavilion in 1993, at President, Mumbai – IHCL SeleQtions, he is now set to take the city on another journey of Thai flavours, this time at his new restaurant Thai Naam by Ananda, a 96-seater, with four distinct dining areas, at The Orb, in Sahar, Andheri East.

Thai food is comfort food for him, “a way of life”. His sojourn with the cuisine began way back in the 1990s when he went to Thailand to learn at hotels and street food stalls.

Says the chef, “I love Thailand, the people, their culture and food. I have been exploring it for a very long time, but my last two years after I left Taj President, were when I saw the cuisine in a new light. I visited villages along the length and breadth of Thailand and delved deeper into the nuances of the cuisine. Different places do Thai cuisine differently today, and a lot has changed since my earlier trips. I sought answers to several ‘why’s. I interacted with chefs across age groups and saw how they all work to make sure the legacy of Thai food remains unchanged and is carried forward.”

Fresh ingredients make all the difference and Chef Ananda makes sure he gets the best selection straight from Thailand. “Luckily, I am next to the airport too, so that helps,” he says light-heartedly. On a serious note, he adds, “This cuisine is a lot about herbs and that is what makes it challenging. The food should be an experience for the diner’s nose and tongue, from the beginning till the end of the meal. I want this cuisine to grow on people.”

Much like a home, Thai Naam promises you an authentic Thai experience. A rust-red brick wall adorns the entrance, similar to the flooring in ancient Thai homes. “Art elements from northern, central and southern Thailand are reflected at Thai Naam, be it in our culinary offerings or the décor and design,” says Ananda.

The menu is intentionally limited, but abundant in vegetarian options. “I don’t want people to get confused,” he states simply. From marinated chicken morsels wrapped in pandanus leaves and fried, to a spicy mince chicken salad and steamed John Dory with lemon garlic sauce, to long green eggplant with tomato, pickled garlic, edamame and chilli, all dishes reflect his ‘less is more’ philosophy. He does not believe in doing “too much with the ingredients”.

The dishes are served in a sequence, with progression of flavours in mind. “Nothing is served without a reason, merely to fill your stomach. You must savour each morsel and taste the ingredients,” he avers.

Chefs of Ananda’s stature often stop actual cooking, but he cooks every day, and says the learning never stops for him. It is the same mantra he teaches his young team, whom he has hand-picked from Kerala for their skills.

For a man who has helmed successful restaurants, he displays the same excitement and nervousness a newcomer would, anxiously awaiting your reaction, as you taste his food. No smugness and overconfidence for this soft-spoken chef. That is what makes him Ananda Solomon.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/6h343c/article30932063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MPChefAnandaSolomonjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ananda-solomon-thai-naam/article30932066.ece
368,2020/02/27,Incredibowl in Coimbatore serves up a different salad every day,"If salads are your thing, you should get in touch with Yegammai Annamalai

Yegammai Annamalai had just delivered 30 packets of red beans and paneer salad with salsa dressing, she informs me.“Now I will watch a video and wait for the reviews. This is my reward time for the hectic work that I do in the mornings,” she smiles. The 33-year-old who has been catering for small parties for the past one year has recently launched Incredibowl. She describes it as a home made salad venture and sounds still a little surprised about how it all came about. “This happened by accident. Last month, a friend asked me if I could make her salads as she was on a diet. I did it for an entire week. Soon, the word spread and I started to get more orders. It occurred to me that I could make a business of this and I started a Facebook page,” she says.

It is not as simple as it sounds. Yegammai keeps herself updated about the salad world through the internet. “On the weekends, I do trials and decide the menu for the coming week. I try to include salads from different parts of the world like guacamole from Mexico, stir-fried-vegetables with cauliflower rice from China and raw papaya salad from Thailand. I have made nearly 20 different kinds of salads. Her guacamole has a lot of fans,” she says.

She takes pride in the fact that her vegetables and fruits are locally sourced. “The raw materials are procured everyday to retain the freshness. Salads tend to become soggy by the time they are delivered. So, I pack the dressing separately,” she says. Yegammai stays far away from ketchups and mayonnaise. “They are filled with preservatives, fat, sugar and salt. The only sweeteners that I use are brown sugar and honey.”

Yegammai makes a vegetable based salad and a fruit based one every day. Her customers, she says. “They range from age 25 to 60.” If required, she customises and replaces ingredients. For example, if she is preparing a salad for a vegan or someone who is lactose intolerant, she replaces paneer with tofu. She always consults with her clients for information about any allergies before she accepts orders. Recently she made zoodles with zucchini strips where she used an Italian sauce with herbs. Yegammai admits that sometimes she does get feedback that is critical. “One of the reviews said that my salad was bland. Now, I customise the spice levels too,” she says.

Info you can use Available from Monday to Friday

Each salad box contains 300 to 500 gm and price ranges from ₹80-₹220

The orders should be made a day in advance.

Visit www.facebook.com/Incredibowl-101498778099396/ or call 098422 80001 for orders

Some of the salads she makes are more time consuming, she says, and says the Lebanese Platter is one of them. “It is made with parsley, crushed wheat, tomato, cucumber, carrot and olive oil. It took me a lot of time to prepare. One also has the option of ordering home made pita bread as an add on,” she says. Parvathi Vaidyanathan, a customer who follows a low-carb diet has been ordering from Yegammai for the past two weeks. “These salads are light and unlike the commercially available ones are not smothered in mayonnaise and sauces. The quantity is filling and and she also customises my orders,” she says.

Yegammai delivers her salads within a six kilometre radius around Race Course. She hopes to expand her area of delivery soon. While her salads are usually ordered for lunch, she says she will also be preparing them for dinner orders soon.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/s3dqou/article30930846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOWL2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/incredibowl-serves-up-fresh-salad-every-day/article30930848.ece
369,2020/02/27,Kerala’s Ajwa Biriyani chain is now in Chennai too,". A balancing act: Kerala’s popular Ajwa Biriyani chain opens its maiden Chennai outlet. How does this Thalassery variant fare against the Madras biryani we love? We find out

Biryani lover that I am, I find it hard to decide which style is best.

Madras style, made with basmati rice and high on spices, has always been my preference. I love Ambur-style biryani where red chilli paste replaces the whole green chilli, as well as subtly-spiced seeraga samba biryani. Therefore, when I visit a newly-launched eatery specialising in Malabar or Thalassery biryani, as it is popularly known, I am admittedly sceptical.

To begin with, I could not accept this plain-looking, white colour dish being called biryani (this prejudice was to be dispelled soon). For me, biryani has to be high on drama, and come with all the paraphernalia. So when Chef Razak AC took me into the kitchen of Ajwa Thalassery Dum Biryani, I was wondering where all the cooking takes place, as the kitchen was spic and span. There were huge dabaras of various sizes, and I was puzzled where that appetising aroma was emanating from, as there was no trace of any cooking.

“We begin the preparation as early as 7 am. Preparing Thalassery biryani is a meticulous and time-consuming process that requires adequate planning and preparation,” says Razak, who along with three of his friends opened Chennai’s maiden branch of Ajwa Thalassery Dum Biryani.

Three chefs from Razak’s family take turns to come to Chennai to prepare the speciality dish everyday. The kaima rice variety is sourced from Bengal, and only ghee is used. The meat gravy, cooked on medium heat with sautéed onions, tomato and few spices, requires no oil.

“The aroma and flavour can be attributed to the kaima rice, and the three stages of slow cooking which are the most essential aspect of this style of biryani,” says Razak. The most important aspect of Thalassery biryani, however, is the dum: the mutton or chicken gravy and the cooked rice are sealed and kept aside for close to three hours.

We order mutton and the fish biryani. The chef recommends spring chicken, which is made with fresh chicken weighing anywhere between 450 to 600 grams. Our biryani arrives unassumingly, topped with fried onions and served with small portions of sweet dates pickle and onion raita. Just as the dish is cooked in layers, so it is served. “We cut it like a cake and plate it. You have to go right down and scoop out the rice and meat and place it on your plate,” says Naushad Mohamad, one of the partners. I relished the aromatic preparation, which tasted delicious. The hours (four, says the chef) spent painstakingly preparing this biryani were worth every morsel.

The date pickle, typically served with biryani in the Malabar region, is made of dates syrup with grated beetroot, carrots and green chilli. It takes a while to get the palate used to the varied tastes of the rice, meat and pickle, and once it synchronises, you begin to relish its effect on the taste buds. The flavourful, ghee-infused preparation with a hint of masala here and there, and a splash of sweet tangy date pickle provides a satisfying meal experience. For vegetarians, there is vegetable biryani and plain aromatic ghee rice or the Kerala nei choru, along with four vegetarian side dishes such as dal fry, cauliflower fry, and paneer butter masala. Completing the meal with a hot Sulaimani is a good idea.

Thalassery biryani is all about the right amount of spices, perfect cooking of the rice and finally balancing both with perfect dum. We are informed that for dinner they also serve Malabar special items such as nei pathri, puttu and Kerala parotta. But the restaurant, with a seating capacity of 60, has nothing to write home about in terms of ambience.

So has the experience made me shift loyalties? What can I say? Thalassery biryani is an experience, but Chennai biryani is an emotion.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ajwa-thalaserry-biryani-comes-to-chennai/article30930700.ece
370,2020/02/27,"The man from Italy who has taken over a restaurant's kitchen. And no, he's not a chef","Juan Jose, who is cooking at Food Exchange in the city, wants to show this part of the world what truly authentic Italian food is

In a bizarre turn of events, an inauthentic tiramisu led a diner to take over the restaurant’s kitchen.

The man in question, Juan Jose, is a long stay guest at the Novotel Chennai Chamiers Road. Of Italian and Portuguese lineage, the 47-year-old spent nearly 30 years living in the Italian municipality of Sernaglia della Battaglia and later in the city of Montebelluna. Last seen, he was whipping up his mother’s Italian recipes at Food Exchange, the hotel’s coffee shop.

“One day I tried the tiramisu here and told them not to call it that. To be fair, it tasted good, but to me, it just wasn’t tiramisu,” he says. Listing the ingredients and method with which it is made, back home in Italy, he adds that the traditional recipe does not contain alcohol.

Clearly, he seems unamused by Indianised Italian flavours. There are misconceptions, he says. “People often think we add garlic in everything; that is not true. We don’t have garlic bread in Italy,” he announces.

Another thing that leaves him visibly upset is pasta loaded with chicken, broccoli and additions. “If it is a pesto pasta, the pesto is the topping. If you want chicken just order a roast chicken on the side,” he says sounding half amused, half exasperated. As for adding seasoning and ketchup to the food... you better make sure your hands are far from them when he is around your table.

Juan loves food. He believes that if you like to eat but don’t know how to cook, you miss much of the pleasure.

“I started cooking at 24, soon after my wedding. But that does not mean my wife can’t cook,” he pauses for effect, and grinning, adds, “She is much better than I am. Sometimes when I am cooking here, I phone her to ask her for recipes.”

Juan’s family is currently based out of Canada while he has been in Chennai for almost a year on work, as an employee for Val Engineering Company. Work has also taken him to Malaysia, Denmark and Germany.

He started visiting India in early 2000. Despite having travelled extensively, Juan cheekily says, “I never eat Italian anywhere because it’s not Italian.”

After his regular day job, Juan gets back to the hotel by 7 pm and by 8 pm he dons the apron while busily giving instructions in the kitchen along with Chef Kalaiselvan Manivannan.

Today, he is discussing how to do ravioli fillings. Juan has created a dinner buffet, which has a cyclic menu for 14 days. The menu offers three different pastas, one risotto, three appetisers, three main courses, pizzas, bruschettas and of course the root cause of his existence in the kitchen at Food Exchange — tiramisu.

His version is moist, soft, rich with cacao and redolent with the flavour of coffee. “I knew I was a good cook when I realised two things: one, most things were clean in the kitchen once I was done cooking and and two, I could prepare a meal with whatever is inside the fridge,” he says.

Despite his love for all things culinary, Juan says he prefers not to make a career out of it. “It’s too much hard work,” he grins.

371,2020/02/27,Assess impact of junkyard expansion on flamingos: HC,"Court seeks report on Kanjurmarg plant from NEERI, BNHS

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday directed two expert bodies — the National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI) and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) — to assess the impact of the solid waste treatment plant at Kanjurmarg on the nearby Thane creek which is home to flamingos. They have been asked to submit a report in two weeks.

A Division Bench of acting Chief Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice N.R. Borkar was hearing a petition filed by NGO Vanshakti challenging the validity of the environment clearance that was granted to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to expand its solid waste treatment plant from its current 65 hectares to 121 hectares.

Vanshakti had contended that the expansion of the facility violated the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification of 2011 which prohibited setting up new or expanding existing solid waste treatment plants in CRZ areas, and also violated the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules, 2017, and provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act. The notification also called for setting up of solid waste treatment plants outside CRZ areas.

On September 19, 2019, a Bench of HC had stayed the environment clearance to BMC granted in October 2018 and had accepted the petitioners’ contention that SC had ordered declaration of 10-km around national parks and wildlife sanctuaries as eco-sensitive zones. However, in December 2019 another Bench had lifted the stay stating that the site at Kanjurmarg was the only place where solid waste from the city was being treated scientifically.

Vanshakti then moved SC against this order. On February 14 this year SC referred the issue back to HC asking it to reconsider and decide on the PIL quickly observing that a report from an expert body would be appropriate before taking a final decision.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/svwv4n/article30926924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMFLAMINGOS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/assess-impact-of-junkyard-expansion-on-flamingos-hc/article30926925.ece

373,2020/02/27,YMCA to start vocational training centre in Mawal,"Organisation to sign MoU with three companies to hire skilled labour

The Bombay Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) will launch a vocational training centre in Kanhe in Mawal taluka on February 29. It has also signed MoUs with three companies who will hire skilled labour from the institute.

According to YMCA, the 23,000 sq.ft. community development centre at Ambewadi in Kanhe village will provide courses on organic farming, bedside nursing, sewing, mehendi, welding, electrical works and tailoring ranging from three months to six months in length.

Paul George, general secretary, Bombay YMCA, said the organisation had carried out a survey to understand available higher educational institutions and job sources near villages. “Many villages are as far as 25 km from schools and colleges, whereas the nearest industrial training centre is 60 km away in Lonavala. We also learned that many local industries were engaged in making spare parts of automobiles and therefore it was beneficial for the people of the nearby villages to become skilled labourers,” he said.

Mr. George said YMCA started the courses in 1991 keeping the youth in focus, with equal courses for women and plans to reach out to 1,400 people every year. The centre will also have sports facilities like table-tennis and basketball, which can be used by the members. “We have also constructed a 55-acre campsite in Nilshi, which is 30 km away from the centre. The visitors can enjoy archery, ziplining, and river rafting at the campsite, surrounded by water on three sides,” he said.

Mr. George said YMCA has signed MoUs with Mahindra Accelo, Mahindra Trucks and Buses Ltd. and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. to hire skilled labour from the institute. “These companies will hire the people who learn the skill development courses from the YMCA centre. A pharmaceutical company has also assured of hiring individuals through the centre,” Mr. George said.

The organisation on Wednesday also felicitated two of its members, Sanil Shetty, a Chhatrapati Awardee and commonwealth winner for table tennis, who started his career at YMCA, and Victor Salve, who grew up at the YMCA boys hostel and now designs basketball curriculum for 38 schools in India.

“There is a misconception in people’s mind that YMCA is for a particular community. We have our facilities like hostels, shelters and orphanages in 132 countries and people from all the communities are welcomed to our centres,” Mr. George said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ymca-to-start-vocational-training-centre-in-mawal/article30926901.ece
374,2020/02/27,Mumbai woman leaves Diamond Princess for home,"138 passengers board chartered AI flight from Japan, will be quarantined in Delhi

After being stuck for 23 days on the quarantined cruise ship Diamond Princess in the Japanese port of Yokohoma, crew member and Mumbaikar Sonali Thakkar (24) finally left for India on a special Air India flight chartered by the government.

A passenger who got off Diamond Princess had tested positive for novel coronavirus, causing authorities to quarantine the ship at Yokohama from February 3. Ms. Thakkar, a Mira Road resident, was among the people stuck on the ship.

Earlier this month, her father, Dinesh Thakkar, had tweeted a video of Ms. Thakkar asking for assistance from the government, and had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to bring his daughter home.

On Wednesday, former Bharatiya Janata Party MP Kirit Somaiya announced on Twitter that Ms. Thakkar and 137 other Indians had boarded the chartered flight sent by the government to bring them back.

Mr. Somaiya told The Hindu that after Mr. Thakkar informed him of his daughter’s departure from Japan, he confirmed the news with the Ministry of External Affairs. “I was assured by the ministry that 138 people had boarded the flight and Ms. Thakkar had also shared images with me. The ministry has also said that after the flight lands in Delhi, all the passengers will be quarantined there for 14 days,” Mr. Somaiya said.

Mr. Thakkar said his daughter is in touch with the family and has not thought about quitting her job with the cruise company. “It was because of the virus outbreak that the ship had been quarantined. The cruise company is not at fault. Therefore, we will not think about her termination and are waiting for her to return home,” he said.

He said that the government could have taken this step earlier when nobody was infected on board. “Now, due to the government’s delay in the assistance mission, 16 Indians have already tested positive on the ship and therefore were not allowed to board the chartered flight,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/n043vg/article30926893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMSonali-Thakkar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-woman-leaves-diamond-princess-for-home/article30926894.ece
375,2020/02/27,Taloja jail gets forged release memo of inmate,"Document had judge’s signature, stamp

A case has been filed against unidentified persons for forging the signature of the joint civil judge of the Judicial Magistrate of First Class (JMFC) court, Vashi, on the release memo of an inmate in Taloja jail.

The case was filed on Tuesday by Ramesh Shantaram Lambe (58), Assistant Superintendent, JMFC, Vashi, for the alleged forgery of a release memo for Ubedul alias Sayyed Muddassar Sheikh.

Earlier in the day, S.J. Katkar, fourth joint judge of the junior division, had called Mr. Lambe to her chamber and told him that Mr. Shaikh, who was accused of cheating, was granted bail. She told him that since the inmate could not provide surety, the memo for his release was never made.

Ms. Katkar further told Mr. Lambe that on February 11, the jailer of Taloja jail received a release memo with Mr. Sheikh’s name on it. The memo also had Ms. Katkar’s signature, a forged stamp, and a fake outward entry number. Since the jailer found the release document suspicious, he approached Ms. Katkar, who confirmed his suspicions.

“Since the forged document did not have the inmate’s case number, the jailer met Ms. Katkar to ask her the same, only to discover that the memo was forged. Mr. Sheikh has no role in this as he is in the jail. An outsider is involved and further investigations are under way,” senior police inspector Dinkar Mohite, CBD Belapur police station, said.

The case has been registered on charges of cheating and forgery.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/taloja-jail-gets-forged-release-memo-of-inmate/article30926861.ece
376,2020/02/27,Council passes Bill making Marathi compulsory in schools,"It will be introduced in all schools, irrespective of board, from Class I to Class X from the coming academic year

The Legislative Council on Wednesday unanimously passed a Bill making teaching and learning Marathi compulsory in schools across Maharashtra.

The Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language in Schools Bill, 2020, introduced by Minister for Marathi Language Subhash Desai, will apply to all schools irrespective of the board they are affiliated to, and calls for phase-wise introduction of Marathi language as a compulsory subject from Class I to Class X starting from the academic year 2020-21.

The subject will be introduced in Class I and Class VI from this academic year and extended to further classes.

These provisions will be compulsory for schools seeking recognition or NOC from government. Schools which already have the NOC and do not teach Marathi will lose recognition. The Bill provides for a penalty of up to ₹1 lakh on schools violating this.

Usually, a Bill is introduced in the Assembly first. However, in this case as an exception, the Council chairman allowed Mr. Desai to introduce the Bill in the Upper House. It will be tabled in the Assembly on Thursday.

During the discussion, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, “I don’t think Marathi is sakti (compulsion), but it is the language of shakti (power) and bhakti (devotion). Who are these people who ask for evidence of how old the language is? Were they even born then? Marathi can even bring English to task. To conserve Marathi, it is we who need to work. We (the Thackerays) were criticised because my children studied in English medium, but my parents never taught me to despise another language. My children speak Marathi properly. Shiv Sena was formed for the very identity of Marathi and I am fortunate this is happening under my government.”

Former transport minister Diwakar Raote said, “I welcome this Bill that was originally proposed in the 1960s. I read a letter in a Marathi daily the other day that demanded that Marathi be made third language in other States as well. Government invitations these days are largely in English, when English was intended for exceptional cases. All judicial business also happens in English. The government order to have shop signages in Marathi is in English. I am glad that our government has brought this Bill.”

Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar said, “This Bill will re-emphasise the glory of the Marathi language. I request IAS and IPS offices to talk in Marathi regularly. Even now, cars are penalised for having Marathi number plates. This law penalises schools who do not implement it by ₹1 lakh, but that amount may be nothing for big schools. The law needs to be implemented strictly.”

Hemant Takle (NCP) said, “This one thing was lacking to restore Marathi’s glory, which has been done today. Some people will say this will restrict students’ growth, but it is the responsibility of the government to ensure nobody lags behind. There is a Sanskrit university and we need to try for a Marathi university.”

Many members also demanded that Marathi be given the status of a classical language.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nv6oi/article30926846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMSUBHASHDESAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/council-passes-bill-making-marathi-compulsory-in-schools/article30926847.ece
377,2020/02/27,Over 50 people detained for holding candlelight vigil,"They had gathered in Dadar to show solidarity with Delhi victims

Over 50 protesters were detained on Wednesday night after they gathered at Veer Kotwal garden in Dadar for a candlelight vigil for the victims of the violence in Delhi. They were later taken to different police stations, their personal details noted, and then let off.

At 8 p.m., around 80 people gathered at the garden. “Initially, the gathering was planned at Chaitya Bhoomi, but due to heavy police bandobast, we shifted to Veer Kotwal garden. There was no sloganeering and we were only discussing the State-sponsored violence with candles in our hand. We demanded the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah and arrest of Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra,” a 23-year-old protester from Tata Institute of Social Sciences said. The student said after around 20 minutes, the police entered the garden and started evacuating the non-protesters, and locked the garden from outside.

Women asked to leave

Another protester, not wanting to be named, said, “Only the men were detained. The women were given a chance to leave the garden by giving their personal details. I was taken to Mahim police station while some others were taken to Shivaji Park police station. We were released after the police collected our personal details.”

Meanwhile, Mumbai Police spokesperson Pranaya Ashok said, “Fifty-three protesters were detained for gathering unlawfully at Veer Kotwal garden. All of them were taken to the Mahim police station and released after taking their details.”

After the incident, the Joint Action Committee for Social Justice, said, “The detention of peaceful protesters is the worst form of authoritarianism and undemocratic behaviour. This is nothing but a naked attempt at curbing dissenting voices against CAA-NRC and the fascist powers ruling the country. We demand the police recognise the democratic rights of the citizens and help them exercise these rights.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8e8ck3/article30926824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMCHAITYABHOOMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/over-50-people-detained-for-holding-candlelight-vigil/article30926825.ece
378,2020/02/27,State to close education board set up by BJP govt.,"Decision taken under pressure, says Oppn.

School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on Wednesday told the Legislative Council that the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), which has 83 public and private schools affiliated to it, will be shut down.

The board was a project mooted by Bharatiya Janata Party leader Vinod Tawde in the previous government. The State set up the MIEB in 2018 to upgrade government-run schools and provide quality education on a par with international schools. It had decided to roll out the plan in 100 schools.

Initially, the State had plans to tie up with Cambridge Board, but it eventually decided to form its own board and set up committees to determine its framework. However, there were several allegations against the MIEB.

On Wednesday, Shiv Sena MLC Vilas Potnis raised a calling attention motion on the matter, pointing out mistakes and a lack of transparency in the board’s curriculum. He sought to know who the experts on the board were. He said that even though schools are affiliated with the board, they have not started admissions. “If the board shuts down, it will cause further trouble to students,” the motion read, demanding that the MIEB start operations.

Several members demanded a review of the board, following which Leader of Opposition in the Council Pravin Darekar said, “We don’t feel the need to shut the board, you can take a review of the matter with an expert committee.”

Ms. Gaikwad replied that there were several complaints about the MIEB administration. “It is our job to secure these children’s future. If you want, we will take a review,” she said.

Chairman Dattatray Sawant said, “Since the MIEB is not required, you (minister) take a decision immediately.”

Ms. Gaikwad then announced that the board would be closed, saying, “If you (chairman) feel something is wrong, we have to act.”

The Opposition said the decision had been taken under pressure.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-to-close-education-board-set-up-by-bjp-govt/article30926803.ece
379,2020/02/27,Constable held for rape of 25-year-old woman,"He had promised to marry her

The Rabale MIDC police have arrested a police constable for allegedly raping a 25-year-old woman from Digha on the promise of marriage.

Pravin Kate (30), who is attached with Pantanagar police, had met the victim around two years ago through Facebook. While Mr. Kate lived with other bachelors in Digha, the victim also lived in the locality with some other single women, and worked in a private firm.

The duo had been in a relationship for two years, during which Mr. Kate took her to various lodges in Thane and had a physical relationship with her by promising marriage. According to police, the constable had even enacted making her wear a mangalsutra and given it to her in writing that he would marry her.

However, in December last year, the victim came to know that Mr. Kate, who hailed from Pune, was to get married to someone else in his city. She then went to meet his family and told them that he had promised to marry her but Mr. Kate denied the claim. Later that month, the constable got married and the victim filed a complaint with the police soon after. “The accused then approached the sessions court for anticipatory bail, but his plea was rejected. After this Mr. Kate approached the High Court, but faced rejection again,” an officer from Rabale MIDC police station said.

Once the bail was rejected, Mr. Kate was arrested on Monday. The 2011 batch constable was produced before the court on Tuesday and remand in police custody till Thursday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/constable-held-for-rape-of-25-year-old-woman/article30926772.ece
380,2020/02/27,"OTP should be compulsory for rail ticket booking, says RPF DG","RBI approached to help reduce e-ticket touting; 79 racketeers arrested

Calling the fight against e-ticket touting “multilayered and multidirectional”, Director General (DG) of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) Arun Kumar, said they were approaching banks and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make it mandatory for all railway ticket transactions to be completed with a one-time password (OTP).

“There is a provision that OTP is not required for transactions under ₹2,000. We have taken this up with the RBI and asked them to have an OTP as far as railway tickets are concerned,” Mr. Kumar said during an interaction on Wednesday.

He said the force had successfully neutralised two key software — ANMS and MAC — which accounted for nearly 80% of all illegal ticketing online. “We are aware that some illegal software continues to be in the market. We are keeping a close eye on them and are working to neutralise them as well,” Mr. Kumar said. The RPF, in multiple nationwide raids, had seized and blocked 27,948 live tickets booked through MAC amounting to ₹7.96 crore and had recovered used tickets to the tune of ₹30 crore.

Mr. Kumar said nearly 79 people connected with the racket had been caught and were being questioned and added that the Tatkal window of key trains now remained open for much longer. “The Tatkal window for the two-tier AC on Pushpak Express, which runs from Mumbai to Lucknow, had shut in 4 minutes after opening at 10 a.m. on October 29, 2019, but on February 9, 2020, it took 41 minutes to be fully booked,” he said.

He said that the illegal software typically tried to bypass the digital queue on the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation website by dispensing the need to enter the captcha code and OTP while booking tickets. “We are working closely with the commercial department of the Railways as well as the Centre for Railway Information Systems to make the ticketing system more robust,” he said.

Mr. Kumar also said the RPF had increasingly started looking at cyber crime and that one of the key changes proposed would be to the Railways Act, which he said was increasing the penalty and quantum of punishment for touting.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/frqkv2/article30926757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMDGRPF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/otp-should-be-compulsory-for-rail-ticket-booking-says-rpf-dg/article30926758.ece
381,2020/02/27,Twitter war over Devendra Fadnavis’s ‘bangles’ remark,"Former chief minister retracts statement after Aaditya Thackeray demands apology

A Twitter war over a statement by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis escalated on Wednesday with Shiv Sena leader and Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray shooting off a reply only to be countered by Mr. Fadnavis’s wife Amruta. The Sena leaders too trolled her as a result.

Questioning the silence of the Sena over a communal remark made by AIMIM leader Waris Pathan, Mr. Fadnavis had said while speaking at a rally held at Azad Maidan that the ‘BJP is not wearing bangles like the Shiv Sena’ and will not keep quiet on the issue.

Reacting to the remark, Mr. Thackeray sought an apology from Mr. Fadnavis. “Shri @Dev_Fadnavis ji, normally I choose not to comment back. Kindly apologise abt bangles comment: bangles are worn by the strongest of all- the women. Politics can go on, but we need to change this discourse. Rather disgraceful coming from a fmr CM,” he tweeted on Wednesday morning.

‘Not a sign of weakness’

Speaking to reporters at the Assembly, Mr. Thackeray said wearing bangles cannot be a sign of weakness. “A woman works at office, at home, everywhere. She does things which many a time, a man cannot do. Insulting a woman by using the analogy of bangles should not happen. I demand an apology from the former chief minister,” he said. Later, Mr. Fadnavis retracted his statement.

Coming to the rescue of her husband, Ms. Fadnavis tweeted, “A cocooned worm will never understand the ‘Pun’ of life ! It’s meant to thrive on the glory of the silken life woven for its comfort by its ancestors @AUThackeray! Proud of ur struggles @Dev_Fadnavis & each and every hardworking member of @BJP4Maharashtra.”

It led to members of the Sena trolling her. “Most will not understand your meaningless pun, but hearing the cover version of Hello sure was fun ... way better than the walls that were scribbled at Varsha..;)” tweeted party spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi.

Yuva Sena secretary Varun Sardesai also tweeted, “A worm in regards to what? Being a young politician or being a dynast? Because the last time I checked, @Dev_Fadnavis was both a dynast and a young politician (youngest mayor, I guess) Did you just call your husband a worm?”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cxd91b/article30926514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMAADITYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/twitter-war-over-fadnaviss-bangles-remark/article30926515.ece
382,2020/02/27,State to set up disease control institute,"Medical college, hospital to come up in every district

In light of the novel coronavirus outbreak and the possibility of dealing with such cases in future, the government has decided to set up a State Institute of Disease Control and Prevention, the first of its kind by any State government.

At present, only one such institute, National Centre for Disease Control, is being run by the Central government.

According to officials from the Medical Education Department, the proposal for the institute is being prepared and different stakeholders such as the Public Health, Higher and Technical Education and Finance Departments will hold a discussion on it.

Proposal being drafted

An official from the Medical Education Department said, “The proposal is in a nascent stage. We are chalking out the plan and finalising the possible place to set it up. The idea was mooted after the debate on the coronavirus outbreak. The country has only one such institute and no State government deals with the issue of fighting such diseases.” The official said around 17% to 20% deaths are due to non-prevention of diseases as per the national average.

The Medical Education Department is also planning to set up a medical college and hospital in every district of the State to ensure affordable and effective medical services.

“The cost of each such college with hospital varies based on the number of beds. But approximately it will cost ₹500 crore per district to carry out the project,” said the official.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-to-set-up-disease-control-institute/article30926234.ece

384,2020/02/27,COVID-19: field surveillance stepped up to trace travellers,"Health Department tracking passengers who went undetected during screening

With the number of people infected with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) crossing the 80,000-mark globally, the State’s Health Department has stepped up its field surveillance to trace travellers who returned from regions exposed to the virus, but went undetected during screening at the international airport in Mumbai.

Dr. Pradip Awate, the State’s epidemiologist, said, “Till date, 91 symptomatic travellers have been isolated in Maharashtra and a majority of these cases were picked through active field surveillance.” While some travellers slipped under the radar at the airport, others reported themselves to hospitals.

He said, “There are housing societies and companies who call to inform us about people who have returned after travelling abroad and our staff members immediately reach out to them.”

Debunking myths

Dr. Awate cited the example of a housing society in Navi Mumbai with Chinese residents and medical officers were dispatched to check their travel history. The officers also held meetings to debunk myths and fears.

Earlier this month, a batch of Chinese students arrived at Wardha’s Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwa Vidyalay to study the Hindi language. “As the university had already alerted us about the batch, we advised them to take all the necessary measures and followed up with them for a period of 14 days,” said Dr. Awate, adding that the batch has completed their isolation period and started their year-long course.

The institute’s president, Dr. Anil Kumar Dubey, said the students were placed under isolation within the campus. “Besides the government health officials, our doctors were also constantly checking on them. None of the students had any symptoms,” said Dr. Dubey.

Meanwhile, as per the latest directive by the Central government, passengers from Iran and Italy will be screened at the airport in addition to those arriving from Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Nepal. As on Wednesday, 53,981 travellers from 441 flights have been screened at the airport.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vjpy39/article30926146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMCHINAMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-field-surveillance-stepped-up-to-trace-travellers/article30926147.ece
385,2020/02/27,BJP’s demand for resolution honouring Savarkar rejected,"Opposition MLAs rush to well of House in protest, seek ban on Congress publication for its remarks on Hindutva ideologue

Assembly Speaker Nana Patole on Wednesday rejected the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) demand for a government resolution honouring Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar, prompting the opposition party to disrupt proceedings in the House.

Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis demanded a ban on State Congress mouthpiece Shidori for allegedly insulting Savarkar. As BJP members ran into the well of the House, Mr. Fadnavis tore a copy of Shidori. Wednesday was the Hindtuva leader’s death anniversary.

Former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar had demanded a resolution honouring Savarkar, in a bid by the BJP to corner the ruling Shiv Sena, which also idolises him. The Sena is in coalition with the Congress, which has criticised Savarkar’s ideology for years.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was not present, and Congress leaders chose to not speak on the matter. Mr. Patole continued with the day’s proceedings amid sloganeering by BJP MLAs.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said Mr. Fadnavis, as CM, had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 20, 2018, and January 17, 2019, to honour Savarkar with a Bharat Ratna. “I wonder why there was a delay when the BJP was in power in Maharashtra and at the Centre. Like today, Savarkar’s death anniversary is observed every year, but never has a demand for such a resolution been made. This leads to suspicion of a political agenda,” he said.

Mr. Pawar said everyone respects Savarkar’s contribution to the freedom struggle, but not everyone agrees with some of his views.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister and Sena leader Anil Parab said the government would bring such a resolution if the Centre conferred the Bharat Ratna on Savarkar. Sena MLA Sunil Prabhu said the BJP’s love for Savarkar was full of opportunism.

As business continued with the government clearing five Bills and holding one calling attention motion on violence against women, BJP MLAs remained in the well, holding up placards and photographs of Savarkar and shouting slogans against the Sena and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. The House was adjourned after the important business of the day was over.

Outside the Assembly, Mr. Fadnavis told reporters, “I have never seen such a laachar [helpless] Sena before.” He recalled how Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray had hit a banner of Congress leader Mani Shankar Aiyar with shoes for allegedly insulting Savarkar.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ptpbop/article30926054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMASSEMBLYDAYTHREE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjps-demand-for-resolution-honouring-savarkar-rejected/article30926055.ece
386,2020/02/27,Bill on lines of Disha Act likely this session,"Officials studying A.P. law: Deshmukh

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday said in the Assembly that the State government will introduce a Bill in the ongoing budget session on the lines of the Andhra Pradesh government’s Disha Act to curb crimes against women.

Responding to a calling attention motion on women’s safety raised by MLAs across party lines, Mr. Deshmukh said, “A team of five officers of the police and Home Department is studying the Act.” He said stringent provisions like death penalty for gang rapes could be replicated.

The Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2019, seeks to complete investigation in seven days and trials in 14 working days of the crime, where there is adequate conclusive evidence, and reducing total judgement time to 21 days from the current four months. The Act also prescribes death penalty in rape cases where there is adequate conclusive evidence.

Addressing a press conference later, Mr. Deshmukh said, “Forty-eight special courts will be set up to deal with cases of crime against women. We are also planning to make a provision to appoint a special woman counsel for such cases.”

He said the Disha Act lets women can file a complaint anywhere, irrespective of the location of the crime, and makes provisions for one-stop centres and Disha minibuses. A special mobile application has also been prepared.

Mr. Deshmukh said, “We will amend the rules and make installing CCTV cameras mandatory in every new building coming up in the State. We will also connect the feed of such CCTV cameras with our existing CCTNS network.” He said 5,000 CCTV cameras will be added to the existing network in Mumbai.

Mr. Deshmukh also said that the Manodhairya scheme will be modified to include inflammatory items such as petrol and diesel used to attack women.

In the Legislative Council, during discussions on the same topic, Shiv Sena MLC Manisha Kayande raised the matter of former BJP MLA Narendra Mehta, who has been accused of harassment by a woman corporator.

Mr. Deshmukh said the government has not received an official complaint, after which deputy chairperson Neelam Gorhe directed the government to look into the case. Mr. Deshmukh said the government will take action after a detailed probe.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2m4qek/article30925993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27bmAssembly-BackbenchersFinalcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bill-on-lines-of-disha-act-likely-this-session/article30925995.ece

388,2020/02/27,Mama Mia! It’s a pizza,"What’s it like when Italy’s favourite dish makes it to UNESCO’s list of cultural heritage?

Who can say no to a pizza? There are pizzas and pizzas, but it’s the Neapolitan we are talking about. It made it to UNESCO’s list of Intangible Cultural Heritage*.

The Neapolitan pizza originated in Naples, Italy. It is prepared with simple, fresh ingredients — raw tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, basil and olive oil. Nothing else. It is cooked at high temperatures for not more than 90 seconds.

The story of the Neapolitan pizza began in Naples in 1889. The pizzaiuoli (the person who makes the pizza in a pizzeria) spins and twirls the dough in the air to oxygenate it and make it light. It is then baked in a wood fired brick oven. There are songs, stories, gestures, expressions and slang specific to the pizza makers.

A long history

In the 16th century, explorers coming back to Europe from Peru brought with them a red fruit. Initially, everyone thought it was poisonous. But, the peasants topped their flatbread with it and it became quite popular. It was the tomato.

A variation of the Neapolitan is the Marinara. Traditionally, it was prepared by the mariner’s wife (la marinara — get it?) for her husband’s homecoming. It has no cheese. It is also known as the Margherita, named after the queen. A baker named Raffaele Esposito in Naples baked it with the colours of the Italian flag — red (tomatoes), white (mozzarella) and green (basil leaves). Today, this is the classic Neapolitan pizza.

Neapolitan-style pizza typically consists of a thin and soft crust. And, if it is cooked properly at a high temperature, the crust will bubble up and be charred in spots. It is topped with sauce made from San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese made from the milk of water buffaloes and basil.

Just a slice

When the Neapolitan pizza got its status on the UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list, pizzas were distributed to everyone on the streets.

Over five billion pizzas are sold all over the world each year.

After World War II, American GIs came home from Italy with a craving for pizza, bringing the food to a broader consumer base for the first time.

Pizza chefs have their own lingo. A ball of dough that’s been stretched and is ready for toppings is called a skin, mushrooms are screamers, and slices of pepperoni are called flyers.

The 30-hour ‘Occupy Raj Bhavan’ stir by the Welfare Party of India that concluded on Wednesday evening led to chaos on the Kowdiar-Vellayambalam-Nanthencode-RR Lamp-PMG roads. Though the police diverted traffic at Vellayambalam and Kowdiar Junctions, the chaos continued on Wednesday as well, especially during peak hours. Traffic snarls were seen on the Nanthencode-Corporation Office junction and on the LMS-Mascot Square-PMG junction stretches.

Traffic diversions from TTC Junction and Devaswom Board Junction when agitations take place in the Raj Bhavan area have come in for flak from local residents.

The Thiruvananthapuram Chamber of Commerce too has come out against the misuse of the road by protesters.

S.N. Raghuchandran Nair and Abraham Thomas, president and secretary respectively of the chamber, said laxity on the part of the police in implementing the High Court order of August 19, 2011 banning meetings and agitations on roadside was causing hardship to road users.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/road-users-upset-as-stirs-lead-to-traffic-snarls/article30926409.ece
390,2020/02/27,Rani Mangammal Mahal to get facelift,"Restoration work will take at least 18 months for completion: curator in-charge

The Rani Mangammal Mahal, a heritage building housing the Government Museum in Tiruchi, is getting a facelift.

It will soon be restored to its former glory as the restoration works are being undertaken by experts at the complex.

The restoration work is being undertaken at a cost of ₹3.85 crore.

The Chokkanatha Nayak Palace, known as Rani Mangammal Mahal or Kolu Mandapam, is a mid-seventeenth century palace, built by the Madurai Nayak rulers. The palace was built by Chokkanatha Nayak and served as a Durbar Hall of Madurai Nayaks when Tiruchi was their capital.

The museum is maintained by the Public Works Department. However, the building houses the museum over the last 15 years. Until then, government offices functioned out of the building, said C. Sivakumar, Curator in-charge.

“The murals were all buried under at least 20 layers of limestone and paint. The brick structures were also covered in cement,” he said.

During some repair works undertaken in what used to be the Durbar Hall, some murals were discovered. “We then roped in a scholar from Thanjavur who helped us study the works and understand its importance. With his help, and the help of experts trained in these restoration works, brought in from Jharkhand, we have begun the work. The restoration work will take at least 18 months to complete,” Mr. Sivakumar said.

Documents, photos and texts are being studied to aide the restoration work. Natural dyes will be used to paint the murals.

The roof of the building will also be repaired. “The domes and minarets were covered in cement and flattened. We are chipping out the cement from all nooks and crannies to showcase the building as it was,"" he said.

The aim is to restore the building to its former glory and through it, showcase the vibrant history and culture of Tiruchi.

Since the works are underway, parts of the museum have been cordoned off and the exhibits packed and kept safely away. Some of the exhibits have been moved to the front.

After the restoration work is completed, the exhibits, especially those focussing on Tiruchi and its history, will be showcased, Mr. Sivakumar said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/kznpnz/article30935281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY28-11MURALS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rani-mangammal-mahal-to-get-facelift/article30935283.ece

393,2020/02/27,Surplus Annamalai varsity staff to displace BDU guest lecturers?,"‘No indication of such a move’

Guest lecturers of Bharathidasan University’s constituent college at Navalur Kuttapattu in Tiruchi and other locations in central districts on Thursday staged a protest assailing the State government’s reported move to displace them and post surplus staff of Annamalai University.

At Government Arts and Science College, Lalgudi, students joined the guest lecturers in demanding justice and job security for the teachers.

On Wednesday, the guest lecturers staged a demonstration on learning that a few surplus teachers of Annamalai University had been posted on a three-year contract under regular scales.

Expressing their anguish over the “intellectual exploitation”, the teachers raised slogans demanding regularisation of services. It was unfair on the part of the government to cause a threat to their livelihood after rendering service with duty-consciousness for several years, the protesters at Navalur Kuttapattu said.

The teachers wondered if there was any provision in the law to abandon their welfare all of a sudden after having availed their services for so long.

As guest lecturers with substantial work experience, they were well qualified and with requisite skills to be eligible for regularisation of service, they said and urged Bharathidasan University to intervene.

Vice-Chancellor of Bharathidasan University P. Manisankar said there was no indication of surplus staff of Annamalai University getting posted to the constituent colleges.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/surplus-annamalai-varsity-staff-to-displace-bdu-guest-lecturers/article30935258.ece
394,2020/02/27,Civic body shelves Mannarpuram roundabout project,"Tiruchi Corporation has shelved the Mannarpuram roundabout development project.

The project, which was finalised a year ago, was aimed at beautification of the roundabout, which is located at the entry point to the city from Madurai-Tiruchi National Highway. Besides improving the greenery of the park, the civic body had planned to establish amusement equipment for children and benches for strollers.

Since the roundabout with a plinth area of about half an acre was considered as suitable for establishing a fountain, the Corporation planned to rope in a New Delhi-based consultant to set up a musical fountain. It was expected that it would cost ₹1 crore for the project. But, enquiries revealed that the Corporation had dropped the proposal due to various reasons.

A senior official of the Corporation told The Hindu that the roundabout was owned by National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). The approval of NHAI was necessary for developing the roundabout. Though a communication was sent to NHAI initially, apprehensions were raised on the practical difficulties in maintaining and operating the public park.

Moreover, it was initially planned to tap funds available under Smart City Mission (SCM) for the project. But hurdles cropped up as the proposed area of the project was outside the purview of Area Based Development of SCM. Hence, it had been decided to drop the project temporarily.

However, the official added that the preparation of budget for 2020-21 had been undertaken. It would be released soon.

They distributed sweets to passengers waiting at bus stands and travelling in TNSTC buses in major towns such as Kumbakonam and Thanjavur on Thursday morning.

The employees also distributed pamphlets containing details of the types of buses and services offered by the corporation to elicit their patronage during the coming vacation period.

The exercise will continue over the next few weeks so as to encourage holiday revellers to utilise the services offered by the Corporation, sources said.

Bus impounded

Meanwhile, a private transport bus was impounded by a group of commuters at Vallam on Thursday morning.

A group of commuters boarded the Tiruchi-bound private bus from Thanjavur on Wednesday night and purchased tickets for Vallam. The bus crew asked the passengers to alight on by-pass road instead of dropping them at Vallam bus stand, located a km away.

The passengers and their friends intercepted and impounded the private bus, which entered Vallam around 10 a.m. to proceed to Thanjavur. As the protesters refused to leave the bus until their grievance was redressed by officials concerned, other passengers alighted and took other buses to reach their destinations.

On hearing about the agitation, Vallam police arrived and pacified the demonstrators.

Construction activities for the first phase was deliberated upon at the meeting chaired by former TIDITSSIA president N. Kanagasabapathy on Tuesday.

The government sanctioned ₹5 crore during 2016-17 as 50% grant for the facility to be set up at Panchapur and the amount is with Small Industries Development Corporation.

The trade centre will foster business opportunities for industry clusters in the entire central region to showcase their products. Besides projecting the strength of fabrication industry in the region and its state of readiness to derive utility of the defence corridor project, efforts will be made to ensure a strong presence of the textile sector in Karur, the readymade garment sector at Puthanatham, marine sector in Nagapattinam and other products the central districts are known for, S. Gopalakrishnan, TIDITSSIA president, said.

The total investment for the project was initially estimated at ₹11 crore including land and building cost. Factoring in the cost escalation, the facility has been planned to be created in phases.

399,2020/02/27,"Declining admissions, mounting loans","Private engineering colleges caught in existential crisis

Bank loans obtained by private engineering colleges in the region are turning into non-performing assets due to continuous decline in admissions in recent years.

“Repayment capacity of the colleges has taken a hit due to the trend of increasing number of students opting for higher studies in non-engineering fields,” says P. Selvaraj, secretary, Consortium of Self-Financing Engineering Colleges in Tamil Nadu.

Although the institutions intend to transform themselves into arts and science colleges, the process is fraught with complications. “This method does not seem to be practical,” Mr. Selvaraj, who is also founder chairman of Shivani Group of Institutions, points out.

But some have set the ball rolling. For instance, the management of an engineering college along Namakkal Road wound up operations and converted the institution into a school after obtaining a no-objection certificate from All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and completing the formalities prescribed by the School Education Department.

But this will not work out in all places, particularly in rural areas. Setting up schools every few km does not make economic sense, he contends.

What is more, the trend of below-average engineering students migrating en masse to deemed-to-be universities for completion of fourth year has made matters worse. Those unable to clear arrears are taking transfer certificates following increase in academic rigour put in place by Anna University.

Under the new system, only those who do not have arrears in the first semester will be allowed to study fourth year.

“Some of the deemed-to-be-universities admit students in the final year for a hefty fee and facilitate them to complete their engineering degrees at the end of fourth year. We have complained about this trend, but the State government seems to have little say over the functioning of deemed-to-be universities. We have approached AICTE,” Mr. Selvaraj says.

Barring a handful of engineering colleges, the rest face loan repayment problems in Tiruchi district. The managements are learnt to have approached the banks, seeking a moratorium on repayment.

“NPA guidelines being common for all banks, the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act will have to be invoked to recover loans,” a senior bank official says.

The maximum that the banks can do at this juncture is restructuring of loans on a case-to-case basis, the official adds.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/declining-admissions-mounting-loans/article30932233.ece

406,2020/02/27,de Bruyne leads City’s fightback against Real Madrid,"Lyon stuns a lacklustre Juventus

Manchester City pulled off a stunning late fightback to beat Real Madrid 2-1 away in Wednesday’s Champions League last-16, first leg in which the Spaniards had captain Sergio Ramos sent off late on.

Kevin de Bruyne kept his cool to beat Belgium teammate Thibaut Courtois from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute to give City the lead after Gabriel Jesus had headed home a cross from de Bruyne to pull the visitors level in the 78th minute.

Isco had given Real the lead on the hour mark following a sweeping counterattack but the 13-time European champion’s night soon unravelled, culminating in Ramos being sent off for hauling down Jesus in a bid to prevent a third goal.

Ramos will be suspended for the second-leg at the Etihad Stadium on March 17 while City’s influential defender Aymeric Laporte was forced off injured in the first half, another setback in a season marked by fitness troubles.

Pep Guardiola opted to leave his top scorers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero out of the starting lineup. Yet he turned to Sterling in the second half and the England forward earned the penalty from which de Bruyne snatched the winner.

Juventus’s hopes of reaching the Champions League last eight suffered a blow when the two-time European Cup winner slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Olympique Lyonnais.

Midfielder Lucas Tousart scored the only goal in the opening half to give Lyon, bidding to reach the quarterfinals for the first time since 2010, a deserved win.

Lacking quality

Juventus lacked quality, with Cristiano Ronaldo rarely getting into scoring positions, and it will need to improve in the return-leg if it is to progress.

After a cagey start, Lyon made a clear chance when Karl Toko-Ekambi’s header at the near post from Houssem Aouar’s corner hit the crossbar. Aouar then burst into the area and delivered a cutback that Tousart placed into the top corner from close range to put the French side ahead after 31 minutes.

Juve was at the time down to 10 men as Mathias de Ligt was getting treatment for blood on his head.

407,2020/02/27,Edwin elated with national camp call-up,"Says it was emotional to be on the pitch when he got the news

It has been a remarkable one year for Edwin Vanspaul. After playing a crucial role for Chennai City in its victorious I-League campaign last season, the 27-year-old has become a key member for Chennaiyin FC this year. He has been a vital cog in the team’s uptick in form that saw the two-time champion reach the semifinals.

On Thursday, Edwin had more reason to celebrate as he was called up for the national team camp ahead of the FIFA World Cup qualifier against Qatar next month.

“It is an unbelievable moment for me. I was in the stadium doing some promotional work when I was told about the call-up and it was emotional to be on the pitch when I got the news,” said an elated Edwin to The Hindu.

“I just want to go and learn from all the other players and do my best and hopefully get selected,” he added.

Interestingly he has been called up as a midfielder, a role he took on for Chennaiyin after playing as a defender for the first half of the season. When asked about it, Edwin said, “For now I seem to be doing well in the midfield so I am going to try and improve in this area. End of the day, I am ready to do whatever the team wants me to do.”

Even though good things have come thick and fast, Edwin is keeping his feet on the ground. “Yes this last year has been very good and things have happened fast but at the same time I know there might be potential pitfalls so I have to keep improving.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/qa0wz4/article30935331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th28edwin,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/edwin-elated-with-national-camp-call-up/article30933760.ece
408,2020/02/27,Cuadrat defends Parag miss in shootout,"Says luck was against the team and that he trusts the players

Ahead of his ISL debut in the Bengaluru FC - ATK match last Saturday, Parag Shrivas was a nervous man. To soothe his nerves, coach Carles Cuadrat during the pre-match press conference jokingly said, ‘if there is a penalty to be taken, Parag won’t take it.’

On Wednesday night against Maziya S&RC in the AFC Cup playoff, barely minutes after coming on, Parag stepped up to take the all-important first spot-kick in sudden-death. The 22-year-old didn’t even hit the target.

In hindsight, the decision to use Parag seemed baffling, for there were more experienced and cooler heads like Juanan, Nishu Kumar and Ashique Kuruniyan on the pitch. But Cuadrat defended the move.

“Players have to take decisions, they have to know how they feel and how to go for that moment,” he said in his post-match briefing. “Every coach has a different strategy. I never force players into taking penalties. In this case, Parag decided that he can shoot and Juanan decided that he preferred to wait. I trust my players 100%.

Cruel

“The luck was against us,” he added. “But the team still fought, went for the goals. Last season Rahul Bheke gave us the trophy [with the winner in the ISL final] and today he missed a penalty (in the shoot-out). Football can be cruel.”

To be part of the continental competition’s 2021 edition, BFC will have to win the ISL trophy. But there are concerns over Sunil Chhetri’s fitness. The skipper is coming back from a hamstring injury and according to Cuadrat he was scheduled to play just 30 minutes against Maziya but was forced to play close to an hour.

Optimistic

However, the Catalan remained optimistic of his team’s chances. “The pressure to win is always there. The team has had a lot of success — six titles in six years. But we have also experienced some tough moments; against Mohun Bagan (2015) we conceded in the last minute to lose the league. In the 2018 ISL final against Chennaiyin we were winning 1-0 but lost 3-2. We were very close here too, losing in penalties.

“But I trust my players. They never give up. They have special character. So we are going to try to reach the ISL final and fight for the trophy again. It may happen, it may not happen.

A rare goal from combative midfielder Lucas Tousart gave hard-working Lyon a 1-0 home win against Juventus in the first leg of their round-of-16 game in the Champions League on Wednesday.

Tousart, who was sold to German side Hertha Berlin last month but loaned back for the rest of the season, netted in the 31st minute with a neat volley from a cross by midfielder Houssem Aouar.

""We heard before the game we weren’t favourites, and rightly so. But we played very well,” Aouar said. “We’re going over there (for the return leg) with a lot of confidence.”

Italian champion Juventus is bidding to end a 24-year-wait to win the Champions League, but woke up too late in this match.

""We were second to every ball in the first half, I don’t know why. Something went wrong with our approach, I could sense from before kickoff something had not switched on,” Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci said. “We were all far from each other in the first half, making everything easy for Lyon. We need to work hard ahead of the return leg because we cannot afford another game like this in Turin.”

Still, Juventus nearly came away from Groupama Stadium with a draw.

Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo threw his arms up in the air after the referee ruled against his late claim for a penalty, following an apparent push from behind by Lyon defender Jason Denayer.

Then, forward Paulo Dybala had a goal ruled out for offside in the 87th. A minute later, he also had a penalty shout turned down even though he seemed to be pulled back by a Lyon defender.

Juve coach Maurizio Sarri was incensed by both penalty decisions, leaping up and down on the touchline. Ronaldo then waved away a fan who ran onto the field in the fifth minute of injury time, apparently trying to take a photo with him.

Ronaldo was well marked by Lyon’s defense, however, and was limited to a shot wide in a first half in which Lyon was better than the 35-time Italian champion. Lyon forward Karl Toko-Ekambi went close in the 21st when his header from a corner hit the crossbar.

Juventus defender Matthijs de Ligt walked to the side of the field in the 30th with blood pouring from the right side of his head after a teammate accidentally stepped on him following a corner. One minute later, with De Ligt receiving treatment, Lyon pounced.

Aouar cut inside down the left, beating two defenders, and whipped in a cross which Tousart clipped in despite being off balance.

The 21-year-old Aouar, praised by Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola as “incredible” when City played Lyon last season, had a speculative shot saved just before halftime.

Dybala struck a firm shot just wide of the left post in the 69th, with Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes beaten.

The return leg is scheduled for March 17, with Italy in the grip of a coronavirus outbreak. The number of cases in Italy of the fast-spreading virus from China has reached 400.

A decision was taken on Tuesday by French authorities to let Wednesday’s match in Lyon go ahead with around 3,000 visiting fans of the Turin-based club.

The decision sparked disapproval from some politicians and residents close to the stadium. France’s health minister Olivier Veran and Lyon’s club president said there was no valid reason to stop Italian fans from attending.

410,2020/02/27,UCL 2020: Kevin De Bruyne leads remarkable Man City comeback win in Madrid,"Jesus and De Bruyne on target as City fight back to win 2-1

Manchester City finally produced a Champions League performance worthy of their status as one of European football's elite clubs by beating Real Madrid 2-1 away in Wednesday's last-16 first leg after pulling off a stunning late fightback.

Kevin De Bruyne kept his cool to beat Belgium team mate Thibaut Courtois from the penalty spot in the 82nd minute to give City the lead after Gabriel Jesus had headed home a cross from De Bruyne to pull the visitors level in the 78th minute.

Isco had given Real the lead on the hour mark following a sweeping counter-attack but the 13-times European champions' night soon unravelled, culminating in captain Sergio Ramos being sent off for hauling down Jesus in a bid to prevent a third City goal.

City coach Pep Guardiola, who has not gone past the quarter-final in his three previous seasons with the club, was delighted with how his side turned the match around but also said the tie was still wide open.

“Winning in the Bernabeu gives us great satisfaction, it's incredible for us and not something this club is used to. I'm very pleased with the result and the performance, we showed great personality,” he said before sounding a note of caution. “If there is one club who was capable of turning a tie around it is Real Madrid, they have the history and experience in this competition to do it.”

Ramos will be suspended for the second leg at the Etihad Stadium on March 17 while City's influential defender Aymeric Laporte was forced off injured in the first half, another setback in a season marked by fitness troubles.

City went into the match with a two-year ban from European competition hanging around their necks for defying UEFA's rules on financial fair play although the club submitted an appeal against the sanction earlier this week.

Gleeful City fans

The visiting supporters chanted against Europe's organising body throughout the game and after they had completed their comeback the sanction had become a badge of pride for the gleeful fans.

Guardiola opted to leave his top scorers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero out of the starting lineup despite them getting a combined 40 goals in all competitions this season.

Yet he turned to Sterling in the second half and the England forward earned the penalty from which De Bruyne snatched the winner, drawing a foul from Real's Dani Carvajal.

Brazil striker Jesus led City's line from the start and had their two best chances in the first half, first drawing a save from Madrid keeper Courtois then seeing a shot hurriedly scuffed off the line by three Real players right before halftime.

Real's best chance of the first half came when Karim Benzema had a header saved by Ederson and the ball fell to Vinicius Jr. but the teenager fell over just as he was shaping to shoot into the unguarded net.

The Brazilian was not fazed by the miss, though, and played a crucial part in breaking the deadlock by chasing down Fernandinho and laying on the pass for Isco to score.

Real's fans felt they were on the familiar path to victory in their favourite competition and began to sing 'We are the Kings of Europe', but it was City, whose only European trophy came in the 1970 Cup Winners' Cup, who had the last laugh.

“There's no explanation for what happened, we had 75 spectacular minutes and in the last 15 minutes we didn't do what we needed to do, we lacked intensity and control and they had two attacks and scored twice,” said Real's Casemiro. “But the tie is not over, if there is a team that is capable of a comeback it is Real Madrid.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/hgpk2p/article30928507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1208888902THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/ucl-2020-kevin-de-bruyne-leads-remarkable-man-city-comeback-win-in-madrid/article30928508.ece

413,2020/02/27,‘Education incomplete without art and craft’,"Look alive, official urges students

Commissioner of School Education V. China Veerabhadrudu on Wednesday underscored the importance of arts and crafts in the school curriculum.

Participating in a function organised by members of the Crafts Council of Andhra Pradesh (CCAP), to distribute prizes to the winners of various craft activities organised by them in select schools, Mr. Veerabhadrudu said education was not complete with mere classroom lessons.

Referring to Mahatma Gandhi’s Nai Talim, a principle which says that knowledge and work are not separate, he said the Mahatma promoted a curriculum based on this pedagogical principle.

He said it was sad that arts and crafts in schools were on the decline. He expressed concern over growing stress only on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and said knowledge in these subjects was only a part of education. “They may get you a good job, but your education will not be complete,” he reiterated.

Mr. Veerabhadrudu egged the students on not to sit but to work. “Let your entire body partake in the education. The bookish knowledge you gain in a classroom caters to only your brain, that too only to the left brain. To educate the right brain, you need to draw, sing, dance, play and engage in other activities,” he said.

He said most children these days expressed a desire to become either a doctor, a Collector or an engineer. “But I want kids to become writers, dancers, artists and painters,” he said citing examples of badminton ace P.V. Sindhu, chess grandmaster Koneru Humpy, weightlifter Karanam Malleswari and singers like Shreya Ghoshal and Geeta Madhuri. He said children should try to master as many languages as possible and also learn at least five to six different crafts and explained to them how Gandhiji had learned 32 crafts in his life, including the art of making sandals and how he sent General Smuts a pair of leather sandals he had made in prison.

CCAP’s joint secretary S. Ranjana, executive member B. Sujatha , member G. Rashmi and others were present.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/education-incomplete-without-art-and-craft/article30928531.ece
414,2020/02/27,Finding a parking spot is a nightmare in city,"VMC can take a leaf out of GVMC’s book by waiving parking fees at commercial establishments

Parking spaces are becoming hard to come by in the city, which is witnessing a boom in the number of vehicles.

With public spaces being encroached upon in the city, including pavements, motorists are no longer finding enough places to park their cars, and as a result, are leaving their vehicles haphazardy parked on the roads leading to traffic snarls in commercial areas.

""When I stopped my car on MG Road near a shop, I was asked by a security guard to leave as the pavement was reserved for their customers. When I refused, the security person began pleading with me to move my car, saying that the management would be watching from the CCTV camera and he would have to face the heat if any outside vehicles were allowed to be parked there,"" said Y. Hemanth, a businessman.

Many establishments on M.G. Road occupy the footpaths outside and reserve the space for their customers with the help of barricades. Buildings with cellars use the space for purposes other than parking.

On the flip side, motorists tend not to use the cellar parking and leave vehicles at no-parking zones.

While there is little scope for increasing parking spaces, strict enforcement of no-parking zones and prevention of encroachments by the police and civic body respectively could reduce the severity of the problem.

Meanwhile, the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation is planning to address the issue through a ‘corridor improvement’ project.

""We are conducting a feasibility study to set up multi-level parking lots. Larsen and Toubro (L&T) is currently planning a corridor improvement project under which three ideal locations for multi-level parking would be identified. Also, across the city, road network of about 60 km (including M.G. Road and Eluru Road) would be improved with parking and footpaths as major components. Currently, traffic is being studied, and in a month or two, tenders will be called,"" VMC Commissioner V. Prasanna Venkatesh said.

On the other hand, the burden of parking fees collected by commercial buildings like shopping malls came to the fore in the wake of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation introducing uniform rules for parking vehicles at establishments.

Consumer case

Officers of VMC and the Joint Collector too are supposed to implement the suggestions made by the Krishna District Consumer Forum-II at Vijayawada. The Forum asked the authorities to consider the High Court orders and ensure free parking at malls and in its judgment delivered in February 2019 while disposing of a case filed in October 2018 by M.V. Syam Sundar of Consumer Guidance Society. The main respondent in the case, PVR Limited, has moved the A.P. State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in June 2019, and the case has been adjourned five times on the request of the appellant so far.

In the latest development, the case has been posted for hearing on September 8, 2020.

Due to a lack of legal provisions, VMC is yet able to follow the suggestions. ""We don’t have specific provisions to act against malls collecting parking fee. We have recently inspected the malls, prepared a report and sent it to our standing counsel for a legal opinion. Once we get legal backing, we can act by imposing fine or make any move against the violators,"" said Mr. Venkatesh.

""At our level, we have pursued certain malls to give up on parking charges while offering to waive property tax collected on the parking area. LEPL, which is now offering parking for free, has given us written consent. Trendset Mall is also in talks and soon it will stop collecting parking fee. We are pursuing other malls to come forward. This is a permanent solution to the problem,"" Mr. Venkatesh added.

All the malls in the city do not collect the fee for the first few minutes. As per the rules, they are supposed to specify the duration during which vehicles can enter and leave without any fee but none of the malls do so.

While all the malls provide parking in cellars, VMC, which is supposed to lead by example, collects parking fee for vehicles parked on the roadside near its commercial complexes.

VMC has established parking lots on the roadsides at NTR Complex, Gandhi Park in One-Town, Lenin Centre and other areas where minimum ₹10 to ₹30 is collected per vehicle for the first three hours. It has leased out the roadside space to a private party which also sells space via an app.

Civic officials say that it is one of their sources of revenue and imposition of the fee is necessary to ensure parking space is available for most people.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/finding-a-parking-spot-is-a-nightmare-in-city/article30925946.ece

There is a need for more interventions to improve the quality of life of the elderly, T.V.S. Rao, president of Visakhapatnam District Senior Citizens’ Welfare Association (VDSCWA) has said.

He was speaking at the inaugural of a three-day orientation programme on geriatric care for functionaries of the old age homes organised by Sneha Sandhya Age Care Foundation (ACF), Nightingales Medical Trust (NMT), Bengaluru, in collaboration with the VDSCWA, at Pradhama Hospital on Wednesday.

420,2020/02/27,Eight more model police stations mooted in Vizag,"Forensic lab may come up at Marripalem, says Police Commissioner

The city police have chalked out a major expansion and modernisation plan and the proposals have been been sent to the higher ups for approval.

Topping the bill is the plan to convert eight police stations into model ones with an estimated expenditure of around ₹1 crore each.

“We have plans to convert police stations including the ones at Arilova, Dwaraka Nagar, PM Palem into model police stations. The revived facilities will have crèches for the women staff, separate enclosures for accused, cubicles and workstations for the staff and reception centres,” says Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar Meena.

The Commissionerate has already converted the police stations at MVP Colony, Maharanipeta and Kancharapalem into model stations.

Apart from this, a Disha police station will be inaugurated at Yendada shortly and this station will house the ACP (North) office. The two-storey building has been constructed entailing an expenditure of ₹2 crore. There are plans to build an office for the DCP (Zone-I) at Madhurwada.

For tourists

The long-pending tourism police station appears to have finally moved in the right direction. The idea of having an exclusive tourism police station was mooted by former Police Commissioner T. Yoganand. “A tourism police station may come up in Jodugullapalem area. With the increase in tourist footfalls, having an exclusive police station is the need of the hour. ,” says Mr. Meena, adding that a land measuring 2,000 sq yards has been identified at Jodugullapalem.

The proposal of setting up a modern forensic laboratory equipped with facilities to deal with cyber forensic cases has also been cleared and it is likely to come up at Marripalem in a stretch of two acres.

With the implementation of the Disha Act, there is a need for a modern state-of-the-art forensic lab and this will also house the facilities for cyber forensic cases. “The proposal has been pending since long and the works are likely to begin shortly,” says a senior police officer.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/hqz1bz/article30926527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VZ3DISHAMAHILAPOLICESTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/eight-more-model-police-stations-mooted-in-vizag/article30926528.ece

422,2020/02/27,‘White-topping technology extends longevity of roads’,"Even as laying cost is more than that of bitumen roads, it can last up to 25 years: expert

White-topping the existing bitumen (BT) roads is an optimal solution to the deteriorating urban infrastructure as it will reduce maintenance cost, extend life cycle of roads and prevent accidents, Advisor to Kerala Infrastructure Investment Board and former Chairman of Indian Concrete Institute Jose Kurian has said.

The white-topped road comes between the bitumen-topped road and cement concrete (CC) road but its life cycle is as good as that of CC road, he told the media here on Wednesday.

The cost of laying one km of BT road between 3.5 m and 4 m width would be around ₹1.25 crore and it would be between ₹2 crore and ₹2.25 crore for CC roads, said Mr. Kurian, adding that white-topped roads were quite suitable to be used as internal roads in cities.

Explaining the process of white-topping of roads, Mr. Kurian said the existing road is milled and a thin layer of 100 mm to 200 mm is laid with pavement quality concrete.

“It’s a proven technology. The cost will be around 25% more than that of bitumen roads. The average resurfacing period for asphalt road is eight to ten years, while the same for white-topped ones is somewhere between 20 and 25 years,” said Mr. Kurian.

Water would damage BT road but would not affect the white-topped ones.

Mr. Kurian said the white-topped roads would reduce the braking time unlike on the roads dotted with potholes and also improve lighting.

‘Trend catching up’

“The technology is catching up slowly in India. Such roads are being laid in several places such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kerala. Around 1,000 km of white-topped roads have been laid across the country,” he said.

Engineering firms can take up pilot projects if a project of at least 300 metres of road is offered, said Mr. Kurian.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/jvr7o0/article30926438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VZ3FORMERCHAIRMANOFINDIANCONCRETEINSTITUTEJOSEKURIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/white-topping-technology-extends-longevity-of-roads/article30926439.ece

425,2020/02/27,Gauging the ghazal,"In ""Urdu Ghazal: A Gift of India's Composite Culture”, Professor Gopichand Narang attempts to construct the cultural history of the country through the most popular genre of Indian poetry

Could the incredible and multi-layered tale of social fraternising and spiritual intermingling be easily comprehended through a verse form which seemingly has the bearings of a foisted and derivative mode of creative expression? Could a chequered, vibrant and historically complex story of cultural fusion and intellectual borrowings, spreading over more than seven centuries, be made palpable through a literary genre? Here one must not grope for the answer and instead look up to the celebrated author and literary theorist Professor Gopichand Narang who says it is the Urdu ghazal and that no genre of any Indian language could vie with it on this count. The answer is cogently articulated in his meticulously researched study,""Urdu Ghazal: A Gift of India's Composite Culture”, recently published by the Oxford University Press.

The book is a thoroughly revised and updated version of the seasoned critic’s Urdu book, “Urdu Ghazal aur Hindustani Zehn-o-Tahzib” (2013), rendered into English by Surinder Deol, a well-known translator and author, with remarkable ease.

Many attempts have been made to bring forth a chronological and linear narrative of ghazal. Several critics have heaped praise on it by describing it as the most cherished art form but its thematic mannerism that refuses to be bogged down by the singularity of thought has come in for a scathing attack. For them, the ghazal is hardly more than a barbaric and wild form that always seeks to rejoice in self-afflicted pain. It talks about a wound of separation that never heals. Tearing apart the widely-held perception about ghazal, Professor Narang manifests how it has become a phenomenal opus that remarkably maps the cross-cultural terrain and soft power of India.

There is no denying the fact that ghazal continues to be adored for being a melancholic expression of unrequited love or a deeply felt exercise in nostalgia wrapped in ornate and clunky idiom with a frequent rhetorical flourish but Narang's analyses how the most-sought-after form of Urdu poetry juxtaposes the narrative of loneliness, despair and ever-soaring personal desires with the social practices of inequality, discrimination and atrocities of all sorts in a metaphorical diction.

Divided into three parts, the 500-page book, betraying a strong sense of academic rigour, dwells on the key concepts unfailingly used as nuanced tropes by the exponents of ghazal and grabs the reader by the neck and keeps his interest fully alive to the end.

Narang pertinently observes, ""The ghazal is a marvel of the magnetic dynamism of husn-o-ishq in highly charged metaphoric idiom. It is a celebration of love and freedom in an ambience of pure ecstasy and unremitting joy as well as a profound capacity for enduring pain and suffering. The ghazal is the soul of Urdu poetry and the play of creativity at its peak.”

The first chapter discusses the genesis and evolution of India's composite culture and spells out what constitutes the unprecedented fusion. Employing frame by frame approach for elucidating the historical evolution of this verse form, Professor Narang turns our attention to those aspects which escaped the attention of historians of Urdu literature. For instance, seldom does one know that Chander Bhan Brahman (1574-1662) was the first poet who composed Urdu ghazal. The author says, “Chander Bhan Brahman was also the author of the first regular Urdu ghazal. Inspired by the proto-Rekhta model of Amir Khusro, the hybrid Urdu based on the Khari dialect of Hindi had reached a stage of development by the time of Shahjahan when Urdu ghazals could be written in it.”

He has produced three of five extant couplets of Brahman. “Khuda ne kis shahar ander hamien ko laaya dala hai/n dilbar hai n saqi hai n shisha hai n piyala hai"" (in what kind of a city / God has brought me?/There is no beloved,no saqi /no cup, no wine. ) The author sounds convincing when he asserts that a composite culture requires a common language and Urdu came into being for this reason but different faiths and cultures could bear fruits without being tangled with a common language.

The second chapter proffers an insightful debate on the classical foundation of Urdu ghazal and here three seminal concepts -- love, beauty and self -- are elaborated with the verses produced by the prominent Urdu poets such as Sauda, Meer, Qayam Chandpuri,

Siraj Aurangabadi, Dard, Shah Niyaz Ahmad, Aasi Ghazipuri, Meer Taqi Meer, Mirza Ghalib, Momin, Nasikh, Bhadur Shah Zafar, and Haali. Narang does not restrict himself to uncritical paraphrasing of themes but takes pains in delineating the narrative strategy of ghazal and sets in motion a dispassionate and focused debate on metaphors, smilies, symbols and the imagery of the Urdu ghazal.

The critical acumen and refined aesthetic sensibilities are fully manifested in the last chapter where Professor Narang examines the works of the neoclassicists, the progressives and the modernist and the postmodernist with even-handed attention. The author has included many poets whose ghazals are not given recognition by the highbrow critics.

The book is a fascinating read for all who seek to get a deeper understanding of the cardinal values of India. It is perhaps the first and most rewarding attempt to construct the cultural history of the country through the most popular genre of Indian poetry and Professor Narang deserves accolades..",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/gauging-the-ghazal/article30931829.ece
426,2020/02/27,"The Red-breasted Flycatcher, is a small but feisty visitor to Delhi","The Red-breasted Flycatcher is a cute little furball, but also a magnificent hunter

The Red-breasted Flycatcher’s scientific name Ficedula parva, tells us that it is a small (parva) fig-eating bird (Ficedula). This small (11-12 cm) passerine bird of the Old World Flycatcher family therefore, can be found occasionally feeding on figs (banyan, peepal) in our urban gardens.

The bird remains quite silent in winters, but often gives itself away with its rattling ‘zrrt, zrrt’ calls, echoing in our backyards and other forest scrub patches of the city.

It is a distinct small flycatcher — males have a reddish-orange throat that extends till the upper breast, whereas the females are overall brown. Both have creamy-white underparts. Males possess a certain grey cast to crown and face, which the female lacks, but both sexes have white sides to the long blackish tail, which they often cock while perched. Another characteristic feature in this bird, is that its wing-tips are downward drooping while it is perched. (Wing tips do not generally droop and are well in-sync with the flanks.)

It is often very difficult to tell males from females for up to the first three years, as the males only develop the red colour on their throat and breast in their second or third year. Until then, they resemble females. Their wings are notably brown, with a prominent white eye-ring.

Participate in the city’s spring birdcount The city is celebrating Spring Season with the Delhi Spring Birdcount on March 1, 2020 (Sunday). To be a part of the festivity and to see and observe birds all day, send an email at ninox.edu@gmail.com

The bird breeds from spring to summer, in the deciduous mixed forests of Eastern Europe and across Central Asia. In winter months (September to March mostly), it migrates to forests, woodlands, orchards, parks, and roadside trees of the Indian Subcontinent.

These belong to the Old World Flycatcher family under the order Passeriforms (perching birds). They can be distinguished from other orders by the arrangement of their toes — three pointing forward and one backward, a design that helps them to cling onto branches efficiently.

The Red-breasted Flycatcher prefers low, open perches in trees that serve as vantage points. From here, it makes circular flights in pursuit of insects, and mostly prefers to return to the same perch.

Its hunting prowess makes me want to stand still and observe the spectacle unravelling before my eyes. Thanks to its pointed black bill (beak), the bird is quite an aerial insectivore, dashing and swooping in on insects in flight every now and then, as well as on unfortunate caterpillars in foliage. The wide array of insects beetles, butterflies, damselflies and invertebrates like spiders found in our region serves as a sumptuous buffet of sorts for the little fur ball.

Unless disturbed greatly, the Red-breasted Flycatcher may settle comfortably in certain areas protecting its territory from other similar-sized birds like Common Stonechat and sometimes Indian Robin in the vicinity.

It brings me immense joy when friends (not birdwatchers!) tell me about their experience with this bird, either in their own gardens, or in areas like Hauz Khas Fort, Deer Park, Vasant Kunj and several other areas in the city!

427,2020/02/27,Panel to study Ulsoor lake pollution,"National Green Tribunal directs study of water samples from lake, neighbouring areas

The southern bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the constitution of a joint committee to take samples of water from Bengaluru’s Ulsoor lake and neighbouring areas to ascertain whether the lake is being polluted due to illegal activity and tasked the panel with also carrying out an analysis of the water in the lake.

The NGT bench comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta made a suo moto direction based on a report in The Hindu in 2016 after schools of fish in the lake were found dead.

“The water analysis should include not only Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) limit but also the Total Coliforms and Faecal Coliforms and also the presence of any heavy metals like Arsenic, Phosphorus, etc. which are likely to affect the human health and if such things are found, suggest the remedial measures required to restore the water quality in that area,” the bench ruled.

‘Illegal activities’

The bench said The Hindu report indicated that the water quality had come down due to illegal activities being carried out while discharging untreated sewage, effluents and the dumping of garbage into the water body, affecting the quality of the water and the ecology and aquatic life, much required for ecological sustenance.

“If the quality of the water in the lake is affected, it will automatically reflect in the ground water quality which in turn affects the health of the people who are likely to consume the poor quality of water, which is not in conformity with the norms provided for drinking purpose,” the bench observed.

The committee will comprise the Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru (Urban), a senior scientist from the regional Office of Central Pollution Control Board, Karnataka State Pollution Control Board and the Commissioner, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike.

The committee has been directed to inspect the area, find out the source of pollution and take action against those responsible.

428,2020/02/27,"Miniature Crafters create vehicles, buildings and more","The group recently held an exhibition of mini versions of various models of the KSRTC buses

Christy Mathew owns more than 15 vehicles, all built by himself, while Mathews Naruvenchiyil has his own Jatayuppara rock sculpture and Eiffel Tower. Bibin Mohan takes pride in his collection of off-roading vehicles. However, all of them are miniature models.

Christy, Mathews and Bibin are members of Miniature Crafters, a WhatsApp/Facebook group for people who make miniatures. MetroPlus caught up with some of the members of the group when they were in the city in connection with ‘Aanavandi Expo’, an exhibition of mini versions of various models of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses. Among the 40-odd exhibits were models of vintage buses, such as the first ever bus launched by the Travancore State Transport Department on February 20, 1938 and the tractor-trailer, models of buses not in production and those that are currently plying the streets.

“There are 122 members in our WhatsApp group and our Facebook page has over 7,800 followers. We have members from various walks of life. All of us are crazy about automobiles. Although we have held exhibitions before, last year we thought about doing something for the KSRTC because it has been a part and parcel of Kerala for several decades now. There are people who share an emotional bond with the public transport system and we have members who are like ‘walking encyclopaedia’ on the KSRTC. We decided to tell the history of the KSRTC through our exhibits,” says Renjith Thomas, a Kochi-based software engineer who spearheads the group.

Some members of Miniature Crafters | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Miniature Crafters was “officially launched” on October 2014 after a few like-minded individuals met on Facebook. “When the film Ordinary was released, someone had posted a model of the KSRTC bus that plays an important role in the movie on Facebook. A search for the artiste eventually connected me with more such talents. Soon we decided to form a group,” Renjith says. To become a member of the forum, one has to regularly post “good models”. “We don’t entertain members who make models once in a while,” he adds.

Creative process

Usually, forex foam sheet that come in different thickness are used to make the body. Some miniatures need pieces of wood, cardboard, paper plate, chart paper, poly-carbon sheets, sponge, thermocol and the like. Spray paint, emulsion, enamel or water colour are used to paint the works.

“The design of the KSRTC buses vary depending on the route, frequency of service and branding of the buses. For instance buses that only ply in the city might have a different look from one that is used for long distance. Also, since they are manufactured at five depots in Kerala, there might be differences on account of that as well. We fixed the breadth at 16 cm for all models; length and height could vary according to the design,” explains Christy, a medical representative from Kottayam.

While some members specialise in luxury tourist buses, others are into making models of buildings, famous structures, monuments, and instruments. The members point out that it takes months to create certain designs because they have to take time out of their jobs to work on the models. “I devote at least three hours a day on one model. Sometimes it takes two to three months to finish one piece,” says Pathanamthitta-based Mathews, an operator of heavy vehicles used for construction.

The youngest in the group is Aaron Eapen, a class nine student from Kottayam. “I have enjoyed making miniature models from childhood. When I learnt about the group I immediately contacted them on Facebook. At the ‘Aanavandi Expo’ I exhibited the first KSRTC bus I made — ‘Ordinary service’. Being part of the group is a learning experience,” says Aaron.

429,2020/02/27,To a conscientious way of life,"A handloom fest brings sustainable clothing choices to the fore

There are few fabrics more comfortable than handloom in Kerala during summer, says Ratheesh KP, pointing to his shirt — purple, hand-spun, hand-woven cotton. He has been the greatest advocate of his own handloom clothing venture, Gramins Lifestyle, which sources hand-spun and hand-woven cotton fabric from weaving societies and clusters across India. “You can only sell what you believe in,” he says.

The brand, accredited by the State Government’s Responsible Tourism Mission, aims to popularise the philosophy behind handloom. “When you buy handloom, you are supporting the country’s economy; helping a weaver; helping yourself by wearing something that will not harm your skin or health; and not leaving a carbon footprint,” says Ratheesh, who is organising a handloom fest.

“The idea is to create awareness on slow and sustainable fashion, the potential of which is yet to be fully explored.”

Each weaving technique is unique to the region it comes from, he explains. “For instance, if you take khadi, the one woven in Kerala is called manila, which is thicker when compared to the one woven in West Bengal, known as muslin... Bengal muslin is the finest cotton fabric one can find in India.” Not all hand-woven clothes are called khadi, he explains. A fabric can be called khadi only if all the processes involved in its making are done by hand. Handloom clothing can have any of its processes mechanised. He adds that handloom woven in Balaramapuram and Koothampully, two of Kerala’s traditional weaving villages, are distinct in character and style. They have subtle differences in warp and weft.

All things hand-woven A four-day ‘Handloom Utsav’, will be organised by Gramins, at Ente Bhoomi, “the Green Lifestyle Mall”, opposite Valanjambalam, from February 28. The event will bring sustainable clothing to the fore and discuss its far-reaching impact on society via workshops and talks. Sessions planned include lectures on Ayurvedic clothing, sustainable fabrics and a workshop on hand-weaving. Cultural programmes will be organised in the evening. Weavers from seven States will also showcase fabric and garments in this exhibition-cum-sale.

Visitors to the Gramins store in Ente Bhoomi can watch how fabric is woven. Listed on Kerala’s RT Mission website under the “city tours” category, a two-hour package has been designed for tourists, where they can see handloom cloth being woven. A traditional Kerala meal at Ente Bhoomi is also included in the package.

A charkha-spinning workshop, led by a team from the Gandhi Grama Seva Kendram, North Paravoor, is a highlight. This will give the public a first-hand experience of charkha-spinning. “Charkha-spinning is a meditative process,” says Shiby PK, a director of Gramins and a social worker. “It is known to have benefits in eye-hand co-ordination and calming the mind. One of our long-term plans is to take charkha-spinning workshops to government schools. It could act as a tool to bring in attitudinal changes in students, as well as educate them about the country’s handloom traditions,” adds Shiby, who also associates with a number of educational projects.

The charkha at the venue, however, is a metallic new model with multiple spindles and a handle, which is turned manually.

Gramins associates with a number of handloom weaving societies in Kerala and other States. It also sources products from individuals and Self Help Groups. The event showcases muslin with jamdhani design from West Bengal, organic cotton fabric, Ponduru khadi saris from northern Andhra Pradesh (the weaving technique is a decades-old art form), patteda anchu saris, a traditional handloom weave from Karnataka, and kids’ wear in natural dyes. Handicrafts made of terracotta, screwpine, bamboo and coconut shell will also be on show.

Stating that Gramins plans to conduct such exhibitions on a regular basis to familiarise people with Indian handloom culture, Ratheesh says: “The larger aim is to nudge people to switch to a more conscientious way of life.”

430,2020/02/27,Kerala Dairy Expo gives a sneak-peak into various dairy products and milking machines,"The expo is organised as part of the four-day Ksheera Sangamam in Thiruvananthapuram

Did you know that a “natural and effective” mosquito and insect repellent could be made from cow dung? Perhaps, a bigger surprise would be bath soaps and face packs manufactured from cow pats. These are some of the “useful by-products” showcased at Kerala Dairy Expo organised as part of the ongoing four-day dairy farmers’ convention, Ksheera Sangamam, at Kanakakkunnu grounds.

“Dung from Gir cows are used for the manufacturing of such cosmetic products. The repellents also have disinfectant properties,” says Arnitha Aparna Shankar, laboratory administrator of Vaikom-based Aamro Dairies, which has come out with the products. Another product is dish wash powder.

Bringing together dairy farmers, manufacturers of dairy products and dealers of milking machines from across the State, the expo, which was flagged off on Tuesday, showcases demonstrations of modern methods and technologies aimed at increasing yield and reducing cost.

Another highlight is various dairy products, from cheese to various payasams. Sreekantan P, assistant director of the Department of Dairy Development, explains the four common types and preparation methods of value-added milk products made in Kerala – dried, fermented, cooled and curdled. The department’s stall displays some of the small eats and edibles made using these preparation methods such as paneer, peda, milk murukku, chenna murki, paneer pickle and the ever-popular lassi and so on.

In a small tank at the stall, a sheet of undulating green catches one’s attention. On closer inspection, it turns out to be tiny fern-like plants floating on the water surface. “That’s azolla ferns. It’s a good substitute for livestock feed as it’s protein-rich. Compared to cattle feed, it’s much cheaper. However, not many farmers are aware about it. It can also be easily cultivated domestically,” points out Sreekantan. Other products for display and sale at some of the stalls include ghee, dairy whiteners, milk powder, milk halwa, milk chocolate, sambhaaram (buttermilk) and so on.

Agri-tech innovations, perhaps, are the chief aspect of the expo and they include various milking machines and equipment used for pasteurization, processing and component separation such as stirrers, pipeline milking system, milk coolers, ghee clarifier, cream separator, cow grooming brush and even “an anti-kick guard” that can be used for milker’s protection. There are also battery-operated and solar-powered variants of computerised testers and analysers to check quality of milk and detect dilution. Another centrepiece is a ‘Robotic Milk Collection Unit’.

An iteration of dairy co-operative Milco’s 500-litre capacity ‘Milk ATM’ that grabbed headlines last year with its launch at Attingal to ensure “round-the-clock” supply finds pride of place at the expo. The contraption comes with multiple payment options including coins, currency and debit card. A model demonstration of airy “double roofing” of cattle sheds highlights the importance of elevated sheds that are deemed safer. This has been widely accepted post the devastating floods of 2018 that witnessed massive loss of livestock. Kerala Livestock Development Board has put up a scale model of the hi-tech dairy farm at Kulathupuzha in Kollam.

A makeshift “goshala” at the venue shelters select cow breeds such as Kankrej, Gir, Vechur and Red Sindhi. Apart from bovines, various pets and ornamental fish are also showcased as part of the expo.

431,2020/02/27,Explained | Why is COVID-19 not a pandemic yet?,"What is the World Health Organisation’s stand on the outbreak? Have most countries been able to check the spread of the coronavirus?

The story so far: On February 26, for the first time since the COVID-19 outbreak began in China on December 8, the number of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) cases reported in a single day was more outside mainland China than within the country. According to the World Health Organisation, there were 412 newly confirmed cases reported from mainland China while there were 459 cases reported from elsewhere. For the last few days, the number of confirmed cases reported from mainland China has come down even as the spread of the virus has seen a sudden increase outside China. For instance, the total number of confirmed cases in China increased from 74,576 (deaths at 2,118) on February 20 to 78,497 (deaths 2,744) on February 27.

Globally, there are 82,549 cases and 2,810 deaths as on February 27.

Besides mainland China, how many countries have reported at least one confirmed case?

As on February 27, 3,346 confirmed cases have been reported from 49 countries.

On February 27, Brazil in South America and Algeria in Africa reported their first infections. Except Antarctica, novel coronavirus cases have been reported from all continents. In the past week, 20 countries have confirmed their first coronavirus cases.

At 16, Europe has the most number of countries that have reported at least one case. In just one day, seven European countries — Estonia, Greece, Denmark, Norway, Georgia, N Macedonia, and Romania — reported their first cases on February 27. As on Thursday, 621 cases and 16 deaths were reported from Europe. While there was a gradual increase in the number of cases in Europe between January 24 (three cases) and February 22 (63 cases), the cases spiked since then — from 63 on February 22 to 621 on Thursday. The numbers nearly doubled from 270 on February 24 to 509 the next day.

Twelve countries/regions — mainland China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam, Cambodia and Philippines — belonging to the WHO West Pacific region have reported at least one case.

There are nine countries — Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman and UAE — in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region that have reported novel coronavirus infections. Only five countries — Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Nepal Taiwan — in the WHO South-East Asia region have reported SARS-CoV-2 infections. In the Americas, cases have been reported from only Canada, the U.S. and Brazil.

Which countries outside mainland China have large number of cases?

South Korea has the most number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections — 1,766 (and 13 deaths) outside mainland China. Italy (528), Iran (245) and Japan (189) are the other countries with most number of cases.

About a week ago Hong Kong and Singapore had the most number of cases but that has since changed. But these two countries appear to have largely contained the spread, with Singapore reporting 93 and Hong Kong with 92 cases as on February 27.

Since the virus has spread globally, will WHO declare COVID-19 as pandemic?

In a press briefing on February 26, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made it abundantly clear that WHO will not declare COVID-19 a pandemic at this moment. He said: “We should not be too eager to declare a pandemic without a careful and clear-minded analysis of the facts. Using the word pandemic carelessly has no tangible benefit, but it does have significant risk in terms of amplifying unnecessary and unjustified fear and stigma, and paralyzing systems.”

He then added: “It may also signal that we can no longer contain the virus, which is not true. We are in a fight that can be won if we do the right things. Of course, we will not hesitate to use the word pandemic if it is an accurate description of the situation.”

By not calling it a pandemic right away, he did clarify that it does not mean WHO considering the spread to be less serious. He said: “I am not downplaying the seriousness of the situation, or the potential for this to become a pandemic, because it has that potential. Every scenario is still on the table. On the contrary, we are saying that this virus has pandemic potential and WHO is providing the tools for every country to prepare accordingly.”

When was the last time a pandemic was declared?

A pandemic is defined as the worldwide spread of a new disease. The last pandemic reported was the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, which killed hundreds of thousands globally. Unless it is influenza, WHO generally avoids declaring diseases as pandemics. This change came about after the lessons learned from the 2009 H1N1 experience.

According to 2017 pandemic influenza risk management guidelines, the WHO uses pandemic influenza phases — interpandemic, alert, pandemic and transition — to “reflect its risk assessment of the global situation regarding each influenza virus with pandemic potential infecting humans”.

Have some countries contained the spread?

All countries that have reported even one case should primarily focus on containing the spread of the virus, the WHO chief said. Fourteen countries have managed to contain the spread of the virus and no new case has been reported for more than a week. And nine countries, including India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, have not reported any additional cases in the last two weeks, he said. This highlights that the virus can be stopped in its track if countries take appropriate and timely actions.

What steps should countries take to stop the virus from spreading?

The priority should be to detect cases early and isolate people who test positive for the virus. Once a case is detected, the focus should be to trace the contacts and treat them if already infected. Since the molecular test is not highly sensitive and can return false negatives, people who have returned to India or have come in contact with people who have tested positive should be made aware to seek immediate medical care once symptoms show up. Though the average incubation period is five-seven days, a few have shown up symptoms at the end of 24 days. Efforts should also be focussed on preventing outbreaks in hospitals and spread in the community. One way to stop the spread in the community is to avoid mass gathering in enclosed spaces.

The Ministry of Health has advised people to avoid all non-essential travel to countries where community spread of the virus is reported, particularly Singapore, South Korea, Iran and Italy. According to February 13 release, the Health Ministry has been following up passengers travelling from China, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and Japan for a period of 28 days.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/wa6bcy/article30935933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SARS-CoV-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/explained-why-is-covid-19-not-a-pandemic-yet/article30935934.ece
432,2020/02/27,Earth captures new ‘mini moon’,"Earth's new neighbour is not in a stable orbit around the planet and is unlikely to be around for very long

Earth has acquired a second “mini-moon” about the size of a car, according to astronomers who spotted the object circling our planet.

The mass — roughly 1.9-3.5 metres (6-11 feet) in diameter — was observed by researchers Kacper Wierzchos and Teddy Pruyne at the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey in Arizona on the night of February 15.

“BIG NEWS. Earth has a new temporarily captured object/Possible mini-moon called 2020 CD3,” likely to be a C-type asteroid, Mr. Wierzchos tweeted on Wednesday.

The astronomer said it was a “big deal” as “this is just the second asteroid known to orbit Earth [after 2006 RH120, which was also discovered by the Catalina Sky Survey].”

Its route suggests it entered Earth's orbit three years ago, he said.

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Minor Planet Center, which collects data on minor planets and asteroids, in an announcement said “no link to a known artificial object has been found,” implying it was likely an asteroid captured by Earth's gravity.

“Orbit integrations indicate that this object is temporarily bound to the Earth.”

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk said the car-sized object was not the Telsa Roadster he launched into space in 2018, which is now orbiting the Sun.

“It's not mine,” he tweeted.

Earth's new neighbour is not in a stable orbit around the planet and is unlikely to be around for very long.

“It is heading away from the Earth-moon system as we speak,” Grigori Fedorets, research fellow at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland, told New Scientist magazine, and was likely to escape in April.

433,2020/02/27,I do not think of my work as a woman scientist or a man scientist: S. Geetha,"One of the senior-most female scientists in VSSC, she opens up on how technically competent women erase all gender barriers in different sectors

“As an engineer in Control Design Division in Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) Thiruvananthapuram, it was my first project on September 20, 1993 for which I had done the autopilot design that guides the satellite into its pre-decided orbit. Imagine my disappointment, shock and anxiety when that launch, PSLV D I, failed,” recalls S Geetha, Programme Director, Space Transportation System at Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), Thiruvananthapuram. Even now her face mirrors that disappointment.

The next minute, with a smile, she asserts that she did not let that incident crash her dreams of making a career as a space scientist. “Instead, our team was involved in the analysis of what went wrong and that exercise turned out to be an opportunity to learn at close quarters how different teams worked in close coordination for a successful launch. That was an excellent way of learning. Once the next launch was a success, we moved ahead with other projects,” recalls the 58-year-old with a smile. Since then, Geetha has been flying high and is now one of the senior-most female scientists in VSSC.

“I am an engineer and scientist. I do not think of my work as a woman scientist or a man scientist. I have always wanted to work here, especially after my elder brother, G Ayyappan, began working in VSSC,” Geetha says.

Eye on goals

That determination and dedication resulted in her winning laurels and awards such as the ‘Best woman engineer in 2008’, ‘Best woman scientist in 2016’ and ISRO merit award in 2018 and so on. “One of the best aspects of VSSC is that right from the junior-most engineer to the senior-most scientists, every one is encouraged to contribute and work towards a goal. So all of us have a sense of ownership and team spirit. For a mission to be successful, several teams have to work together and there is a lot of planning that calls for accuracy and precision. Nothing should go wrong. Even then until the lift off takes places smoothly, we are all tense and on our toes. It is a critical moment and even though I have been part of several launches and seen quite a few, that tension and anxiety are as fresh as ever,” Geetha admits.

She breaks into a big smile when she recalls her first visit to Sriharikota and saw the PSLV at close quarters. “The feeling is indescribable. This is something we have also worked for and it is an impressive sight,” she says.

At present, she is responsible for programme planning and management of the PSLV, “the work horse of ISRO and prestigious GSLV Project of the country for injecting INSAT series of satellites in Geo Synchronous Orbits. The designs have been flight proven in 31 flights of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle [PSLV] and nine flights of Geo Synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle [GSLV],” she explains.

She says among the several duties of her team, taking care of the launch vehicle, choosing the best for the job, ensuring that it takes the satellite to its orbit and so on are just some the manifold functions of the team. When there is a goal to be met, Geetha says that she finds herself thinking about it even at home and then she jots down her thoughts on paper to take it up at a later stage.

National Science Day is observed on 28th February to commemorate the discovery of the ‘Raman Effect’ by Sir CV Raman on 28 February 1928. Science Week is also observed along with the National Science Day. The first National Science Day was celebrated on February 28, 1987.

The theme of National Science Day 2020 is ‘Women in Science’.

With 64 engineers comprising seven teams working with her, Geetha says she has to lead by example. She avers that it is the passion for their work that helps them overcome hurdles and meet any challenge.

“It is true that I was the first woman associate project director of a GSLV project but on the job, there is no thought about gender. One has to be technically competent,” she points out. Even then the fact remains that women comprise only 15 per cent of the scientific community in VSSC.

Role model

She says women have to express their views and participate in discussions. Geetha says in her case, her mother, Shakunthala, who retired as headmistress of Government School Vattiyoorkavu, was herself the best mentor and role model.

“I firmly believe that for a woman to be successful in her career, a support system is essential. In my case, my mother-in-law, also a teacher, was of great help while I was doing my postgraduation from the College of Engineering Trivandrum. When my daughter, Vineetha, now a student of visual communication in Chennai, was a baby, we again had wonderful people to help us,” Geetha says.

Looking back, she says with great candour that she never dreamt that one day she would drive a car, travel alone and lead a team. “I tell my team to dream high and work hard. What is exciting about our work is that it is never repetitive. There are innovations and it is exciting to see the designs and innovations you have suggested being implemented,” she explains before signing off to move on to the next meeting on her busy schedule.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/wmz23r/article30931100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvmGeetha,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/space-scientist-s-geetha-on-creating-her-own-space/article30931101.ece
434,2020/02/27,"Women have to work doubly hard to prove themselves in most workplaces, says EV Soniya, winner of National Bioscientist Award","She talks about her work in DNA fingerprinting and how her deep interest in molecular biology helped her make a mark in her area of expertise

Numerous phone calls later, one gets to speak to Dr. EV Soniya as she in the midst of preparations to travel to Delhi to receive her award for the National Woman Bioscientist Award for her pioneering work in DNA fingerprinting. Chief Scientific Officer – Molecular Forensics and DNA Technologies at the city-based Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB), Soniya says it is a lifetime achievement award for various assignments for which she led her team. “And it is a recognition of my leadership skills, for my institution and my team,” she says modestly. The award is in recognition of her research contributions and their application to society.

Though the award is gender-based, Soniya, does not want to focus on that aspect and would much rather talk about her work and its impact in different areas and it is always the ‘we’ that she highlights. “We are not a nine-to-five team. It is the passion for our work that has sustained the team led by our director M Radhakrishna Pillai and that has helped us meet some tough challenges,” she says.

Soniya believes it was that deep interest in her research that sustained her through the tough years of child-bearing and parenting. She feels that many of the women of her generation had to go through that phase to pursue a career. “It was not easy. But how many people have the opportunity to work in a field they enjoy? I know many bright men and women who did not get that chance to work in an area that challenges and motivates them,” she emphasises.

Pragmatic and ambitious at the same time, 54-year-old Soniya asserts that women would have to help themselves and not expect to have things done for them.

Dual responsibility

“That said, women usually bear the responsibility of running a home and are the primary caregivers once they have children. That dual responsibility is a reality in my generation. Moreover, usually, if the husband has a transferable job, it is the wife’s career that takes a hit. These are also some of the reasons why women are poorly represented in science and in the higher echelons of research,” she believes.

Born in a conservative joint family in Thrissur, Soniya had always been a bright student and an active participant in extra-curricular activities. She remembers how her mother, Sreedevi, an exceptionally bright student, was forced to leave school after class ten to become a wife and homemaker. So Sreedevi was keen that her three children do well in academics and go in for higher studies.

Daily wonders of DNA “Genetic analysis at the molecular level is one of the most effective methods for management of endangered animals and plants. Complaints regarding the identity of the elephants were a problem for the Forest Department. So they approached RGCB to develop a marker-based DNA fingerprinting of elephants in captivity. After collecting blood samples of all the captive elephants, we gave them a database with a unique DNA fingerprint of each captive elephant. Each elephant was given an ID card with its name, the name of the owner, other details and a QR code. If you scan the bar code on your phone, all the details of the elephant can be accessed. With this, the Forest Department could easily identify an elephant. This is the first time in India that DNA data has been included in ownership details of captive elephants. We also developed a protocol to DNA fingerprint wild elephants using dung and tusk samples, to help solve wildlife crimes, including poaching and illegal trade,” explains Soniya.

“After class ten, I chose science with the vague idea of studying medicine. It was not the age of the information glut and so we had no idea about the options and choices open to us. Eventually, I took up Botany for graduation and post-graduation,” she recalls.

Her teachers suggested she did her PhD. “But research did not necessarily lead to a job, and unless one had the exposure, studying abroad was not so easy to come by then,” she says.

Marriage to PK Govindan Potti, an engineer in Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, brought her to Thiruvananthapuram and in 1990, Soniya enrolled for her doctorate in the University of Kerala. “Fortunately, my husband supported me and parenting was a shared responsibility. Even today, we give each other that space to pursue our individual careers,” she says.

In 1995, she completed her doctorate and got the chance to work on a two-year project at the Central Tuber Crops Research Institute. Two years later when the project ended, she got a lucky break. RGCB had just come into existence and she got selected as a research associate. “It was in its nascent stage and we had to work mostly on our own and do our own research. The late Dr MR Das, founder-director of RGCB, had told us that we had to take up research in new realms of our specialisation. I took a little time to find my feet but once I found my niche, I understood the scope and expanse of my work. That is when my work no longer became work. It was intriguing and I was fascinated by the doors it opened,” she says.

Closure through Science Soon after the Puttingal fireworks tragedy, when 111 people were killed after a pyrotechnics display went awry in a temple, RGCB’s help was sought to help identify the victims through DNA fingerprinting. “The work had to be completed at the earliest as the victims’ relatives needed some kind of closure. Moreover, there were damages to be paid and identification was crucial for that. The tragedy happened just a few days before the festival of Vishu and many of us spent Vishu at work. A team from RGCB visited the place to collect blood samples from relatives. Although, in some cases, there was little to go by and the work was heartbreaking, we were able to meet the deadline,” she recounts.

Beginning with delving into molecular biology and biotechnology of spices such as black pepper and ginger, she moved on to more intricate detailing of plants involving the identification of certain genes and enzymes.

“I am interested in understanding the molecular mechanisms working behind the interactions of plants with both biotic and abiotic factors, especially the plant-pathogen interactions and plant stress responses, and the molecular details of metabolic pathways for the production of secondary metabolites,” reads her profile on the website of RGCB. Publications in prestigious journals helped in gaining a reputation in her domain. At present, she is working on a project titled ‘GenomeIndia: Cataloguing the Genetic Variation in Indians.’ She comes into her own when she is talking shop. Gender discrimination and inclusivity do not really feature much in her conversation. “Well, women have to work doubly hard to prove themselves. That is true of most workplaces and not only in laboratories,” she feels.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/uz8cgs/article30931402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvmSoniya2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/in-conversation-with-ev-soniya-winner-of-the-national-woman-bioscientist-award/article30931403.ece
