0,['24/01/2020'],"I may have missed out on opportunities by not attending parties, but I don’t regret that: Suniel Shetty","Bollywood actor Suniel Shetty was on a self-imposed break for a few years — a time well-spent with his father, whom he lost thereafter — until his recent comeback with the multilingual Pailwaan , alongside Kichcha Sudeep . His return to films has also heralded in a new phase in his career, as he branches out into other industries. He’s already done Darbar with superstar Rajinikanth and is part of Mohanlal’s Malayalam film Marakkar as well. Amid all this excitement, Suniel made a quick trip to Bengaluru to be a part of a sports injury conclave, during which we caught up with him for a quick chat on films, fitness and fashion, and also tells us why he thinks Bengaluru has changed. Excerpts…I have been a proud father right from the day they began school. They were well-behaved, humble, respectful students. Mana (his wife) has brought them up beautifully. Ahan and Athiya grew up around their grandparents, and have learnt good values amid love and affection. What I am happy about is that they chose their careers and trained for it.A lot of people had expressed their concern over girls being in films (referring to Athiya). But I believe that as long as you are brave and confident, you can handle anything in the world. I remember being asked at a press meet once, “The film industry is such a shady place. What advice do you give your daughter about it?” I replied, “I don’t give any advice to my daughter at all. Instead, I advise my son to treat women well.” If everyone does that, there is no cause for concern.There is no such trend in Bollywood, but when a team is working together, there is a tendency to meet up. But I stay further away from the city, and the journey back home is long and tiring. Also, I am very lazy, so I often skip going to such get-togethers. Once my shoot is done, I head back home and spend time with my family. On Saturdays, I usually catch up with my childhood friends. I have some amazing friends in the industry as well. I meet them whenever there is time.I may have missed out on a few opportunities by not attending parties, but I don’t regret that. Sometimes, you need to make a choice in life, and I choose family over anything else. In my career, there was a four-year period when I did not work, but those were also the most beautiful four years of my life, because I spent time with those whom I love the most. And during that time, the media did not forget me. When a certain movie has done well and you ask me how I feel, I would say that I am feeling good. But in a movie like Darbar, I know that it has done well mainly because of Rajinikanth sir. Similarly, Pailwaan was a big hit, and the credit for its success goes mainly to Kichcha (referring to Sudeep). I accept that. I think I am in the happiest phase of my life. I respect everyone, but I am not insecure.I sport a man bun, because I have hair on my head (laughs). If you are a sportsperson or an actor, you need to have your own style statement. There were times when we dictated fashion, but now fashion dictates us. The brands tell you what to wear, how to walk. I am old school, and I’ll stay that way. I will wear my hair and my beard the way I like it.Actors speak up on matters that we feel need to be talked aloud. Many artistes even voice their opinions through their films/craft. Having said that, things do get a little taxing, sometimes; expecting actors to call out every time doesn’t make sense.Hera Pheri 3 is in the making. There are certain issues regarding the film, but all three of us — Akshay Kumar Paresh Rawal and myself — are working towards making it happen. There’s also an American film, titled Fraudsters. The story is inspired by a massive call centre scam that happened in India.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73548414,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-204570/73548414.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/i-may-have-missed-out-on-opportunities-by-not-attending-parties-but-i-dont-regret-that-suniel-shetty/articleshow/73548414.cms
1,['24/01/2020'],I am writing something for Telugu fans at present: Siddharth,"Given that he first tasted financial success in Tollywood , with Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana Siddharth has quite a following in the Telugu-speaking states. But the actor hasn’t done a straight Telugu film for the past six to seven years. Quiz him if he intentionally decided to focus on Tamil films during these years and he says, “I’d be lying if I say I planned all this. After Rang De Basanti, I was asked why I hadn’t moved to Bombay.,” he recalls, adding, “I was already in Hyderabad then. And I can’t live in two cities.After that, I moved to Chennai, and I’m being asked why not be in Hyderabad as well. I want to work in different languages, but I want to be in one city only.”So, is there any plan for a Telugu project in the near future? “I’m currently writing something for Telugu fans, and there are definitely plans to do films in Telugu. In fact, my current films are all tailor-made to work in both Tamil and Telugu,” says Siddharth, adding that his Telugu audiences are wonderful. I realise I have a beautiful audience there to whom I haven’t made a film for in some time. But if you look at the long game, all these are inconsequential,” the actor adds.There will come one film that will change things. I started in Tamil, then went to Telugu and worked there for seven years without coming to Tamil. Then, I came to Tamil and have been doing films here for seven years without going to Andhra. I don’t know what’s going to happen next.

5,['24/01/2020'],"Filmmaker Rajasenan says, the brilliance of writer Raghunath Paleri and actors like Jagathy made the dialogues memorable","I had finished Ayalathe Adheham and was waiting for a good project.That’s when Jayaram told me that lyricist Gireesh Puthancherry has the thread of an interesting story with him. When I enquired about it, I came to know that producer Goodnight Mohan has already bought it from him. I called him, he said, “I had presented it to many, but the film didn’t get made. If you are interested, you can buy it from my office.” I went to his office and bought the four-page thread, which was interesting.I had an offer from Mani C Kappan and told him I have a story. By then, I developed this four-pager into a 15-page story. I asked Raghunath Paleri also to join us and all of us liked it. We further developed it in Chennai, and that’s when some of the important characters of the story were born, and we named the house, Meleparambil. Raghu named it. I asked him, why not add Aanveedu also to it? When I called Mani C Kappan and told him the title, he said it sounds different and nice, lets finalise it.Then we started with the casting. Generally, one would first think of someone like Thilakan for the role of the father in the family. But from the time we were discussing the story, I had the face of Narendra Prasad sir in my mind. When I called him to talk about it, he said, “I am doing villain roles now. How will such a father’s role be suddenly accepted? Moreover, there is a humour element too.” I told him, “That’s what makes it different”, and he agreed to play the role.As for the evergreen dialogues in the film, from ‘Velaikkariyayirunthalum Neeyen Mohavalli,’ ‘Ente garbham inganalla’ to ‘Amme pant pant,’ the credit goes to scriptwriter Raghunath Paleri. He is someone who goes deep into the psyche of characters and writes poetic dialogues and conversations. When talented artistes like Jayaram, Narendra Prasad and Jagathy Sreekumar deliver it, they also gain a special, memorable personality of their own. That’s why so many dialogues of one film is still used by people. There are certain scenes which has Raghu’s signature, like the one in which Jayaram tells Shobana, “Ingane okke aakumennu arinjirunnenkil nee ardharathriyil kondu vanna kuthira vandiyil njan kerillayirunnu”. It indirectly says, wrapped in humour, that it’s a cross that he took on his shoulders, but with wonderful cinematic impact.While reading the script, the dialogue that made me laugh the most was the one Jayaram says to Shobana, ‘Nee njan Gulf il aanennu vicharichal mathi’. The time in which this film was made, it had a lot of weight. It wasn’t a time in which Gulf Malayalis took their family to the Middle East and many experienced a kind of longing and waiting period of two to three years to meet.On the location, we laughed the most when Jagathy performed the ‘Amma pant pant’ scene and the one in which he runs into the water and says, ‘Baakki nanaju poyi.’The location was Kunnathuveedu in Vaniyanpuram, Ottappalam. Film’s like Kamal’s Peruvannapurathe Viseshangal were also shot there earlier. But, we also attached a veranda to it, as many important scenes like the climax happens there.Innocent was supposed to play Janardhanan’s role in the film, initially. It’s when we started shoot in Pollachi that Innocent called me saying he got another film as a hero, around the same time and should be excused from this project. We needed a replacement in nine days. That’s when I remembered the face of Janardhanan, who was on a train with me a few days ago. I could immediately see him as someone who is aged and unmarried. When I called to tell Raghu about the same, he said, “I think Janardhanan would be a better fit, than someone with a Thrissur accent amid characters speaking a mid-Travancore dialect.”The Tamil portions were written first by Raghu and later translated to Tamil by K Balachander’s associate Bhanu Das, who knew the language well. There is a scene in which Pavizham’s dad Gounder tells Harikrishnan that though he doesn’t know how Harikrishnan’s family would accept Pavizham, he has accepted them. He says the dialogue, ‘Orothikku oruvanthaan enpathu Tamizh panpaadu,’ which means, ‘One man for a woman is the Tamil culture’. I feel not even Tamil movies would they have used one sentence to summarise the Tamil culture in this manner.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73549063,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-439303/73549063.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/filmmaker-rajasenan-says-the-brilliance-of-writer-raghunath-paleri-and-actors-like-jagathy-made-the-dialogues-memorable/articleshow/73548792.cms

8,['24/01/2020'],An actor’s career is about ups and downs: Sindhu Loknath,"In an industry where actors are not only expected to dole out at least one film a year, but also be ‘busy’ with work all the time, as out of sight can be out of mind, Sindhu Loknath ’s journey of working on Kaanadante Maayavadanu has spanned over three years. She has not had a release in this time, but when she was not shooting for this film, she was busy starring in a musical (she played Charlie Chaplin in a performance last year), and globe-trotting. As she is set to bounce back from this ‘break’, Sindhu chats with us about her journey in films, the need to stay positive through tough times, and why despite the long wait, this movie will be a benchmark in her career...I started shooting for this film in 2016, and due to the untimely death of Raghava Uday , the antagonist in the film who drowned on the set of Masti Gudi, the project was on hold for a while. It was quite a jolt for all of us. Nearly 80% of the movie had been shot and only the climax remained, so we were in a fix as to how to move ahead. The makers then decided to reshoot the second half with Bhajarangi Loki replacing Uday. And few new elements were added — we shot a song in Kashmir, and elaborate sets were erected for some sequences, all of which was time consuming. After that, of course, the VFX work also took time. People believe that actors need to be constantly busy, but we have ups and downs too. Sometimes we have packed, back-to-back schedules and other times we have months of break. An actor’s life does not have a set routine and after nine years in the industry, I am used to the nature of work. Having said that, the past few years have also been an emotional time, because having a project stall just short of the finish line and then struggling to release it, after completing it eventually, can take a toll on you. It has not been easy, but I try to stay positive and believe that there is a lot more in store for me. I am really glad that the movie is finally ready for release and hope this paves the way for more opportunities.The movie is a fantasy love story between a ghost and a human being and is a commercial entertainer. It was a pleasure to work with this team. I have collaborated with Vikas before and since he was involved with Kaanadante Maayavadanu from the scripting stage, he knew the subject inside out and would help me out with scenes. I have known Raj, the director, from our days on the set of Lifeu Ishtene . He was a part of Yogaraj Bhat sir’s team. Raj loves fantasy films, and that’s the genre this movie falls in.2020 has just begun and I hope the year has good things in store for me. Right after Kaanadante Maayavadanu, I have another film and a musical to look forward to. Apart from that, I also have my solo trips; I am soon heading to Bhutan. Travel keeps me calm. Whenever I feel low, I head out on a trip. It helps me find peace and discover new cultures and places.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73548148,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-228424/73548148.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/people-need-to-understand-that-an-actors-career-is-about-ups-and-downs/articleshow/73548148.cms

BEIJING: China on Thursday locked down five cities, including Wuhan , suspending all public transport in an unprecedented move to contain the coronavirus that has infected over 630 people and left 18 others dead, dampening the celebrations of the Lunar New Year On Thursday evening, Chinese officials announced suspension of public transport in five cities - Huanggang, Ezhou, Zhijiang, Qianjiang and Wuhan in Hubei province, official media reported.Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the virus is believed to have first emerged, has no trains or planes in or out.Nationwide, a total of 18 people have died. While 17 of them died in and around Wuhan, one death was reported from outside Hubei -- the virus epicentre.According to the health commission in northern Hebei province, which borders Beijing, an 80-year-old man diagnosed with the new virus died on January 22.The victims' average age was 73, with the oldest 89 and the youngest 48. So far 631 cases have been confirmed in 25 provincial-level regions in the country.The government has sealed Wuhan and Huanggang, a prefecture level city with over 7.4 million people, in an unprecedented effort to curb the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus. The other three cities too have substantial population.From 10 am on Thursday, all public transportation, including city buses, subways, ferries and long-distance coaches in Wuhan were suspended, and outbound channels at airports and railway stations closed until further notice.The city officials have asked people in both the cities not to leave. Wuhan is a major transportation hub and home to many universities.The Wuhan lockdown is a cause of concern for Indian students who still remained there. The city has about 700 Indian students, majority of them studying medicine. However, most of the students have apparently left for home for the holidays.As concerns grew over their safety, the Indian Embassy on Thursday opened helplines and established contacts with the concerned Chinese officials to ensure food and other supplies for those who remained in the city.In new disclosure, Chinese officials on Thursday confirmed fresh cases of coronavirus in people who did not even travel to Wuhan recently.The National Health Commission also reported increasing number of cases with no exposure to Wuhan's Hunan seafood wholesale market, which is believed to be related to most of the infected cases. The cases without confirmed exposure to the market have been found overseas.The virus, which a doctor in Wuhan told BBC is spreading at an alarming rate, has dampened the Chinese New Year celebrations beginning Friday.Chinese all over the world formally bid goodbye to the year of the pig and welcome the year of rat on Friday. The Chinese government has given week long holiday.In view of virus scare, several cities including Beijing have cancelled special events. The festival is also known as the Spring Festival.Large cultural activities during spring festival in Beijing such as temple fairs were cancelled to prevent the spread of the virus, state-run Global Times reported.An official statement said that Beijing's sprawling imperial palace 'Forbidden City' will close on Saturday until further notice to ""avoid cross-infection caused by the gathering of people"".A Chinese government announcement said citizens in Wuhan and Huanggang should not leave without specific reasons.As medical consumable such as surgical masks, protective clothing and disinfectant are running short, the Red Cross Society of China's Wuhan branch opened a 24-hour hotline to receive donated emergency stocks.All residents in the province have been ordered to wear masks.""Staff of state organs, enterprises and institutions shall wear masks at work, and operators of public venues should set up eye-catching signs to request residents to put on masks before entering,"" said a notice issued by the Wuhan municipal government.""Those who disregard the warning will be punished according to relevant laws and regulations,"" it added.Many local residents are busy purchasing food and daily necessities for the festival, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.According to the provincial commerce department, the Hubei province will strengthen the monitoring of grain, oil, meat, eggs and vegetables, increase stocks during the spring festival holiday to ensure stable supply, and intensify environmental sanitation control.Hubei Province has alone reported 444 cases of coronavirus infections. All 17 deaths were reported from the province.Among the confirmed cases, 399 patients are receiving treatment in hospitals, with 71 in severe condition and 24 in critical condition, said Yang Yunyan, vice governor of the province.Confirmed cases have also been reported from several regions including Xinjiang and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, as well as in the US, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Vietnam.The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Wednesday extended to Thursday its emergency talks on whether the coronavirus outbreak in China constitutes a public health emergency of international concern.Lauding China's immediate detecting and sharing of the sequencing of the virus, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus believed that those actions will ""minimize the chances of this outbreak spreading internationally.""",world,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73563177,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-336227,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/china/china-seals-five-cities-to-halt-spread-of-virulent-coronavirus-as-cases-climb-to-over-630/articleshow/73562398.cms

Poulomi Das (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)

Model turned actress Poulomi Das pretty much enjoys being a part of the daily soap scenario. The talented actress has worked in several television shows including Aghori, Dil Hi Toh Hai, Suhani Si Ek Ladki etc. She was recently in Lucknow to promote her upcoming show which is based on the life of a girl with a dusky complexion. Poulomi, who also happens to be dusky in real life too, is not just confident in the show but also very confident and sanguine in general. An elated actress said that she was quite happy to be doing a show where she gets to flaunt her actual complexion with much ease and poise.The dusky beauty spoke at length about skin colour and the whole taboo around dark skinned people in the industry. Speaking about people getting bullied for their (dark) colour, she said, “I was first made aware of my dark complexion when as a kid I had gone to attend a wedding with my family. This aunty just looked at me and told my parents that ‘your daughter is so beautiful. She’s slightly dark though. Don’t you think that’s a problem?’ and as an innocent 6-7 year-old I asked her why it’s a problem and whether it needs to be addressed medically. After that she was silent as she couldn’t answer my question. Later on my father told me that it’s no medical issue and it’s a colour I’ve been gifted with and is normal. Also, jab gora bolna gaali nahi hai toh kisi ko kala bolna gali kaise hua?”Poulomi Das (BCCL/ Aditya Yadav)“Right from school I was a tomboy with short hair and stuff. I never really got bullied and if at all anybody would dare to say something, I’d stop that person right there. However, if anyone would still say anything to me about my dusky complexion, I’d just tell them that they need to be well informed and that my melanin is way higher than theirs, which is good keeping in mind that there are lesser chances of me getting cancer or even tanned,” added the actress with a laugh.The actress, who was in Lucknow to promote her show Kartik Purnima , also revealed that she never felt the need to use fairness products on her skin and ubtan was the only thing her mom ever applied on her face to make it glow. Poulomi said, “I used to ask my mother whether it’s possible to transform your colour by using a fairness cream and she would bluntly say ‘no’. She would say that it’s not possible in real life. According to my mom, fairness creams do not make anyone fair, you are born with your colour and you need to love it.”Talking about people using products to become fair, Poulomi spoke, “I can’t say for others, but personally I feel it’s a waste of time and money. Plus, I love my melanin, it’s beautiful and so healthy, even scientifically. I don’t want to get rid of my melanin. I feel people should stop endorsing fairness creams. However, I’m glad to see that the commercials are getting better with time and aren’t just centered around complexion.”She further added, “Although I’ve been cast in other shows before this, a lot of times when I’d go for auditions, people would say things like we’re looking for a North Indian girl. In my head, I used to wonder who is this stereotypical North Indian girl? How does she look? So I won’t deny that a bias for fair complexion is there. It very much is, but it’s changing gradually. Hopefully, we’ll get to see women of darker skin tones also playing leads in TV shows. I’ll try to bring about that change,” added Poulomi with a wink.— with inputs from Yashi Agarwal",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73552454,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-229544,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/you-are-born-with-your-colour-and-you-need-to-love-it-poulomi-das/articleshow/73552492.cms

17,['24/01/2020'],Rassasy By Barcelos: Restaurant Review: Rassasy By Barcelos,"One of the greatest perks of my job? Interacting with you, my reader. Even better is dining with you as my foodie blind date. And of course, being in constant touch (like I have been with many a reader) is the best upside.Here’s the biggest downside... a disappointing restaurant and pronouncing it so. So while I was happy to catch up with a long-time loyal reader and that too on Shilpa Chawla’s birthday, we were disappointed by the restaurant’s food. The lovely, lively Shilpa, a social media influencer, loves micro blogging and has been exploring new restaurants for the past 18 years, which is roughly the time she has been in touch with me. I went back alone to Rassasy By Barcelos, several weeks later, ordered across the menu and, once again, the mish-mash of a menu did not pass muster.Tucked into the gleaming ORB right next to the international airport, the large space is brightly done up. Its wide 28-feet bar offers a range of drinks. Artworks adorn the walls, reflecting the good old days, and there’s a separate smoking lounge, too.Italian, Portuguese, Mexican, American... you name it. However, only four dishes (amongst the long winding multi-cuisine menu) passed muster.Chicken mince meat balls were moist and tasty, smeared with slightly sweet tangy tomato sauce. Quesadilla with corn paneer? Thankfully, tasty and generously portioned, too. Chicken Espetada on a skewer was succulently tasty one dinner and overcooked the next. Hearty Italian stallion chicken sandwich. The African influence is present in the choice of four peri peri sauces. There are plenty of cocktails as well.Can anyone get guacamole so wrong? So bitter? On my second visit, guacamole wasn’t available. Can Tiramisu be rancid? Cheesecake, too? Below average thick, chocolaty Opera.Avoidable, dry biscuity base pizza. Overcooked aglio olio pasta. Intriguing ‘Black Burger’ is stodgy. Lacklustre Trinchado Portuguese curry with rice Avoidable, seriously small chicken wings with peri sauce and peri mayo.Rassasy By Barcelos, the intriguing name of this African chain of restaurants propelled us from South Mumbai to the airport. Its indifferent mish-mash fare had us retreating right back. I’m fully aware of the investment of money, time and dreams that owners put into restaurants. And while I can empathise with them, my first duty is to you, dear reader. So, I went back unannounced to the restaurant for the second time. And though only ever so slightly better, the below average mish-mash of Mexican American Portuguese et al disappointed. We’ll stay away till they get their act together.Rassasy By BarcelosThe ORB, Next to JW Marriott SaharChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, AndheriContact: 9111900003Timings: 12 pm to 1 amMeal for two: Rs.3000",life-style,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73558292,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-108018/73558292.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//life-style/food-news/restaurant-review-rassasy-by-barcelos/articleshow/73558158.cms

24,['24/01/2020'],"Bharati Achrekar: Though TV is a medium for women, older actresses are treated like furniture","Bharati Achrekar, who has been a part of iconic shows like ‘ Wagle Ki Duniya ’ (WKD’), ‘Kachchi Dhoop’ and ‘Teri Bhi Chup Meri Bhi Chup’ in the eighties and early nineties, is clear that she won’t sell her soul to make money. The decision, she says, has often forced her to take breaks from Hindi TV. However, the actress is happy to return to the small screen once again, four years after her last show, ‘ Sumit Sambhal Lega ’, wrapped up in January, 2016. She will feature in ‘Naati Pinky Ki Lambi Love Story’ (‘NPKLLS’), in which she plays a progressive and broadminded character. Achrekar says, “I was away from Hindi television because there were no good roles. I had decided that I would return only if I am offered something interesting. My character in ‘NPKLLS’ is just that.”Like most of her contemporaries, she, too, rues the fact that there is a dearth of meaty roles for senior actors. She says, “I feel that the makers don’t want to work hard on creating interesting characters. Though TV is a medium for women, older actresses are treated like furniture. It’s okay if they give me a small part, but it should be meaty. Even if I have just one scene in an episode, it should be impactful. I don’t want to be treated like furniture in shows. 30-year-old women play mothers-in-law and grandmothers, it is all so unreal. I don’t do a show until I can relate to it. I have a theatre background, and I need to be convinced about my role. While money is important, you can’t sell your soul for it. Having said that, I don’t blame the makers because they are investing money and they need good ratings to sustain and earn a profit. It’s just that unfortunately, content has been compromised in the process. I don’t think that this situation is going to change. Today, most people want larger-than-life stories. We had tried to narrate a realistic story with ‘Sumit Sambhal Lega’, but it was not accepted by the audience.”Talking about the iconic shows she has been a part of, Achrekar says, “It has been 30 years and people still remember ‘WKD’, though it had only 19 episodes. These days, shows cross 1000 episodes, but they don’t stay on for long in people’s memory. In ‘WKD’, I neither wore make-up, nor elaborate costumes. We would take seven days to finish one episode. Today, one episode is made in a day. So, how can you expect good quality?”While Achrekar has played a variety of roles during her prime, she has been mostly cast in comic roles on Hindi TV. “That’s the hazard of our profession. Ek baar chaap padh gayi toh padh gayi. While I like to make people laugh, I need to do different roles. Most makers of Hindi shows have not seen much of Marathi theatre. So, how will they know my range and calibre?

Nepotism seems to be a never-ending debate in Bollywood, with the topic recently hitting the headlines again, after Ananya Panday shared her point of view on the issue on a TV show and Gully Boy actor Siddhant Chaturvedi hit back with a witty response. Actor Shreyas Talpade , who was recently in Jaipur to shoot for reality quiz show Mind Wars , opened up about the issue. Shreyas, who himself comes from a non-filmi background, shared, “Of course, there is nepotism. Are you kidding me? But if you keep thinking about that, it is not going to take you anywhere. Siddhant Chaturvedi gave a fantastic answer to Ananya Panday when he said, ‘Jahaan humare sapne poore hote hain, wahan inke struggle shuru hote hain.’”“An ordinary person dreams of becoming a hero in a Karan Johar film. Par aap (referring to Ananya Panday) unki pehli picture mein hi heroine ban gayi. Kya struggle kiya aapne? Her struggle has started now as she has to prove herself as an actor. But coming from a filmi background, it won’t be difficult for her to get three-four films. Three-four bade banner ki filmein milna bahut hai,” he said.Talking about an outsider’s struggle in the industry, Shreyas said, “An outsider goes through a lot of struggle to get his first film. Badi mushkil se usko dusri film milti hai and it becomes even more important to have this second film do well at the box office. Otherwise, he or she will be branded a one-film wonder. In logon ke saath (referring to star kids) aisa nahi hota. So, let’s not kid ourselves. But agar main yeh sab sochta rahunga, to apna kaam kab karunga? Instead of worrying about nepotism, I like to carve my path with my hard work.”Shreyas Talpade in Jaipur (Pankaj Sharma/BCCL)Shreyas is also pumped up to be a part of the new show, Mind Wars. “I am very excited as it allows me to do something different from my past projects. I belong to a generation that grew up watching Bournvita Quiz Contest. Through this show, I got to know so much about India,” he said.Shreyas was last seen in Setters, which tanked at the box office. The actor admitted that he was disappointed but also said that it’s important for a film to stick to its budget. “The first and foremost thing has to be the script and a tight screenplay. Sometimes, people start getting indulgent about certain things and end up spending more than the film deserves. Then it gets difficult to recover that amount, something that happened with Setters,” he said.When asked about projects in the pipeline, he said he is reading a few scripts and is also planning to produce a show. Has he become selective? “I was talking to a few 10-12-year-old children and they told me that they have mostly seen me doing comedy and would love to see me in a serious film. I told them that I started my career with a serious film, Iqbal. Then I did Dor. But some people felt I could not do comedy. So I took it as a challenge. I did comedy and people loved it.” “That was also the era of a lot of multi-starrer comedy films. I was a part of a few of them. Also, when you are new to the industry, you don’t want to say no to biggies. Then one day, you see yourself doing only comedies. Now, it has become a challenge to prove myself again in serious films. Setters was an attempt to get back to the serious genre,” he said.The last time Shreyas had come to Jaipur was just for a day to shoot for Setters. This time, however, he stayed on for four days. “Jaipur is a beautiful city. This is the first time that I stayed here for more than a day. I would love to come and shoot for a film in Jaipur, especially in winters. The city seems to be a very peaceful place,” he said, adding that he tried Jaipur’s pyaz ki kachori and ghevar. “If I get time, I would love to buy some ghevar for my family,” he concluded.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73555425,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-266908/73555425.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/shreyas-talpade-nepotism-exists-par-agar-main-yeh-sochta-rahunga-to-kaam-kab-karunga/articleshow/73555376.cms

28,['24/01/2020'],"Death penalty not open-ended, can’t be challenged forever: SC","NEW DELHI: Revealing judicial discomfort over death row convicts exploiting procedural loopholes to avoid or delay execution for years, the Supreme Court on Thursday said “it is extremely important for death penalty to attain finality”.Indirectly referring to continuous and separate litigations by the four Nirbhaya case condemned prisoners to delay execution, a bench of Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna said, “Many are under the impression that concurrently awarded death penalty (by trial court, high court and the SC ) is open-ended and can be argued against as and when one wishes. Finality of death sentence is extremely important. Recent events have shown that. One cannot go on fighting endlessly on this.”The court also held that post-conviction “good behaviour” in jail may not be sufficient to modify a death sentence as any mitigating circumstances are taken into account by courts at the trial stage. While the court was not against reformation, punishment reflected societal expectation and gravity of crime, the bench said.The CJI-led bench’s observations came during open court hearing of petitions by one Shabnam and Saleem seeking review of their death sentences. Infuriated by constant objections to their relationship, which had resulted in pregnancy at the time of the crime, Shabnam mixed sedatives in tea and served it to her family members. She then held the heads of her parents and four other family members while Saleem slit their throats. A seventh victim, her brother’s 10-month-old child, was throttled to death. The duo wanted to lay claim over the entire family property.The bench’s remarks assume significance as the Centre on Wednesday, responding to public resentment over Nirbhaya convicts delaying execution, sought a change in guidelines laid down by the SC in 2014 to protect the rights of death row prisoners. The Centre said the rights of victims and society must also be factored in. When solicitor general Tushar Mehta mentioned this during Thursday’s hearing, the SC said it would separately deal with it.For Saleem and Shabnam, senior advocates Anand Grover and Meenakshi Arora strenuously attempted to convince the bench that the couple’s exemplary post-conviction conduct should be considered for commuting the death penalty to life imprisonment. Arora said as the couple now had a child to look after the court could exercise forgiveness as they had shown enough signs of reform during incarceration.The bench asked, “Does the couple having a child mitigate the gravity of their crime? Does it mitigate the murder of a 10-month-old child? Does that mitigate the murder of seven innocent family members? We are not against forgiveness. But it is the law which prescribes punishment for crime. A judge awards punishment as per law, which reflects society’s expectations. We must protect innocent and also punish the guilty. Can a judge forgive a murderer brushing aside evidence if he feels an accused appears innocent?”Responding to mitigating circumstances cited by Grover and Arora, the bench said, “A court examines mitigating circumstances at the time of sentencing. Can post-conviction mitigating circumstances be a ground for commuting death sentence? What we understand is that the sentence should be proportionate to the crime. Seven members of a family were killed through meticulous planning and in cold blood. Is the death sentence proportionate to this crime? All three courts have said yes.“If post-conviction good behaviour is accepted as mitigating circumstances, then there never will be finality to sentences and it will open the floodgates for petitions seeking commutation of all kinds of sentences.”The bench then reserved its verdict on the review petitions.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73564745,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-106126,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/death-penalty-not-open-ended-cant-be-challenged-forever-sc/articleshow/73564736.cms

Former President Pranab Mukherjee (File Photo)

NEW DELHI: The largely peaceful protests being held in the country would enable a deepening of India’s democratic roots, and the assertion of the youth and their belief in the Constitution was heartening to see, former President Pranab Mukherjee said here on Thursday.

“The last few months have witnessed people come out on the streets in large numbers, particularly the young, to voice their views on issues which in their opinion are important,” Mukherjee said at a function organised by the Election Commission.

“Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent. I believe the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have gripped the country shall once again enable the further deepening of our democratic roots,” Mukherjee said. His remarks come in the wake of agitations against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and NPR-NRC.

Delivering the Sukumar Sen lecture instituted by the EC, Mukherjee said: “The Election Commission has served its purpose well and any attempt at its denigration will amount to denigrating the electoral process. People’s mandate is sacrosanct and its sanctity supreme. The onus of ensuring this lies with the EC. They must do so and put any speculation to rest.” People’s mandate must be above any iota of reasonable doubt, he said.

The former President also took note of the challenges faced by the Indian electoral system and referred to the embargo on sanctioning and implementation of development projects once the election code of conduct kicked in and the disproportionately large size of the electorate vis-à-vis public representatives. He also said adequate representation of women in Parliament and state assemblies remained a major area of concern. “If democracy has succeeded, it is largely due to the perfect conduct of elections by all election commissioners starting from Sukumar Sen to the present election commissioners,” Mukherjee said.

In his opening remarks, chief election commissioner Sunil Arora thanked Mukherjee, and said the objective of the lecture was to make a positive intervention in the democratic and electoral discourse, within the ambit of the constitutional mandate of the EC. “The EC wishes to involve a wide cross-section of people, including political parties, leading constitutionalists, legal luminaries, academicians, civil society activists in it,” Arora said.

Pakistan PM Imran Khan at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos. (AFP photo)

NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday hit out at Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan for raising Kashmir in Davos and said Islamabad was acting in a desperate manner that the world could see through its double standards on terrorism.

The reaction came in the wake of Khan’s remarks that India had been taken over by an extremist ideology and though he appeared to be reaching out when he said the world would realise Pakistan’s economic potential when its relations with India normalised, the government did not seem impressed at all.

The external affairs ministry said Islamabad needed to focus on taking irreversible action against terrorists without making misleading and distracting claims, indicating that Khan needed to deliver in a consistent and verifiable manner on curbing terrorism aimed at India.

If Pakistan was indeed serious about a peaceful and normal relationship with India as Khan claimed, the onus was on Islamabad to create a conducive atmosphere, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

“They have to take credible, irreversible and verifiable action against terror groups operating from their soil rather than making misleading and alarmist statements to divert the attention of the international community,’’ he added. Since the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, Khan and other Pakistani leaders have often spoken of India-Pakistan tensions taking on a nuclear dimension.

The government said it wasn’t surprised by the content and tone of Khan’s remarks on Kashmir, adding that not only were these comments factually inaccurate and contradictory, but also demonstrated a growing sense of frustration.

“Pakistan has to realise that the global community has seen through this double standard of playing the victim card in their fight against terror on the one hand, and supporting terror groups targeting India and other countries on the other,” Kumar said.

Khan had brought up the alleged human rights violations by Indian forces in J&K in his meetings at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “Kashmir is, you know, it’s a far more serious problem than people realise, (than) the world realises. The problem is that India has been taken over by an extremist ideology, which is called Hindutva or RSS ,” Khan was quoted as having said in Davos.

Khan also said the world would realise the true “strategic economic potential” of his country when the relationship with India became normal. He said his vision was to make Pakistan a welfare state and asserted that economic growth was not possible without peace and stability.

Raj Thackeray's Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), launched its new 'Saffron' party flag on Thursday. (BCCL pho... Read More

MUMBAI: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray , who had attacked the Modi government during the 2019 Lok Sabha poll campaign, turned saffron all over again on Thursday, coming out in full support of the Citizenship Amendment Act and asking local Muslims why they were protesting in favour of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims.

“Throw out the illegal Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims. I fully support the Centre for this,” Raj said at the MNS’ first ever convention at the Nesco grounds, Goregaon, marking 14 years of its formation. The convention saw the induction of Raj’s son Amit Thackeray as leader of the party, making it clear that the MNS chief now wants to groom him for a larger role in party politics at a time when Amit’s cousin Aaditya is a minister in the state government.

Raj said that while he had criticised PM Modi, he would not hesitate to support him when he does the right thing. “India needs to intensify its security even if it means people are inconvenienced. We are sitting on a ticking bomb. It is important to throw out the Muslims from Pakistan and Bangladesh and for this I am with the Prime Minister,” he said.

He announced his party would hold rallies on February 9 in support of the CAA. Like other countries, India must act against illegal migrants, he said.

While Raj said he stood for Muslims of the country, he noted that he would not tolerate those Muslims who “fanned trouble in the country.” Defending Urdu, he said it was not the language of the Muslims and reminded his supporters that Bangladeshis had demanded a separate country for the Bengali language and not for Urdu.

“Is India a dharamshala? I am told it costs only Rs2,500 to make your way from Bangladesh into India. From Pakistan they come via Nepal. Stop the Samjhauta Express and the bus service. Why do we have any relations with Pakistan?” he asked.

Religion, he said, was a personal thing. Targeting Muslims, he said, “Keep your religion in your house. Shut off the loudspeakers on masjids. Our aarti does not trouble, why should namaz trouble others?”

Raj, who changed his party’s flag to saffron with Shivaji Maharaj’s royal seal on it, said the flag had been first used by the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti which, however, later disintegrated, leading to the birth of the Shiv Sena.

“When the MNS was being formed in 2006 I wanted to make this the party flag, but advisors told me to include green -- what they now call social engineering. I was 36-37 years old then and there was no one to guide me, so I went along. But the flag never left me and six years ago, we used it at our annual party rally during Gudi Padva,” he said.

“This flag is my DNA and I decided to bring it forth for this convention. The Raj Mudra (Shivaji’s royal seal) is our inspiration. This flag is to be well taken care of by the one handling it and not left lying on the floor. This flag is not to be used during elections, for that we have the other flag,” he said.

On changing the party flag, he said the Jan Sangh in the 80s had changed its flag and name to Bharatiya Janata Party . “One has to shed one’s old skin for a positive change,” he said.

In his speech, he said he was a Marathi and a Hindu and would fight anyone who challenged these identities.

On him going the Hindutva way, Raj said no one asked him if he was standing up for Hindutva when he protested against the Raza Academy demonstrators misbehaving with women constables or when party workers chased away Pakistani singers. Nor did anyone ask if he was for Hindutva when he resisted restrictions placed on the number of tiers for dahi handi. “Why are you asking now where we are going?” he asked.

He alleged there were “mohallas” in Maharashtra where a conspiracy was being hatched against the country. He said he would share this information with the Union home minister and the chief minister. He congratulated PM Modi on nullifying Article 370 and the Supreme Court for allowing the Ram Mandir.

MNS spokesperson Nitin Sardesai announced the party would set up a shadow cabinet that will take up people’s issues and not allow the government to distract the public with “inane” controversies like the recent one over the book comparing Narendra Modi with Shivaji Maharaj. Members of the shadow cabinet would be announced shortly, Sardesai said.

36,['24/01/2020'],Double-discharge platforms to come up in Patna soon: East Central Railway,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representative image

PATNA: The railways has prepared a blueprint to build double-discharge (DD) platforms on Hardinge Road near Patna Junction.

MEMU trains running on different sections of Danapur division under the East Central Railway (ECR) will originate from and terminate at the proposed DD platforms. These trains currently originate from Patna Junction.

According to Danapur DRM Sunil Kumar, railways has got around 4.8 acres of land on Hardinge Road from the state government in lieu of the land it offered to the latter for the construction of R-Block-Digha Road.

“We have also approached BSNL to hand over a piece of land adjacent to Hardinge Park so that the entire area can be developed as per the blueprint,” Kumar said, adding the railways intends to build four DD platforms from where 18-coach MEMU trains can be operated.

The DRM said the blueprint has also envisaged construction of a multi-storey building to act as commercial complex. “An official MoU will be signed between the state government and railways in this connection soon,” he said, adding the project would be completed in two to three years if railways gets the adequate funds in the ensuing Budget.

Meanwhile, railways has taken an initiative to save electric energy power to the tune of several crores per year by switching over to solar energy plants.

“Solar energy plants are already functional at Danapur DRM’s office, Danapur railway hospital, Danapur station building and Danapur railway hospital OPD. Solar plants have been commissioned at the Patna Junction station building, Patna railway superspecialty hospital, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Ara station, Mokama station, Hathidah station and Lakhisarai station buildings,” he said.

Besides, railways has provided free Wi-Fi facilities at 88 stations in the Danapur division, including Patna Junction, Rajendra Nagar Terminal, Pataliputra Junction and Danapur.

“In a recent survey, it was pointed out that passengers travelling from Patna Junction are utilizing free Wi-Fi facility the most.

39,['24/01/2020'],Digit Insurance’s mgmt takes part in co’s fund-raise,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Mumbai: New-age non-life insurer Digit has got regulatory clearance for an investment of $84 million (about Rs 596 crore) from three private equity investors — A91 Partners, Faering Capital and TVS Capital. In addition to the three high-quality institutions backing the company, 72 Digit employees have also invested over $4 million (Rs 30 crore) in this round

Digit Insurance is promoted by Kamesh Goyal and Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa ’s Fairfax Group, who together own Go Digit Infoworks Services. The present round of funding has resulted in diluting the holding company’s stake to around 90%. TOI had in its December 10 edition reported about the proposed fund-raise . The latest round of investment values Digit at close to $900 million. This is also the largest private equity funding round in the Indian insurance space.

Speaking to TOI, Goyal said the company is likely to double its premium income this year to Rs 2,400 crore from Rs 1,200 crore last fiscal. The current round of funding would be adequate to meet its capital requirement for 2020-21, but it may need additional funds the year after as insurance solvency norms require capital to be hiked along with increase in business. Digit has already captured a 1.2% share in the industry.

“This year, the market has been tough. Pricing of motor insurance is under severe pressure and acquisition costs have gone up for the industry. While we have a claims ratio of around 74%, we are still in our second year of operations and investments have gone into opening offices. By next year, we should have reached an optimum scale from an expense perspective,” said Goyal.

“Our investment in Digit is based on our thesis to back market-leading companies pursuing large opportunities in financial services in India. Digit is uniquely poised to become a dominant player in the general insurance industry and we are excited to offer our expertise and partner with Kamesh and his team in their exciting journey of delighting customers with innovative yet simple products and services,” said Aditya Parekh, co-founder and MD, Faering Capital.

Mumbai: Consumer finance provider Bajaj Finserv has partnered Apollo Hospitals to extend credit to those having to undergo expensive healthcare and diagnostic procedures.

The funding will be through a co-branded healthcare EMI card in association with Bajaj Finance , the lending arm of Bajaj Finserv. Users of this co-branded card can convert their medical bills into easy no-cost EMIs that can be repaid over a period of 12 months with minimal paperwork, thereby avoiding the hassle of documentation.

The card, which can be instantly activated, provides a high credit limit of up to Rs 4 lakh. It will also provide priority access and add-on benefits like complimentary personal accident insurance cover, discount vouchers and coupons. Covering the entire family, the Apollo Hospitals-Bajaj Finserv Health EMI Card will be accepted across the entire Apollo Hospitals network.

The EMI card will also benefit patients who do not have health insurance or whose insurance limit is lower than the cost of the treatment. “As the country’s first corporate hospital, our vision has always been to make world-class healthcare accessible to all. The quality of care, especially in a life-threatening emergency is the differentiating factor between a positive and a negative medical outcome,” said Apollo Hospitals Group chairman Prathap C Reddy. Those undergoing elective procedures and surgeries can proceed with the treatment immediately without waiting to collect funds for up front payment.

“India is under-insured when it comes to health insurance, leading to families struggling to raise funds for treatment, especially in a medical emergency. The Health EMI card will help families focus on the treatment and not the payment by availing easy no-cost EMIs,” said Apollo Hospitals Group VC Preetha Reddy.

42,['24/01/2020'],Insurance cos to reward healthy friendships,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Chennai: Friend Assurance feature proposed by health insurance companies will now allow both friends and families to buy a health insurance policy, besides a discount awarded to the healthiest group. Religare Health Insurance, Max Bupa Health Insurance and Kotak Mahindra General Insurance who had proposed the idea of ‘friend assurance’ under the Regulatory Sandbox had received Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority’s (IRDA) nod earlier this month. The insurance regulator has set February 1 as deadline to roll out this feature on pilot basis for a period of six months.

Under this policy, customers can now cover not just their families but also their friends under one policy number. “The objective is to acknowledge and reward people who lead a healthy life and so, why restrict only with the family. A 15% discount on premium at the time of renewal will be awarded if there are no claims made (for in-patient care) in the year,” said Religare Health Insurance, who will make this new addition on its existing Group Care product, and offer under Rs 5 lakh - Rs 10 lakh cover.

This new policy will have similar benefits of any health insurance policy, and strength of the group will vary between five to 30. Under this concept, the group will be scored based on various behaviors like number of doctor consultation, number of health checkups based on which renewal premium will be decided.

Max Bupa Health Insurance has decided to roll out the friend assurance feature on its existing group policy — Health Companion. “Depending on the group’s cumulative score, we will decide the discount. We do estimate an average discount of 5%-10% if the entire group has a good score,” Max Bupa’s spokesperson said.

This friend assurance feature will be available on all its policies and on covers ranging between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1 crore. “We have defined the group with a minimum of seven members, but no restriction on upper limit,” he added. Earlier IRDA had placed restriction on this concept, that a group cannot be formed just for purpose of buying insurance or availing discounts. The concern was that there should be a commonality in nature of members of group (a homogeneous group). This new product aims to get people to lead a healthier lifestyle, besides initiating social interaction among the members and keep them motivated. Friend Assurance policy offers features similar to retail products, where the group which does not make any claim will get a 15% premium cash back at the end of year. It is available in few European countries like Germany, however, the form and format differ from that proposed in India.

43,['24/01/2020'],Ex-minister Fuke moves HC for quashing FIR,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: Former minister and MLC Parinay Fuke moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court for quashing of an FIR lodged against him by kin of state assembly speaker Nana Patole.

Tirthanand, son of Nana Patole’s nephew Vinod Patole, had filed a case against Fuke at Sakoli police station.

According to Fuke, there was a bitter contest between him and Patole for Sakoli seat during assembly polls in October last year. The complainant had lodged a false complaint against him under sections 171-E, 143, 147, 148, 149, 324, and 325 of IPC to deter him from contesting the polls.

A division bench comprising Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Madhav Jamdar on Thursday issued notices to the respondents, including Sakoli police in Bhandara and the complainant Tirthanand asking them to reply within two weeks.

While praying for quashing of FIR, the petitioner, through counsel Rohan Chhabra, contended that the complainant had lodged a false FIR on October 19 last year, which stated that the MLC tried to distribute packets containing cash to voters in a village. The complaint mentioned that he and his brother came across a white Innova during campaigning. A few of Fuke’s men in the vehicle were allegedly distributing the cash packets. When they tried to intervene, they were warned, claimed the complainant.

According to the complaint, when Patole siblings tried to stop Fuke’s men, they were allegedly assaulted. They then called Nana Patole’s office and informed office-bearers about the incident and also how money was being distributed among the voters.

While demanding directives to Sakoli police on not to file charge sheet, Fuke, the MLC from Bhandara-Gondia constituency, contended that the FIR is nothing but a concocted story to malign his image. Pointing out that no eyewitness was mentioned in the FIR, Fuke argued that he was not present at the place when the Patoles were allegedly assaulted.

“Their claim of being assaulted in front of police station is completely illogical. The complainant’s claim that he made call to Patole instead of dialling 100 looks fabricated. Nana Patole wields huge clout in Sakoli constituency and it was being misused,” Fuke said.

PATNA: A day after miscreants created ruckus on the campus of a private school on Vivekanand Marg, the school principal, teachers and over 150 students staged a protest in front of Anugrah Narayan College and S K Puri police station here on Thursday.

An FIR was lodged with S K Puri police station against 50 unidentified people who vandalised the property of the school and injured several people, including students.

The Vikas Residential Public School authorities and students staged the protest to demand security on school premises and action against the culprits. They also criticised the police for its “indifferent attitude”. “The police reached the school only after the mob left around 1.15pm. The mob had entered the school around 12 noon,” a school staff said.

School principal Kumar Vikas said, “I have been running the school here for the last 15 years. Such incident never occurred earlier. Around 50 people walked into the campus and went on the rampage,” he said, adding several students and school staff received minor injuries. “My father Suresh Prasad Singh was badly beaten up by the mob. He had to be taken to the hospital,” the principal said.

According to the school officials, people in the mob asked the staff to vacate the premises claiming that some parts of the land belong to them.

SHO of S K Puri police station Vikas Kumar said police have collected CCTV footages from the school.

According to the SHO, the school used to run from a rented building of one Vaidyanath Singh. “After Vaidyanath’s death, the ownership of the land went to his sons and daughters – Laxman, Brij Bihari Singh, Gulabo and Rajdhani Kunwar. Children of Laxman and Brij got their share of 19 decimal land on which the school building was constructed. However, Rajdhani’s son Indra Dev and Gulabo’s daughter Prem Shila also claimed their share,” he said, adding Wednesday’s incident was fallout of a property dispute in the family.

SURAT: Customs department of Mumbai had busted an overvaluation scam of a city-based diamond company and seized its rough diamonds to the tune of Rs 3.47 crore.

The company located in the diamond hub of Katargam had imported rough diamonds from the United Arab Emirates through precious cargo customs clearance centre (PCCCC) at Mumbai’s Bharat Diamond Bourse (BDB) by declaring assessable value of the goods at Rs3.47 crore in November 2019.

On examination of the parcel by the government-approved valuer at the PCCCC in Mumbai, the customs department found that the rough diamonds were actually valued at Rs94 lakh and that they were sorted as per colour, size and clarity.

Sources said the rough diamonds were not covered under Kimberly Process Certificate (KPC) issued by the UAE and that they were imported in contravention of the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962.

The customs department has directed the company owners and the customs broker not to remove, part or deal with the said goods except with their written permission.

PATNA: Four people, including a Bajrang Dal activist, were killed in separate incidents in the state in the last 24 hours, police said on Thursday.

Hajipur SDPO Raghav Dayal said the body of 36-year-old Neeraj Kumar, a Bajrang Dal activist, was recovered from a well at Adalbari under the Hajipur town police station in Vaishali district on Thursday. Neeraj had gone missing from Anjan Peer locality of Hajipur town on Wednesday.

Police said Neeraj, a resident of Kadamghat locality of Hajipur town, had left his studio at Anjan Peer with some of his acquaintances on Wednesday for arbitration in a land dispute. His family members started searching him when he didn’t return home late in the night. Earlier, a missing case was lodged with the Town police station.

On Thursday morning, Neeraj’s body was recovered from the well located on the premises of a guava orchard at Adalbari. The body bore bullet injuries and his throat was slit with a sharp-edged weapon. Police recovered nine empty cartridges from the spot, which suggested that the criminals shot Neeraj after slitting his throat with a sharp-edged weapon.

The SDPO said one Pappu Singh, a resident of Kadamghat at Hajipur, has been made accused in the case. “Raids are on to arrest Pappu,” he said, adding dispute over a plot of land was probably the reason behind the murder.

In another incident, a 35-year-old man, Surendra Kumar Singh, was shot dead by unidentified armed criminals near Patiasa Chowk under the Ahiyapur police station area in Muzaffarpur late on Wednesday night. Police said the incident took place around 9pm when Surendra was returning to his native village Manjhauli under Bochaha police station in the district from his work.

Surendra, who worked at the office of a cloth merchant, was rushed to the SKMCH where he died during treatment. DSP (town) Ram Naresh Paswan said personal enmity was the reason behind the killing.

AHMEDABAD: A 72-year-old retired teacher, breathed a massive sigh of relief when she was handed back her purse, which contained Rs 55,000 cash and 60g of gold jewellery, after a nerve-wracking two-hour wait.

Pushpa Solanki had boarded bus No. 13/1, going from Ranip to Isanpur, at Gandhi Ashram. When she got off at the Lal Darwaja bus station, her purse snagged on the door handle.

“Before I could do anything, the unaware driver closed the door and the bus sped away. I tried to yank the purse off but was not successful. As I ran behind the bus shouting for help, I fell down. Some other conductors and drivers at the bus stand gathered around and took me to the control cabin.”

Solanki said that control cabin officials called the Vadaj control and got the phone number of the driver, Girish Rathod, and conductor, Dilip Patel. After checking Rathod, said that the purse was still on the bus and would be handed over at Lal Darwaja when they returned from Isanpur.

“I waited till the bus returned. After two hours, the purse was handed over to me. I checked it contents and found everything in order, the cash and jewellery too,” she said. The control cabin staff took pictures. Solanki said it was her luck and the honesty of the driver and conductor that she got her belongings back.

KOLKATA: Author-activist Arundhati Roy , while delivering a speech at a city film festival on Thursday, said she was amazed at the solidarity and courage shown by students and women, who have been leading the protests against implementation of NRC and CAA since the bill was passed in November.

“Within days of the Citizenship Amendment Act being passed, the students rose. AMU, Jamia, JNU, Jadavpur University . They showed us what courage and solidarity mean. They showed us that this is a battle between those who know how to think and those who know how to hate,” she said.

She stressed that the most exciting thing about the ongoing protests is that they are led by women. “It is a liberalization for young women who are out on the road protesting,” said the author of ‘God of Small Things’ during the hour-long talk at the 7th Kolkata People’s Film Festival at Uttam Mancha in south Kolkata.

Roy said the real purpose of an all-India NRC, coupled with CAA, is to threaten and destabilize the population by casting it into a maze of bureaucracy and documentation, that nobody, least of all the poor, can hope to have. She also strongly criticized the internet ban in Kashmir, wondering if a fire-walled internet is in the country’s future.

“It is meant to create a tiered citizenship, in which one set of citizens has no rights and lives at the mercy of another — a modern caste system which will exist alongside the ancient one, in which Muslims are the new Dalits,” she said.

She appealed to the audience to boycott NPR and NRC. “This government is in its second term and has a brute majority in Parliament. We have to prevail on the CMs of non-BJP states to refuse to implement CAA, NRC and NPR. India has a choice. Deep federalism or the risk of balkanization,” she said.

Kanhaiya Kumar at the meeting on Thursday evening

KOLKATA: “Today they are coming for your citizenship, tomorrow they will come after your property and then they will snatch your voting rights,” said Kanhaiya Kumar while addressing a nearly 15,000-strong crowd in the packed Debashree cinema hall ground near Barrackpore railway station on Thursday evening. The National Population Register ( NPR ) is NRC in disguise, he alleged.

In the afternoon, several posters with derogatory statements against Kumar were found pasted near Titagarh Tata Gate off BT Road, near Barrackpore railway station and in an area leading to the meeting venue. Police later pulled some of these down. The agitators got into a scuffle with cops when a team from Titagarh police station arrived the spot.

“Some BJP supporters who were found putting up posters and banners containing filthy language against Kanhaiya Kumar were caught red-handed,” an officer said. After the eight persons were arrested, another group of BJP supporters gheraoed Titagarh police station demanding their immediate release. When police tried to disperse the agitators, the BJP men put up a road block on BT Road near Titagarh police station for over half an hour. Sensing trouble, a tight security arrangement was made for Kumar’s meeting.

BJP MP Arjun Singh, however, said, “Police had falsely implicated BJP supporters and arrested them. We are not bothered with Kanhaiya Kumar. The protest was against the false charges by police.”

Kumar, later, received a rousing welcome by the crowd.

“The Indian Constitution does not differentiate between its people based on religion, birth, language or caste. This new citizenship law, therefore, is unconstitutional and illegal,” he said, adding, “Their NRC brahmastra in Assam backfired. They tried to throw out Muslim infiltrators, but ended up making 12 lakh Hindus foreigners in their own country. They are using NPR as a ploy to evade the NRC issue. The NPR will try to identify doubtful citizens. These people will be asked to furnish additional documents, which they most likely will not be able to. And then they will use the NRC trick.”

A statue of former Bihar CM and towering extremely backward caste (EBC) leader, Karpoori Thakur in Patna.

PATNA: Various political parties are gearing up to celebrate the birth anniversary of former CM and towering extremely backward caste (EBC) leader from the state, Karpoori Thakur in a big way on Friday.

The occasion has gained special significance this time as the state assembly elections are due in October-November. Mainstream political parties have been making efforts to woo the predominant EBC sections who together constitute around 30% of the state’s population.

While the EBC wing of the JD(U) will celebrate the function at Sri Krishna Memorial Hall here, the BJP’s function will be held at its state headquarters. CM Nitish Kumar is slated to inaugurate the JD(U)’s function.

For the first time in recent memory, the state BJP has decided to hold the function under a ‘pandal’. Party’s senior leaders, including state president Dr Sanjay Kumar Jaiswal and ministers Sushil Kumar Modi , Nand Kishore Yadav and Mangal Pandey, will attend the function.

Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav will inaugurate the RJD function at the party office here. “Former CM Rabri Devi is unlikely to participate due to poor health,” RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said.

The RLSP has planned to organize congregation of school students in front of their schools across the state to press for educational reforms in the state. Party chief Upendra Kushwaha will lead the congregation on the Miller School ground here. “The students will stand in lines in front of their schools and hold ‘maanav kataar’, including on the Miller School ground,” RLSP functionary Bhola Yadav said.

As far as the political leanings of the EBC sections are considered, they have largely remained aligned with Nitish for the last 15 years or so.

55,['24/01/2020'],Nitish to PM: Intervene to end Nalanda seer’s fast at Haridwar,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

PATNA/NALANDA: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has urged PM Narendra Modi to intervene to end the fast being observed by Sadhvi Padmavati , a 23-year-old seer from Bihar’s Nalanda district , at Haridwar to press for preservation of the Ganga and suspension of the hydroelectric projects on the sacred river in Uttarakhand.

Nitish shot off a letter to the PM on Thursday, requesting him to initiate steps to end the fast being observed by Padmavati since December 15 last year. The CM said the health condition of Padmavati might deteriorate in the days to come.

Maintaining that the Ganga must be left to flow unhindered, the CM reminded the PM he had shared his views with him on this issue several times. He also reminded the PM of the conferences organized in Patna and New Delhi in February and May in 2017 to address the issue.

While the first conference was held in Patna on February 25 and February 26, 2017 on ‘Aviral Ganga’, the second one was organized in New Delhi on ‘Ganga ki aviralta mein badhak gaad: Samashya evam samadhan’ on May 18 and May 19, 2017. Noted river water conservation experts from across the country had attended the two conferences. Two separate resolutions – ‘Patna Resolution’ and ‘Delhi Resolution’ – were also passed after the conferences.

Nitish said the two resolutions were later sent to the Union water conversation ministry for necessary action. The CM hoped that the PM would initiate steps to address the issues raised by Padmavati and end her fast. “I am aware of your commitment and sincere efforts to ensure the natural and unhindered flow of the river,” he added.

On Wednesday, the CM had sent JD(U) MP from Nalanda Kaushlendra Kumar and water resources department minister Sanjay Jha to Haridwar to provide urgent medical and other assistances to Padmavati. Matri Sadan at Haridwar, where Padmavati is observing the fast, is the place where activist Swami Gyan Swarup Sanand had breathed his last following 112 days of his fast-unto-death on October 11, 2018. Sanand had begun his fast on June 22, 2018.

An Alwar based-organisation, Tarun Bharat Sangh, had recently appealed to Nitish to intervene in the matter and save Padmavati’s life.

Sant Kumar, father of Padmavati and resident of Badi Malama village in Nalanda district, said his daughter is a follower of Matri Sadan in Haridwar. He said Padmavati, who had earlier sat on dharna in Varanasi for the cause of preservation and protection of the Ganga, started her fast-unto-death this time after the central government and National Green Tribunal (NGT) failed to respond to her demand of legislation for preservation and free flow of the Ganga and suspension of hydel projects being carried out in Haridwar.

PATNA: Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday asked the newly recruited 848 forest guards of the state to show compassion and concern for the forests, trees, wildlife and scheduled tribe (ST) populations living in the forest areas.

“If you show compassion and concern for the forests, trees, wildlife and ST groups living in the forest areas, it will help you perform your duty with dedication and sincerity,” Modi said while addressing the newly recruited forest guards at a function at Gyan Bhavan here as part of their orientation programme.

Modi said against the 902 sanctioned posts of forest guards, 879 candidates were selected for appointment through an examination that was conducted without any controversy. “The results were fair and no court case occurred,” Modi said.

He added that the environment, forest and climate change department will spend Rs 641 crore during the current financial year. “Of the total sum, Rs 501 crore has come through budgetary allotment and the remaining Rs 140 crore from the Centre.

Representative image

CHENNAI: Aspirants for National Eligibility cum-Entrance Test (Neet) from government and government-aided schools have dropped by more than 10,000 students this year . From 17,630 applicants in 2019, the numbers have dwindled to just around 7,000 in 2020 .

Only two students from government-sponsored coaching centres in the state got medical seats last year. Four students from government-aided schools who attended private coaching also got MBBS seats in 2019.

Despite elaborate efforts by the school education department, the number of students joining medical courses remained more or less the same.

The number of students attending Neet coaching has come down from 19,355 to 10,000 this year. Students and teachers were disheartened as the cut-off increased over 100 marks and old students grabbed 70% of medical seats in the state, officials said. There has been a decrease in the number of students opting for science stream every year. Pursuing Neet is also providing limited options and this year, the cut-off may increase further. These factors could have discouraged many students, said an official.

Headmasters of some schools said one year coaching for Neet is not sufficient. “Coaching should have been given for two years. Instead of giving coaching at state level, the government should consider coaching at school level,” said the headmaster of a city school. Some headmasters demanded a separate quota for government school students as they could not compete with students who prepare for more than two years for the exam.

Educationist Prince Gajendrababu said apprehensions about common medical entrance tests have been proved correct. “We warned about mushrooming of coaching centres and possibility of spending an extra year for coaching. They have come true and only affluent students can afford coaching as it would cost up to Rs 5lakh a year,” he said. “Though government school students have the same aptitude and skills like others, they could not take up the test. The state government should strengthen higher secondary exams and admit students based on higher secondary marks,” he added.

“Poor results for three continuous years has taken away the confidence of government school students. The government also did not give proper training for medical aspirants,” said Dr G R Raveendranath, general secretary, Doctors’ Association for Social Equality. “The state government should reserve seats for government school students in government medical colleges,” he said.

In 2016, before Neet-based admissions for MBBS, 34 students from government schools joined medical colleges. After introduction of Neet for medical admissions in Tamil Nadu , only seven from government schools joined MBBS in 2017, while five joined in 2018, according to the Directorate of Medical Education. So far, only 14 from government schools have aced Neet in the last three years.

60,['24/01/2020'],Builders begin changing façade design of textile markets in Saroli,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Surat: The devastating fire at Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market on Puna-Kumbhariya Road a few days ago has brought into focus buildings with glass and aluminium facade, especially those in the textile markets of Saroli.

Firefighters had a tough task recently extinguishing the fire at Raghuvir Celeum Textile Market because it had a glass and aluminium facade.

Thus, builders, who constructed textile markets in Saroli with facade, have started to make drastic changes in decorative elevations.

A few builders have started to change elevation of the markets with non-combustible material and also providing them proper ventilation and lighting.

Out of 26 textile markets in Saroli on Puna-Kumbhariya Road, about 18 have façade design to make them look more decorative. Majority of builders had used aluminium sheets and glass in outer elevation.

Surat Urban Development Authority (SUDA) has given 30 days to builders to make necessary changes in façade design and get it approved from fire and emergency services department of Surat Municipal Corporation.

For the buildings under construction, the builders will be charged premium rate of Rs1,000 per square metre for outer elevation.

SUDA chairman Banchhanidhi Pani told TOI, “By putting premium rate of Rs1,000 square metre for façade design, we are discouraging builders in going for outer elevation. Those who have done the facade will have to change the design to make the building safe. From now on, builders will have to specially register themselves for doing outer elevation. The fire and emergency services department will carry out a detailed inspection of the design of the facade.”

Experts believe textile markets are vulnerable to fire hazards due to presence of highly inflammable polyester fabric.

Design of textile markets must conform to National Building Code (NBC) guidelines and builders should stay away from creating decorative facade using aluminium and glass material, which are highly dangerous when fire breaks out.

Dr Atul Desai, professor of civil engineering department of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT), told TOI, “Such elevations are done in western countries using glass due to heavy cold. Take the example of a car parked under the sun. If the temperature outside is 35 degrees Celsius, the actual temperature inside a closed car would be 45 degrees. Same is with buildings having decorative facade. Textile markets are ticking time bombs as they are stuffed with inflammable material in huge quantities. The facade makes matters worse in textile markets in case of fires.”

Surat: Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) arrested proprietor of a city-based trading firm for fraudulently availing and utilizing input tax credit (ITC) to the tune of Rs5.56 crore. The proprietor was produced in Surat district court on Thursday which sent him to judicial custody for 14 days.

DGGI’s Surat zonal unit had raided Karim Traders owned by Salim Ahmed Panjwani located at Udhna Udhyognagar in Udhana. Panjwani had created a chain of firms in Surat, Vapi, Billimora, Ankleshwar and other places in Gujarat to pass on fake ITC.

About 22 premises in Surat, Ankleshwar, Vapi and Billimora were raided by the DGGI two days ago. Scrutiny of seized records seized from Karim Traders revealed that Panjwani obtained GST registration as a trader of grains but had shown supply of scrap and ingots to various firms across Gujarat.

Panjwani availed huge amount of inadmissible and wrong ITC from bogus suppliers on the basis of GST invoices issued to them without actual supply of goods. During course of investigation, incriminating documents were recovered from the premises. Total illegal transaction of goods was valued at Rs100 crore, involving GST evasion of about Rs18 crore as per preliminary estimates.

An officer on the condition of anonymity said, “We have found GST evasion of Rs18 crore as per preliminary estimate. The case is at initial stage of investigation and the amount of tax evasion could increase further. Panjwani was arrested on the basis of preliminary scrutiny of documents which showed fraudulent availing of ITC to the tune of Rs5.56 crore by him.”

SECUNDERABAD: Students who graduated from Osmania University ( OU ) after 2010 can now get their transcripts digitally.

The university’s examination department started issuing digital transcripts to UG students from January 21. “Earlier, students had to submit a photocopy of their transcripts to obtain a duplicate one from the controller of examination. Many a time, we had to reject photocopies due to poor printing. Now, using the database from 2010 onwards, we will be able to issue digital transcripts without any hassle,” said Prof Sriram Venkatesh, controller of examination (CoE), OU.

Issuance of digital transcripts was initially limited to only a few courses such as master of computer applications. However, considering its benefits, the university extended it to other courses as well. “We will be shortly extending the service for post-graduate courses as well,” said Prof Venkatesh.

While the university will dispatch digital transcripts of those who graduated after 2010, those who have graduated before that will have to submit physical photocopy to the varsity to obtain transcripts.

According to officials, the digitisation of transcripts will prove beneficial for many graduates who have moved to other cities or countries. It will have digitized signature of the university registrar and the CoE. Cost of issuance of transcripts and the duration to obtain the same shall remain the same.

More than 40 textile mill owners in the city areas have approached the state government for allotting them land outside the city limits for safe operations. For the purpose, the South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA) has also identified about 20 lakh square metre land at Gabheni village outside the city limits for shifting the textile mills out of the city areas.

The shifting of the textile mills will not only reduce pollution in the city areas, but also protect residents from fire hazards.

President of SGTPA, Jitu Vakharia said, “We have been pursuing with the state government for the land on the outskirts of the city. We have identified government land in Gabheni village, located around 20km away from the city for setting up mills too.”

Last year, the government had approved specified shifting zones for the industrial units with the addition of few provisions in the General Development Control Regulation (GDCR).

The textile mill owners wanting to develop their factories in the special approved areas will get base floor space index (FSI) of 1.8 free, while 0.9 FSI will be chargeable based on the jantri rates. The textile mill owners are upbeat as the FSI for industrial units in city areas is only 1.2, whereas they will be getting a total of 2.7 FSI in the special nod areas located under the new development plan (DP) of SUDA.

Keeping in mind the future development, provisions has been made to construct wider roads. To check the reservations suggested in SUDA DP 2035, a local level consultative committee has been formed under the chairmanship of SUDA president and Municipal Commissioner, M Thennarasan.

About 65 textile mills are operating in the city’s residential areas including Khatodara, Udhna, Ashwani Kumar Road, Ved Road, Bombay Market, Puna Kumbharia etc. In these areas, Particulate Matter (PM10) levels is exceedingly high than the national annual average at 184 per micrograms per cubic meter of air (UG/M3) per annum.

66,['24/01/2020'],NPCI told to scrap charges on UPI like government’s MDR move,"(Representative image)

BENGALURU: The Indian Bank’s Association (IBA) has written to the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) to remove charges like interchange fee and switching fee in line with the government move of zero merchant discount rate ( MDR ). TOI has seen a copy of the letter.This could be another serious blow to the growth of digital payments on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Removal of these fees would mean another revenue stream getting reduced to nil, which would affect UPI apps, fintech startups and the overall pace of investment and innovation in what is the fastest-growing digital payments network.This comes at a time when UPI has clocked over 1 billion transactions each month from October to December last year (see graphic), with companies like search major Google asking US regulators to follow the model.PhonePe’s co-founder and CEO Sameer Nigam came out strongly on the issue and termed it “most unfortunate but inevitable”. “Zero MDR killed acquiring banks’ revenues so they can’t afford to pay issuers any interchange. Without interchange & PSP fees, issuing banks also have no skin in the game left. Sad day for the entire UPI and RuPay story,” said Nigam, whose Bengaluru-based company launched its payments business starting with UPI in 2016 and has clocked over 5 billion transactions till December.During the IBA meeting when this decision was made and the letter drafted out, SBI was among the key players pushing for the move, people aware of the matter said. If accepted, the proposal would be beneficial for banks who are looking to reduce costs incurred because of the fast growth of these applications.Public sector banks like SBI, which has a 5-crore customer base, have been resisting increasing interchange and switching fee as they will be paying more to other banks when their customers use their ATMs/PoS machines/UPI apps. For seven years, the interchange fee has remained at Rs 15.“There is a loss per transaction banks face. This move will reduce that,” another source said. “IBA managing committee has decided that with respect to zero MDR on RuPay Card and UPI transactions, zero interchange is acceptable to banking industry and NPCI should be requested to consider zero interchange, zero switching fee, and zero-fee for PSPs (payments service providers) while implementing the government mandate,” the letter sent to NPCI on Thursday said.Emailed queries sent to NPCI and SBI did not elicit any response on the matter.Multiple payments industry executives said this would cause further damage to the industry already reeling under the pressure of zero MDR.As reported on January 10, payment players anticipate annual revenue loss could be to the tune of Rs 1,800 crore and about 2.5 lakh jobs would be impacted owing to zero MDR. Even though the Union Budget is slated to be tabled on February 1, hopes of relief from the government are low, sources added.Companies like PhonePe and Google Pay have spent serious money to popularise UPI, which has reached a sizable scale now. Last year, PhonePe was on a Rs 500-crore marketing spree to expand its acceptance among consumer and merchants, while Google Pay spent over Rs 1,000 crore in cashbacks for the financial year ending March 2019. “All the work done by UPI so far will go back to zero. This intervention is not needed and it’s a step back. Consumer companies will go back to the new non-KYC wallet that allows Rs 10,000 monthly transaction limit. The government should reimburse these fees if they want to do away with these charges,” said a senior payments sector executive.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73574475,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-140257,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/banks-push-npci-to-remove-upi-charges/articleshow/73563782.cms
67,['24/01/2020'],"Sequoia’s startup bet intact, to raise record $1.3 billion for new India fund","(Representative image)

BENGALURU: Top Silicon Valley investor Sequoia is planning to raise about $1.25 billion for its new fund for India. This will be a record corpus raised for the country, underlining the growing maturity of the Indian startup ecosystem, said two sources familiar with the development. Sequoia is known as the early backer of companies like WhatsApp and Google in the US, and Byju’s and Oyo in India.Sequoia Capital India has sounded out its limited partners (LPs), the term for investors in venture capital funds. Sequoia’s LPs include top endowment funds and family offices. The new corpus is 80% larger than the $695 million the firm raised for its sixth fund in 2018. Till now, the largest venture fund raised for India was $920 million, also by Sequoia back in early 2016.Sequoia will also, for the first time, split the corpus into two vehicles — one for early stage and other for the growth stage. The move comes as Sequoia is holding the annual global meeting of its LPs in India for the first time at the end of March as the country has become a lucrative market in terms of returns as well for the firm.Till now, these meetings have been held in larger markets like the US and China. “The roadshows will happen after the global LP meet and the fund will most likely be closed during the second half of the year,” said one of the sources mentioned earlier.While $750-800 million is expected to be raised for the growth fund, $450-500 million will be raised for the early stage fund, according to one of the sources. These funds will also continue to invest in Southeast Asia, which the firm started in 2014 after setting up a Singapore office. When contacted, a Sequoia Capital India spokesperson declined to comment.“Sequoia India’s fourth has been a turning point as it has several portfolio companies which have already given cash returns,” said another person briefed on the fund-raise. Raised in 2014, Sequoia’s fourth fund got $500 million from hospitality major Oyo and another $185 million from ed-tech unicorn Byju’s through a partial exit over the last 18 months. Some of the other prominent portfolio companies from that fund include the biggest internet players in Southeast Asia, like Indonesian ride-hailing major Go-Jek (valued at $10 billion) and online marketplace Tokopedia (valued at over $7 billion).Sequoia also beefed up its top team last year by roping in former Google’s India and Southeast Asia head Rajan Anandan, and then Uber’s Asia head Amit Jain. These additions were done after three MDs left Sequoia to form a firm — A91 Partners — which raised $351 million last year. “Sequoia now has a stable partnership with the next rung being given a lot of leeway to spread their wings, which is a good sign,” said a venture capital investor who did not wish to be named. Other MDs at Sequoia are Shailendra Singh, Mohit Bhatnagar, G V Ravishankar, Shailesh Lakhani, Abheek Anand and Piyush Gupta.The new record corpus comes at a time when there is a slowdown expected in the venture funding market as investors tell startups to move away from the growth-at-all-costs mindset. Additionally, companies like WeWork and Uber have seen a significant fall in their valuations after testing public markets.A new large fund by Sequoia in such an environment signals continued long-term bullishness on the Indian startup space, said investors. “One thing Sequoia has done well is that they double down harder when the market is lukewarm, which they have done in India in the past as well. They are comfortable writing larger cheques as well,” said Vinod Murali, MD at venture debt firm Alteria Capital. “It is important for India that Sequoia goes and raises a large fund because there is a natural cascading effect for other smaller venture capital funds as well.”",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73575186,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-93591,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sequoias-startup-bet-intact-to-raise-record-1-3bn-for-new-india-fund/articleshow/73563714.cms
68,['24/01/2020'],Notorious history-sheeter shot dead in Navsari,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Wasim Billa Gulam Shaikh

SURAT: Four unidentified assailants shot dead a history-sheeter from the city in Navsari on Wednesday night. Deceased Wasim Billa Gulam Shaikh, who had been debarred by Gujarat high court from entering Surat city due to his criminal activities, was living in Navsari for the past few months. Police suspect it to be a case of contract killing executed by professional shooters.

Shaikh left a gymnasium at around 10.15pm and was shot dead the moment he sat in his car by the assailants who fired multiple times at him. He was shifted to a private hospital where he died during treatment. He had received at least four bullet injuries on vital body parts, police said. Firoz Gulam Shaikh, brother of the deceased, lodged a complaint in this connection at Navsari rural police station on Thursday.

Family and friends have named a few suspects whom police were questioning. They alleged that Shaikh had enmity with a few businessmen in the city due to which he was facing criminal complaints. Shaikh’s family suspects any one of these businessmen could be involved in his murder.

Police suspect attackers had specific information about the deceased’s movement, including his routine of visit the gymnasium. Police are checking CCTV footages of the area to find out if the attackers were caught on camera anywhere and if they had carried out a recce before attacking Shaikh.

Police recovered a motorcycle from Kanai Khadi on Vedchha Road which they suspect was used by the assailants. Four shooters had come on two motorcycles but police don’t have exact information about the route they took to escape. “Vehicle number plate and chassis number of the motorcycle have been tampered with. Thus, we believe that this motorcycle had been used in the crime. We have no CCTV footages as yet in which the attack has been captured. There are no eyewitness to murder either,” a police officer said.

“Police suspect Shaikh didn’t know the attackers and hence allowed them to come close. He was shot from close range on vital body parts to ensure that he died,” the police officer added.

The high court had barred Shaikh from entering the city due to criminal cases against him. He was living in Rangoon Nagar in Navsari, police said.

Shaikh was prime accused in threatening and attacking a couple of businessmen in the city. He had threatened them for share in land deals. Shaikh was a local hoodlum when one of the businessmen roped him to keep troublemakers away during development on a disputed land. Later Shaikh became a gang leader and started to demand his share from the businessman.

Bihar tourism minister Krishna Kumar Rishi

PATNA: State tourism minister Krishna Kumar Rishi on Thursday said three five-star hotels would be developed in the state capital soon. He said model toilets and restrooms for tourists would also come up on the highways in the state.

Addressing mediapersons at BJP office here as part of the party’s ‘sahyog karyakram’, the minister said Hotel Patliputra Ashok and Sultan Palace will be developed into five-star hotels, while the third such hotel will come up near Kangan Ghat in Patna City. He said the bidding process for these hotels, which will be developed in public-private partnership (PPP) mode, has already started.

Rishi said the number of tourists vising the state did not drop even after enforcement of total prohibition. “At least 2.95 crore tourists, including foreigners, visited Bihar in 2016 and the number went up to 3.34 crore in 2017 and 3.47 crore in 2018. In 2019, 1.76 crore people visited the state till September,” the minister said.

70,['24/01/2020'],45th Shodh Yatra returns to Ahmedabad,"This story is from January 24, 2020

AHMEDABAD: The 45th Shodh Yatra , a journey on foot by like-minded individuals in search of indigenous knowledge, creativity and innovations at the grassroots in remote corners of the country returned to Ahmedabad recently.

The ‘yatra’ is organized by Society for Research and Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies and Institutions (SRISTI). It returned with remarkable examples of innovative teachers, pest control ideas and agriculture methods. This time, the Shodh Yatra travelled to 20 villages in the district of Chamba in Himachal Pradesh and was led by visiting professor at IIM-Ahmedabad, Dr Anil Gupta.

During the Chamba visit, the team came across villages which prevented the deadly foot-and-mouth disease by an indigenous method of spraying a special powder made of crushed sugar and tobacco into used human footwear and then bandaging the same around a bovine’s hooves. The insects, according to the villagers, got attracted to the sugar, while the tobacco acted as a pesticide. Another fascinating instance was a series of transparent water pouches that were hung from beam of shops by grocers. This warded off mosquitoes because of the reflection in the water pouches. In fact, Gupta explains, the mosquitoes saw a magnified version of themselves and kept away.

Other than these, the yatris met people who inspired them. One such example being Pawan Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School in Singa. When he had joined the school he found there was only one chair for three teachers. That day he decided to give up his one-year salary towards school improvement. Soon people got inspired and did the same, and within an year the school became a smart school.

AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Thursday celebrated the first anniversary of the smart city bus service with pomp and show at ZP Ground in Aurangapura. However, on finding out that the celebratory cake for the event was brought covered in plastic, municipal commissioner Astik Kumar Pandey imposed a penalty of Rs 500 on the cakemaker.

The smart city bus service was launched in the city on January 23, 2019, under the Smart City project. Under the service, a set of 100 buses were ordered from Tata Motors. The Aurangabad Smart City Development Corporation Ltd (ASCDCL), the special purpose vehicle formed for the implementation of the Smart City project, signed an MoU with the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC). As per the MoU, the MSRTC is providing drivers and conductors to run the service. Over the past year, 58.86 lakh citizens have travelled by the city buses. The ASCDCL has also awarded the contract for the construction of 150 bus shelters.

In an elaborate ceremony held at the Aurangapura ZP Ground, the anniversary of the service was celebrated in the presence of mayor Nandkumar Ghodele, MP Imtiaz Jaleel, municipal commissioner and ASCDCL CEO Astik Kumar Pandey, corporators and school students. Prashant Bhusari, the chief operations manager of smart city bus service, was present too. The guests released colourful balloons in the air to mark the anniversary.

A cake designed in shape of the city bus was ordered from the Cantonment-based Lalsa Bhai cakemaker by the AMC for the event. However, the cakemaker had used plastic to cover the cake. This did not go down well with the municipal commissioner, who immediately asked the solid waste management department to penalise the cakemaker for violating the plastic ban. The cakemaker was fined for Rs 500 and a spot fine receipt was issued.

This is not the first instance of Pandey fining for plastic use. Earlier, he had fined one of his officials, one of the corporators and a person greeting the chief minister for using plastic products.

CHENNAI: A 65-year-old ragpicker was crushed to death by a private bus off Poonamallee bypass service road on Wednesday. The deceased man, yet to be identified, was sleeping under the parked bus, which had remained at the spot for a couple of days following an engine fault.

Bus driver M Govindaraj, 33, of Pallipattu in Tiruvallur district , failed to notice the man sleeping under the vehicle and the rear wheels ran over the man’s head crushing him to death on the spot. Soon after the cries of the victim, fellow bus drivers told police that they tried to stop the vehicle by alerting the driver. But, he didn’t notice it and stopped the vehicle only after running over the elderly man.

During inquiries, vendors and traders told police that they have spotted the elderly man picking rags in the neighbourhood. Based on the complaint of V Mohan, 44, a driver of a bus company who witnessed the incident, the Poonamallee traffic police rushed to the spot.

81,['24/01/2020'],Telangana: Contractors fill own coffers in the name of sand societies,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Sand mining in Eturu on the banks of Godavari river.

HYDERABAD: Contractors, infra companies and politicians seem to be filling their own coffers from sand mining in the name of tribal sand societies in Telangana . For instance, in Mulugu district, which has around 60 tribal sand societies, sand mining works are being given to sub-contractors in almost all cases. As per government rules, rights to sand quarrying have to be exclusively given to tribals in tribal areas.

In Eturu, despite legal notices being served to offenders and complaints being lodged against irregularities , both collector and cooperative society have turned a blind eye to the problem.

Moreover, it is learnt that the district cooperative society has failed to maintain audits of sand societies and except for one or two, none of the societies have filed financial statements.

In the case of Samakka of Eturu Grama Prajala Isuka Quarry Labour Contract Cooperative Society, it was found that there was no elected committee when the sand mining license was issued.

On March 10, 2015, G Samaiah, a Koya tribal of Kamalapur in Mangapet mandal of Warangal district had sent a notice to the collector and Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation Limited (TSMDC) on irregularities in sand mining, however, no action was taken by authorities.

“The excavation of sand in Godavari river has become a business in the hands of persons with money and muscle power. They are saying that because adivasis do not have machinery, the licence was granted to the contractors, but as per river conservation rules, no machine can be used in the excavation of sand from rivers. AP Panchayat Raj Act 1998 says that mine license has to be granted to tribals only. Eturu Grama Prajala Isuka Quarry Labour Contract Cooperative Society Limited had no committee when the license was granted in February 2015. They said that a meeting of society members took place in the collector’s chamber, but it is impossible to accommodate hundreds of society members in the chamber,” the complainant alleged, adding that environmental and forest clearances were not obtained in many cases. “In the name of the welfare of tribals, mining mafia is destroying forests and rivers,” he said.

Furthermore, the cooperative society had served a legal notice to Sri Sai Constructions on October 25 in 2015 in which it alleged that it had given a contract to the company for loading, excavation and transportation of sand, but that the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) ‘is recognising unauthorised persons of Sri Nidhi Construction for the purpose of raising contract.’

A petition was filed in 2018 with Jayashankar-Bhulapalli district officials regarding Sri Saralamma Tribal Isuka Moram Quarry Labour Contract Cooperative Society. The petitioner alleged that for more than two years, sand was being mined without the consent of the members and that the work was given to construction companies.

Madhu Babu, a tribal from Kanthanapally alleged that a former TRS leader’s son was actively involved in sand mining in the area. “There is too much competition among sub-contractors. Each politician ropes in his own sub-contractor. We don’t have machinery so we depend on contractors,” he said.

“The societies are supposed to submit annual reports. Except for one society, none of them have submitted the report. We have inspected one Alubaka Mahila Sand Society in Venkatapur and found that they are not submitting financial statements. No general body meeting was conducted. As the tribals are not educated, it is difficult,” Mulugu district cooperative officer C Nagar Narayana told TOI.

The murals have been spotted in Pattharkhola village

ALMORA: Pre-historic murals have been claimed to have been found in Pattharkhola village of Almora .

Lalit Joshi, teacher at the SSJ College, who found the murals a few days ago, claimed that “the murals painted in a saffron colour corresponded exactly to the murals of Lakhudiyar, a famous prehistoric site near Petsal village of Almora.”

“I got to know of these rocks, which have small holes init, from the local residents. I had read about some rocks with cup marks whichwere earlier used in various rituals. I then made up my mind to visit the area,”he said.

At the village, Joshi says he also spotted several paintings of what looked like a group of people.

“These paintings are very similar to the ones in Lakhudiyar,” hesaid.

As the word spread of the presence of the murals, a team of the state archaeology department visited the site on Tuesday and studied the paintings.

Chandra Singh Chouhan of the archaeology department based in Almora, told TOI, “Though the murals look similar to the ones in Lakhudiyar, we will submit a report in the matter soon after conducting carbon dating and other related researches. Without that, we won’tbe able to say much about the period that the murals belong to.”

Delhi-based Smart Bike will station 5,000 pedal sets at 617 docks

CHANDIGARH: Bicycle-sharing will start here in two months. Delhi-based Smart Bike will station 5,000 pedal sets at 617 docks and pay Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) Rs 12 lakh a year, which was the highest financial bid opened on Thursday.

The city will not spend even a penny and the company will get limited advertisement rights. A senior UT official said: “Two companies had cleared the technical-bid stage, so the contest came to who could pay the CSCL more. Smart Bike’s rival quoted Rs 6 lakh.”

The authority’s board of directors will meet next week for approving the allotment to Smart Bike. The official said: “The 5,000 bicycles will come in a phased manner, since the company will first have to create its infrastructure. It’ll take 18 months for the full service to begin, although the first phase will start in two months.”

After failing thrice to start bicycle-sharing, the UT administration had relaxed the project rules and floated a new tender. The official said: “The relaxed rules allow for hybrid bicycles that can be switched from pedal to electrical mode. The earlier rules permitted only 25% bicycles to be power-assisted. Now, the city has also been divided into four zones to help the successful bidder lay its infrastructure.”

The earnest money was reduced from Rs 30 lakh to Rs 5 lakh to attract more bidders.

84,['24/01/2020'],Madhya Pradesh: Minister hurls ‘Shakuni Mama’ &amp; Kaurava barbs at BJP,"This story is from January 24, 2020

BHOPAL: The political storm over former BJP minister Badrilal Yadav’s offensive remark against the Rajgarh collector took an ‘epic’ turn on Thursday when minister P C Sharma compared CM Kamal Nath with Lord Krishna and BJP leaders to ‘Shakuni Mama’ and the Kauravas from The Mahabharata.

BJP took strong exception to this, and suggested that Nath send his cabinet ministers for courses in meditation

On Wednesday, in the aftermath of Yadav’s comment, Congress spokesman Durgesh Sharma had likened BJP to the Kauravas. Law minister P C Sharma continued with the Mahabharata theme to corner BJP on Thursday.

“The offensive language and the kind of words used against a woman bureaucrat are very unfortunate and highly condemnable,” Sharma told mediapersons on Thursday morning, adding: “The incident occurred in the presence of Shakuni Mama and it was only after indication from Duryodhana that Dushasana went ahead with the ‘chirharan’.”

Top state BJP leaders — including former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan, state party president Rakesh Singh and LOP Gopal Bhargava — were on the dais when Yadav made the remark in Biaora on Wednesday. Sharma didn’t specify who he meant by Shakuni Mama, Duryodhana and Dushasana. “This country respects women and worships Durga, Saraswati and Laxmi,” he said.

On BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya’s comment that the “virus of JNU has reached Madhya Pradesh”, Sharma said: “There is no virus of JNU here. Rather, it is the virus of Rani Laxmibai and Indira Gandhi. And if women officers face any difficulty while maintaining law and order in the state, then chief minister Kamal Nath will stand behind them like Lord Krishna.”

BJP reacted strongly to Sharma’s ‘Shakuni Mama’ and ‘Kaurava’ barbs. State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal said, “Chief minister Kamal Nath should send his cabinet ministers for a course in Vipassana meditation to get rid of their mental disturbances. Every other day, the state government’s ministers give statements that spark a controversy — be it Jitu Patwari in Dewas, Kamleshwar Patel in Rewa or P C Sharma in Harda earlier this week. Ministers are not doing their work, but creating controversies with their meaningless statements.”

On Wednesday, Durgesh Sharma had used the same metaphor of the Mahabharata, comparing BJP to Kauravas. “On Indian soil, even the arrogance of Kauravas was crushed. Kauravas had made the same mistake that the BJP leadership is making,” he had said.

HYDERABAD: The state government, which is vying for the prestigious Unesco World Heritage Site tag for the centuries-old Ramappa Temple in Mulugu district, has come out with a ‘remedy’ for vastu dosha (flaws in the elements) in the temple.The temple’s main priest, who had reported the matter, had said that the temple has serious vastu flaws as devotees and tourists enter from the western gate, when they are actually supposed to enter from the easter side.“Devotees enter from behind Lord Sivalinga in sanctum sanctorum of the temple even though the entry should be from the east as per the shastra. The temple was built in 1213 and is more than 800 years old. For the past 50 years, people have been walking in from the western gate. This is against vastu. Soma Sutra Pradakshinam is a way of circumambulating Sivalinga. People are crossing Soma Sutra from behind while entering the temple. This is not good,” temple priest Umashankar told TOI.He said that a representation was submitted to Mulugu district collector Narayana Reddy stating that the temple’s growth and international recognition are being delayed due to vastu dosha. “We suggested that if the entry is from the east, the temple will have a bright future ahead,” he added.District authorities and MLC P Srinivas Reddy have sanctioned an 80 feet road connecting the main road to the temple, and the work has almost been completed. The contractor of the road works told TOI that the road would be open to public and entry to the temple would be allowed during Medaram Jatara in February first week. “Kameswara temple located on the right side was dismantled, and the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) is trying to rebuild it.

AHMEDABAD: The leader of opposition Dinesh Sharma has raised doubts over the decision of the AMC to award the contract for super-suction machine to the old contractor despite the fact that a new contractor has quoted a price of Rs 2,200 less per shift.

Sharma said earlier this month the water supply and sewerage committee rejected the proposal of the official wing to award the contract to one Accord Watertech and Infrastructure (AWI). The company had quoted a price of around Rs 10,000 per shift which was 2,200 less than the tender price.

Sharma claimed the panel, instead of clearing the proposal of AWI, decided to continue with the contract of Hitesh Associates. He said the earlier contract of Hitesh Associates had ended on July 30, 2018. “Now when the new tender is invited, the committee still wants to continue with the old tender and wants to float a new tender afresh,” he said.

AURANGABAD: Second time in just 10 days, relatives of a patient vandalised the medicine ward of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) on Thursday after the patient died while undergoing treatment in the afternoon.

According to GMCH sources, the patient had a heart-related ailment and was referred to the state-run hospital from a private hospital. Doctors said the patient was being treated at the Intensive Coronary Care Unit . However, the case turned critical on Thursday.

When the doctors declared the patient dead at 4.30 pm, a mob, posing as relatives, turned violent and damaged the glass doors on the ground floor of the medicine building, the GMCH administration said. The relatives also verbally abused the on-duty resident doctors, holding them responsible for the patient’s death.

Earlier, on January 13, a mob of 60-70 people had damaged the doors and windows of the same medicine ward after a patient had died. One guard was physically assaulted. Subsequently, a case was lodged at the Beghumpura police station.

When asked about measures taken to prevent such attacks, in-charge dean of GMCH Kailash Zine said the police is investigating the case lodged in the January 13 incident. “Increasing the security is not the solution as 10 to 15 men suddenly break into the ward, where only a single relative is allowed at a time. We have faith in the police. Following the investigation, lawful action will be taken,” he said.

Beghumpura police said no complaint was registered until late on Thursday. HoD of medicine Meenakshi Bhattacharya condemned the mob attacks.

BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said on Thursday that if CAA is upheld by the Supreme Court as ‘constitutional’, it would be the “last nail in the coffin of secularism”.

Talking to reporters, Singh said that he and former MP and hockey Olympian Aslam Sher Khan would tour the state and create awareness on secularism like Mahatma Gandhi.

“Today, Muslims of this country are frightened and have lost hope in the system as well as the police and political parties. There is one last ray of hope and that is the judiciary. Muslims are keenly watching if the Citizenship Act is rejected or upheld by the apex court. If this Act is accepted as constitutional, it will be the last nail in the coffin of secularism.”

The former chief minister said, “If the Act is upheld, we don’t know what will happen in the country because no one can comprehend the amount of rage it will generate among the people. The protest against CAA-NRC has gone beyond the control of political parties, as they are being organised by students, women and children of minorities.”

Digvijaya Singh said that it is important to restore the faith of minorities, who feel they are being targeted. He said that Hindu, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians had fought for freedom hand-in-hand and have taken India to the road of development.

Aslam Sher Khan said that he will start touring the state to spread the message of communal harmony. “We will travel and talk to those who believe in secularism and Hindu-Muslim unity. We will fight the way Mahatma Gandhi fought for Hindu-Muslim unity. There may be attacks on us but we are not bothered. Sanatani culture should continue as it believes in Ganga-Jamuni sansktiri.” The dates for the tour of the state will be decided soon.

JODHPUR: Rajasthan High Court has issued notice to the election commission and the state government seeking reply as to why has the election programme for zila parishads and panchayats not been unrolled yet, despite completion of the five-year term.

The petitioner Bhanwar Singh has prayed for directions to the state government and the election commission for immediate release of the election programme and holding elections as soon as possible. Petitioner’s counsel Moti Singh argued that it was the duty of the state election commission and the state government to announce elections in Panchayati Raj system every five years.

“But in spite of the completion of five years on January 23, no such programme has been announced by the election commission,” argued Singh. The petition stated that the election commission had deferred the election in 3,264 gram panchayats and 412 panchayat samitis an order on January 9, 2020.

The petitioner also prayed for immediate announcement of elections in all these rural entities as well as 33 zila parishads in the state.

“The election commission has no constitutional authority to defer the elections except in the condition of death of any candidate or booth capturing,” argued Singh.

He prayed to the court quashing the orders of the election commission of deferring the election dated January 9 and announce a fresh programme as soon as possible for election in all the panchayat samitis, gram panchayats and zila parishads. Admitting the arguments of the petitioner, the court issued notices to the state government and election commission seeking reply by January 28.

HYDERABAD: The TRS drew inspiration from the freedom struggle of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose during the statehood movement, said culture and sports minister V Srinivas Goud . “Netaji founded the Azad Hind Fauj to achieve freedom for India from British rule and during the Telangana movement to achieve a separate state, Subhash Chandra Bose was an inspiration,” said Goud, while addressing a large gathering to mark the 123rd birth anniversary of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose in the city on Thursday. “To fight and achieve what we wanted to, his life was a big inspiration,” added Goud at the event at Rabindra Bharati organised by Jan Urja Manch.

A team from the ‘She Teams’ gave a demonstration on how women and girls can protect themselves against attacks. Students of the martial arts form ‘Kalari Pattu’ gave a demonstration of the art form. Meenakshi Amma, 78-year-old exponent of Kalari Pattu from Kerala performed the martial arts form using a stick. Her team said the real sword that she uses could not be brought along with them as it was not allowed on flight due to a security alert in connection with Republic Day. The programme organisers felicitated culture director Mamidi Harikrishna Reddy on the occasion. A play was staged on the life of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

AHMEDABAD: In a boost to foreign investments in Gujarat, the Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) is looking to double the number of Japanese companies present in Gujarat, over the next five years.

This will be undertaken through a fresh wave of investment by Japanese companies in Gujarat. According to state government figures, There are presently more than 100 Japanese companies operating here.

“We are looking at doubling the number of Japanese companies in Gujarat in the next five years. So far, more than 80% of Japanese companies that have invested in Gujarat are in the automobile and auto ancillary sector, while companies from other sectors are fewer. Of these, Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC) and Honda Motorcycle and Scooters India (HMSI) have made the biggest investments in Gujarat,” said Yasuyuki Murahashi, chief director general, JETRO, New Delhi. He spoke to mediapersons after a seminar on investment opportunities in Gujarat, organized in Ahmedabad by JETRO Ahmedabad on Thursday.

“There is a lot of potential for companies in other sectors such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals and food processing for investing in Gujarat,” said Murahashi.

The seminar was organised with a view to bring more Japanese investments to Gujarat by Japanese companies that are present in India and are looking at expansion. Representatives of eight companies in the automobiles and chemical sectors met state government officials after the seminar and later visited the Sanand Industrial Estate-III at Khoraj, about 25km from Ahmedabad.

“We had fruitful engagement with representatives of 10 companies from Japan in the automobiles, chemicals, textiles and medical devices sectors. While bigger companies are looking at an investment of Rs 800-900 crore, smaller ones are looking at investments in the range of Rs 200-400 crore,” MK Das, principal secretary, industries and mines, told TOI.

State government officials also confirmed that a second round of visits by Japanese companies is expected to take place soon.

Slowdown Effect: Japanese investments in auto sector in low gear

According to top officials of Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), investment in the automobile sector has remained slack of late, due to the slowdown in the sector. Speaking to TOI, Yasuyuki Murahashi, chief director general, JETRO, New Delhi, said, “The pace of investment in the automobile sector has fallen due to the slowdown in the sector. However, Japanese investments in India come with a decade-long vision and therefore, as market sentiment revives, there will be a revival, as more projects pick up pace.”

Japanese garden to come up at riverfront

The Sabarmati Riverfront at Ahmedabad could soon have a Japanese garden. Ahmedabad mayor Bijal Patel announced that a few locations in the city have been earmarked for such gardens, while speaking to the press on the sidelines of Kobe-Ahmedabad and Hyogo-Gujarat Economic Cooperation Seminar, organized at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) by the Indo-Japan Friendship Association (IJFA), Gujarat, and Japan Information and Study Centre (JISC).

“The project is being undertaken as part of the sister-city agreement between Ahmedabad and Kobe. We will be showing them the land and if everying works out, a Japanese garden may come up at the riverfront,” said Patel.

A 51-member goodwill delegation, led by the mayor of Kobe, Kizo Hisamoto, is currently on a two-day visit to Ahmedabad to explore collaboration on academic, cultural and business fronts. “Talks are under way to work out a collaboration between Gujarat University and Kobe University,” said Mukesh Patel, president, IJFA, Gujarat.

96,['24/01/2020'],Two major dump yards in city to be reclaimed,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: Heaps of waste accumulated in two major dumping sites in the city—Palayam and Erumakuzhy—will be removed through bio-mining and bio-remediation. The corporation estimates that over 11,000 cubic metres of unsegregated waste have been piled up at both the sites over the past few years.

The dumping site at Palayam will be cleared as part of Smart City project. The temporary rehabilitation block for vendors and shop owners who have to be shifted for the modernisation of Connemara Market, is being planned at the site which has turned into a dump yard. A total of 484 vendors will have to be shifted to the temporary rehabilitation camp and around 60 vendors will be given permanent space as per the old agreement with Trivandrum Development Authority (TRIDA).

Bio-mining of legacy waste/un-processed municipal solid waste is done by excavation of the non-biodegradable waste by using suitable mechanical sieving machine or any other suitable equipment. It involves segregation and retrieval of recoverable materials and recycling and reclamation of the dumpsite. It is roughly estimated that there could be roughly 9684 cubic metres of legacy waste spread over 40 cents at Palayam.

The corporation’s health wing has recently undertaken a total survey to assess the volume of waste that has to be bio-mined at Erumakuzhy. The survey results showed that 2,388 cubic metres of waste have accumulated at Erumakuzhy. The corporation will now undertake bio-mining of the waste with the help of specialist agencies.

The civic body has decided to do bio-mining of two the dump yards as per rule 15 of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. As per the rule, the local body has to investigate and analyse all old open dumpsites and existing operational dumpsites for the potential of bio-mining and bio-remediation and take actions to bio-mine or bio-remediate the sites.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had raised alarm that the incremental growth of municipal solid waste dumpsites has resulted in mountains of waste and it had directed the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to propose standard operating procedure (SOP) for bio-mining and bio-remediation of legacy solid waste.

As part of bio-remediation and bio-mining, the dumpsite is excavated and waste is stabilized through bio-remediation. The waste is exposed to air with use of composting bio-cultures. The stabilized waste will be screened to recover all valuable resources like plastic, brick, metals, clothes, rags followed by sustainable management through recycling, co-processing and road-making, according to SOP issued by CPCB.

Bio-mining at Palayam is estimated to cost Rs 94 lakhs. The process will be completed within in three months.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has initiated corporate insolvency resolution proceedings (CIRP) against a Lotus Greens group company , the Gurugram-based Bright Buildtech Pvt Ltd .

An NCLT bench comprising Abni Ranjan Kumar Sinha (member, judicial) and Sumita Purkayastha (member, technical) appointed Naresh Kumar Bhutani as insolvency resolution professional (IRP) on a complaint filed by the operational creditor, Suresh Chand and Sons for non-payment of dues of Rs 1.01 crore.

“It’s the first case of its kind where a real estate company has been dragged into insolvency by operational creditors like real estate agents,” said advocate Piyush Singh, partner at PSP Legal, who represented the real estate agent in this case.

So far, financial creditors like banks or homebuyers would file cases against developers under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

Singh said the company was developing a 100-acre township in Gurugram .

The complainant had offered brokerage services to the developer and had raised bills for work that it did in 2015 and 2016. After prolonged negotiation, the operational creditor sent a final bill of Rs 1.01 crore, including a service tax component of Rs 15.56 lakh on April 8, 2019. It moved NCLT when it got no response.

CM Kamal Nath interacts with vice-president (international sales) of Amazon Web Services Max Peterson at Davos... Read More

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh scored big on Thursday in its push for investment at Davos by bagging wind energy projects worth Rs 4,000 crore. Chief minister Kamal Nath has been holding back to back talks with global business leaders there to showcase MP’s potential as a business-friendly destination.

“Two central wind projects of 325MW capacity each are now approved. One of them is by Soft Bank Energy of Japan and the other by Actis from England. They will be coming to the state,” said principal secretary, industries, Rajesh Rajora, adding that the twin projects involve a total investment of Rs 4000 crore. Details related to the two projects are yet to be announced, he said.

Earlier in the day in Davos, Dawaat, a food company based in Mandideep got an FDI worth Rs 125 crore from Saudi Arabia Agriculture and Livestock Investment Company (SALIC). A government spokesman said the prevailing atmosphere of faith has started yielding results.

CM Nath met Max Peterson, vice-president (international sales) of Amazon Web Services, and showcased Madhya Pradesh’s potential to have a data centre of AWS. The CM highlighted “low lease rentals and competitive skill adjusted labour cost” in MP, said sources.

Peterson was informed about the low power tariff in MP, with Re 1 per unit rebate, and that nearly 693 acres land was available at nine locations in the state. The state promises to provide up to 75% rebate on cost of land for units established on government land and leased up to 99 years, said sources.

AWS is present in six locations in India — Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai — and has data centres in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.

“Back-office operations of AWS can be set up in MP as the state is cost-competitive for support functions,” Rajora said. The MP government is already in touch with Vikram Sridharan, general manager, public policy government relations, at AWS India on setting up a data centre in MP.

Nath also had a meeting with Borge Brende, president of World Economic Forum, and L Iswaran, minister of communications and information of Singapore.

Last month, CM Nath had handed over a letter of award to the CEO of Wesley Group Dorian Mulanse for a world class 27-hole golf course-cum-resort to be constructed at a cost of Rs 220 crore in Ninod village near Sanchi.

101,['24/01/2020'],Prestigious surgical training centre faces closure over funding,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Mumbai: One of the country’s prestigious surgical training centres, the Center of Excellence for Minimal Access Surgery Training ( CeMAST ), in Worli is facing closure.

“Closure is more than a possibility,’’ CeMAST founder Dr Tehemton E Udwadia told TOI on Thursday. “It is facing closure as the German medical equipment company, Karl Storz SE, which has been funding it altruistically, has now changed its philosophy,’’ he added. He said CeMAST officials had received a call on Thursday afternoon, asking them to cancel training programmes scheduled from March.

CeMAST started in 2012 with the backing of Sybill Storz, who was until last year chairperson of Karl Storz SE, and has now retired. The company is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of laparoscopic equipment, and has been providing roughly Rs 16 crore annually to run the centre, said Dr Udwadia. Calls to the company’s Delhi office were unanswered.

CeMAST started in a 4,000 sq ft centre in Mahalaxmi to provide multispecialty minimal access surgery training courses, but it moved five years back to Poonam Chambers in Worli. It offers training across 16 specialities, from gastroenterology to neurosurgery and ENT, and has trained over 8,000 surgeons.

``I set up the centre because the surgeon:population ratio in India is absurdly low. With the implementation of new government schemes, it is important to train more surgeons,’’ said Dr Udwadia.

CeMAST provides tissue-based training on sophisticated machines specially built by Storz for the centre. “Surgeons get to train on animal tissues or entire GI tract or bladders preserved from dead animals,’’ said a surgeon who trained there three years back.

Gastroenterologist Dr Amit Maydeo said it was a pity the centre could close down. “It has fantastic modules and is a great training centre,’’ he said. But, he added, training centres require a lot of funding, equipment as well as manpower.

Dr Jaydeep Palep, a laparoscopic and bariatric surgeon, said the centre was a great resource centre for young surgeons from tier 2 and 3 cities. “Surgeons who come out of college could get hands-on training on high-tech equipment with faculty picked up from across the country,” he said.

Dr Udwadia said the centre had just worked out details of a distance education module to ensure surgeons get knowledge without having to travel to Mumbai. “We manage to make Rs 4 crore a year, but it isn’t enough to run such a training centre,’’ he added.

A doctor, a faculty member, said while some philanthropic groups in India could easily fund such a centre, it would be a shame to reinvent the wheel. “Not only will a new office be needed, new equipment will be needed,’’ he said.

102,['24/01/2020'],MVA set to scuttle BJP plan to dissolve NIT,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: Change of guard at the state level has led to a complete reversal in urban development policies of the city. Devendra Fadnavis-led government had decided to dissolve Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) and make Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) the sole planning authority. However, new guardian minister Nitin Raut is against the decision and wants to strengthen the agency.

Raut had written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray some days ago urging him to revoke the decision to scrap NIT. He demanded that NIT be made planning authority for 3,800 Gunthewari layouts, which were developed by the agency and have been handed over to the NMC.

Thackeray forwarded the letter to the state urban development department (UDD), which sent letters to NMC and NIT seeking their opinion. NIT told the government that it would abide by whatever decision state government takes.

The demand for dissolving NIT was raised by corporators belonging to all political parties. It was one of the major poll promises of BJP in 2017 NMC elections. NIT was to become Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) and its jurisdiction would be confined to the Nagpur metro region outside city limits.

The Fadnavis cabinet, on December 27, 2016, decided to dissolve NIT with effect from December 31, 2017. A three-member committee was formed to oversee the dissolution, but the committee did not take any concrete action. On June 13, 2018, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court stayed the decision. Fadnavis nevertheless went ahead with the dissolution process, albeit slowing down the process.

The state cabinet on August 13 last year approved NIT’s dissolution. The UDD issued a notification on August 27, ending NIT’s powers as planning authority and transferring its schemes, leased out plots and flats to NMC. NMC became planning authority for entire city, including for sanctioning layouts, building plans, regularization of unauthorized plots, amendments in city’s development plan etc. However, final notification was not issued before assembly elections were declared and NIT survived.

According to mayor Sandip Joshi, BJP decided to dissolve NIT as having two planning bodies for a city was an anomaly. “There was tremendous discontent among Nagpurians over working of the NIT. They welcomed our decision to dissolve it,” he said.

Fadnavis had started emasculating NIT long before dissolving it. He made NIT bear NMC’s share of Rs250 crore in the Smart City project and asked it to pay Rs200 crore for two phases of cement road projects and another Rs200 crore for executing works in regularized and unauthorized layouts. Consequently, NIT, which was a cash rich body, has become almost bankrupt.

Even though the BJP government had almost dissolved NIT, there were several grey areas and contradictions. For example, even after cabinet’s decision to scrap NIT, the agency continued to execute several projects like developing multimedia show at Futala Lake. There was no clarity on whether NIT’s assets within the city like the Ambazari swimming pool, Jagnade Square transport plaza etc would remain with NIT or be handed over to the NMC. The issue of NIT staffers had not been resolved.

This move by the state government seems like another effort to throw spanner in the work of the BJP-ruled civic body. As reported by TOI on Thursday, Raut has usurped the Nag-Pili river rejuvenation plan by bringing in a ministerial committee to oversee its implementation. Three Congress ministers and Shiv Sena’s Aditya Thackeray are part of the committee. Two days ago, municipal commissioner Abhjit Bangar was replaced 13 months into his tenure.

103,['24/01/2020'],Footpath encroachers to be evicted soon,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The town planning standing committee, which has begun issuing notices over parking violations at major commercial complexes and institutions, has directed the engineering wing to remove all encroachments, mostly belonging to street vendors, on footpaths.

The previous council meeting had approved the town planning standing committee’s proposal to release funds to remove unauthorised structures jutting onto the footpath and roads.

The street vendors who have occupied RKV road, the stretch between Museum police station and Kanaka Nagar, will also be rehabilitated as part of opening up space for implementing a project under the smart city scheme. As part of the scheme, vending zones would be established on RKV road at a cost of Rs 2.7 crore.

The problem posed by street vendors had led to a heated debate in the council with various councillors and mayor K Sreekumar admitting the existence of a network, which helps the street vendors operate unauthorizedly in the city.

Sreekumar has said that individuals owning multiple bunks run the businesses making use of local and migrant labourers.

BJP councillor Karamana Ajith has alleged that one of the persons who has been allotted street vending space, rents out shops and commercial spaces in the city and that eligible beneficiaries were being denied opportunities.

The town planning wing had earlier completed compilation of data on road and footpath encroachers, parking violations and unauthorised constructions in the city.

Major violations regarding encroachment of footpaths were found in locations coming under Fort, Ulloor and Kadakampally areas. Nearly 150 violations have been found in these areas. Footpath encroachments have been also reported from Pettah, Perunthanni, Chalai and Fort areas.

104,['24/01/2020'],Table NIT dissolution report in NMC first: Mayor Joshi,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: Mayor Sandip Joshi has issued a letter to municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe asking him not to submit report on dissolution of Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) to the state government without tabling it in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) house.

Guardian minister Nitin Raut had written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asking him to not dissolve NIT and instead strengthen it. The state urban development sought NMC’s views on the same.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday evening, city BJP president Pravin Datke appealed to Raut to withdraw the letter. “The decision to dissolve NIT was taken in interest of common citizens. The guardian minister should not block the move. We appeal to the CM not to agree to Raut’s demand. However, if the state government goes ahead with strengthening of NIT, BJP workers will take to streets. We will not let the government hurt the city,” he said.

Datke said that former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had decided to dissolve the NIT because it was the most corrupt agency in the city. “NIT has enriched itself by looting the poor and middle class Nagpurians. Its working is very poor,” he added.

The BJP leader further said that Raut had taken the decision because BJP was in power in NMC and would continue to rule for another twenty to twenty-five years. “However, the minister should realize that only BJP voters don’t live in Gunthewari layouts,” he added.

On reasons for delay in dissolution of NIT during Fadnavis government, Datke said that there were several legal issues which had to be sorted out.

Earlier, mayor Joshi strongly condemned the decision and said that it was unfortunate. “The guardian minister instead of working for welfare of people is promoting an agency that harasses them,” he said.

Sachin Pilot

JAIPUR: Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Thursday said the economic slowdown and rising unemployment have hit the youth most. On one hand, the prices of essential commodities are skyrocketing, while on the other hand, there are hardly any employment opportunities for youths, he said.

Pilot was speaking at a meeting of the Congress leaders including ministers, MLAs, MPs, district presidents and party candidates from the last assembly and parliament elections, at the PCC office on Thursday. The meeting was held to finalise preparations for Rahul Gandhi’s rally which has been named as ‘Yuva Aakrosh’ rally scheduled to be held at Ram Niwas Bagh on January 28.

Pilot sad, unemployment is at an all-time high in the last 45 years. But the BJP government at the Centre instead of focusing on the pressing issues is adopting diversionary tactics by raking up contentious issues.

Pilot claimed that besides party workers, Gandhi’s ‘Aakrosh Rally’ will be attended by youths and students in large numbers.

“There is unrest among youths in the country today. The educated are unemployed and the economy is in poor state and Rahul Gandhi wants to focus on it. The message from the rally will go across the country,” he said.

“Gandhi will raise issues concerning people. After Rajasthan, he will hold rallies in other state also. In view of the Union Budget, the Congress wants the Central government to focus on the issues which help the economy run,” Pilot added.

The youth Congress and the NSUI have been asked to mobilize youth for the meeting.

Speaking on the occasion, chief minister Ashok Gehlot said due to the wrong polices of the Centre under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the economy has nosedived. Common people are reeling under skyrocketing prices while the youth are uncertain about their future with retrenchment and shrinking job opportunities the order of the day, he said.

Gehlot said crude oil is only sold at half the price at international market today compared to UPA government but there is no reduction in fuel prices.

He alleged that demonetisation and poor implementation of GST are the major reason for the economy going haywire. Even the share of the state government in central taxes were being curtailed. The Centre is now playing diversionary tactics. CAA and NRC are part of it, he said.

Gehlot alleged “The country’s unity and integrity is under threat by fascist forces and an atmosphere of fear is being created among the people.”

AICC secretary Vivek Bansal also spoke on the occasion.

107,['24/01/2020'],Narendra Modi: PM’s intervention fast-tracks Odisha railway project delayed for 25 years,"This story is from January 24, 2020

NEW DELHI: At the meeting on Wednesday of Pragati , a mechanism devised by him to speed up implementation by bringing down silos within bureaucracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed happy when presented with the status report of one particular project.

The 289-km Khurda-Bolangir railway line in Odisha was conceived in 1995 and was supposed to provide succour to one of the poorest regions in the country. Yet, it languished for decades until 2015 when it engaged the attention of the PM when he was reviewing the status of projects which had failed to get off the ground much after they were launched.

After going through details of the project and seeing that it had progressed at a snail’s pace, Modi made his unhappiness known. “This area is home to some of the poorest and neediest citizens, who got left behind other parts and are in dire need of compassionate governance. We have failed them,” sources in PMO quoted a worried Modi telling officials in 2014.

“Work on this project should have been prioritised. If the work had been finished by 2000, the original date of completion, the cost would have been substantially lower and would have helped unlock the economic potential of eastern India,” he lamented.

On Wednesday, in sharp contrast, Modi, a stern taskmaster, looked satisfied when the railway ministry shared the details of implementation of the Khurda-Bolangir line with him to show that work was going as per schedule.

Sources said the railway ministry shared the progress report on the line and assured that work on it was on track. The chief secretary of Odisha said not much work had taken place on the project for the first 20 years and the process of serious planning began only in 2015, after Modi undertook the first review. Odisha government said that land was being acquired for the project from the Rs 2,000 crore state government provided for after the renewal of interest in the project under NDA government and that the job would be complete in next 6 months.

On the question of environmental clearances, sources said the PM noted with satisfaction that the railway ministry and the environment ministry were on the same page.

For PMO officials, the progress of the Khurda-Bolangir line is another evidence of the effectiveness of Pragati platform as a tool to speed up implementation of projects which were mothballed for several decades.

On Wednesday, the PM took up 11 issues out of which nine were linked to delayed projects worth Rs 24,000 crore and spread over nine states of Odisha, Telangana, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Bihar, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh and three Union ministries. These include three from the ministry of railways, five from the ministry of road transport and highways and one from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.

Until Wednesday, the PM has reviewed 269 projects with a total investment of Rs 12.30 lakh crore. The PM has also reviewed the resolution of grievance redressal related to 47 government programmes and schemes across 17 diverse sectors, sources said.

Pankaja Pankaja

AURANGABAD: Amid speculations that BJP was sidelining Pankaja Munde , the party office on Thursday declared that it would launch an agitation on January 27 for Marathwada ’s water issues under her leadership.

Munde supporters were upset over the lack of enthusiasm from BJP towards her plans to stage a token hunger strike in front of the divisional commissionerate for various issues concerning Marathwada. The former state minister for women and child development had decided to go ahead with her agitation under the banner of Gopinath Munde Pratisthan, irrespective of the party’s support.

It is said that Munde is upset with former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and some other senior party functionaries since her loss in the 2019 assembly election from Parli. “The BJP has in a way extended an olive branch to Pankaja Munde at the party core committee meeting by declaring that the agitation would be launched under her,” said the party worker.

The statement issued by party’s office secretary Mukund Kulkarni states that the meeting of the core committee headed by state party chief Chandrakant Patil, in the presence of Fadnavis, decided to launch the agitation to be led by Pankana Munde.

Fadnavis, union minister of state for civil supplies Raosaheb Danve, former speaker Haribhau Bagade and the opposition leader in legislative council Pravin Darekar would participate in the agitation.

BJP state general secretary Surjeet Singh Thakur said that the Fadnavis-led government had initiated many steps to free Marathwada from drought. “However, after the new government took over, its constituents got engaged in infighting and settling scores with each other, thus eventually ignoring the region’s core issues,” he said.

111,['24/01/2020'],Chinese worker among two dead in mine roof collapse,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: An Indian and a Chinese mine worker were killed after the roof of a manganese mine caved in at Gumgaon, around 24km from Nagpur, on Wednesday. Two mine workers, an Indian and a Chinese, were injured and are recuperating at a private hospital after the incident around 400 feet below ground level.

Manganese Ore India Limited (MOIL) had allotted contract to China Coal C3 (India) Private Limited to complete a work of high speed shaft sinking. The work at the site had started in 2018, with combined work force of MOIL and the Chinese government company’s workers. The incident took place in the second shift.

The deceased in the incident were identified as Chen Gang, 31, and Pankaj Chauriwar, 25, who were trapped under debris when the roof fell. The injured, Wang Yungshan and Anil Bagde, were lucky to be rescued by co-workers.

Khapa police have registered an offence against Prashant Geharwal, assistant manager of MOIL, along with the Chinese company’s safety personnel Vijay Kumar Swarajsingh and others for causing death due to negligence.

Police said some 13 persons, including four Chinese, were engaged in the concreting work of the multi-level inset. MOIL sources said the systematic support rules were comprehensively followed, but a sizeable portion of the roof caved in. “The incident was unfortunate, and mostly uncontrollable and unpredictable,” said MOIL sources.

Bagde, 25, who suffered lower back and limb injuries, said it appeared to him as if there was an earthquake under the ground, which was followed by a huge load collapsing on his lower back. “I was fortunate my upper part was not buried under the debris, which allowed me to keep breathing. My unfortunate coworkers were completely trapped under a huge quantity of debris,” he said.

Bagde, who was working as a welder, said co-workers rushed to rescue him and others. “An engineer had just completed checking the portion of the walls and roof with a hammer to see whether something was loose and coming off, but he had got no untoward indication. The walls and roof were mostly covered with safety iron net too, but still a portion of it came off,” he said.

“We have no assurance of the future, whether there would be work for us tomorrow or we shall be fit enough to work again and when,” said Bagde, who had been working at the site for around a year.

Police said the deceased Chauriwar too was tightening a bolt when debris fell on him. The four persons were rushed to Mayo Hospital but Chauriwar and Gang were declared dead. Their post mortem was performed at Mayo Hospital.

MOIL sources said Chauriwar’s family has been compensated with Rs20 lakh and job for one of his kin. The Chinese company is learnt to be taking up the compensation for the injured and their deceased national.

Vadodara: A machine prepared by a young school student from the city may well help the government in cleaning up the waterbodies in cost effective way. Varun Saikia, a standard IX student of Navrachana School, Sama, recently won the top prize in the category of cleanliness and health at the CBSE National Science Exhibition held at Gurgaon recently.

In an exhibition where hundreds of schools from across the country had participated, Varun’s machine prototype ‘Makara’ earned appreciation from none less than CBSE chairman Anita Karwal. “I believed in my project and I had this feeling that I will win in the contest,” Varun told TOI. Karwala didn’t just appreciate the project but also suggested that the innovative machine prepared by Varun should be suggested to the government.

The 14-year-old boy’s prototype ‘Makara’ floats on the water surface and picks up garbage as well as filters sewage water.

The machine doesn’t cost much and if operated smartly, can play a key role in cleaning up water bodies across the country.

“The small prototype I kept on display in the exhibition was also equipped with Bluetooth. The machine can be connected with a mobile app and operated from a distance. I am hopeful that the government will consider my project and implement it on bigger scale,” Varun added.

Varun is in process of building a hi-tech prototype that will have bigger capacity for collecting waste, battery with longer life and a heavy duty motor.

The new prototype named Flipper will also have an ultrasonic sensor to prevent fishes getting caught, GPS to monitor its movements and data recorded to find out how much garbage was collected from which spot.

His aim is to help the government in cleaning up River Ganga as well as other water bodies across the country in cost effective way. Varun was the youngest innovator to participate in Vibrant Gujarat - Global Trade Show 2019 and he had also got grant from Gujarat Innovation Council, Vadodara chapter for building a better prototype last year.

VADODARA: In a recent Bollywood blockbuster, actor Ayushmann Khurrana’s character Bala tries every trick to hide his bald pate, except going for a hair transplant. Banyan City’s ‘Bala’, tried even the last resort — hair transplant — which, however, proved to be an exercise in futility.

Seething in bald fury, the 31-year-old man pulled the homeo clinic major to the consumer court on charges of cheating and won the case too.

Ketan (name changed) mane struggle began in June 2015 when lured by an advertisement by a leading chain of homeopathy clinics, assuring 100% result, he had spent Rs 65,000 to get respite from baldness. He was promised a good crop of hair within a year of the operation. However, not a single strand grew on his head.

After medical tests, Ketan was referred to a senior doctor at the Ahmedabad clinic by a doctor at chain’s Vadodara clinic. He went for the transplantation process at Ahmedabad where too the doctors assured him of hair regrowth after the treatment .

However, his wait proved fruitless, even after a year. Ketan then contacted the doctors again but was given assurances again to wait patiently for some time more. Makwana even sent them photos of his condition through emails and WhatsApp but got no response.

Miffed at being duped, the resident of Karelibaug filed a complaint with Vadodara district consumer disputes redressal forum and fought the case on his own. He presented all the bills, medical test reports, copies of emails and WhatsApp messages and argued that the treatment was bogus as he was healthy at the time of treatment as shown in medical tests and was also young. Therefore, the failure to grow hair was not his fault, he said.

The court upheld his evidence and the arguments and concluded that the treatment did not yield results and ordered in his favour. However, Ketan will get only half the amount he spent along with interest.

“Since the doctors have performed the hair transplant surgery on the complainant it is not appropriate to award him the entire treatment cost,” the court stated in the judgment, ordering the chain of clinics to pay him Rs 32,500 along with 8% interest. Ketan will also get Rs 5,000 compensation for mental harassment and legal expenses.

BHOPAL: The Union home ministry has appointed two high-level committees to look into the disposal or sale of enemy properties in the country. However, none of the 9,406 moveable and immovable vested properties that figure on the ministry’s list belong to Bhopal .

In 2015, the Custodian of Enemy Property for India (CEPI) had vested control of properties on Abida Sultan, the daughter of last Nawab of Bhopal Hamidullah Khan. However, the move was challenged by Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan and Pataudi family in the MPHC. The case is scheduled for hearing on February 20.

A senior Union home ministry official said, “We do not know the exact number of enemy properties in Bhopal . The state government has been asked to look into the matter.” About 131 properties in state capital Bhopal were earlier identified and vesting order was issued.

Highly placed sources in the government said there was a complaint over tabulation of CEPI properties in Bhopal. The properties worth crores are largely controlled by Pataudi family and spread over 2,800 acres across Bhopal, Raisen and Sehore. All three districts were then part of the Bhopal State. Officials from the revenue department have traced land records from 1940 to 2016 record. Following the district collector survey on behalf of CEPI, there is only one property named ‘Nani Ki Haveli’ in walled city which has been traced to Abida Sultan.

A complaint in such a matter is received by CEPI. It pertains to people who migrated to Pakistan or were residents of Pakistan between September 10, 1965 and September 26, 1977 are treated as enemy movable and immovable properties in India. New CEPI Act applies retrospectively to transfers that have occurred before or after 1968 and prohibits civil courts and other authorities from entertaining disputes related to enemy property.

Meanwhile, disposal of 88 properties in MP is scheduled to take place soon. The properties are located in Khandwa (1), Jabalpur (1), Seoni (5), Satna (55), Harda (4) and Dindori (22). Across India, a total of 6,50,75,877 shares in 996 companies of 20,323 shareholders are under the custody of CEPI. Of these 996 companies, 588 are functional or active companies, 139 of these are listed with remaining being unlisted.

The process for selling these shares is to be approved by the alternative mechanism under the chairmanship of Union finance minister and comprising minister of road transport and highway and home minister. The sale proceeds from this may be used for development and social welfare programmes.

In a public interest petition filed by Lokesh Khandelwal, the bench comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Ashok Kumar Gaur said among the 5,279 odd trees that are required to be cut for the purpose of construction of road, the state government has come up with a report indicating that 859 such trees will be translocated to appropriate places on the highway.

“We are of the opinion that since the present expansion of the road is a public requirement; we direct that the state may be permitted to construct the road on the proposed state highway Majari to Haryana and Rajasthan border and Majari to Neemrana. It is also subject to abiding their undertaking that 859 trees will be translocated,” the bench said.

The court further stated that although the state has agreed to plant three times the number of trees than the trees that have been removed, they need to plant more. “The state government must plant 10 times the number as planting trees is a vital necessity in a state like Rajasthan,” the bench said.

The bench has further expressed hope that the state government would abide by the request made by the court.

We will make a representation to the election commission in this regard,” said Danve who was among those who led the huge rally taken out to mark the birth anniversary of the party chief.O

On the occasion, deputy mayor Rajendra Janjal said that Sena wants to spread the ideology and message of the late Shiv Sena supremo to all the people. “This would help us to strengthen our hold in the city.

Hyderabad: After complaints of a high-protein diet being supplied to around 1,000 patients per day at the state-run Niloufer Hospital without recommendations surfaced nearly three months back, a detailed inquiry was launched into the issue.

While new mothers and pregnant women require a high-protein diet and a daily chart is followed to ensure a nutritious meal, the food supply contractor in this case was supplying to high-protein diet to all patients, making an additional Rs 16 per patient per day. The additional amount that the contractor took home in the process ran to the tune of up to Rs 2.5 crores per month. This scam was confirmed by the inquiry committee in a confidential report submitted to the health authorities a few days ago.

After the irregularity was pointed out, a team of five members, including dieticians, was set up by the Director of Medical Education (DME), Dr Ramesh Reddy and the report had been directly submitted to the state health secretary. “The report has pinpointed the scam and the double payment being made for the food. Links establishing the corruption have been shown as well. It is recommended to remove the contractor and review the food in all other state-run hospitals too,” said a senior official.

The fact that the scam went unnoticed for almost a year hints at a nexus, the report said. “While pregnant women and lactating mothers are recommended high-protein diets, not all patients require it. The contractor was supplying the high-protein diet to all the patients without being asked. While regular diet costs Rs 40, the high protein diet costs Rs 56. There are issues related to double payment to the contractor from funds of Aarogyasri and from hospital funds as well,” said a source in the hospital.

VADODARA: A city businessman nearly bid goodbye to Rs 9 lakh after an unidentified man from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh tried to cheat him using a cheque with his forged signatures.

Piyush Shah, a resident of RV Desai road in the city said he was plainly lucky as the money was debited from his Union Bank of India account in the Sultanpura branch on Lakkadpitha road on December 18. However, Shah’s son Hemang received an SMS regarding the debit and asked his father if he issued a cheque for Rs 9 lakh to anyone.

When Shah denied, the father-son duo immediately went to the bank to inquire and wrote an application to the branch manager requesting to ‘stop payment’ on the forged cheque. Thankfully, Shah received the money back in the account the next day.

But on inquiring further with the bank, it was known that the cheque was deposited in a branch of Oriental Bank of Commerce in Kanpur. However, it was not known whose account it was. Shah, who deals in industrial machineries, submitted his complaint with Navapura police, based on which cops registered a complaint of forgery on Wednesday. tnn

Nagpur: Even as former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has challenged summons issued to him by the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) here in the Supreme Court, he’s likely to remain present before former’s court on Friday, according to his lawyer Uday Dable.

During the last hearing, the CJM’s court had granted a reprieve to Fadnavis by adjourning hearing on plea filed against him by lawyer Satis Uke for allegedly suppressing information about two pending criminal cases while filing affidavit for nomination form during 2014 assembly polls.

The CJM asked Dable to make Fadnavis appear in the court on January 24 for replying to the summons issued to him. It was a second reprieve for the South Nagpur MLA. He was earlier allowed to skip the court proceedings on December 4 when he was asked to appear by the Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) court led by judge SB Mehta.

According to BJP office-bearers, Fadnavis had given his consent to attend the concluding ceremony of Khasdar Krida Mahotsav, to be held at Yashwant Stadium on Friday evening. Since Fadnavis would be in city, his lawyers may produce him in the court in the afternoon to avoid any embarrassment in case the CJM issues a warrant. The court may not grant him a reprieve third time, they said.

After Uke’s case was remanded back by the SC to trial court, JMFC issued summons to Fadnavis, a five-time MLA, on November 4, asking him to remain present on December 4 to defend charges against him.

After Dable sought ex-CM’s exemption from appearance citing “unavoidable circumstances” due to winter assembly session, the hearing was adjourned to January 4. The ex-CM again asked for exemption from appearance citing his “busy schedule” for visiting hailstorm hit areas in the state being LOP, following which he was asked to remain present on January 24.

On January 9, the leader of opposition in assembly moved the top curt for reviving its order of remanding back Uke’s case to JMFC. Fadnavis had allegedly failed to mention in his poll affidavit summary case no. 232 of 1996 (u/s 500 of IPC — defamation) and regular criminal case no. 343 of 2003 under various sections of IPC, which were pending before the JMFC.

The crime took place at the house of Ashokan, a native of Parthoorkonam in Manamboor.

The incident happened on January 8, after the NRI family found that the main door of the house and a steel almirah were forced open.

Other than gold ornaments, the thieves had also stolen Rs 50,000 and 1,000 UAE Dirhams.

Based on the complaint, police had arrested four youths who have direct involvement in the burglary on January 19 from their hideouts in Perumkulam and Attingal.

AHMEDABAD: A study by the Society for Women’s Action and Training Initiative (SWATI) and International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW) last year, revealed a new low in sexual violence against women in public spaces in rural Gujarat .

The study to gauge sexual violence against women and girls ( SVWAG ) conducted across some 10 villages in various districts of Gujarat revealed that 59% of adolescent girls faced lewd comments, songs or playing music loudly when they walk through the village.

According to the study, conducted as part of the ‘Know Fear’ project, 41.1% of adolescents were subjected to winking, leering and stalking; while 29.7% faced grabbing of their hands, obscene gestures, touching or even groping. The study was conducted in Jarvala, Bamanva, Bajana, Gavana, Mithaghoda, Bubwana, Sedla, Vadgam, Nana Goriya and Savlas villages, among others, with a sample size of 522 adolescent girls in the 13-18 years age-group and 522 women above the age of 18; from the population of 16,000 in these villages.

“The infrastructure in rural areas is poor and women don’t have access to safe public transport. At the same time, awareness about the issue and acknowledgement of the problem by authorities is poor. Thus, it is important to create conversations around cases of sexual harassment ,” said Poonam Kathuria, director, SWATI.

Agra: Slogans of ‘Jai Sri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ rent the air at the BJP’s well-attended public meeting, organized in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), at Kothi Meena Bazar ground on Thursday.

If slogans of “azadi from CAA” have been the flavour of the anti-CAA protests in UP, particularly AMU, Modi chant and slogans like ‘Jai Shri Ram’ dominated the public meeting which was addressed by BJP’s national president JP Nadda, chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and party’s state president Swatantra Dev Singh.

Though the crowd at the rally was impressive by local standards, it was far less than the 1.5 lakh figure touted by the party leaders a day earlier.

Party workers reached the venue with posters and banners of ‘We support CAA’ and kept shouting slogans of ‘Jai Sri Ram’, ‘Vande Matram’ and ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. Modi chants were also raised.

BJP workers had also carried a 51-foot-long national flag, which, in fact, turned out to be a major attraction at the rally.

People, who reached the venue wearing black outfits, were turned back by the cops on duty, as organizers feared that they might take them off and waive them during the speeches by the party leaders.

The busy area around the venue witnessed traffic jam for almost an hour as the police had cordoned off several access routes. The rally, which started around 2:10 pm, finished at about 3:15 pm.

Nagpur: In a rare life-saving surgery at trauma centre of the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), neurosurgeons removed a sickle that was almost 9cm deep in the head of a 65-year-old woman and saved her life. The woman hails from a poor farmer family of village in Yavatmal district.

Mirabai, hailing from Asoli village in Pusad tehsil of Yavatmal district, was assaulted by an unidentified person while she was sleeping in her house on Tuesday night. The assaulter left her screaming in pain with sickle stabbed deep in her head through her right eye.

Relatives rushed her to a local government hospital. Even doctors were shocked when they saw the iron sickle deep inside her skull and referred her to GMCH Nagpur. Her relatives managed to bring Mirabai to trauma centre on Wednesday morning. All the necessary investigations were conducted immediately and she was moved to the operation theatre within one and a half hours.

A team, led by Dr Pavitra Patnaik, associate professor and head of neurotrauma, ophthalmologist Dr Divyanjana and Dr Sheetal and maxillofacial surgeon Dr Vikas Meshram performed the critical operation. Within one hour, Dr Patnaik removed the sickle from the right eye.

“The surgery was extremely critical. We were worried about torrential bleeding after removal of the sickle. Saving the life of the patient without damaging any vital structures of the brain while removing the sickle was a major challenge,” said Dr Patnaik. Adequate blood for transfusion was arranged by the hospital.

The sickle was stabbed so deep inside head that both frontal lobes were hurt. While the right eye was badly damaged, even the branches of carotid arteries and on opposite side behind the left eye was injured.

“The patient is now conscious and obeying commands. The post-operative infection is a major challenge in such cases. The situation is considered critical until the patient is discharged,” said Dr Patnaik.

Dr Faizal, professor and head of orthopaedics and in-charge of trauma centre, quoted this as a courageous example of multidisciplinary team effort in saving a patient’s life. “Such treatment at any other private hospital would have cost a fortune. We are happy to offer such care at no cost. Speedy treatment was the key of success in this case,” said Dr Faizal.

GMCH dean Dr Sajal Mitra congratulated everyone involved in the patient’s management and prayed for a faster recovery of the patient.

Nagpur: Owners of vacant plots in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) limits will be fined if they fail to stop people from littering their property. The NMC’s health department has proposed to impose garbage lifting charge of Rs50 per sq mtr from such owners.

In a proposal submitted before the standing committee, the department has also sought nod to auction such properties if owners fail to keep the place clean.

Health department prepared the proposal after mayor Sandip Joshi received complaints from several residents about how open plots were posing serious health hazards due to accumulation of garbage and stagnation of water for many years.

The proposal states that if garbage is found on any open plot, the department would issue a notice to clear it in two days. If the owner failed to heed to the notice, the cost involved in clearing the litter will be recovered from the defaulting owners, the proposal stated. If the owner fails to pay the expenses incurred and in stopping garbage being dumped on his/her property, the NMC will auction such properties under relevant sections of the Maharashtra Municipal Corporation Act.

In the past, the corporation had asked the owners of open plots to remove bushes, garbage, trash and fence their property. Corporators like Abha Pande had raised the issue on several occasions at the general body meeting.

The NMC had, in 2014, passed strict bylaws for dumping, collection and destruction of waste on open plot control rule. It had provision to levy a fine up to Rs5,000 or filing a police complaint against such plot owners. The bylaws for Dumping, Collection and Destruction of Waste on Open Plot Control Rule, 2014 were forwarded to the state government for approval on March 15, 2016. However, they have not been cleared yet,” said a senior official from NMC’s health (sanitation) department.

“As a result, we could not take punitive measures against the nuisance makers,” the official claimed.

Recently, Joshi directed assistant municipal commissioners of all 10 zones and property tax department to identify private and government plots being used as garbage grounds and warned their owners. The officials will take a photograph of the garbage before removing it and use it as evidence.

OTHER PROPOSALS

* NMC’s health department (medicine) has sought nod to appoint 29 doctors including one physician, two gynecologists, 11 male doctors, two homeopaths, eight ayurvedic medicos on contract basis for its clinics. The department will require Rs93.60 lakh

* Sports and cultural department has demanded Rs46.35 lakh for organizing three-day Vaishakh Din Mahotsav to mark birth anniversary of Gautam Buddha

* Garden department seeks Rs31.32 lakh and Rs24.82 lakh for developing garden in Yogeshwar Gruh Nirman Housing Society and Vaishno Devi Nagar, respectively

* General administration department has sought nod to empower civic chief to appoint a security agency to deploy guards on its premises. NMC spends over Rs7.30 crore per annum on 300 security guards at its various establishments and offices

Allahabad: A tractor-trolley transformed into a double-decker vehicle with a bamboo partition and a pedal rickshaw with a battery for greater speed are just some of the ways in which the ‘great Indian jugaad’ has been facilitating transport at the Magh Mela ground in Allahabad.

With several of kilometres to cover on the 20-bigha venue, devotees often have to walk miles to reach the different camps on the ground. However, one can spot a number of customised vehicles, some using unique principles of rural engineering, ferrying devotees. The number of such vehicles only surged on Thursday, as hundreds flocked to the Magh Mela ground ahead of the Mauni Amavasya snan.

Almost every vehicle which came from nearby villages was retrofitted with special arrangements like extra carriers to accommodate more passengers.

“Three families from my village wanted to take a dip in Sangam on Mauni Amavasya. We were 15 people and had only one vehicle. So, we decided to use a bamboo structure to convert our tractor-trolley into a double-decker bus so that more people could be accomodated,” said Ghanshyam Kumar, a native of Mahi village and a farmer by profession.

Some vehicles were also saddled with stoves and sacks filled with vegetables and rice, especially those ferrying devotees from far-flung places.

“As we there wasn’t enough space in the truck, we decided to hang our belongings on both sides of the vehicles,” said Rambilas from Khajuri Khurd village.

Even small vehicles like motorcycles and vans were seen fitted with additional carriers. In many vehicles, baskets tied to the roof were laden with items of daily necessities.

133,['24/01/2020'],"Gujarat BJP MLA Ketan Inamdar falls in line, offers to withdraw resignation","This story is from January 24, 2020

BJP MLA Ketan Inamdar with BJP president Jitu Vaghani on Wednesday

VADODARA: The resignation drama by Savli BJP MLA Ketan Inamdar was wrapped up within 24 hours with state BJP president Jitu Vaghani announcing that he had decided to take back his decision.

After a marathon meeting with Inamdar at the circuit house, Vaghani told media persons that his decision could not be called as a rebellion. “Inamdar would withdraw his resignation. He did not rebel against the party. It was an emotional decision he took as he felt some of his works were not happening. These include setting up an ESIS hospital in his constituency, a lift irrigation project and the issue of the power bills of the Savli municipality,”

Inamdar had sent his resignation to the assembly speaker Rajendra Trivedi, chief minister Vijay Rupani and Vaghani on Wednesday. The strongly worded resignation letter blamed lack of coordination between the government and administration as well as indifference in addressing important issues in his constituency for his decision.

Inamdar had stated that the dignity and respect of his post as an MLA were not maintained. “This has happened at the cost of government constantly trying to ensure the respect of senior officials,"" the letter had stated. It later came to light that he was referring to being cold shouldered when he had approached a senior Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (MGVCL) official for resuming electricity supply to the Savli municipality.

The power connection of several facilities of the municipality including streetlights had been severed as the civic body’s power bills were overdue. Inamdar said that he had requested the official to resume the connection by taking a post-dated cheque, but the official insisted that the connection would be resumed only after the cheque was cleared. He later raised the issue with state energy minister Saurabh Patel, but it remained unresolved and Inamdar felt hurt, sources said.

While Inamdar had been sulking for quite some time now and had raised the issue of officials not maintaining the dignity of elected representatives earlier too, the MGVCL incident was the catalyst in his decision to resign. He mentioned this even while addressing the media after the meeting with Vaghani.

Inamdar too said that he would be withdrawing his resignation. “My concerns have been addressed by the party president, chief minister, deputy chief minister and the energy minister,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Rupani had told reporters in Dahod that the issue would be sorted and the government was serious in resolving problems of MLAs and common people.

Throughout Thursday, a series of resignations were tendered in favour of Inamdar. These included district and taluka panchayat members, agriculture produce market committee members, BJP party office bearers and others.

134,['24/01/2020'],Maharashtra: 'Flood-hit Sangli farmers received Rs 89 crore aid',"This story is from January 24, 2020

Over 3 lakh farmers were affected by floods in the month of August 2019

KOLHAPUR: Sangli collector Abhijit Choudhary on Thursday said that around Rs 89 crore has been distributed among flood-affected farmers in the district till the third week of January.

“We had demanded around Rs 130 crore from the state government as compensation for farmers. The government, however, released Rs 100 crore of which Rs 89 crore has been distributed among the beneficiaries. The remaining amount too will soon be deposited into the accounts of the beneficiaries,” he said.

According to Choudhary, they also received Rs 109 crore aid for damages caused due to the unseasonal rainfall of which Rs 102 crore have been distributed. “We returned Rs 7 crore back to the state government after compensation was distributed among all the beneficiaries,” he said.

Daulat Desai, district collector of Kolhapur , told TOI that they received Rs 121 crore from the state government for agriculture aid of which Rs 38 crore have been distributed and the remaining amount will soon be deposited into the account of the farmers.

“We are taking every precaution to ensure every affected farmer gets the assistance, but if anyone is facing any kind of hurdle then they can contact the respective administrative authority to get their issue resolved at the earliest,” he said.

Over 3 lakh farmers were affected by floods in the month of August 2019. The beneficiaries are being provided compensation according to the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) guidelines.

Pratap Jadhav, deputy commissioner revenue, divisional commissioner office (Pune), told TOI that they received around Rs 1,018 crore as aid for five districts across the division.

The officials, however, are unsure about the distribution update. According to a revenue department official, Rs 300 crore has been received from the state government for flood compensation and Rs 222 crore has been received for homes destroyed during floods.

The state had received record rainfall in the month of August during which many rivers and waterbodies had flooded or crossed danger levels, leading to evacuation of around 5 lakh people in Kolhapur and Sangli districts.

JAIPUR: In an indirect attack on the central government and current political unrest, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said the Centre should listen to the ‘ Mann ki Baat ’ of intellectuals and writers. He was speaking after inaugurating the annual five-day Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF) at Diggi Palace.

“JLF is the pride of Rajasthan, it has carved a place for itself in the world. Everyone is in awe of it. I hope the festival will inspire the new generation. It is being talked about across the world. All the literary people discuss this festival, they feel at JLF they will get a chance to say their 'mann ki baat' as well as ' kaam ki baat '... If intellectuals voice their opinion then it is a possibility that their voices will reach those holding positions in the government and it might help,” Ashok Gehlot, who was attending the festival after a gap of six years, said.

Interacting with the media later, he said that this was the first time that such a situation has risen in the country and urged authors and speakers to discuss it at length and get the message across.

“This is not just a national but an international platform and I strongly suggest that more people should participate in it,” added Gehlot.

Referring to the Centre’s policies that have resulted in political turmoil, he reiterated, “Everyone knows the present scenario and I hope that the central government listens to writers and those participating in the festival.”

The festival, now in its 13th edition, was described by Gehlot as “pride of Rajasthan” and “Sahitya Ka Mahakumbh”. During the event, he paid tribute to Rajasthani poet Vijaydan Detha and unveiled an English translation of the late poet's works—“Bijji: Timeless Tales from Marwar”.

Speaking at the inaugural session, festival co-director and author William Dalrymple told the audience that the JLF has now formally become “the largest literary festival” in the world.

“Around five lakh people attended the event last year. At a time when people say that love for literature is dying, we are a proof that it isn’t. Literature is alive and loved and the teeming crowds at the JLF are proof of it,” said Dalrymple.

Gehlot later tweeted that he hopes that the youth especially would gain from discussions at the festival as well as from the authors.

Deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who visited the festival venue on the inaugural day, said that the festival was not only for the people of Rajasthan but also for the whole world. “Every citizen in this democracy has the right to speak about the present scenario in the country and their words should be acknowledged,” said Pilot.

Sanjoy Roy, festival producer, said that literature was the only thing that can push against the ""spread of a narrative of hatred”, the one that the country was witnessing today.

KOLHAPUR: The schools across the state will soon be ringing bells at least thrice during the school hours to encourage students to drink water.

The state school education and sports department, in a notification on January 21, has asked schools to decide on the timing of ringing the bell and include it in their daily schedule.

The notification stated that dehydration is the root cause of many diseases among school children across the state. The children should drink at least 1.5 to 2 litres of water, which varies according to the age, height, and weight of the child.

“It is a common complaint from parents that their wards bring the water bottle as is without even consuming it. Less water consumption can cause urinary tract infections and also kidney stone, lethargy, and distressed behaviour,” it said.

The notification has asked the headmasters to fix the timing of ringing the water bell in their daily schedule, which could habituate students into consuming water on a regular basis during the school hours. The schools have been asked to give special breaks to students to use washrooms. The education commissioner has been asked to review the initiative.

Asha Ubale, district primary education officer, told TOI that they have received instructions from the education department and same will be forwarded to schools. It is an important initiative, she said.

Sattappa Mohite, a city-based education activist, said such initiatives have already been implemented in a few schools in other states and it is a welcome decision from the education department. “It will surely help in encouraging students to hydrate themselves at regular intervals, it can really help them in their academics as well,” he said.

Notably, according to United Nations guidelines, every student (child) has the right to safe drinking water and it’s a human right too. It is important for schools to provide safe drinking water. It is also one of the important criterion in the Right to Education (RTE) infrastructure needs of the schools to have drinking water facility in a school.

KOLHAPUR: Farmers in the region are hoping for better weather for roses ahead of Valentine’s Day in February.

According to the farmers, rose production has already taken a major hit this season due to the unfavourable weather conditions. However, consistent cooler weather can make up for the bad better a little bit.

A farmer said if there is a lot of cloud cover over the poly houses for rose saplings, it can have an adverse effect on the growth of the plants. Extreme cold too can be harmful. The current pleasant weather is ideal for rose production. He added that the flowers will be ready for the export from January 28 onwards and will be kept in cold storage. He added that the orders are still being received and the rate of orders for the flowers will increase after February 10.

“For production in late January and early February, we have to prepare from December and make sure everything is in order — including the plant’s health and the production quality,” he said.

The farmer added that the flowers are kept in the cold storage at the fixed temperature of 7°C before they are shipped out. This ensures they retain their freshness.

He said the European market is the biggest, and long-stemmed red Taj Mahal rose variety is most in demand. According to the farmer, varieties of red roses like Grand Gala, Top Secret and Upper Class are also quite popular abroad. He said that in the past few years, there was variation in the production of roses, either due to the climatic differences or due to demand.

Ramesh Jadhav, a flower vendor, said, “Generally a red rose costs somewhere between Rs 10-15. However, during Valentine’s Day, the prices skyrocket upwards to Rs 30-60 for each rose.”

138,['24/01/2020'],Modi corrected historical mistakes committed at the time of Independence: Nadda,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Agra: In an obvious reference to the abrogation of Article 370 in J&K, enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and settling of the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, BJP national president JP Nadda on Thursday said that what Prime Minister Narendra Modi has achieved in eight months of his second tenure, the Congress could not do it in the last 70 years.

Addressing a pro-CAA rally in city’s Kothi Meena Bazar, Nadda said that Modi has made corrections to “historical mistakes” made at the time of Independence. “Congress had absolute majority in both the houses of Parliament but never had the willpower to make these corrections,” he said.

It was his first political rally since the 59-year-old leader from Himachal Pradesh was elected as the BJP’s 11th president on January 20 after he emerged as the only nominee in the fray.

Nadda was accompanied at the rally by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya and party’s state president Swatantra Dev Singh. This was the sixth rally organised by BJP in the state in support of CAA.

Nadda quoted western UP poet Muzaffar Razmi’s famous lines to attack Congress. “Lamhon ne khata ki thi aur sadiyon ne saza payee (centuries have been punished for mistakes of the moment). We got freedom but the decisions, which were taken then, had proved deadly for the country.”

Maintaining that Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and even former PM Manmohan Singh wanted Indian government to settle Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Christians, who were left in Pakistan during Partition and had been facing problem in their survival, Nadda said, “The Congress leadership is suffering from ‘manasik diwaliyapan’ (mental bankruptcy). The statements issued by the party in the last eight months will reflect that these are intended to help Pakistan.”

“It’s unfortunate that Dalit leaders are opposing the CAA. These Dalit leaders and the Congress hardly know anything about the CAA and are only spreading canards to mislead people,” Nadda said, adding that this law is for providing citizenship not taking it away.

In his address, UP CM Yogi Adityanath said, “In a democracy, everyone has the right to speak in a democratic way but those who cause chaos should not be under any kind of illusion as the government has a solution to every problem.”

Maintaining that protesters who destroyed public property “on the signal of PFI and SIMI” have now realised that their assets will be confiscated, Yogi said, “The government will recover the losses from those who damaged public property.”

“Now, these people are trying to ruin the atmosphere by using their women and children as a shield,” he said, adding that previous governments used to plead with miscreants but the one led by him knows how to deal with them.

On CAA, the CM said, “The CAA is connected with India’s heritage. It has been the tradition of India to protect the people who come here for shelter. The CAA is a law for granting citizenship not for taking citizenship away. The opposition must understand its reality.”

Allahabad: Miles away from her family, Pratapgrah native Kalpana describes kalpwas as a ‘spiritually blissful’ experience. However, she often is unable to share her experience with her family given the poor mobile connectivity at the Magh Mela venue.

Hundreds of devotees, especially the kalpwasis, have been reeling under problems spurred due to the poor mobile connectivity at the Magh Mela ground.

This is the time that 45-year-old Kalpana and her neighbour Sushila have visited the Magh Mela as kalpwasis. “It is a unique experience to spend a month on the banks of Ganga, while leading an austere life. We share joy, perform rituals and attend religious discourses. My experience is the only thing that I would be taking back with me. However, I find it difficult to share my experience with my family due to the connectivity snags,” said Kalpana.

Another devotee, Kunti said, “This is the first time that we are facing such a problem. Despite having a mobile phone, we aren’t able to use it for the most basic of all tasks, which is making a call.”

Kinnar Akhara’s acharya mahamandleshwar Laxmi Narayan Tripathi said scores of devotees, seers and kalpwasis, who were staying in camps at the ground, are facing troubles due to lack of connectivity.

Another kalpwasi Sundar said, “During our visit, we have had a number of experience and would like to share it with our family members, but are unable to because of the poor network.”

Mela Adhikari Rajnish Mishra said that additional mobile towers of all service providers have been set up on the Mela ground. As these mobile towers were set up just two days back, we are experiencing some teething troubles,” he added.

140,['24/01/2020'],Sena MP demands mate for tiger C1,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: Shiv Sena MP Prataprao Jadhav has demanded a mate be brought for tiger TWLS-T1-C1. The peripatetic wildcat has been shuffling between Ajanta Hills in Aurangabad and Dnyanganga wildlife sanctuary in Buldhana district.

Saying that he wants the male tiger to settle down, Jadhav told TOI that he has sent a request note to the forest secretary on Thursday. C1, which stepped out of Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary on June 23, 2019, has logged over 1,900km till now in the last 7 months and is still moving. As reported by TOI earlier, this is the longest recorded tiger dispersal in the country.

“C1 has travelled through six districts and of the late it has been shunting between the Dnyanganga and Ajanta in search of mate. Wandering for such a long distance continuously poses risk to the tiger as well as the villagers,” said Jadhav.

Officials expected C1 to move towards Muktai Bhawani Conservation Reserve in Jalgaon district where there are tigers but it didn’t happen. Plans are being explored to translocate the male in Melghat tiger reserve, which is 70km from Dnyanganga.

The MP was told by forest officials that the tiger went to Ajanta Hills for a second time and is now returning. “If a tigress is released in the sanctuary, C1 could settle down. Tiger population will open tourism avenues in the district and employment to locals,” said Jadhav.

The Sena MP said as of now there are no big carnivores like tigers in Dnyanganga and “their numbers will help maintain ecological balance here”.

State’s chief wildlife warden Nitin H Kakodkar said, “We are exploring the suggestion.”

APCCF & field director of Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) MS Reddy was not aware about the MP’s letter but said he was not averse to his suggestions.

“There is no competition in the 200sqkm sanctuary. We have two dams and big water bodies inside the sanctuary with a sizeable prey. There is only one village Devari inside which has voluntarily offered to move out. This will make the sanctuary completely inviolate,” said Reddy.

Like the 149 sq km Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary which has 7 adult tigers, Reddy sees “equal potential in Dnyanganga”. “We cannot strengthen tiger conservation on just probabilities that conflict will occur,” he said.

Hyderabad: Gone are the days when authorities used to track water leakages by manual methods. The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) are now using geographical information systems (GIS) to identify water leakages.

For the first time, the water board had taken the initiative to implement GIS technology for the water supply network at Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Division-VI (SR Nagar) in two sections including SR Nagar and Fathenagar on a pilot project.

After receiving the good results, the HMWS&SB has extended the GIS technology to other sections too and is set to complete the process.

All water lines are being linked to the GIS technology. For each size of the pipeline, different colours have been marked to identify them easily.The water board has marked eight different colours, according to HMWS&SB sources. “These colours would help the water board staff by tracking the areas in which the water line has suffered leaks through GIS technology. In fact, all valves of the pipelines will be linked to this technology,” said a senior HMWS&SB official

Soon after there is a leak in water line, an alert include time, location and size of pipeline will be received by the concerned official. Based on the alert, the staff will reach the location and rectify the leak.

Meanwhile, SMS alerts will be delivered to the mobile phones of the consumers stating that water supply will be affected due to leakage. “As a result, the consumer can take precautions and make alternate arrangements to avoid inconvenience,” added the official. “GIS will also help us to track the leakages of the valves as well. The information of the water source’s valve and the location will be sent to the water lineman too,” said the official.

KOLHAPUR: The local crime branch has arrested two suspects for their alleged involvement in four house burglaries in the city.

Police have recovered valuables worth Rs 6.40 lakh from them. Police suspect that the duo’s interrogation may give leads on some more cases of house break-ins.

The arrested have been identified as 24-year-old Rajat Ramchandra Khilare and 40-year-old Dagadu Annappa Devkule alias Yuvraj. Both are residents of Kanannagar, Kolhapur .

“While investigating the cases, we got information from sources that the two youths from Kanannagar were suspects in house break-ins. Based on the information, we traced them and nabbed them for interrogation,” said a senior police officer.

“During the interrogation, the duo confessed of committing four house burglaries in the city. They were working as workers at building construction sites and used to observe the houses while on duty. After confirming that the residents of the houses are on vacation, they used to make a plan and commit burglaries,” he said.

“We have seized 160-gram gold jewellery worth Rs 6.40 lakh from them. We suspect that they might be involved in more house break-ins reported in the city,” he said.

The idol of Saibaba

AURANGABAD: The action committee formed to spearhead the battle for Pathri’s development has announced that it would pursue a legal course to ensure that the town is declared as Saibaba ’s birthplace.

Baba Jani Durani, the NCP MLC and president of the action committee, on Thursday said a legal suit would be filed shortly. “It is unfortunate that the state government has chosen to remain silent on Saibaba’s birthplace status for Pathri. Even if the government has not withdrawn its stand to offer funds for Pathri’s development, it pains the devotees to know that the government is not ready to officially declare this village as Saibaba’s birthplace. The legal battle, therefore, is imminent to establish the claim,” he said.

On the other hand, the majority of trustees managing the Saibaba temple at Pathri said they were against any case to prove the “established fact” that Saibaba was born at Pathri. “All the scriptures and official records have mentioned that Saibaba was born at Pathri. A large number of devotees visit Pathri temple. There is no need to separately go the court on our own for any legal intervention. However, if anybody else, including residents of Shirdi, are keen on taking the matter to the court, we will present our evidence,” a trustee said anonymously.

Besides different scriptures and religious literature, the official government website of Parbhani district administration describes Pathri as Saibaba’s birthplace. “In the 1970s, field research established that Saibaba was born in Pathri village. Sri Sai Smarak Samiti (Sai memorial committee) was formed in Pathri. The committee purchased land for the temple on the site of Saibaba’s house and the construction work started in 1994. In 1999, the temple was inaugurated,” the website reads.

Meanwhile, Meghana Sakore-Bordikar, the BJP MLA from Jintur in Parbhani, has demanded that Pathri be renamed ‘Sai Dhaam’. The first-time MLA has written to the district administration and the state government.

Vishvendra Singh

JAIPUR: Even as chief minister Ashok Gehlot was inaugurating the JLF on Thursday and heaping praises on the event, his cabinet colleague and tourism minister Vishvendra Singh tweeted saying that the festival is not aligned with the marketing strategy of Rajasthan tourism department. The minster had also reportedly recommended cancelling the tourism department’s sponsorship for the event.

Reacting to news reports that the tourism minister had skipped the inauguration after being annoyed with JLF organisers, Singh tweeted, “There is no anger. Just that I don’t think the festival is aligned with our marketing strategy for Jaipur or Rajasthan for that matter. The synergy was not enough for me to spare the marketing revenue they wanted.”

The tweet came immediately after Gehlot had showered praises on JLF during his inaugural address. Gehlot said, “JLF is the pride of Rajasthan, it has carved a place for itself in the world. Everyone is in awe of it. I hope the festival will inspire the new generation. It is being talked about across the world. All the literary people discuss this festival, they feel at JLF they will get a chance to say their ‘mann ki baat' as well as ‘kaam ki baat'.”

The tourism department had approved Rs 30 lakh for the event as it commands a global audience.

Officials in the tourism department said the sponsorship deal with the organizers could not be scrapped. “Much of the promised deliverables have been made and it cannot be rolled back,” said an official.

Interestingly, the tourism minister is scheduled to speak at the event on January 27 on the session ‘Secrets of Amber by Rashmi Dickinson’.

Later in the day, in a press release, Sanjay Roy, managing director of Teamworks that organises the event, said, “We are looking forward to welcoming the honourable tourism minister, Shri Vishvendra Singh Bharatpur, when he joins us in a session on responsible and sustainable tourism.”

Singh has been in news for tussles with the bureaucrats of his department. A controversy also came to the fore after the minister wrote to the tourism principal secretary for cancelling a light and sound show project for which the Centre had released Rs 45 crore.

147,['24/01/2020'],Parents request Amit Deshmukh to scrap 70:30 MBBS quota,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representative image

AURANGABAD: Three-time Congress MLA from Latur Amit Deshmukh becoming the medical education minister has rekindled the hopes of students and parents who are demanding the scrapping of the contentious 70:30 quota for MBBS admissions.

The unique quota, which exists only in Maharashtra, has been allegedly shattering dreams of several medical aspirants from the Marathwada region every year.

While Dilip Walse-Patil (Pune), Jitendra Awhad (Thane), Vijaykumar Gavit (Nandurbar) and Girish Mahajan (Jalgaon) served as medical education ministers in Maharashtra during the tenures of three different state governments in the past, it is for the first time that the key portfolio is handed over to Amit Deshmukh, who is from Marathwada.

Deepak Rajhans, one of the parents whose ward is preparing for entrance examination for MBBS admissions, said it is high time the state delivered justice to the students from Marathwada.

“The issue of 70:30 quota for MBBS admissions simply needs corrective measures in the policy making. We feel that the issue has become more of a political in nature than the academic. We appeal to the new medical education minister to scrap the contentious quota and protect the interest of students willing to become doctors in future,” Rajhans said.

Dilip Deshmukh, chief coordinator of CET cell of Rajarshi Shahu Junior Science College, Latur, said that a delegation of colleges, parents and students met Deshmukh after becoming the medical education minister and sought his help in the doing away with the 70:30 quota.

“We are again going to meet him on January 26 and request him to intervene in the issue. We also seek his help in expediting the legal battle waged by stakeholders from Marathwada to strike down the court,” he said.

Maharashtra witnesses admission to MBBS course from three regions — Marathwada, Vidarbha, and the rest of the state. Leaving out All India quota of 15%, 70% of the seats in colleges in each region out of remaining total 85% state quota seats are reserved for candidates from that particular region while rest 30% are kept aside for students from other region. Contending that the number of medical colleges in Marathwada are relatively less as compared to aforesaid two other regions, students, parents and colleges have been pressing for doing away with the formula of 70:30 quota for medical admissions in the state.

When contacted, Deshmukh said that he has received representations from stakeholders demanding scrapping of the quota in question. “Being from Marathwada, I know the issue at large. However, I am planning to meet with different stakeholders across the state to study pros and cons of the matter. We will ensure no deserving student has to compromise on the dream of becoming a doctor,” he said.

AURANGABAD: The cyber police and the authorities of a nationalised bank have advised citizens to be extra vigilant and avoid getting cheated by a new scam, the modus operandi for which has been designed by cybercriminals to commit the crime in name of Know Your Customer ( KYC ) completion process.

“The fraudsters target customers by asking them to download a mobile or desktop app to allegedly facilitate the KYC verification process. The app helps criminals in gaining the access to the PIN of the customers and then the fraudsters can easily empty out the linked bank account in multiple successive transactions,” the bank has said in a communication issued to its customers.

The bank authorities have issued a set of do’s and don’ts to ensure that their customers do not fall prey to the evolved modus operandi of criminals.

“Customers strictly avoid downloading any such mobile or desktop app as per suggestion given on a random phone call, posing as bank employees. The banks at large have not come out with any process to carry out KYC verification of customers using mobile or desktop app. The customers are encouraged to bring such fraud calls to the notice of banks and law enforcing agencies,” bank authorities said.

Confirming the incidents of aforesaid ‘ KYC scam ’ in few parts of the country, cyber cell authorities said that the citizens must take extra caution while dealing with phone calls asking for KYC verification.

“The banks at large never ask for KYC verification once the account is opened as the necessary formalities are done before the account is activated. Moreover, banks never use any app or online link for KYC verification,” Kailash Deshmane, in-charge of cyber cell at Aurangabad police commissionerate, said.

The cyber sleuths have appealed to the citizens to be aware of apps requiring to fill in the bank, Aadhaar and mobile number details among other confidential information.

Protesters at Mohammad Ali Park near Halim crossing in Chamanganj continue their stir

Kanpur: Protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Mohammad Ali Park in Chamanganj area continued on Wednesday even as chief minister Yogi Adityanath addressed a rally in the city to drum up support for the new law.

People, including women and youngsters, joined the protest in large numbers and claimed that the citizenship law is unconstitutional and discriminatory. Holding placards reading ‘No CAA, No NPR, No NRC’, the protesters waved the national flag and sang patriotic songs.

Women protesters said they would continue their protest against the law as it was biased against a particular community.

Mohammad Ali Park near Halim crossing in Chamanganj has been witnessing anti-CAA protests on the lines of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. Protests in Kanpur, however, are confined to this park where people from different faiths and communities are joining in. Shahbuddin, a protestor, said CAA was against one community and the government should withdraw it. “People from all walks of life are protesting here. However, we are not allowing any politician to participate in the protest,” he added. Hilmi, a woman protester, said: “The government should also give citizenship to Muslims facing persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Why Muslims have been left out by the government?”

Women protesters said they were braving extreme weather just to demand that the government should roll back the law as it was against the Constitution.

Nagpur: All the other options of service could be charity but educating a person is an act of empowering them. Education is of utmost importance to every human being and it is our duty to make sure that no children, even in the deep rural areas, are deprived of schooling, said Ravidev Gupta, president of Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation, on Thursday.

Gupta was delivering the presidential address at the inauguration of Vigyan Mahotsav ‘Vision 2020’, a three-day science exhibition for school and college students organized as part of Khasdar Sanskrutik Mahotsav.

The exhibition has been organized jointly by Khasdar Sanskrutik Mahotsav Samiti, My Science Lab (MSL), Stree Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, Natraj Niketan Sanstha and Nagpur education department at Mahila Mahavidyalaya, Nandanvan.

Present at the programme were Ravindra Fadnavis, president of Stree Shikshan Prasarak Mandal, Sandip Rathod, deputy commissioner, tribal development department, MSL co-founders Dhananjay Balpande and Avinash Gaikwad, and director of State Institute of Science Ravindra Ramatkar, among others.

Gupta said, “Science is an integrated developmental aspect and its progress is vertical.

Allahabad: Days after the varsity drew flak for irregularities in hiring process of teachers during former vice-chancellor RL Hangloo’s tenure, Allahabad University ( AU ) appointed a new director for the faculty recruitment cell (FRC) on Thursday.

AU’s officiating vice-chancellor RR Tewari appointed Jayant Nath Tripathi from earth and planetary sciences department as FRC’s new director. The cell will have two deputy directors too.

Earlier, DK Chauhan was heading the cell as its chairman, while Vivek Kumar Tewari from the physics department was its director.

Officials said that most members of the FRC are believed to be close to Hangloo. However, with the change of guard, there is a strong possibility that the new VC might reconstitute the FRC.

On Thursday, the registrar issues a notification announcing Tripathi’s appointment. Besides, Anoop Kumar from the economics department and Prakash Kumar Singh from department of earth and planetary sciences were appointed as FRC’s deputy directors.

Currently, there are over 550 vacant teaching positions in AU. The varsity recently received a green light from the ministry of human resources development to begin the recruitment process, which were kept in abeyance over the past six months.

The ministry also directed AU authorities to stop all recruitment processes for teachers started in June 2019.

“The team has a huge responsibility on its shoulders and we will try to fill up a chunk of vacant teaching positions before the new academic session starts, so that the teacher-taught ratio (TTR) at AU improves,” said Tripathi.

AGRA: Mathura district witnessed back-to-back robberies on Yamuna expressway of Naujheel police limits late on Wednesday. Members of the gang used sharp metal objects to puncture tyres of vehicles and then rob at gunpoint. Mathura district magistrate’s (DM) car also reported flat tyre and had to be escorted by local police to safety. The police have now formed several teams to nab the gang members.According to robbed victims, most of the gang members were wearing khaki trousers with black jackets. Police said that all accused were in their early 30s as per victims’ descriptions.The first incident took place at 10:45 pm near milestone 65, when an Agra-based sports stadium developer, Vikram Gupta, 42, was heading home along with his driver Chote Khan. They were robbed at gunpoint by puncturing the hatchback’s tyre with sharp metal wedge. Two mobile phones, laptops, Rs 8,000 in cash and credit/debit cards were reportedly snatched away.Speaking to TOI, Gupta said, “We had travelled for 5 km after crossing Jewar toll, when suddenly two tyres of my car got punctured. While my driver was changing a tyre, a group of six to seven men armed with two country-made pistols and baton surrounded us. They snatched our belongings and ran away to nearby mustard field after jumping over barbed wire fence.”“Since our phones were taken away, we immediately went towards Mathura toll with flat tyres and informed the toll staff about the incident,” Gupta, who is a resident of Sadar, added.Later at 2.30 am, a Kanpur-based garment store owner Prateek Shukla, 25, heading back home from Delhi along with his friend Vidith Jha, 26, and driver Mukesh Kumar Pal, 42, in SUV were robbed of nearly Rs 1.25 lakh worth of belongings at gunpoint at milestone 63.Shukla said, “We were cruising at 100 kmph when suddenly two tyres of my SUV got punctured with a loud sound. Fortunately, my driver Mukesh managed to control the car and parked it on the left lane. I, immediately, dialled toll free number of Yamuna expressway for help, but before rescue team could arrive, a gang of five to six men with weapons and sticks surrounded us and started searching our pockets and the vehicle.”“They took away my two bags in which I was carrying Rs 80,000 worth of jeans for my store. The gang also snatched one bag each of my friend and driver in which they had kept their wallets, phones and IDs. I managed to save my phone in time, as I threw it on the nearby grass,” Shukla said, adding, “While crossing Jewar toll, e-way staff had warned us about possible movement of robbers on expressway. A commuter was targeted earlier in the night.”Interestingly, between the two incidents, Mathura DM Sarvagya Ram Mishra, who was also heading back to his residence from the national capital region, reported flat tyre, after which he called local police to escort him to a safer location.Major (retired) Manish Singh, in-charge coordinator of Yamuna expressway (Mathura-Agra section), said, “On reaching toll, when Vikram Gupta informed our staff about the robbery which had occurred at 10:30 pm, we immediately alerted UP police patrol teams, but they found no one in the area. Later on, the team spotted DM Mathura’s punctured car tyre and escorted him till the toll. By 2:30 am, our control centre again received news of another robbery near the same spot.”“Between milestones 63 and 65, near Awakheda village, at least seven vehicles reported flat tyres but only two were targeted by robbers. The robbers had cut barbed wires to enter expressway stretch and target the vehicles,” he added.SHO Tappal (Aligarh), SHO Naujheel (Mathura) and ASP crime Mathura Radhey Shyam Rai visited the spot, later DIG Mathura Shalabh Mathur and IG Agra range Satish Ganesh visited as part of investigation.Speaking to TOI on Thursday, inspector general of police (Agra range), Satish Ganesh, said, “After the expressway control room alert, SHO Tappal along with his team went for patrol on Yamuna expressway stretch covering 10-15 km, but unfortunately the patrolling was done on the stretch before Jewar toll (towards Noida) due to faulty information shared by e-way control room.”“Our initial probe suggests that the gang members first hid in the nearby mustard fields and used sharp metal objects to target vehicles. After their act, they fled away using the unmetalled road along the expressway. We have formed several teams to nab them. We have also scanned the records of 15-20 history-sheeters who have been active in the area.

NEW DELHI: A group of 27 schoolchildren travelling in a contract carriage had a close shave when a rashly driven Cluster scheme bus rammed their vehicle near the Sagar Ratna crossing in west Delhi’s Naraina on Thursday morning. Seven students and an attending teacher were injured, while at least two occupants of the Cluster bus and its woman marshal were also hurt. The errant driver, Prabhat Malik, was arrested on the spot.Eyewitnesses said the Cluster bus was driving down the Loha Mandi flyover at a high speed and had jumped the signal when the other bus, carrying the students of Salwan Public School in Rajendra Nagar, was taking a U-turn near the Naraina fire station. The Cluster bus, coming from Shivaji Stadium, hit the other vehicle in the middle, making it overturn.Principal Indu Khetarpal said the bus was hired by the school to ferry students.A group of firemen heard the crash at the fire station and rushed to the spot. The students got injured as they fell on top of each other. “The emergency exit of the bus was opened and the rear windshield was cut to rescue the students,” said Ravinder Singh, additional divisional officer of the station, who also informed police around 7am.“The students were traumatised and crying inside the bus. We calmed them down before pulling them out one by one. One of our men entered the bus to help the students come out of it,” said Singh. The students, who were injured on the face, arms and legs, were taken to two private nursing homes. One student had a fracture on the nose and another on aleg, but all have been discharged. Malik has been booked for rash and negligent driving and causing hurt due to negligence.“My child is still traumatised. He has been recalling how the orange bus cut through the traffic and hit their bus, which, he said, had stopped to let other vehicles pass. He needed stitches on the head,” said the mother of a Class VI student, who was informed by the school authorities.The principal said most of the injured students were discharged after first aid. “A Class XI student was brave enough to come to school after the accident and attend classes till the end. His parents also came to school,” said Khetrapal. “At the end of the day, everyone is safe. We have a WhatsApp group for every bus, which was used to inform the parents,” the principal added.The bus was packed as the school had an internal examination. “We have asked police to find out if the school bus driver was also at fault,” said Ashish Kumar, a relative of an injured student.Cluster bus marshal Reeta Singh, who took part in the rescue operations despite being injured, said, “The bus didn’t slow down despite the driver having applied the brakes.”A Delhi government official said the transport department had started an inquiry. “Prima facie, it seems the traffic signal was not working at the intersection. The Cluster bus was on the main road and the signal was green while the school vehicle was coming from a smaller road where the signal was not working. The Cluster bus driver swerved the vehicle towards the left but couldn’t avoid the collision,” he said. Cluster buses are run by Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73568273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-187461,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/11-hurt-as-cluster-bus-rams-vehicle-with-27-schoolkids/articleshow/73563452.cms

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Union minister of state for animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries Sanjeev Balyan, who is BJP MP from Muzaffarnagar , said that nobody will be able to make anti-national slogans if people from western Uttar Pradesh are given 10% reservation in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Jamia Millia Islamia.

Speaking at defence minister Rajnath Singh’s pro-CAA rally in Meerut on Wednesday, Balyan said, “I request Rajnath Ji to give 10% reservation to students from West UP in JNU and Jamia. No one else will be needed and they will take care of those who raise anti-national slogans. There is only one solution for them. This is a message to all those who are protesting against CAA .”

Later, Balyan told TOI, “Jamia has 7,000-8,000 students. JNU has almost similar number. Meerut university has double the number of students enrolled in both the universities put together. These students support the CAA but their viewpoint isn’t highlighted in the media. The viewpoint of students in two universities (Jamia and JNU) cannot be the viewpoint of the students of the entire country.”

Referring to violent protests in western UP districts after the passage of CAA, Balyan said there were deliberate attempts to stoke unrest in the region.

A doctorate in veterinary anatomy from Haryana Agricultural University , Balyan is an accused in the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, who was arrested and sent to jail for inflammatory speech.

The MoS has made many controversial statements regarding the CAA in the past.

Last month, he claimed that 10-12-year-old children studying in madrassas in UP were allegedly involved in stone-pelting and called for a probe on children's participation.

Before that, attacking Samajwadi Party chief and former UP CM Akhilesh Yadav for saying that he won’t fill NPR form, Balyan said that he will not be allowed to contest elections if he does not follow the National Population Register procedure.

In the second phase, 4000 more electric locomotives of the country would be fitted with RTIS, he added.

Explaining on the present technology and how it would be upgraded, the CPRO says that at present whenever a train crosses any important station, the main server of CRIS is automatically gets updated but in the smaller stations, it is the station master who informs the control about the details of the train and the control feeds the same input to CRIS’s server.

“The major shortcoming was that although the passengers could get the location of a train in respect to major stations, they were in dark in respect to smaller stations. But, now as the locomotive would automatically transfer the information of its location at a real time basis—and the same would be refreshed every 30 seconds—any users, irrespective of the app he or she is using, will get the real time location of the train”, said Singh.

The system was on trial in the 2700 odd locomotives for couple of months and would be commissioned after around Three months following which the passengers can start using the real time information of a given train.

“Once fully implemented, information generated using RTIS will have more accurate location of trains and better forecast of arrival time. for enhanced convenience of passengers. It will also help in analysing actual running of each train in a particular section and will also come handy in pinpointing exact delays in section on various accounts. This will also enable our controllers to identify any abnormal stoppage of trains in section arising out of any emergency or incident so as requisite assistance is sent immediately”, said the CPRO.

176,['24/01/2020'],Housing society case: High court says why Telangana arguing against stand of its own special chief secretary,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representative image

HYDERABAD: Some plot owners of Bhagyanagar Housing Society , who had bought plots from the society’s land located between Kukatpally and Hi-Tec City in survey number 1007, on Thursday charged the Telangana government with going against the stand taken by its own special chief secretary (revenue).

Stating this before a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy, plot owners’ counsel M V Durga Prasad said, “It is strange that the state is now arguing for registering this land in favour of third parties when its own special chief secretary filed a counter before the court that this land cannot be registered in favour of third parties.

The Special CS, in his affidavit, had stated that the persons claiming ownership over the parcel of land had failed to file the mandatory declaration under agricultural land reforms Act and hence the land cannot be transferred now.

The bench was dealing with three appeals filed by Prime Properties, Sri Siddharth Infratech and Services Limited and ACE HIBC Private Limited, who had challenged the order of the single judge. The judge had directed the registration department not to register land in favour of anyone till the title dispute, pending before a civil court, was finally adjudicated.

When Prime Properties tried to register the land in favour of third parties and presented the document to the registration department, the Kukatpally sub-registrar had earlier received the documents from the company and kept them pending. The single judge found fault with the sub-registrar, saying that even receiving documents for registration from “the company is unlawful because the company failed to file any declaration as required under the law”.

A legal wrangle on over the ownership of Rs 6,000-crore worth 119 acres of prime land situated between Kukatpally and Hi-Tec City area in survey number 1007. Two groups were fighting over the land and papers they produced claiming ownership show the alleged flow of title to them from two different owners. The bench posted the case to February 4 for further hearing.

The Supreme Court had earlier ordered status quo on the land and directed all parties to raise their contentions before the civil court, where the title suit was pending.

Illustration used for representational purpose

DEHRADUN: Dehradun police have launched a hunt to track down the promoter of an upscale private club in the city, Nazia Yusuf Izuddin, who is the sister-in-law of former Congress state president Kishore Upadhyay.

The move comes a few days after Izuddin's husband and Kishore Upadhyay's brother Sachin Upadhyay was arrested by police in connection with a forgery case. Police sources said that a city court has issued a non-bailable warrant against Izuddin as well but she is evading arrest and has become untraceable.

Speaking to TOI, Ajay Rautela, inspector general, Garhwal, said, “The court had issued a non-bailable warrant against her. Our teams are on a lookout and have been deployed at different places in Dehradun and Nainital to trace her.”

A police officer probing the forgery case, said that the couple would have to appear before the court that issued the non-bailable warrant against them for not joining the SIT probing the case. “Ideally, a person against whom a non-bailable warrant have been issued, does not get any relief from another court so we are expecting that she will surrender soon.”

Meanwhile, Sachin Upadhyay’s bail application which had come up for hearing on Wednesday in a judicial court in Dehradun was rejected. After his arrest earlier this week, Upadhyay was sent to a 14-day judicial custody.

178,['24/01/2020'],"No tax hikes, VMC budget focuses on water supply","This story is from January 24, 2020

Vadodara: The draft budget of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) for the year 2020-21 was on expected lines – shying away from any tax hikes and muted on development.

A bulk of the big-ticket development works in the city will be dependent on grants and schemes. VMC commissioner Nalin Upadhyay presented the draft budget to the standing committee on Thursday morning.

With civic elections round the corner, it was widely expected that VMC will not impose any major hikes in taxes and charges for services. Against the proposed budget of Rs 3,554 crore last year, the proposed budget this year stood at Rs 3,770 crore. The civic body has proposed to take up development works amounting to Rs 1,621 crore.

The major development works proposed this year include seven flyovers that will be taken up with grants from the government. A new sports stadium in the Gotri area of the city has also been proposed by the civic body. A bulk of the other works pertain to services like water, sewage, storm water drains, street lights and others.

Another reason for the expectation was that the civic body had been drawing flak for supply of insufficient, turbid and contaminated water. In this situation, it would have found it very difficult to justify hikes and would have faced opposition.

Cash-strapped VMC is in dire need of resources to fuel any growth. With no hike in taxes, it seems to have had little room for including major development works in the project. Speaking after presenting the budget, Upadhyay said that the situation at the VMC was manageable without raising taxes. “We will be able to take up more development works as compared to last year,” he said.

180,['24/01/2020'],Kerala: New outlets to give push for CNG vehicles,"Representative image

KOCHI: The plan to convert more vehicles using petrol and diesel to those running on compressed natural gas ( CNG ) has picked up steam with the Indian Oil Adani Gas Private Limited (IOAGPL) preparing to roll out 12 more outlets in Kochi and its suburbs by March 31.As of now, there are seven CNG outlets in and around the city and the demand for the greener and more economic fuel has been going up.Officials with IOAGPL said the number of CNG vehicles in the city has been steadily growing. “Now, around 22,000kg CNG is dispensed from our outlets in and around the city a day. CNG use in the city has increased by around 2,500kg per month. So, we are sure that CNG penetration will further go up in the coming years. We are planning to roll out more CNG outlets,” said an official.Officials with the motor vehicles department (MVD) said they too would take measures to encourage more motorists to switch to CNG vehicles. “Around 250-300 new CNG vehicles are registered in the city every month. We are planning to give permits to 1,000 CNG autorickshaws to conduct service in the city. The vehicle owners should be city natives. Besides, there won’t be too many conditions for allotting city permits to the new batch of autorickshaws,” a senior official with Ernakulam regional transport office said.“As of now, auto drivers face long queues in front of the CNG outlets. Normally, autorickshaws conduct services in 3-5km radius. So, more outlets need to be set up within that limit,” the official said.Officials point out that the number of vehicles switching to CNG from diesel and petrol has not gone up as expected. “In the past two of years, when CNG outlets came up in the city, more than 1,000 vehicles, mostly cars, were converted into CNG. The number of such vehicles would have been much higher had the authorities been able to start more outlets to dispense the gas,” said K A Kunheed who runs a workshop where kits for CNG conversion are installed.“If the outlets come up across the state, there will be a leap in the number of vehicles running on CNG. It is during the long-distance trips that the vehicles get more mileage on CNG,” he said.According to MVD officials, the bad experience by those who switched to LPG from diesel and petrol also has had an impact on the prospects of conversion to CNG. “Proper and timely servicing of the conversion kits is key for maintaining the quality of the kits. Many of those who converted their vehicles to run on LPG a few years ago failed to conduct services on time. It led to snags, which forced many to go back to using diesel or petrol,” an MVD official said.Autorickshaw drivers are of the opinion that at least half of the autorickshaws in the city are running on CNG. “For filling the 5kg fuel tank of my autorickshaw, I have to pay just around Rs 285. As per the offer by the manufacturers (of CNG autos), 5kg fuel will give us a mileage of 280km. In reality, we get a mileage of 250km. Still, we spend only around Rs 1 per km. So, many are buying CNG autos or exchanging their old ones for CNG autos,” said Sadik, an auto driver in Kochi.",kochi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73573635,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-139389,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/new-outlets-to-give-push-for-cng-vehicles/articleshow/73563446.cms

NEW DELHI: The Special Investigation Team of Delhi Police probing the violence at Jamia that took place during the anti-CAA protests has issued notices to three people, including former Congress MLA Asif Muhammad Khan, local neta Ashu Khan and AISA activist from Jamia Chandan Kumar Singh. They have been asked to join the probe on Friday at 11am.

The three have been named in two of the three FIRs registered after the Jamia Nagar violence on December 15. Police sources said they were found leading anti-CAA protests during which the violence broke out. Subsequently, the rioters set three buses on fire and damaged at least a dozen vehicles.

The others named in the FIRs include Asif Tanha (SIO Jamia) and Kasim Usmani (CYSS, Jamia). Police sources said notices would be served to the others within a week.

The former MLA told TOI that he had the evidence to prove that he was not present at any of the sites of the riots. “I have CCTV footage from Shaheen Bagh, where I was present at the time of the violence. CCTV footage from the local police station will also show that I passed by in a procession around 4.20pm. If police can give me a single piece of evidence about my presence, I will take all responsibility for the violence,” Khan added.

The FIR mentions that policemen deployed at Mohammad Ali Jauhar Marg were informed that students of Jamia, ex-students and local politicians will protest against CAA and NRC on that day. The protest had been going on outside the university since December 12 because of which there was a heavy deployment of security forces to ensure no untoward incident occurred.

Around 3pm, a large number of students, including the seven named as accused in the FIRs, marched from Jamia to Mathura Road and blocked the stretch. Later, police were informed that the protesters pelting stones and set DTC buses on fire.

This was also confirmed by the Consulate General of India in Jeddah (@CGIJeddah) on Thursday night.Studies have shown that humans are infected through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several countries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.The condition of the woman, admitted to Aseer Hospital was improving, even as confusion prevailed over whether she had contracted the disease that had killed 17 people and affected 600 others across the world.On Thursday evening, Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan, quoting @CGIJeddah, had tweeted that “about 100 Indian nurses, mostly from Kerala, working at Al-Hayat hospital have been tested and none except one nurse was found infected by Corona virus. Affected nurse is being treated at Aseer National Hospital and is recovering well.”But later in the night, @CGIJeddah tweeted that Dr Tarik Al Azraqi, chairman of scientific regional infection control committee, Aseer Region, had confirmed that the Indian nurse, being treated at Aseer National Hospital, is suffering from MERS-CoV & not 2019-NCoV (Wuhan). We request everyone to refrain from sharing incorrect info, said the consulate.Also, Lok Sabha member Anto Antony and Ashraf Kuttichal, an accredited volunteer of the Indian embassy who visited the nurse at the hospital, said that no one was tested positive for 2019-NCoV.Quoting Dr Tareq Al Azraqi, Kuttichal said the nurse’s condition was improving. It was also learnt that the Malayali nurse was shifted to the general ward from the isolation ward around 3pm. Ashraf also gave her a mobile phone on her request. The nurse had joined the hospital two years ago.Meanwhile, Malayali nurses at Al-Hayat hospital said that were not ready to report for duty unless the hospital was sanitized, and compulsory test was conducted on all staff and visitors who took care of a nurse from Philippines who was infected with the virus. Kuttichal, also an employee of the hospital, said both cases were different, and the Filipina was being treated for lifestyle diseases such as blood pressure and diabetes.As many as 247 nurses from various nations have been working at the hospital. Malayali nurses work in private and government hospitals across Saudi Arabia. Hospital CEO Dr Ahmed Hayazi said that Saudi health ministry had taken all necessary steps to provide proper treatment to all suspected cases.Earlier in the day, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had asked Union external affairs minister S Jaishankar to help the nurse, reportedly diagnosed with coronavirus. This was after there were reports that she had informed relatives that hospital authorities had quarantined her.Meanwhile, health department has strengthened the screening of passengers coming to Kerala from China. Health minister KK Shailaja said screening had begun at all airports in the state and instructions were given to immediately shift people to isolation wards in nearby hospitals if they are coming with flu-like symptoms from China.Instructions have also been given to set up isolation wards in district and general hospitals. The minister asked the people who came from China to immediately report to respective district medical offices.“No passenger from China, who came in the recent days, showed such symptoms.

183,['24/01/2020'],Poor response from consumers for PNG connections,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Kochi: The response from the public to city gas project has been lukewarm, said officials with the Indian Oil Adani Gas Pvt Ltd (IOAGPL). Only up to 30% of the consumers, whom they approached expressed interest in PNG connections, they said.

The firm has been carrying out the works as part of the city gas project in six wards of Thrikkakara. “Our officials have been approaching the residents for taking PNG connections. We also use the service of Kudumbashree workers for meeting the residents. But their response has been poor,” an IOAGPL official said.

“They asked us to first introduce the project in the municipality. They said they would take the connections once they get convinced about the benefits of PNG,” the official said.

The IOAGPL authorities have been planning to use more platforms for creating awareness on the benefits of PNG. “We have been trying to create awareness on FM radio. We will also be using other modes for convincing the residents of the benefits of CNG ,” the official said.

“PNG is cleaner and cheaper compared to other fuels like LPG. It is thinner than PNG. If it leaks, it would go up into the air soon. So, chances of catching fire are very remote,” he said.

“It is convenient as consumers get uninterrupted supply of gas, whereas they will have to wait for the LPG suppliers to deliver the refill cylinder at fixed intervals.

Municipal authorities said it would be convenient if IOAGPL provides connections to the households at one stretch. “They have been digging up the roads for laying main pipelines for supply of the gas. They have been giving connections to only a small percentage of consumers. Then, they will have to dig up the roads again for giving connections to the households. If more connections are given right now, digging up of roads over and again can be avoided,” an official with Thrikkakkara municipality said.

184,['24/01/2020'],The Art of Resistance,"This story is from January 24, 2020

The recent spate of kolams in Tamil Nadu protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens, reminiscent of grandmothers’ tales of charkha-centred ""Gandhi flag"" kolams, showed how ordinary citizens can transform an everyday art form into a potent socio-political weapon.

Back in the day, ""swadeshi"" kolams were drawn with the customary white and orange border, but decorated with green leaves to signify support for the nationalist cause. Dissent was sedition in the British Raj, but no one ""discovered"" Nazi affiliations in those who drew those kolams. It was left to free India to accuse Tamil women registering peaceful kolam protests of Pakistani connections.

Though the arts have no sustained, discerning support from state or society, this does not absolve artists of their responsibilities. Nor does lack of resources strip them of their power. A song, painting, verse, or a humble kolam, can unmute the silent, empower the disenfranchised and enable the humblest to curb the mightiest. The civil rights movement in the United States, led by such legends as Martin Luther King, was cemented by African-American spirituals. Anti-apartheid songs compelled the world to take note of atrocities in South Africa. Activist choirs in the Balkans keep protests for human rights alive. Braving charges of terrorism, Latin America continues to sing against multi-forms of oppression. In Hong Kong, subversive art on the streets and social media continues to support the demand for liberty. All over the world, activists, artists and thinkers use their creative powers to take on the neocolonial juggernaut.

India’s independence movement witnessed diverse factions uniting with the clarion call of ""Vande Mataram"". Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s ode to the motherland (1882), translated into other tongues (including the recent ""Tasleemaat maa tasleemaat"" in Urdu), invoked pan-Indian pride. Though it united more than divided communities, its reference to Hindu gods prevented this ode from becoming secular India’s national anthem. However, it was Bankim’s song and not his own that Tagore chose to sing at the 1896 convention of the Indian National Congress, whose goals prioritised unity among people of different faiths. Early ""Indian"" flags — including the one unfurled in 1906 flag to protest against the British partitioning of Bengal — had ""Vande Mataram"" inscribed in bold Devanagari script. Proclaiming Hindu-Muslim brotherhood, the green strip below juxtaposed the sun with the crescent moon and star.

In 1904, Mohammad Iqbal’s poem announced the same idea: ""Religions do not teach hatred. We belong to Hind, our homeland is Hindustan!"" Neither Partition nor Iqbal’s subsequent allegiance shift to the Islamic state could dislodge that song from India’s collective unconscious. Famously did astronaut Rakesh Sharma sum up what he saw from space with Iqbal’s opening line, ""Saare jahan se accha Hindustan hamaara"".

In contrast, we see the recent branding of Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s poem as anti-Hindu, when everyone knows the man wrote it to trounce dictatorship in Pakistan. How ignorant we must be to not to see him subverting the imagery of Islam, and using the word ""buth"" not for Hindu gods, but for the idols of totalitarianism. Today his words ""Hum Dekhenge"" is resonate across the country and people are reaffirming the relevance of Faiz with translations in regional languages, including in Tamil.

For a heart-wrenching example of what art can achieve, we must time travel back to Leningrad (St Petersburg), 1942. Under the sparkling chandeliers in the packed Philharmonic Hall, a skin-and-bones orchestra determinedly stands up in frayed clothes, but with bow ties, hoping that Nazi bombardment would not drown its music. Loudspeakers relay Dmitri Shostakovich’s grand symphony throughout the city where millions are dying of hunger, forced to survive on anything they find — cats, rats, dogs, horses, and reportedly, human corpses. The last notes fade in haunting silence, and applause celebrates how the listeners ""lived it, survived it, and managed to preserve their humanity"". They were to face three more years of war.

Decades later, a few German soldiers return to the city they had blockaded. Why? To recall how spellbound they had been by the ""Leningrad Symphony"" sweeping over their dark trenches bordering the city. Shostakovich had taught them that art can steel the human spirit to resist every kind of oppression. Bodies can be smashed by force, but not the soul. Not when communities are inspired and empowered by word, visual and song.

No wonder then that the establishment in every part of the globe fears art, and employs every tool from fatwa and imprisonment to banning and burning books, paintings and films. Art has ""fearsome"" attributes indeed. It brings people together, sets the mind free, and instils hope. That is why Chopin, in exile, kept the soul of Poland together when the country was mowed down. And Picasso remains best known for ""Guernica"" his spine-chilling indictment of violence and repression.

NAGPUR: Rejecting the plea by Kusba villagers , the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court has directed respondents to remove the villagers from the encroached area coming under Gosikhurd dam.

While upholding the report of a committee comprising collector and tehsildar, which termed the villagers as encroachers, a division bench consisting of justices Ravi Deshpande and Amit Borkar asked respondents to expedite the process.

Kusba sarpanch Ishwar Lambat and others had moved HC through counsel Prakash Randive , contending that the entire village was severely hit by heavy rainfall which occurred in July. People had to be evacuated using boats as there was water logging everywhere. The village has 252 families and over 1,600 people residing, he said.

During the monsoon, even though there was little rainfall, all the villages were flooded. However, according to the government, the village is 452 meters above sea level. Due to geographical location of the village, which is near Gosikhurd dam, flooding is expected and it is difficult to access the place at that time. The government had said that the village does not need rehabilitation since it is encroached.

The petitioners presented pictures of the affected villages to the bench. They also requested that the village be rehabilitated in view of the problems faced by citizens during the monsoon. Taking into consideration all the issues presented by the petitioner, the HC had directed the government to file an affidavit in last hearing.

CHENNAI: The state government has increased the monthly salaries of faculty of Anna University , its constituent colleges, government and aided engineering institutes by up to 280% as recommended by the seventh Central Pay Commission (CPC).An order issued on January 14 by the state higher education department announcing the hike was made public on Thursday.As per the order, the revised payscale will take notional effect from January 1, 2016, and monetary benefit from October 1, 2017, making the staff eligible for a lump-sum amount as salary arrears soon.Designations, mode of appointments and pay structure were also revised as per CPC recommendations for all institutions controlled by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).Accordingly, there will be only three designations in engineering colleges — assistant professor, associate professor and professor. The existing pay structure involving pay band (PB) and average grade pay (AGP) has been replaced with a pay matrix involving levels and cells.AGP of Rs 6,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 8,000, Rs 9,000, Rs 10,0000 and Rs 12,000 has been replaced with academic levels numbered 10, 11, 12, 13A1, 14 and 15 respectively. Each academic level consists of several cells (numbered 1-40) and salaries increase when teachers move to next cell.For example, let us consider an assistant professor, who is receiving Rs 8,000 as AGP now. His pay band was Rs 15,600-Rs 39,100. The AGP of Rs 8,000 corresponds to academic level 12 in the new pay matrix, with Rs 79,800 fixed as entry pay (cell number 1). Once he moves to the next cell (number 2) within the same academic level, he becomes eligible for an annual increment of 3%. So he will earn Rs 82,200 (rounded off to nearest 100). As he progresses through the matrix, the pay will increase and once he reaches cell 40 (last) of academic level 12, he will receive Rs 2,11,500 as salary.A formally constituted selection committee will decide on promotions to the next academic level and designations.Besides, teachers are eligible to get Rs 75,000 professional development grant (on reimbursement basis), research promotion grant from their institutes/universities and engage in consultancy services to generate revenue.As far as pension, gratuity, leave encashment, health insurance and other terminal benefits are concerned, the present state government rules will continue to be applied.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73568017,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-147227,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/anna-univ-faculty-to-get-280-pay-hike/articleshow/73563479.cms

The CM made the comment while talking to the media soon after he attended an event organised to celebrate the 123rd birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Nitish made it clear that there was “no confusion” in JD (U) on any issue and that it would not withdraw its support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ). He appeared to have taken exception to the way Varma made a letter written to him public. The letter talked about certain reservations Nitish had expressed during his private conversations with Varma, a former IFS officer.

“You (Varma) should see for yourself what kind of statements you are making about your claims on what I said to you. Should I say what you used to tell me? This is not the way,” Nitish said.

In his letter, which was later posted on social media, Varma said, “I remember you confessing to me in private how the current leadership in the BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained, on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’… I fail to understand how JD(U) is now extending its alliance with BJP beyond Bihar”.

During his conversation with the media, Nitish made it a point to send a strong message to Prashant Kishor, another senior JD (U) leader who is vocal in his criticism of the CAA and the National Register of Citizens.

In an oblique reference to Kishor’s activities, Nitish said, “JD (U) should be understood properly. It works with complete dedication. Our stand on all issues is always very clear.” He added, “We are never in any confusion on any issue. But if anyone has any doubts, he should come and discuss. The matter can also be raised in party meetings.”

In his response, Varma said in New Delhi that he only sought to know whether JD (U)’s alliance with BJP for the Delhi polls was discussed within the party before it was announced.

He added, “I only sought to know whether this (alliance with BJP for Delhi polls) was done after ideological clarification or not. Even long standing allies of BJP like Akali Dal have refused to ally with BJP for the Delhi election due to their reservations against CAA.”

Union minister Giriraj Singh, who hails from BJP, described the statements of Varma and Kishor as “harmful” for the NDA. “Whether it is Pavan Varma or Prashant Kishor, whatever they have said, is unhealthy for the alliance. Senior leaders of our party look at these statements from the point of view of discipline in the alliance as well,” he added.

NEW DELHI: A 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death with a pair of scissors for hurling expletives at a man outside his house in Nihal Vihar. The boy had been playing with his friends at the time.

A day later, the accused returned to take his belongings when locals and some policemen investigating the case chased him. However, he managed to flee after climbing on the terraces of the nearby houses. He was finally tracked to Uttar Pradesh and arrested. The accused had shaved his beard to conceal his identity.

Police received a call on January 18 that a 13-year old boy had been taken to a hospital in Nangloi with multiple stab wounds. He was declared brought dead at the hospital. The incident occurred near Dal Mill Road in Kamruddin Nagar.

“The deceased was identified as Anand. His father had passed away, while his mother worked as a labourer in a shoe factory. A case of murder was registered at Nihal Vihar police station,” said a senior police officer.

The accused, Shambhu Nath alias Shivam (32), was apprehended from Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh. He told police that while passing by he had stopped to talk to the other children when the boy verbally abused him.

Shivam stabbed the boy in a fit of rage and fled. Police scanned CCTV footage of several lanes close to the victim’s house and saw the accused fleeing in one of them. He was traced to his native village and taken into custody.

SLUG: CITY GAS

Kochi: With the Indian Oil Adani Gas Private Limited’s (IOAGPL) works in Thrikkakara municipality running behind schedule, the district administration has given the agency implementing the city gas project four more days to complete the works in the municipality. The IOAGPL was supposed to restore the dug-up roads by January 20.

The slow pace of IOAGPL’s road restoration works after digging them up for laying pipelines for piped natural gas (PNG) supply had come under fire from people’s representatives in the municipality.

At a meeting held on January 22, the collector informed IOAGPL officials that as the agency has failed to stay on schedule and restore the roads completely, the permission for digging up roads in the next six wards of Thrikkakara municipality, which was to be carried out in the next days, wouldn’t be granted.

It was after the intervention by the district administration that the city gas project, which had been progressing at a snail pace ever since it was launched in February 2016, gained momentum. Still, the speed and quality of the road restoration works drew criticism from the people’s representatives in Thrikkakara municipality.

The IOAGPL officials had cited difficulties in getting permission from local bodies to dig up roads for laying pipelines for PNG supply as the major reason for the inordinate delay in completing the project.

In around four years since February 2016, the OIAGPL has been able to provide connections only to roughly 1,500 families, whereas the target was 50,000 households. The collector had convened a meeting in January first week and decided to expedite the project and complete distribution PNG connections to 40,000 households in Thrikkakara municipality by March 31.

But yet another round of dispute erupted and the people’s representatives of Thrikkakara municipality and the district collector again convened a meeting again on January 9 to sort out the issues. At the meeting, it was decided to complete the restoration of roads by January 20.

The collector had also given instructions to the IOAGPL to complete the remaining work within 15 days of starting it. A schedule for completing the works in Thrikkakara was prepared and it was decided that the works will be completed in a phased manner.

In the first phase, pipelaying, distribution and plumping works to provide connections to the households are to be completed in six wards. In the next phase, works in the six more wards are to be carried out. The entire work in all the 43 wards in Thrikkakara municipality is to be completed by April 30.

When the collector convened a meeting to review the progress of the work on January 22, it was found that IOAGPL hasn’t completed relaying roads. “They haven’t completed relaying of around 700 metres of road dug up for laying the pipes. So, the people are agitated. If the work is progressing in such a manner, we will have to raise objections against digging up the roads for the project,” one of the ward members of Thrikkakara municipality said.

But IOAGPL representatives said they had laid pipes along 30km in the six wards of the municipality and that only a stretch of 700 metres need to be restored.

“Most of the road-digging works are being carried out as per horizontal dimensional drilling (HDD). We don’t have to dig up the road. We just have to dig up pits at certain points. So, we will be able to complete the repair works fast,” said Ajay Pillai, head of city gas project in Kochi.

As of now, they have given PNG connections to 152 houses in Thrikkakara municipality. Once the work in Thrikkakara is over, IOAGPL will start the works in Eloor municipality.

190,['24/01/2020'],Shortage of clotting agent hits haemophilia patients,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Kochi: Unavailability of clotting factor concentrates (CFCs) or factor VIII and IX — the agents in blood which helps its clotting — has been creating trouble to many haemophilia patients . As the government failed to clear arrears to the firms which supply medicine to Kerala Medical Services Corporation Ltd (KMSCL), they have stopped the supply of CFCs.

It is KMSCL which procures medicines for all the government hospitals in the state. “We are not getting supply of CFCs for the past few days,” said Dr N Vijayakumar, medical officer in-charge of Haemophilia Treatment Centre, Aluva. “In reply to our request for CFCs, the government issued orders permitting us to procure CFC for two patients. At the same time, around 980 patients have already registered with us. We are unable to provide treatment to them,” he said.

The haemophilia treatment centre at Aluva is the only facility for the patients in Kerala. Though some private hospitals provide treatment to haemophilia patients, it is not comprehensive treatment. “If I go for treatment at a private hospital, it will cost around Rs 25,000-30,000 even if it is a minor bleed. If it is a major bleed, it may cost lakhs at one go,” said Nasser, father of a kid who is suffering from haemophilia.

With the state government winding up Karunya Benevolent Fund (KBF) scheme, hundreds of haemophilia are facing hardships. The government has not included haemophilia patients as the beneficiaries of Karunya Chikisya Scheme which is to replace KBF. “Even if included in the new scheme, a patient can avail a benefit up to only Rs 2 lakh. In the case of haemophilia patients, hospital bills for treatment of major bleed alone will be Rs 2 lakh,” Dr Vijayakumar said.

HYDERABAD: Repealing the close relative clause, introduced in the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019 was among the strongest demands raised by doctors and couples during a meeting with the select committee of Rajya Sabha on Thursday. They also appealed that the proposed five-year waiting period — before couples can opt for surrogacy — be reconsidered.Chaired by Bhupendar Yadav of BJP, the select committee was constituted in November last year after certain portions of the bill, which aims to ban commercial surrogacy in India, met with fierce opposition from stakeholders. The team’s visit to Hyderabad was part of a multi-city tour — Delhi, Anand and Mumbai — to interact with doctors, surrogates and couples. Based on the committee’s recommendations submitted to the Union health ministry, the Surrogacy Bill will be tabled in Parliament for clearance.“We have gone through years of trauma after we discovered that my wife cannot conceive because of ill health,” said a prospective parent, who recently found a surrogate. “Surrogacy is our only option, and I urge the committee to not punish innocent people unnecessarily by banning the practice.“I have approached every close relative we have, but each of them refused. It isn’t an accepted norm in our society yet,” he said.Another couple that TOI spoke to had a similar story. “We asked my sister and sister-in-law, but their husbands didn’t agree. We had our child through surrogacy five months ago,” said the father demanding that the waiting period be revoked. “Why put a couple through more distress?” he asked. His wife, a cancer survivor, had to get her uterus removed soon after marriage.Making a case for intending couples, another parent said: “My wife had renal disease. If not for surrogacy, we’d never have a child.” Keeping with his wife’s last wish, he later married the surrogate mother.Thursday’s meeting was attended by a sizeable group of surrogates too. “It is my body and I should be allowed to make that decision,” said one of them objecting to the clause that bans them from being a surrogate mother twice.Another said how surrogacy is beneficial for both parties involved. “It is our means to a better quality of life. The government should not object to that,” she added.While many infertility experts said they were wary of taking up surrogacy cases, especially post the bill, they urged the committee to allow “genuine couples” to opt for it.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73572261,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-107237,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/repeal-close-relative-clause-in-surrogacy-bill-couples/articleshow/73563509.cms
194,['24/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Artificial groundwater recharge structures planned in two delta districts,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representative image

CHENNAI: With increased extraction of groundwater for agricultural needs causing concern, the state government recently ordered artificial recharge structures in rivers and tanks to augment groundwater resources in the delta districts of Tiruvarur and Thanjavur. The latest assessment by the state ground and surface water resources data centre of the public works department found that majority of the firkas in the two districts are overexploited and extraction is more than 100%.

Blame it on erratic monsoon, Thanjavur, the rice bowl of Tamil Nadu , depends on groundwater resources for more than 50% of the irrigation needs. The rate of groundwater depletion was so severe in the recent past due to poor rainfall and inadequate storage in Mettur reservoir. The scene is no different in Tiruvarur district. “The recent rains may have helped but there is a dire need for artificial recharge systems for sustainability. The PWD sanctioned Rs 61 crore for 704 recharge shafts and wells in Thanjavur district and 181 such structures in Tiruvarur district ,” said a senior government official. Chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had announced the scheme in the assembly in July last year.

Concerns about depleting groundwater also stem from the fact that the delta region has clay soil, which makes it vulnerable. Water doesn’t percolate through clay soil. “Only the upper reaches of Thanjavur and Pudukkottai have good number of tanks. Tiruvarur has a number of ponds. The artificial recharge structures in these water bodies will directly recharge the dry aquifers, which otherwise suffer due to clay layer,” another official said. The officials are hopeful of improving the groundwater table, because such interventions in the past in Tiruvarur between 2011 and 2013 resulted in maintaining the water level. However, the state government’s special kuruvai packages, announced due to poor storage in Mettur between 2013 and 2018, came with three phase power supply. It resulted in over-exploitation of groundwater resources by farmers.

The PWD’s assessment is that at least eight firkas in Thanjavur are in a critical state, where extraction is between 90% and 100%, and seven fall in semi-critical category (between 70% and 90%). Only five firkas – Sengipatti, Cholanmaligai, Eachankottai, Thekkur and Perumagalur are in safe category (less than 70%). Kumbakonam, Papanasam, Pattukottai, Peravurani, Thanjavur, Thiruvaiyaru and Thiruvidaimarudur taluks are over-exploited. In Tiruvarur, Kodavasal and Valangaiman taluks are the worst affected, followed by Nannilam and Nidamangalam. All four firkas in Thiruthuraipoondi taluk have turned saline.

195,['24/01/2020'],HC corridors abuzz with theories on Zaka Haq’s transfer,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representative image

NAGPUR: Various theories are doing rounds regarding sudden transfer of Justice Zaka Haq from Nagpur bench of Bombay high court to Aurangabad bench by chief justice Pradeep Nandrajog.

According to lawyers practicing in the Nagpur bench, it was allegedly done with a mala fide intention as he had issued a contempt notice to registrar (administration) and flayed administration under him for negligence on January 2.

“I believe the CJ’s decision was triggered by the contempt notice issued to Nagpur bench of registrar for negligence on January 2 . The Nagpur registrar, in turn, had informed about it to the registrar general in Mumbai. There is nothing wrong in issuing notice to HC registrar if mistakes are found, as it’s a human nature,” former advocate general of Chhattisgarh , Jugalkishor Gilda , told TOI.

Gilda also questioned the “haste” shown in issuing transfer orders by the CJ, who would be superannuating by next month-end. “No heaven was going to fall if the judge was retained in Nagpur. The HC administration got an impression that he was donning the role of an administrative judge, which was not a reality. I think there are many other factors as well which are doing rounds in the HC corridors,” he said.

Lawyers further claimed that many of their fraternity were upset with “hefty cost” Haq used to impose against their clients, and in some cases against them for “blunders and for efforts to mislead the court”.

“We at the District Bar Association (DBA) are opposing justice Haq’s transfer, as he is one of the very few judges who diligently works beyond scheduled office time, of course with the consent of lawyers for the speedy disposal of cases. A particular group of lawyers doesn’t like his approach and about 15-20 of them, including senior lawyers, complained to the CJ in this regard,” DBA president Kamal Satuja said.

Satuja further said that the CJ should have followed the principles of natural justice by asking the judge on his version over the complaints. “As per these principles, which are upheld by the Supreme Court, the CJ could have asked his brother judge on what exactly led to the confrontation. Even the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) could have been taken into confidence before issuing transfer orders. The apex court had upheld that principles of natural justice are nearly equivalent to the fundamental right,” he said.

Another theory doing rounds is that a powerful group of lawyers had planned Haq’s exit as he had dismissed many of their cases, although on merit.

VADODARA: The draft budget for the year 2020-21 proposed by Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) commissioner has taken a series of initiatives to improve water supply in the city. Throughout 2019, the civic body had drawn flak over water supply.

The draft budget has made a provision for a new water supply pipeline from the Ajwa Crossroads to Lalbaug via Some Talav. The existing pipeline here was prone to leakages and had led to water supply issues in the eastern and southern parts of the city. The new pipeline will take care of this long standing problem.

The civic body is also eyeing to take up improvement in its water supply network instead of relying on booster stations to ensure seamless water supply. To improve the water supply network in the city, network upgradation will be taken up by drawing a master plan taking help of experts.

A new water treatment plant will come up at the Nimeta water treatment facility of the civic body. The new plant will be of a capacity of 50 million litres per day (MLD) and will cost Rs 64.5 crore.

Stand by vertical turbine pumps will be installed at French wells in the Mahi river at Raika, Dodka, Fajalpur and Poicha. This will ensure that water supply is not affected when there is a breakdown.

Thiruvananthapuram: Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state government would not take a lenient approach to encroachments and illegal constructions that obstruct normal flow of rivers and water bodies. “Such obstructions will be removed,” he said while inaugurating national conference for developing policies and strategies for flood management organised by water resources department on Thursday.

The chief minister said Japan-model flood resilient development will be implemented in flood prone areas in the state. He said that people living in areas prone to water logging during monsoon will be shifted. “Housing will be shifted while their ownership over the land will be retained,” he added.

Experts from the Netherlands, the US and China are attending the two-day conference. Concepts such as ‘sponge city’ for Kochi and ‘room for river’ for Kuttanad were discussed at the conference. Sun Xiang, senior project manager of Shenzhen water planning and design institute China, explained the sponge city model of flood management, effectively implemented at Shenzhen city in China from 2015. Xiang, who visited Kochi where the state government is planning to implement Sponge City on a pilot basis, suggested that it would take a 10-15 years of time and a good investment to implement the project effectively.

Xiang said that they demolished concrete embankments of rivers and reused it to create permeable river banks. He suggested that river regulation and widening should be done to prevent urban flooding around river banks in Kochi. “Canals in Kochi should be dredged to facilitate easy flow of water to the sea. Pumps should be utilised to flush out water in case of emergency,” he said.

Another speaker Paul van Meel, who is water advisor of the Netherlands, hailed Kattakkada watershed management progamme as a model initiative in the state. He said deepening of the Thottappally lead canal was one way to reduce impact of flood in Kuttanad. “Bridges across major canals are not constructed considering the flood situation and it must be reconstructed. Steps must be taken to remove obstructions in the lower reaches of river so as to ensure quick outflow of flood water to sea,” he said adding that approach in upper and middle reaches of the river is to ensure soil and water conservation through integrated watershed management.

Water resources minister K Krishnankutty, who presided over the inaugural function, said watershed management projects will be immediately implemented in the state. “Environmental issues are caused by over exploitation of groundwater. Climate change and global warning have made lots of changes to the natural environment of the state. Changes in availability of water resources must be taken into consideration. Steps have been taken to introduce water budget,” he said.

Additional chief secretary (water resources) Viswas Mehta, additional secretary, ministry of jal shakti, T Rajeswari and secretary B Ashok attended the event.

NAGPUR: The ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 ( CAA ), National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register ( NPR ) at Eidgah ground in Jaffar Nagar found support from lawyers, professors, doctors and academicians on Thursday.

The speakers termed CAA, NPR and NRC as “anti-poor and ‘anti-national” laws and appealed to non-Muslim religious minorities and those belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Schedules Tribes (ST) and lower Hindu castes to come forward and support the agitation.

“The CAA, NRC and NPR combo is leading India towards the concept of Hindu Rashtra, which was established by Savarkar and Golwalkar. This concept has no place for non-Vedic religions. After Muslims, they will target Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs and all minorities in the country,” said professor Prajwalla Tatte. She also called on women from all religions to join the protests, saying that the new laws would suppress women in the future.

Homeopathic practitioner Dr Shahwar Naziya claimed that giving citizenship to people from Pakistan and Afghanistan may bring back polio to India. “India was declared polio-free by WHO four years ago, but Pakistan is still grappling with it. People coming from Pakistan may bring polio back to India, as no one will check their health and immunization status while offering them citizenship,” she said.

“We must oppose CAA for the future of our kids,” Naziya appealed. She received a rousing response from the women present at the protests.

Dr Ratinath Mishra termed CAA and NPR as anti-India. “It is against the guiding principles of our constitution. The present government is following the ‘divide and rule’ policy of Britishers, and we will never let them succeed,” he said.

A group of lawyers from district and high court visited Eidgah ground and expressed their support to the agitation. High court lawyer Ravi Shakar Bhure said that it is a massive conspiracy in which the judiciary is helpless too.

“Citizens are protesting all over the country. India’s credibility as a democratic country is taking a hit. Even courts are denying petitions against CAA and NRC, which is disappointing for a law student like me,” he lamented. Lawyers Sheetal Deshpande , Shabana Khan, Akshay Samarth, Akeb-ul-Haq spoke on the occasion and promised to give the protesters all necessary legal help.

NEW DELHI: An insurance agent was abducted and then murdered by four men after he failed to pay them a ransom of Rs 25 lakh . Crime Branch officers arrested all the accused.

The accused men — all of whom were involved in cricket betting — had planned to extort money from the victim, Deepak Dua, as they presumed he was earning very well.

DCP (crime) Rajesh Deo said that the mastermind of the racket, Vinod Kumar, was a cab driver who met Dua at his office in Rohini while transferring his LIC policy from UP to Delhi in December last year. He then planned to abduct him. He had roped in his friends, Monu Sharma, Sandeep and Sunny for the job.

On January 4, Sharma contacted Dua posing as an insurer and sought a meeting with him. He asked Dua to come to Nangloi metro station the next day. Sharma met him there and asked him to board a car. They then drove to a metro station in Noida where Vinod, Sandeep and Sunny also got in the car. On the way they started demanding Rs 25 lakh from Dua.

However, Dua pleaded with them saying that he did not earn much and agreed to transfer Rs 30,000 from his account. However, the accused refused to accept that and started thrashing Dua. When they realised that they couldn’t extort the money from him, Vinod decided to strangle him. The four men then parked the car near highway and strangled Dua. They then dumped the body in Bulandshahr.

Meanwhile, Dua’s family lodged a missing complaint at Prashant Vihar police station. They suspected that he may have been abducted as his phone was found to be switched off.

“We formed a team to track the mobile data and call details of the victim. One of the numbers led us to Sharma,” said Deo.

HYDERABAD: With increase in automation and digitisation, cybercrime and cyber threats are on the rise, said experts at ‘Cyber Security Conclave 5.0 — the Next Gen Threats and Solutions’, a conclave organised in the city on Thursday.

At the event, Sanjay Bahl, director general, Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN), said: “As the world is moving towards automation, cybercrimes and threats are also increasing and posing challenges in equal ratio.” He said CERT-In is focusing on collecting, analysing and disseminating intelligence on cyber threats for the benefit of all stakeholders, who could potentially be affected by these attacks.

Cyberabad police commissioner, VC Sajjanar, said that presently complaints on cybercrimes are more than traditional offences. “Most complaints are related to social media, online financial offences, and data theft. The loss incurred by the complaints due to Cyber Crimes is immense, and it has been posing tough challenges to the police,” he said.

The event was organised by Society for Cyberabad Security Council (SCSC) and Cyberabad police. During the conclave, sessions were orgainsed by SCSC for policemen to acquaint them with the latest cybercrime trends and its solutions.

201,['24/01/2020'],Tamil Brahmi inscriptions overwritten by vandals,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Cavern on top of Siddharmalai in K Mettupatti near Madurai

CHENNAI: Each rock bed inside the cavern on top of the Siddharmalai in K Mettupatti, 40km from Madurai, has an Tamil-Brahmi inscription. But just below the ancient inscription are also names in English — the handiwork of vandals.

Though the Archaeological Survey of India maintains the site, lack of maintenance leads to many anti-social elements camping at the site. Plastic food wrappers, empty packets of condoms and bottles are found scattered in the area. There are at least 28 sites where inscriptions of Tamil Brahmi have been discovered in the state. Some are maintained well, but significant places like the one in Mettupatti are forgotten.

Inside the cavern two rows of nine beds with names of the donors and Tamil Brahmi inscriptions are found. A stone footprint associated with Jainism, and locally known as Ramarpatham (mark of Lord Rama) is

also found.

A scenic place, reaching the top of the hill is difficult. This may be the reason why no one from the ASI takes an initiative to protect the site. Rock art expert K T Gandhirajan, who camped at the site five years ago, said there is hardly any awareness about the site among the public. ""Five years ago, we (a group of artists and heritage enthusiasts) climbed the hill and spent a night under the stars, discussing the significance of the site in the dead of the night,"" he said.

The rock beds apart, a one-line inscription in Tamil Brahmi on the boulder at the entrance of the cavern is considered one of the oldest in Tamil Nadu . Scholar Iravatham Mahadevan later deciphered it as ""Amanan Matirai Attiran Urai Utayanasa"" (The abode of Attiran, a Jain monk (Amanan) of Madurai (Matirai) gifted by Udayana (Utayanasa). The inscription talks about the donation of a cave-shelter by Utayana to Attiran.

""Since there is no one to take care of the site, vandals have a free run and destroy the beauty of these inscriptions. It’s ridiculous,"" said K Muthukumaran, a heritage activist based in Madurai.

Many who visit the Ramarpatham and the temple on top of the hill are not aware of the existence of the Tamil Brahmi script at the spot. ""I don’t know what it means. I have been to this place a couple of times, but have not noticed the inscriptions. Nobody ever told me about it,"" said K Murugan, who was visiting the temple with friends.

Since puja is performed regularly at the temple, the staff of the temple draw arrow signs using white paint to wards the cavern, which helps heritage enthusiasts who visit the Tamil Brahmi site and rock beds. Otherwise there are no information boards. ""I don’t know what the ASI is doing here. It’s high time it took some initiative in promoting important sites like this,"" said Gandhirajan.

Kochi: A former teacher of Al Ameen Public school in Edapally, which is affiliated to CBSE , tweeted that the school management allegedly collected blank cheques from teachers. She has shared her concerns on twitter with the Prime Minister, Kerala chief minister and Union ministers.

“…they credit the CBSE recommended salary to the teacher’s account. Within minutes, they debit around 9,000 from our accounts and evade the tax,” said Swapna Lekha V B in one of the tweets.

In another tweet, she said as a teacher she believes that its her duty to raise voice against the exploitation of teachers by the school management. “It’s our duty to stop this financial fraud. They have been evading large amounts of income tax for several decades. I hope the authority would look into this matter,” she said.

Swapna, in another tweet, alleged that when she complained about this corruption to the CM following which an inquiry was conducted, the school authorities “called me alone to the room and threatened me and terminated me from service.” Swapna, who was working in the school for the past seven years, was terminated from service early this month.

She has also lodged a complaint with the Elamakkara police raising similar allegations. She also told police that the school authorities have threatened to kill her. “Since it is a non-cognisable offence, we have sent a report to the court. We will take necessary action as per the court directive,” said an officer from Elamakkara police station.

Despite several reminders from CBSE, there is constant allegation that most private CBSE schools do not have a uniform pattern for providing wages to teachers. They are paid lesser than their counterparts in the central and state government schools. Schools here are also not comfortable putting the teachers’ salary online.

However, school authorities have denied the allegations. “Nothing of this sort has ever happened in the school,” said school principal Lekshmi Haridas. “She was taking photos of school documents and teachers. She even entered my room in my absence and took photos of documents signed by me,” the principal alleged.

Following this, several colleges from the city are expected to approach the TSCHE in order to make the shift by January 31.“There are many women’s colleges in Hyderabad which are able to fill only 50% to 60% seats every year. While women’s colleges in districts have higher enrolment, women’s colleges are not able to secure as many admissions in Hyderabad,” said president of Telangana Degree and Post-Graduate Colleges Association, Ramana Reddy.Change in parents’ mindsets towards gender parity is cited as one of the key reasons why a higher number of women’s colleges are willing to convert to co-ed institutions. “Earlier, there was a lot of concern over female students’ security due to which parents preferred an all-women’s college. But now, the mindset has changed as parents have understood that their daughters have to eventually work with men once they are employed,” said Fareetha Farzana, principal of Shine Degree College, LB Nagar.Officials claim that there is a 60:40 ratio between male and female students in degree colleges due to which managements are preferring to switch to co-ed. “Colleges have realised that if they switch from a women’s college to co-ed, they will be catering to a larger market wherein chances of vacant seats will be lower,” said TSCHE chairman Papi Reddy .In order to make the shift, managements will have to submit letters from students, parents and staff (teaching and non-teaching) expressing their willingness in writing for conversion of the college before January 31.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73563567,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157157,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/poor-enrolment-women-colleges-may-turn-co-ed/articleshow/73563568.cms

RAJKOT: Cops can be ruthless, especially when they go to arrest someone. But the abject poverty and condition of a cheating case accused’s daughter in Sikka Na Patia left sleuths of Rajkot special operations group (SOG) with a lump in their throats.

So moved were the cops when they went to arrest former gold smith Jitu Pala in November last year that they gathered money for treatment of his 12-year-old daughter who was hearing and speech impaired.

SOG had received received an application of complaint that Pala had allegedly cheated two people of Rs 65 lakh when he was working in Rajkot’s Soni Bazar. But in a cruel twist of fate, Pala incurred heavy loss in the business and went bankrupt. He left Rajkot and moved to Sikka na Patia with his family six months ago.

“We found that Pala and his family were living in abject poverty. No accused who had committed a fraud of Rs 65 lakh would suffer such poverty. We realized our that the application was false,” said M A Ansari, sub-inspector with Rajkot SOG.

While at his house, cops discovered that the 12-year-old girl’s disability.

“After Pala’s neighbours testified in his favour and his wife cried, we felt he could not have been involved in cheating. But we told him that he would have to come to Rajkot for investigation formalities. We could not see his daughter’s plight and thought it was our duty to help her,” said Jitubha Zala, head constable with Rajkot SOG.

Four SOG policemen contributed from their own pockets to get her a pair of hearing aids, which has helped her overcome disability.

“My daughter developed complications in her eardrums when she was a year old. She became completely deaf by the time she turned five. They were not cops, but angels in disguise who visited our house two months ago,” said Sheela Pala, the girl’s mother.

At that time, one Rajani Lodhia and his associate identified as Nadha filed an application of complaint against Pala, accusing him of duping them of gold worth Rs 65 lakh.

Madurai: Madras high court has directed the police to file a final report (charge-sheet) within two months in a case registered against the national secretary of BJP, H Raja for his derogatory comments about the judiciary.

S Doraisamy, an advocate from Chennai, in his petition stated that on September 15, 2018, Raja had proceeded to set up a stage to conduct a meeting for the Vinayaka Chathurthi celebrations in Pudukottai district by violating a high court court which prohibited the setting up of a stage in the middle of the road. When the police officials attempted to stop him, Raja picked up an argument in which he passed derogatory comments about the judiciary.

Doraisamy said the Thirumayam police had registered a case against Raja under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 505 (1) (b) (c) (statements conducing to public mischief), 506 (1) (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 290 (punishment for public nuisance) of IPC.

The principal seat initiated suo motu contempt proceedings against Raja, however, it was closed after he tendered his unconditional apology. He stated that since Raja holds a high post in a political party, the police after registering the case did not conduct any investigation and did not file the charge-sheet yet.

Hence, the petitioner moved the high court Madurai bench last year, seeking to file final report in the case. When the petition heard on Thursday, justice A D Jagadish Chandira gave the direction to the police.

Kochi: The Central Bureau of Investigation conducted a raid at a luxury beauty salon , Nail Artistry owned by actress Leena Maria Paul at Panampilly Nagar in Kochi on Thursday, in connection with an alleged money fraud case. According to CBI sources, the raid was held following an order from anti-corruption bureau in Hyderabad.

Incidentally, it was the same salon which was attacked by two bike-borne assailants in December 2018 on the orders of underworld don Ravi Pujari.

“A case was recently registered by the CBI Hyderabad unit against two people who posed as CBI officers from New Delhi and demanded bribe from a businessman who was accused in a corruption case. The accused spoofed CBI Hyderabad office’s landline number and multiple calls were made to the businessman mobile. The investigation found that one of the accused was familiar to actress Leena. We are yet to ascertain whether the actress has any involvement in the fraud,” said a CBI source.

217,['24/01/2020'],Human — dam or disaster?,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: A dam or disaster? Ten days after the expert committee headed by chief minister’s secretary Vikas Kharge met to discuss the controversial Human dam project proposed in the buffer of Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR), Uddhav Thackeray will review the issue at a high-level meeting on Friday.

On January 13, the committee — comprising forest and irrigation officials and experts — set up by the state wildlife board (SBWL) discussed the issue, but experts warned that the major dam could spell doom for tigers and humans by flaring up man-animal conflict.

In the last decade, over 140 villagers have died in wild animal attacks in Chandapur district alone. As per the latest estimation, Maharashtra’s tiger count has gone up from 190 in 2014 to 312 in 2018, with Tadoba’s landscape having more than 88 tigers. Construction of Human dam would lead to deprivation of space for tigers.

BJP MLA Sudhir Mungantiwar, on whose insistence the Friday meeting has been called, said, “The issue was discussed with the CM during winter session of assembly in Nagpur. The proposed dam in Sirkada village in Sindewahi will benefit 160 villages along with Chandrapur, and develop irrigation potential for 46,117 hectares.”

During Mungantiwar’s tenure as forest minister in the last government, however, the project was opposed by the SBWL. The four-member National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) committee too, in its report on project appraisal submitted in November 2014, opposed the project.

Apart from Mungantiwar, the meeting will be attended by ministers Vijay Waddetiwar, Jayant Patil, Sanjay Rathod, and others. The ministers did not respond to TOI’s calls, and Kharge chose not to comment.

The major dam will need diversion of 1,925.55-hectare forest land and felling of 1,50,791 trees. The Ministry of Enviornment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) granted Stage-I in 2004, despite warning by the-then principal conservator of forests (PCCF), wildlife that the dam’s canal and submergence area is a viable corridor used for free movement by animals between Tadoba-Ghodazhari-Bramhapuri.

“This corridor also assumes importance because the huge water body of Irai project near Mohurli has already deprived TATR of viable buffer zones, due to the submergence of pristine forests cutting off of the corridor to high forests of Bhadrawati. Construction of canals will restrict the movement of animals and even if passes are given, it is unlikely that animals will use them,” the-then PCCF’s report said.

Wildlife biologist Aditya Joshi said, “The submergence will break the only linking corridor for tiger movement between Tadoba-Ghodazhari-Umred-Karhandla. The tigers will be forced to cross the agricultural fields, which might in turn increase encounters with humans and lead to more conflict.”

Conservationist Prafulla Bhamburkar said, “The dam falls in the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Ghodazhari, as well as TATR. Additionally, the Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP) of TATR has been approved and thus the proposed forest land is part of the legally notified corridor now.”

“Is there a need for an additional dam? Since the inception of this project in 1983, several irrigation schemes like Gosikhurd, Irai, Ghodazhari, Asolamendha, Nalleshwar, Chargaon and others have come up in Tadoba landscape. Massive mining activity around Tadoba has already destroyed corridors,” said Deepak Dixit, chief of Prakruti Foundation.

“On September 8, 2009, the-then union minister Jairam Ramesh had asked ex-CM Ashok Chavan — who is now a minister in the Thackeray government — not to go ahead with the project considering isolation of Tadoba. However, the same government is now pursuing the project,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka.

Project Puzzle

967.37ha out of 1,925.55ha proposed area is now part of Tadoba buffer

WII says dam site is major corridor joining TATR with Kanha through Navegaon-Nagzira passing through buffer area

Gosikhurd and Nalleshwar irrigation projects almost complete

Command area of these projects includes part of Human project command area

After submergence of this forest area, vital functional corridor will be severed

As per guidelines for taking up no forestry activities in wildlife habitats, approval of Standing Committee of NBWL will be required

In view of above, project needs to be reviewed afresh

NEW DELHI: Leaving no occasion to corner BJP’s former ally Shiv Sena, Home minister Amit Shah on Thursday recalled its founder Bal Thackeray as someone who never compromised with his ideals, in what was seen as an attack on the current Sena leadership for aligning with Congress and NCP to form government in Maharashtra.“Remembering Balasaheb Thackeray Ji on his Jayanti. Balasaheb Ji was a brilliant intellect of his time, always mesmerised the masses with his oratory skills. He always stood firm and never compromised with his ideals, Balasaheb Ji’s life and his values will continue to inspire us,” Shah tweeted.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also paid tributes to the Sena founder as he tweeted: “Tributes to the great Balasaheb Thackeray on his Jayanti. Courageous and indomitable, he never hesitated from raising issues of public welfare. He always remained proud of Indian ethos and values. He continues to inspire millions.”While BJP continues to accuse Sena leadership of compromising with the ideals of party’s founder Thackeray, there have been several embarrassing occasions for Uddhaav Thackeray since taking over as CM, whose proposed visit to Ayodhya is being seen as a desperate bid to revamp the party’s hardcore Hindutva image.The announcement of Thackeray’s visit to Ayodhya followed yet another controversial statement of senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan who said his party formed the government in Maharashtra with Shiv Sena on the appeal of Muslims.BJP national spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi was quick to welcome Thackeray’s decision to visit Ayodhya on completion of 100 days in office and asked if Sena would take Congress along. Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Raut added to the discomfiture of Sena’s allies by tweeting that it wanted its alliance partners to accompany them. “Rahul Gandhi also visits several temples,” Raut said.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73567005,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-261522,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/balasaheb-never-compromised-with-his-ideals-amit-shahs-tribute-to-shiv-sena-founder-comes-as-jibe-for-uddhav/articleshow/73567003.cms

KOCHI: In a suspected case of suicide , a 38-year-old woman died on Thursday morning after she reportedly jumped from the tenth floor of the apartment complex where she stayed with her mother and nine-year-old daughter.

The deceased was identified as Elza Leena Maria, a native of Thiruvalla and a resident of a flat in a high-rise apartment complex near Kathrikadavu railway overbridge . The incident happened around 6.15am and her body was found by her mother and daughter on the extension of the second floor of the building. Police said that her estranged relationship with her husband was suspected to be the reason.

According to the North police, she was staying in the flat on the tenth floor of the building. On Thursday, she went out as usual for morning walk on the corridor. Though her daughter also joined her, she asked the girl to go inside and study. At that time, the woman’s mother was busy in the kitchen. A few minutes later they heard a loud thud outside. When her mother and daughter ran to the common corridor, she was not there. On looking downside, they saw her lying on the floor unconscious. Though they alerted the neighbours, police and doctors, the woman was later declared dead.

“Prima facie, it is a case of suicide. The victim used a bicycle to step on it and climb over the high railing of the corridor. Her mother later recovered a suicide note from the apartment and it hinted that she was depressed over the past few months due to the marital discord. She was reportedly undergoing medication for depression too. Her husband was staying in Chennai after being separated from her. Though she joined an aviation academy at Kaloor two months ago as a communicative English tutor, she left the office on Friday after expressing her intention to resign,” said police sources.

Meanwhile, the nearby residents said that Elza was a jovial person who was very active in the activities related to the Church. But they also said that she was not pleasant over the past few days.

North police registered a case of unnatural death under Section 174 of Code of Criminal Procedure. The body was later released to the relatives after conducting postmortem.

As the news of the incident spread, several people gathered around the building and nearby roads. They were later dispersed by the police.

Representative image

MADURAI: Madras high court has permitted one of the released convicts in the Melavalavu massacre case to visit Madurai for three days to attend his son’s marriage.

K M Ragunath, son of one of convict Manikandan, in his petition, stated that based on an interim order of the high court dated November 27, 2019, his father along with the remaining 12 convicts have been residing in Vellore district . Ragunath said that his father is complying with the court order without breaching any conditions.

He said that his marriage is scheduled to take place at Sivankoil at Melur in Madurai district on January 30. Since his father’s presence is required for his marriage, he sought to modify the condition for his father Manikandan for five days from January 29 to February 2 so that he can attend his marriage.

Hearing the plea, a division bench of justice S S Sundar and justice A D Jagadish Chandira granted permission for Manikandan to visit Madurai to attend his son’s marriage for three days from January 29 to January 31. The judges adjourned the case to January 30 for further hearing.

It maybe recalled that a public interest litigation (PIL) was filed by advocate P Rathinam, appearing as party-in-person challenging the GOs passed for the premature release of the 13 convicts involved in the case. The case involves the massacre of six dalits at Melavalavu on June 30, 1997, by members of another caste following the election of a dalit as the village council president. The state government released all the 13 convicts citing good conduct in November 2019.

Madras high court

MADURAI: Madras high court has set aside the order appointing O Raja, brother of deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, as chairman, and the interim board members of Theni District Milk Producers Cooperative Union. Petitioner V P Ammavasai, president of Palanichettipatti primary milk cooperative society, said a GO dated 22.8.2019 was passed by the department of animal husbandry, dairying and fisheries for bifurcating A1301 Madurai district milk producers cooperative union into Madurai and Theni districts.

This meant that there were only six members in the Theni district milk producers cooperative union. The petitioner said that according to the Cooperative Society Rules, 17 members are mandatory for constituting a valid executive committee. He said a meeting was convened on August 24, 2019 and O Raja was appointed chairman and 17 members appointed executive committee / interim board members without following rules. This was based on the order of Theni deputy registrar of the milk production and diary development department on August 26.

Hence, the petitioner moved the HC Madurai bench seeking to restrain the chairman and other board members of Theni district union from functioning. A division bench had passed an interim restraining order on September 12 and the state government filed a petition seeking to vacate it. On Thursday, a division bench of Justice M Duraiswamy and Justice T Ravindran observed that the authorities concerned have cited the wrong provision of the Act based on which the interim board was constituted. Hence the judges set aside the August 26 order of Theni deputy registrar and remitted the matter back to the authorities to pass orders on constituting an interim board or regular board in accordance with the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, other rules and by-laws.

Thiruvananthapuram: Severe unrest is brewing within Congress over the jumbo list of office bearers which has been submitted for the high command’s approval. Upset over the developments, two senior leaders of the party V D Satheesan and T N Prathapan have asked the party high command not to consider their names for any post.

Meanwhile, the party high command was not ready to accept the list submitted by KPCC, which comprised six working presidents, 13 vice-presidents, 36 general secretaries and 70 secretaries. Since the high command was not ready to accept the list, the senior leaders from the party who have been camping in New Delhi for a week have now returned.

Prathapan and Satheesan who spoke to AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik made it clear that the sharing of posts between the groups has brought sever shame to the party. Satheesan was considered for the working president post and Prathapan for the vice-president post.

The group managers had sabotaged the attempt of KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran to avoid a jumbo committee. Mullappally even had to surrender before the diktats of the group managers from adopting ‘one man one rank’ post.

Apart from the existing working presidents Kodikkunnil Suresh and K Sudhakaran, four more were added to the list to balance the group equations. V D Satheesan from the ‘I’ group and P C Vishnunath from the ‘A’ group were included. However, K V Thomas lobbied for the working president post and his name was included as the high command nominee. To give a representation for the Muslim community, the name of T Siddique was added in the last minute.

For the vice-president posts, 13 were considered to accommodate the senior leaders from both the groups. It also featured MLAs and MPs. V S Sivakumar, Adoor Prakash, Thampanoor Ravi, Sooranadu Rajashekaran, A P Anil Kumar from both the groups have found place in the vice president list among others.

CHENNAI: A three-year-old girl drowned after falling into a well at a relative’s house in Thirumullaivoyal on Thursday.

The deceased has been identified as Mithra, daughter of Hemkumar and Saranya of Tiruttani. The couple had another child recently. The incident happened when the family of four were visiting Saranya’s sister and her husband at Saraswathi Nagar in Thirumullaivoyal.

Police said Hemkumar and his brother-in-law were away to see a doctor and Saranya and her sister were at home with Mithra and the infant. Police said Saranya was feeding her newborn child, when Mithra was playing inside the house. “She had chided Mithra, asking her not to run inside the house. Mithra told her mother she was going to sleep with her grandfather and left the room,” a police officer said.

Saranya began looking for Mithra after a while but could not find her. Since the surrounding wall of the well was too low, Saranya peeped into it on suspicion and found Mithra floating in the water. Neighbours rescued Mithra and rushed her to a hospital where doctors declared her brought dead.

On information, the Thirumullaivoyal police registered a case and sent Mithra’s body for post-mortem. A police officer said there was about 10feet of water in the well.

A case has been registered and further investigation is on.

Gujarat high court (File Photo)

AHMEDABAD: In a major relief to coal importers, the Gujarat high court on Thursday struck down the Centre’s decision to impose Integrated Goods & Service Tax ( IGST ) on ocean freight by holding that its two notifications issued in 2017 levying the duty lacked “legislative competence”.

Various coal importers had challenged two notifications issued by the Centre on June 28, 2017 by which 5% IGST was levied on the estimated component of the ocean freight paid for the transportation of goods by the foreign seller, and this tax is recovered from the importer of the goods.

The bench headed by Justice J B Pardiwala has held the two notifications ultra vires to the provisions of the IGST Act. The bench said, “We have reached to the conclusion that no tax is leviable under the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, on the Ocean Freight for the services provided by a person located in a non-taxable territory by way of transportation of goods by a vessel from a place outside India up to the customs station of clearance in India and the levy and collection of tax of such Ocean Freight under the impugned notifications is not permissible in law.”

The coal importers submitted before the high court that the IGST can be levied on service provider or service recipient, and not on the importers, for they pay customs duty. The imposition of IGST amounts to double taxation because it sought to tax the importers so far as ocean freight is concerned. The importer is not a recipient of service of transportation of goods. The high court also accepted the argument that both, the service provider and the service recipients, are outside India and such a levy goes beyond the mandate of Section 1 of the IGST Act, which extends to the whole of India and not outside India.

Madurai: The AIADMK and the DMK are gearing up for another poll battle as the elections to the posts of chairman and vice-chairman of the Vadipatti panchayat union are scheduled to be held on January 30.

There was a close fight between the AIADMK and the DMK to bag the coveted panchayat union chairman and vice-chairman posts in the 13 panchayat unions in Madurai district. The elections to the posts of chairman and vice-chairman were held on January 11.

The DMK won the posts in Madurai East, Madurai West, Alanganallur, Usilampatti and Sedapatti panchayat unions. The AIADMK on the other hand won, Thirumangalam, Kallikudi, T Kallupatti, Chellampatti, Melur and Kottampatti unions. As both parties have six panchayat unions each, the victory at Vadipatti is crucial, as the party that wins the union would become the winner in the district.

Among the 13 unions, the election at the Vadipatti panchayat union was not held on January 11 due to lack of quorum. The panchayat union has a total of 14 union ward members, and rules specify the presence of eight members to conduct election.

230,['24/01/2020'],Gujarat HC refuses to quash FIR against anti-CAA protesters,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representational

AHMEDABAD: The Gujarat high court has refused to quash an FIR filed against some protesters of the Citizenship Amendment Act observing that the investigation into “the serious offence” is under way and at a very nascent stage.

The court held the accused have not been able to establish that the HC should use its special powers to quash the FIR in this case.

Four protesters including Amarnath Vasava were arrested in Chhapi town in Banaskantha district of north Gujarat, where the protesters had gathered in large numbers.

The authorities had withdrawn permission to hold the programme at the last moment and detained Vasava and three others from their hotel in the morning of December 19, 2019.

After the protests, police booked people including these four for rioting, unlawful assembly, creating rift between communities and criminal conspiracy.

The protesters approached the HC saying that they had been in police detention at the time the alleged trouble took place. Still they have been implicated in the case. Cops had taken them to the venue at the insistence of the mob.

The HC observed that their submission is attractive, but the cops had to take them to the venue due to demand of the mob, which had already started damaging property.

Two of the accused delivered speeches and shouted slogans, though there was no permission to hold the programme, the HC said.

Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: Addressing his first election rally in Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah said the opposition had misled the youth and the minorities on CAA, which was all about giving citizenship to persecuted minorities in the Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who dream of a peaceful life in India.

“Deputy chief minister of Delhi Manish bhai shamelessly said that they were with Shaheen Bagh protesters. They have tried to disturb peace in Delhi and instigated violence. Will Delhi remain safe if they come back to power?” Shah asked, seeking support of the crowd in favour of the CAA.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

He also blamed the AAP government for trying to save those who allegedly raised anti-India slogans at JNU in 2016 by not granting prosecution sanction to Delhi police to file chargesheet against them.

After his speech at Matiala, Shah went on a “padyatra” in the neighbouring Uttam Nagar constituency and ended the day with another public meeting at Nangloi Jat.

Shah’s speeches in both Matiala and Nangloi Jat started with local issues with the home minister invoking CAA, Ram Mandir, abrogation of Article 370 and 35A in later part of his address. He also blamed the AAP government for obstructing the Ayushman Bharat scheme — which promises free treatment of up to Rs 5 lakh every year to the poor — and giving pucca houses to slum dwellers under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana from being implemented in the national capital for “vote bank politics”. Shah alleged that CM Arvind Kejriwal feared that those who benefitted from the scheme will vote for Modi in the elections.

“BJP’s record is to work even without being in power in Delhi. For 4.5 years, Kejriwal said Modi didn’t allow him work. Now, he is saying the last five years were good. We have to apprise people about the projects that have been left incomplete by AAP government and also tell them that this government didn’t implement Centre’s public welfare schemes like Ayushman Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana,” he said.

Shah said 112 government schemes launched by the Centre were not implemented in Delhi. “AAP government is the biggest obstruction in the implementation of these schemes. Remove this obstruction and make the BJP government in Delhi under the leadership of Modi and enjoy their benefits,” he said.

Shah blamed AAP government for supply of contaminated water in the city. He said Modi government had promised to give “mineral water” type supply through tap to every household in the next five years and blamed Kejriwal for trying to take credit for it.

BJP national president J P Nadda and state unit chief Manoj Tiwari addressed two public meetings each in various parts of the city. At Palam, Nadda slammed Congress for backing the Shaheen Bagh protest, saying the then Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Manmohan Singh had urged deputy PM L K Advani in 2003 to grant citizenship to minorities who had migrated from Bangladesh. At Tughlaqabad, Tiwari said by taking the decision to regularise unauthorised colonies, giving ownership rights to its residents and launching ‘Jahan Jhuggi Waha Makan’ scheme, BJP had proved it was the only party “standing” with the poor.

MADURAI: The state government has been issued notice on a plea seeking to ensure that police personnel involved in vehicle checks in the state are armed.

In his petition, K K Ramesh, a litigant from Madurai appearing as party-in-person, moved the high court Madurai bench seeking the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) or State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to take action in cases where police personnel are killed or injured by anti-social elements during vehicle checks.

He also sought that senior officials should ensure that all the police personnel who are involved in vehicle checks or law and order duty are carrying arms. He further sought to install CCTV cameras at all the check-posts situated at the inter-state borders and the visuals should be monitored through a control room.

When the petition was heard on Thursday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran issued notice to the state government and adjourned the case to a further date. TNN

234,['24/01/2020'],UAPA case: CPM dist panel goes on backfoot,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Kozhikode: Two days after UDF hinted that it will take up the case against Allan Shuhaib and Thwaha Fasal, who have been arrested for alleged Maoist links, CPM district committee went on backfoot, saying that the party is still in the process of verifying the details regarding the case.

Addressing a news conference on Thursday, CPM district secretary P Mohanan said the party had not got a chance to hear from the youth as they are still in judicial custody. “We need to check the facts pertaining to the case in detail. We have certain limitations as the youth are in custody,” he said.

Asked about chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s remarks on the issue, he said that Pinarayi’s statements may have been based on the information provided by the government machinery.

Mohanan’s assertion is contradictory to the statement by the chief minister who categorically said at different occasions that Allan and Thwaha were Maoists. He had cautioned against whitewashing the youth and presenting them as innocent.

Mohanan said that there will be a natural delay in party’s examination on the Maoist links of CPM workers. “And the party will act as per the finding of the examination,” he said.

It may be recalled that CPM state committee member P Jayarajan also had said that Allan and Thwaha had links with Maoists. In a reply to Allan’s mother Sabitha Shekhar’s Facebook post, Jayarajan had said that party has found out that a wanted Maoist had stayed with Allan in his hostel room.

Meawhile, later in the day, Mohanan issued a statement saying that the media has misquoted him. “Certain media channels are misrepresenting that I have said the chief minister’s is the police version and I have contradicted the CM,” said his statement.

“I said that the government can only proceed in the legal way and what the chief minister said should be taken in the that sense. This statement is being given in the news as P Mohanan said something against the chief minister,” Mohanan said.

He added that both the party and the government have the same view on UAPA. Chennithala’s intervention is just a political drama because as many as 132 cases were framed under UAPA when he was the home minister, he added.

In the reply, the Lok Sabha secretariat stated that as on December 10, 2019, 503 MPs hadn’t furnished the requisite details, with only 36 MPs, including PM Narendra Modi, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, having done so.

Speaking with TOI, Nadim Uddeen said, “I’d asked for detail of those MPs who haven’t taken oath yet, as well as details of assets and liabilities furnished by them after they took the oath of office and secrecy.”

As per the RTI reply two MPs, Himadri Singh and Atul Kumar Singh, hadn’t even taken oath, as on July 31, 2019. Nadim Uddeen had filed the RTI online on October 24, 2019. The Lok Sabha Secretariat information cell responded on December 11.

Representational Image

AHMEDABAD: The city police on Thursday explained before the Gujarat high court why they grant permission to political parties for rallies in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) or to oppose it, but refuse permission to those lacking credentials.

After they refused permission to hold a protest rally in Jamalpur, two petitioners – Mudita Vidrohi and Mijahid Nafees – complained before the HC that the state administration straightaway grants permission to the ruling party for rallies in support of CAA but refuses permissions to those who want to oppose the new citizenship law.

In reply, the city police claimed that this argument by the petitioner “is thoroughly misconceived”. It claimed that the rallies taken out by the BJP and Congress were both peaceful and the law and order situation was not threatened anywhere. The affidavit by assistant commissioner of police, I J Patel, said, “None of the instances (of rallies hosted by the ruling dispensation and the opposition) relied upon by the petitioners serve as a precedence which have threatened either law and order or public order. Moreover, permissions to such processions, if any given, are fact based and depending upon the credentials of the hosts.”

Justifying denial of permission to gather 10,000 people to protest CAA in Jamalpur, the police questioned the credentials of the petitioners so far as their assurance to maintain peace in the area. The officer cited statements of residents, who requested cops not to grant permission to this protest programme fearing disruption of peace.

To question the credentials of the petitioners, the police repeatedly cited the incident of the Shah-e-Alam protest held on December 19, 2019, which turned violent. The violence that took place in Shah-e-Alam was cited to refuse permission of a rally from Jamalpur Gate to Khamasa. It was reiterated that a huge crowd of 10,000 cannot be managed by police.

Swachh Survekshan survey is conducted every year to ascertain the cleanliness of cities and towns and rankings are given based on various factors.

Officials and workers from Madurai Corporation have been reaching out to the people for the past three weeks asking them to register their feedback, which is crucial in determining the ranking of any local body. Officials said the corporation has not been performing well in terms of ranking in the Swachh Survekshan results due to poor documentation and citizen feedback. This time around, officials left no stone unturned in terms of documentation, and that has been reflected in the first and second quarterly results released last month, in which Madurai had performed well compared to other cities in the state.

Dr S Vinoth Raja, assistant city health officer of the corporation said that they have formed teams, which have been reaching out to college students, residents at temples and other areas where people gather. Public are sensitized on the importance of feedback and help is being provided to download the app required for recording it. After feedback, they will be field visit by teams for direct observation. Some of the areas will be randomly checked and photographs will be taken to provide marks under direct observation category.

Officials said that out of 6,000 mark, a major chunk of 1,500 is allocated to citizen feedback. The civic body has asked people to come forward to record their feedback in next one week. The user needs to input details such as state, city and mobile number to get an OTP on their mobile phone. In total, there will be eight questions. In order to give feedback the user should have lived in the city for at least six months.

Residents can record their feedback through SS2020 VoteForYourCity app, or Swachhata app, or www.swachhsurvekshan2020.org website.

Madurai: As the afternoon temperature starts climbing and hovering around 35 degrees Celsius, summer coolers such as watermelon and tender coconuts have started arriving in the city.

“The rise in the afternoon temperature is indicative of the hot summer that we are going to face this year,” said T Swaminathan of Anna Nagar.

The retired teacher says that there were days when winter afternoons were considered best for walks in Madurai, but not anymore.

Selathayee, a vendor who sells watermelon near the Mattuthavani bus stand, said that the fruit was selling for about Rs 25per kilogram as the supplies were just starting.

“The inside of the fruit has not become that red or tasty, but it is good to tackle the afternoon heat and many people are buying it regularly,” she said.

Fruit Vendors Association secretary S Muruganantham said that about 10-15 tonnes of watermelons are arriving from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka to the Madurai market every day.

In the coming days it will go up to more than 100 tonnes. This year the supply is going to be good, he said.

Meanwhile, tender coconut sales have also started picking up and the vendors say that the bigger ones with more water are selling for Rs 60.

“Customers are not complaining as the heat in the afternoons has increased,” said T Kannan of Pudur.

Wholesale tender coconut dealer V Sampathkumar said that the city was only receiving about 40,000 to 50,000 tender coconuts per day, predominantly from Theni district.

“Traders are finding it hard to make a living after the demonitization and now the supplies have also dropped due to water scarcity,” he said. The low supplies were a reason for the high price, he said.

Meanwhile, doctors said that people should keep themselves well hydrated this season as the afternoon temperatures are rising. Tender coconuts and watermelons are good for all seasons in Madurai, they said.

ETURUNAGARAM: T Sammakka, a tribal woman who survives as a farm labourer in Mulugu district’s Eturunagaram town, got the shock of her life recently when GST intelligence officials slapped a Rs 3 crore tax evasion notice on her.The director-general of GST intelligence for Hyderabad zone in its notice told her that the cooperative society she was heading had mined sand worth Rs 24.5 crore and had a tax liability of Rs 3.4 crore, an amount she had not even dreamt of in her life.According to the authorities, the Eturu Grama Prajala Isuka Quarry Labour Contract Cooperatie Society Limited had received the money from the Telangana State Mineral Development Corporation (TSMDC) towards sand excavation services.The rules state that any sand mining contract and related activity in scheduled tribal areas must exclusively be given to local, scheduled tribal persons only. Sammakka and other members of the society say they had subcontracted the sand-mining to larger companies for which they received around Rs 1 lakh each into the bank account. Also, they had no clue of the vast transactions that were taking place in their name.A TOI investigation in this tribal region on the banks of Godavari in Telangana found out that most cooperative societies that got sand excavation contracts immediately subcontracted the work to construction and infrastructure companies in Hyderabad and Warangal . Sources said that it was likely that the society members were given a pittance compared to the earnings from the sand mining.Sammakka, who belongs to the Koya tribe, told TOI, “I took over as president after society elections in April 2016. We subcontracted sand mining to five companies and had no role in excavation thereafter.”She further said: “For every meeting that we attended, they paid us Rs 500 each and we signed the documents. All the accounts of the society are taken care of by officials of Euturunagaram Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA). In three villages, there are 600 members of the society, each getting between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1 lakh.”Sammakka’s neighbour Seetha Lakshmi said, “Huge sand mining happened right in front of us. But we didn’t know the amount of sand excavated. What the members of the society got was a pittance.”Officials at the Mulugu district registrar of cooperative societies’ office revealed that Sammakka’s society was registered on February 16, 2015. The district collector, after approval of the district sand committee, handed over the sand mining contract to TSMDC. The mining corporation in turn gave it to the tribal society. The society now says it only passed this on to the other companies.TSMDC has agreed to pay Rs 150 per cubic metre to the sand societies for excavation work. The Society has given subcontract. As per the subcontract, the scope of the work includes excavation of sand and transportation it to nearby stock yard and loading the sand into the truck as specified by TSMDC.The subcontractors paid Rs 70 per cubic metre to the Society. It was estimated that around 67.5 lakh cubic metres at Eturu and around 56 lakh cubic metres of sand at Thupakulagudem was available as per contractThe transactions were from March 2015 to December 2016 during the service tax regime, and the society neither obtained service tax registration nor paid the tax. Chityala Arun Kumar, one of the members of the society, appeared before GST officials and said, “Society has given the contract for excavation to five subcontractors. We are not registered with the service tax department hence we did not pay any service tax. Due to lack of awareness and clarity on applicability of service tax on the excavation of sand we haven’t paid the tax.” He added that he would get back after consulting other society members.ITDA officials said that Rs 80 was being paid to subcontractors per cubic metre by the societies and they get a profit of Rs 70 per cubic metre. It said 18.1 lakh cubic metres of sand had been sold by the Eturu society for which around Rs 27 crore has been paid to the society in which Rs 14 crore is paid to subcontractors and society got Rs 12.7 crore profit.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73576595,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81311,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/tribal-co-op-society-gets-rs-3cr-gst-shocker-over-sand-mining/articleshow/73563761.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: The state government has decided to initiate procedures for acquiring land for the Thiruvananthapuram-Kasaragod semi high speed rail corridor, which was accorded in-principle approval by the ministry of railways. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Thursday.

According to the project’s feasibility study report, the government has to acquire a total of 1,226 hectre land. But, the railways ministry has now agreed to use its surplus land in places where the new rail comes parallel to the existing railway line. Thus, the semi high-speed rail project would get around 200 hectres of land from railways.

The government will have to acquire the rest of the land, and for speedy work, the meeting decided to open acquisition cells immediately. The meeting was attended by public works minister G Sudhakaran, chief secretary Tom Jose, transport principal secretary K R Jyothilal and Kerala Rail Development Corporation (KRDC) MD V Ajithkumar.

The project, estimated at Rs 66,000 crore, is being taken up by the KRDC, wherein the Indian Railways and the state government have equal share. The project is being implemented with loans expected from international financial agencies, and discussions are on with German Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency. tnn

Representative image

MALAPPURAM: Twenty-two families of a dalit colony near Valanchery in Malappuram district were allegedly denied drinking water after three among them attended a pro-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) programme organized by BJP.

The residents of Cherukunnu SC colony alleged that a Muslim family in the neighbourhood, which use to provide drinking water to them, stopped the supply from January 17, citing the participation of three among them in a ‘Janajagratha Sadass’ supporting CAA as the reason. The event was held at Valanchery town a week ago.

After senior BJP leaders raised the issue through their Twitter handles on Thursday, revenue authorities decided to convene an all-party meeting and take immediate steps to restore the water supply.

Most of the residents of the colony are BJP supporters. Akhila Cherukunnu Parambil, a resident, said the water supply scheme of grama panchayat was not functioning for more than a year and they were forced to walk around 1km to collect drinking water.

“Recently, the Muslim family arranged a facility to pump water from a water source to their home. They offered three buckets of water to each of the family in the colony daily. On Friday, a woman member of the family told us that photos of three men of the colony attending the pro-CAA programme was being circulating on a social media group in the locality and the family cannot continue to provide water as they were under pressure from a section of people to stop the supply,” said Akhila.

C P Velayudhan, a former CPM branch committee member, said the family stopped providing water suddenly and people in the colony, irrespective of party affiliations, were hit. Velayudhan said that he would bring the issue to the notice the CPM leaders. For the last three days, Sevabharathi unit in Painkannur has been supplying water to the colony.

However, Sainudheen Kalappadathil, a member of the Muslim family, said: “We stopped supplying water due to technical issues. My wife never told them anything about CAA. These allegations are fabricated.”

Meanwhile, Tirur tahsildar T Murali, who visited the colony on Thursday, said that revenue authorities will file a detailed report on the incident to district collector Jafar Malik on Friday. “Panchayat authorities will take immediate steps to provide water to the colony,” he said.

“We are yet to verify the allegations of the colony residents,” added Murali.

247,['24/01/2020'],Tamil Nadu: Mass withdrawal over NPR-KYC link ruffles bank,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Since Saturday, about 600 people have withdrawn their entire deposits worth about Rs 6 crore (File photo)

MADURAI: Smarting under an unprecedented money-withdrawal spree by customers who misread a bank notice requesting National Population Register (NPR) details for its KYC, the Kayalpattinam branch of Central Bank of India in Tuticorin has launched a campaign to allay fears. Since Saturday, about 600 people, predominantly Muslims, have withdrawn their entire deposits worth about Rs 6 crore.

There are about 18,000 accounts in the branch of which 15,000 are savings, said branch manager A Mariappan. Kayalpattinam is a coastal town with about 10,000 households. Many of the men work abroad and hold NRI accounts with the bank. Shabana (name changed) said they were told that the notice may be a consequence of their protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and that there was no safety for their deposits. Her husband who works in the Middle East had told her to withdraw the few lakhs they had in the bank, which she did on Monday.

“We went on a campaign in an autorickshaw announcing that KYC was only for new accounts and very old ones when a ration card was enough to start an account, and that the NPR certificate was only an option. But we are yet to get the message through,’’ said Mariappan pointing out that customers withdrew Rs 50 lakh even on Thursday. The bank notification published in a Tamil daily on January 11 had said that NPR details can be provided by customers for the KYC linked to their accounts. The withdrawals began after the notification was widely circulated on social media. The customers presumed that it was mandatory to furnish the NPR certificate. Officials said they were surprised to see hundreds of customers queued outside their bank early on Saturday morning to withdraw cash.

“It was only a little while later that we realised that they had come to empty their accounts, and there was nothing we could do about it,’’ Mariappan said. “Monday was the day of highest withdrawals and most of the customers who came to withdraw money were women, who rarely come to the bank on other days,’’ he added.

Social activist and member of the Mass Empowerment and Guidance Association S K Salih said the people’s fears were justified as they were at the forefront of the protest against the CAA and NRC. “We took out a rally of 6,500 people, carried a 650-metre-long national flag and conducted special prayers in schools against it. We wore badges saying ‘No CAA and No NRC’, and here we were being asked to submit NPR details. Our biggest fears are becoming true,’’ he said. “This is a nation where demonetization occurred on a single night and nothing can be ruled out,’’ he said.

Madurai: House break-in incidents continue to take place in the Koodalpudur police station limits despite the stepped-up vigilance by the city police. Koodalpudur, having a vast area from Park Town to Paravai Market to New Vilangudi, continues to be a hotspot for burglars.

At least six incidents targeting locked houses have been reported since December 2019, which is one fourth of the total incidents reported in Madurai city having 22 police stations.

Another incident was reported in Vinayaka temple in the police limits, where articles worth thousands of rupees were stolen. The incidents were reported from places such as S Alangulam, Anaiyur and Park Town. In one of the incidents, 44 sovereigns of gold jewels and Rs 2.17 lakh in cash were stolen from a locked house at S Alangulam on December 24.

Close to 700 grams of gold jewels and about Rs 4 lakh in cash were looted in six house break-in incidents in the police limits. House break-in incidents were also reported in Tallakulam, SS Colony and Thirunagar police stations limits in Madurai city. After the introduction of Delta vehicles and increase in visible policing, crimes including house break-ins have largely come down in other police station limits.

A police officer said that they have stepped up vigilance during night. There are at least three police beats, three two-wheeler patrols, one Delta vehicle and the station inspector would be moving at nights. But, house break-in incidents could not be stopped since the area is too vast to cover. “Houses are sparsely built and the area is also vast. The station’s jurisdiction is on the borders of Madurai district police, making it easier for criminals to escape without any trace,” he said.

A higher police officer said that the only way to prevent burglary is to catch the gangs operating in the locality. They are confident of catching them in 10 days, he said.

249,['24/01/2020'],"Delhi: Primary healthcare given a boost, but hospitals need infra injection","Representative image

NEW DELHI: Five years ago, no one had heard of a mohalla clinic . But the idea of neighbourhood health centres has been a hit among Delhiites , especially the poor, who earlier postpone all doctor visits unless the illnesses was really serious, both to save money and the time spent in overcrowded government hospitals.“When my wife fell ill recently, I went to the mohalla clinic operating from the house next door,” revealed Sanjay Kumar in east Delhi’s Vinod Nagar. “The doctor examined her and prescribed medicines for free. I would have had to pay a private doctor Rs 150.” Kumar, who came to Delhi two decades ago from Rae Bareli in UP, is a Congress party supporter. Saying he hadn’t decided who to vote for in the assembly elections, Kumar did express happiness, however, at Delhi government’s success in boosting primary healthcare by introducing mohalla clinics.When Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi for the second time in 2015, it promised to build 1,000 mohalla clinics across the state. However, only 450 such clinics have become operational. “There is no mohalla clinic in our area. We have only been hearing about its benefits,” said Rinki Yadav in south Delhi’s Sanwal Nagar. BJP and Congress have regularly alleged corruption and deficiencies in the running of the clinics, but it hasn’t dented the popularity of these convenient healthcare stations.It isn’t surprising then that AAP hopes the clinics will garner it support during the polls. More than half of them are run from rented premises instead of portacabins, as envisaged in the original plan when the first clinic was inaugurated in west Delhi’s Peeragarhi in July 2015. “The plan to build more mohalla clinics was delayed by unavailability of land and the obstructions created by the BJP-majority municipal corporations,” alleged an AAP functionary.But the opposition parties point out that the AAP government failed to improve tertiary care in the capital. A report by a BJP think-tank, released last week, claimed that Delhi government had added only 394 beds in state-run hospitals instead of the 30,000 beds it had promised during the 2015 assembly polls campaign. Public Policy Research Centre also said the AAP government had been pulled up numerous times by Delhi high court for its inability to meet the city’s growing healthcare demands.A recent inquiry conducted by a high court-appointed expert panel on the functioning of state government-run hospitals revealed that most had long waiting lists for major procedures, while those located on the city’s periphery lacked basic equipment and staff. The 250-page report said some of these centres were forced to shut emergency services after 4pm and three peripheral hospitals were cited as referring the patients requiring emergency services to a “bigger centre” after that.The report also noted that most public hospitals struggled with staff shortage and key equipment. At Lok Nayak Hospital, one of the largest public health facilities in the capital, there were less than half the stipulated staff in the obstetrics and gynaecology department at night. Even a sanitation employee wasn’t on duty though almost half of all deliveries takes place at night, the panel said.Government officials claimed to be working to improve things. “We have started a helpline that patients can call to complain about any deficiency,” said one of them. “Also, we have ensured availability of free medicines and we are working overtime to expand the health infrastructure by constructing new hospitals and adding more beds to the existing ones.”The official added, “The Indira Gandhi Hospital in Dwarka, which will be the largest in southwest Delhi with 1,241 beds, the 600-bed facility at Ambedkar Nagar in south Delhi and a 772-bed hospital in Burari, northwest Delhi, are likely to become functional in three months.”Since few Delhi state-run hospitals have MRI and CT scan facilities, the government introduced a scheme two years ago to allow patients referred by select hospitals to have such tests done in empanelled private diagnostic centres. Similarly, if the waitlist for surgery was too long, patients could avail of treatment at select private hospitals. “More than 17 lakh people have benefited from the scheme, while over 1,000 people have undergone free surgery in private hospitals,” a government official said.Critics, however, observe that outsourcing key services and surgeries to private establishments may not be a good idea. “The money spent annually by the government in getting MRIs done outside its hospitals, for example, can instead buy required machines. Only two-three Delhi government hospitals have MRI facility, and in Lok Nayak Hospital, the waiting time for a scan is two years,” said a doctor.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73570709,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-112903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/primary-healthcare-given-a-boost-but-hospitals-need-infra-injection/articleshow/73564075.cms

RAJKOT: Hardly had the flutter on social media around Abdasa Congress MLA Pradyumansinh Jadeja’s son Jaideepsinh’s video on Instagram showing him firing in the air died down, that another politician added fuel to the fire with another fresh upload of a similar video on Facebook.

The new video shows Dhoraji Upleta Congress MLA Lalit Vasoya learning how to fire, was uploaded by his supporter Dinesh Patel. However, Vasoya may escape action as the video was taken at the time of his training to ‘fire a pistol’.

“I have applied for gun licence for my personal security. As it is mandatory for any licence applicant to acquire the certificate from the weapon training centre in Gondal, I had gone there. It was while I was practising with a pistol that my video had been shot,” Vasoya told reporters.

Later, Vasoya also asked Patel to remove the video from his account. Jaideepsinh uploaded three videos on Instagram showing him firing in the air from his pistol and 12 bore gun, leading to his arrest on Wednesday night.

KOLKATA: The West Bengal Heritage Commission has proposed the replication of the Serampore Initiative, which led to the restoration of Danish heritage in Serampore, to take up similar projects in former European colonies along the Hooghly . Portuguese were the first to settle in Bandel , followed by the Dutch in Chinsurah and French in Chandernagore.

“The Serampore Initiative that saw the Danish government, National Museum of Denmark and the West Bengal Heritage Commission (WBHC) sign an MoU and contribute towards restoration of important Danish architecture in Serampore can act as a model to drive similar initiatives in other European settlements in Hooghly,” WBHC chairman Shuvaprasanna said.

Conservation architect Manish Chakraborti, who executed the restoration of St Olav Church, Denmark Tavern and North and South Gate of the court compound, said the National Museum of Denmark had steered the research, while the Danish government and WBHC had financed the project. “This collaborative and bottom-up approach is a potential model for conservation-led development in other historic settlements along the Hooghly,” he said. On Thursday, WBHC assigned heritage plaques to the restored buildings. St Olav Church, restored in association with the Calcutta diocese, has won a Unesco heritage award of distinction.

Bente Wolff, project head of Serampore Initiative, said the key takeaway from the Serampore model was how it catalysed larger contributions and supplementary projects from the state government and Serampore municipality, like restoration of Government House, upgrading of the riverfront, historic streets and the historic town square. “We also have the relocation planned for government office, away from historic town core, demolition of sub-standard buildings and construction of new bus terminus to relieve the town core of overload of buses,” Bente added.

PANAJI: The state government on Thursday extended the term of the committee to prepare draft zonal masterplans for the eco-sensitive areas declared in the state by three months. The Union environment ministry had notified five wildlife sanctuaries and one national park and areas around them in Goa as eco-sensitive zones.

Draft zonal masterplans have to be now prepared for these areas. The ministry of environment, forest and climate change has notified Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park, Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary, Netravali Wildlife Sanctuary , Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary, Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary and Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary as eco-sensitive zones and the areas around as wildlife protected areas.

The activities that are prohibited, regulated and permeated in eco-sensitive zones are defined in the notification. A committee to monitor the compliance of the notification was constituted.

The state level eco-sensitive zone monitoring committee for Goa held its meeting and decided that as the land details are already available with the town and country planning department, the chief town planner will get the draft zonal masterplan for eco-sensitive zones prepared.

“The notification requires the preparation of a zonal masterplan for effective management of eco-sensitive zones for each protected area within two years of the date of its publication for consideration and approval by MoEF,” the government stated in a notification.

Bareilly: Police have resolved the highway truck robbery case and arrested the truck owner and driver for planning a fake robbery in Izzatnagar area of Bareilly district. The truck’s owner and driver had faked the robbery and sold a rice consignment which they were handed over by a businessman for delivery.

The police have arrested both the accused and recovered Rs 6 lakh along with the truck. The truck’s driver had filed an FIR that his truck was looted by armed robbers in Izzatnagar area on January 20.

Truck owner Munna Yadav and driver Prem Singh, both residents of Deoria district, approached SHO Izzatnagar police station and lodged a police complaint that they were carrying rice from Bihar to Uttarakhand when 3-4 unidentified robbers had thrashed, confined them and eloped with the truck along with loaded rice on Nainital-Bareilly state highway. An FIR was registered under IPC sections 343 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) at Izzatnagar police station.

During the investigation, SHO KK Verma found that Munna Yadav had filed a fake complaint. And after following him through his informers, Verma caught him red-handed with the looted truck with a fake registration number of West Bengal. Yadav had already sold the rice to someone else and had shared the money with his driver Prem Singh.

Yadav later told police that he faked the robbery because he wanted to collect money for the treatment of his mother who is suffering from a critical health condition.

SSP Shailesh Pandey told TOI on Thursday, “During investigation, we found that the story narrated by the truck owner had many loopholes. It didn’t match with the chronology of events and during cross-questioning, driver and the owner had differing statements. We monitored the movement of the truck owner and recovered the looted truck which was hidden elsewhere with a fake registration number. We booked him for cheating along with the sections of robbery.”

Representative image

MADURAI: The city corporation is planning to seek police help after LED bulbs and controller units have gone missing from the lamp posts on the streets in the last few days. High wattage LED bulbs, which were installed recently under the Smart City scheme, were found missing in many areas. Apart from bulbs, controller units, which control street lights based on preset timing, were also missing.

A private contractor, who procured materials and installed new LED bulbs and fittings, recently informed the corporation officials about the missing components. The officials, who suspected that the components might have been stolen, are planning to lodge a police complaint through a petition to the police commissioner.

Sources from electrical department of corporation said that all the missing bulbs are 120 watts and each one of them may cost between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000. Each controller unit costs more than that.

Sources said that it has been noticed that at least six bulbs and 18 controllers are missing in places like Avaniyapuram, Chinthamani, South Marret Street, Alagappan Nagar, TVS Nagar and Muthupatti. There is a strong suspicion that equipment could be missing in other parts of the city also and teams are conducting checks in all the areas.

The corporation took up the work of replacing street lights into LED bulbs under the Smart City scheme in 72 old wards at the cost of Rs 25 crore last year.

A higher official from the engineering wing of the corporation said that it is suspected that some disgruntled employee under the private contractor could have been behind the theft. CCTV footages, which have been taken out from nearby houses, show that some people stole the bulbs and units. “We will consult with corporation commissioner and lodge a complaint with the police commissioner to catch the thieves,” the official said.

HYDERABAD: Telangana may have achieved 100% universal Aadhaar coverage along with a few other states, but India’s newest state has the highest error percentage in the country.While Telangana has 13.6 % errors, Karnataka has 8.6% errors and the rest have less than 5.5% errors in Aadhaar cards issued in their respective states, according to the study by global social impact advisory group Dalberg.Most of these errors are mistakes in dates of birth or names, followed by goof-up in names, addresses, the gender of the person and photographs, the report says.Experts say the errors assume significance in the backdrop of the proposed implementation of the National Population Register (NPR), which will seek data on dates of birth and Aadhaar numbers of citizens. Neighbouring Andhra Pradesh has just 0.80% errors in Aadhaar cards issued in the state.The pilot project of Aadhaar enrolment was first kicked off in 2010 in the then undivided Andhra Pradesh.“The transliteration tool which converts Telugu into English and vice-versa was not updated. Officials used a customized tool which has resulted in errors in names and addresses of people,” cybersecurity expert Sridhar Nallamothu explained. “The cameras that were used were of outdated VGA (video graphics array) type which was part of first-generation smart mobile phones released in 2002. Similar phones were used during 2010 pilot project,” he added.Experts also blamed operators belonging to private enrolment agencies hired by the Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI) for mistakes. “After opening the network with their finger authentication, the operators allowed others who are not authenticated to carry out the enrolment work,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be identified. “UIDAI had even cancelled contracts of some of these enrolment agencies,” he recalled.Another glaring error that often came to the fore was mobile phone numbers not displayed on Aadhaar cards. “It was either due to the cardholder forgetting to give his or her mobile number to the operator or the number not being filled in the designated column by the operator,” experts said.Officials countered that care was taken as monitors were arranged for the benefit of citizens to see what is being entered in the system by the operators. “There may be some technical errors. But generally, illiterate people would not know what was being shown on the monitors and might have nodded to what was being asked of them by the operators,” said a UIDAI official.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73575915,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-535538,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/check-your-aadhaar-t-tops-error-charts/articleshow/73563841.cms

Representative image

NASHIK: Schools across Nashik district have started registering on the SARAL portal for admitting students under the Right to Education ( RTE ) Act for the academic year 2020-21.

The primary education directorate of the state government has instructed the schools to complete the registration process before February 11 following which the students will begin applying for admissions.

“Once the schools register on the portal and provide the number of students that can be benefited, the same will be verified by the Block Education Office (BEO),” a Nashik zilla parishad ( ZP ) official said.

Nashik ZP is the nodal agency in Nashik for undertaking the process of admissions in schools of the district under RTE Act.

According to the ZP official, earlier there was a provision of four rounds of lottery for students to get admissions under the RTE if the number of applicants was more than the number of seats available in schools.

“But now there will be only one round of lottery for admitting students in schools under the RTE. Moreover there will be a waiting list of equal number of students who will automatically get upgraded against cancellation of admissions,” he said.

In the academic year 2019-20, a total of 457 schools had registered themselves under this scheme. “This year we are expecting over 550 schools to register on the portal. Also, last year, over 1,400 seats remained vacant. Since there will be only one lottery this time and a waiting list of equal number of students, we are expecting 100% admissions under the scheme,” the ZP official said.

The ZP has also directed the schools to update online data of students studying under the RTE scheme and the number of vacant seats that would be available in the next academic year. Students, who had registered last year, will be automatically registered this year.

The primary education directorate has asked the BEO as well as the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) to constitute a scrutiny committee for checking the admission documents.

Although minority schools and schools that get grant from the government are exempted from the scheme, the BEO has to upload the details of such schools along with those that are shut for the purpose of scrutiny.

KOCHI: A meeting organised by a Sangh Parivar outfit within the premises of the Ernakulam Pavakulam Temple in support of CAA on Tuesday morning has kicked up a row after the video of a woman who went to the event uninvited being pushed out of the hall and verbally abused by a group of women and men went viral on social media.The controversy worsened further on Thursday with the Ernakulam North police registering cases against both the woman and the meeting attendees, based on each other’s complaints.Police said the incident occurred when the woman, identified as Athira of Thiruvananthapuram , entered the hall, where the meeting named Mathrusangamam organised by Janajagarana Samithi was proceeding, and alleged that the speakers were “propagating lies”.This led to a minor scuffle and heated exchanges and the woman was finally pushed out of the hall. The video also showed some women attendees verbally abusing the woman with communally-loaded and provocative comments.Later on Tuesday, BJP industrial cell secretary C V Sajini who was speaking at the event at the time of the incident, filed a police complaint against the woman. Based on this, police registered an FIR against Athira under IPC Sections 447 (criminal trespass) and 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place). The police said Athira, a make-up artist, stays in a hostel near the temple. The case was transferred to women’s police station on Wednesday.“It was a closed-door programme and the woman barged in with abusive words. The participants pushing her out was a normal reaction. Police should probe the larger conspiracy behind the incident,” said Sajini.Based on Athira’s complaint on Thursday, police also registered a case against 29 people under IPC Sections 143, 147, 323, 294 b, 506 and 509 read with 149. “She said she was on her way to the bank when she happened to hear the speech which she alleged propagated lies.

PANAJI: While 2020 seems set to see a good cashew crop, it may not be a good year for mangoes. The blossoming of the cashew fruit, which takes place between November and January, has been on track this year, farmers said. With cashew beans having already started to sprout in some orchards, stakeholders anticipate a bountiful season this year.“The flowering process is complete and small green nuts have started appearing in their place. We are expecting a good cashew season this time, since the crop’s development looks very promising so far,” said Valpoi-based farmer and cashew processor Vinod Barve.However, there has been no flower bud initiation in the mango crop yet. The upcoming season looks bleak, farmers said. Agriculture experts attributed this to fluctuating weather parameters.“There needs to be a dry spell of 45-50 days after the rain,” said director of agriculture Madhav Kelkar. “Owing to the fact that there was continuous and erratic rain (last year), there may be delayed flowering of the mango crop.”Agriculture Technology Management Agency’s (ATMA) North Goa project director Dilip Paranjape said the mango crop has not received enough “water stress” this season.“The mango crop requires water stress. The season will be delayed as of now owing to the prolonged monsoon. However, if the monsoon further delays, the crop may get time to reach fruition and we may get a good mango produce,” he said.Principal scientist (horticulture), ICAR-CCARI, A R Desai, said that farmers will have to be patient and observe how the mango crop behaves. “The mango crop is very sensitive to weather parameter changes unlike cashew, hence the flowering is eccentric,” he said. “There are a lot of fluctuations in the weather due to global climatic changes.” He also said that the cashew crop will get farmers more income than the mango crop.",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73572885,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-551290,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/cashew-farmers-hopeful-for-2020-mango-farmers-see-bleak-year/articleshow/73563795.cms

New garbage dumps are developing in villages neighbouring Margao

MARGAO: Minister for waste management Michael Lobo on Thursday said that the garbage situation in the rural parts of South Goa was taking a turn for the worse with new garbage dumps developing in villages neighbouring Margao.

“I was in Margao for most part of the day, today, and I saw garbage dumps in Navelim, Rumdamol and Davorlim. These dumps need to be cleared at the earliest in the interest of the locals,” Lobo said in the presence of chief minister Pramod Sawant, while addressing the gathering at the inaugural function of Saras 2020 at Margao.

He added that a garbage treatment plant will soon come up at Verna industrial estate for which one lakh sq m of land has already been acquired. “The environment impact assessment is complete, and the South Goa collector will soon conduct a public hearing over the project. The facility will have capacity to treat 250 tonnes of waste per day and energy will be generated through this project,” Lobo said.

He urged people to support the project. “Do not get carried away by politicians trying to put spokes in the wheels of development,” Lobo said.

263,['24/01/2020'],MIDC keen to levy &amp; collect property tax in industrial areas under civic limits,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Two industrial estates of MIDC, Satpur and Ambad, are located in the limits of the NMC

NASHIK: The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation ( MIDC ) is keen to levy and collect property tax in industrial areas that falls under the jurisdiction of municipal corporations across the state and has written to the state government, seeking its nod.

Currently, the MIDC is levying and collecting 50% of the property tax and the remaining 50% is given to the respective gram panchayats. The MIDC had issued a circular in this regard in December last year following a government resolution (GR) issued in September 2019.

The MIDC wants the same model to be replicated for industries located in the limits of municipal corporations like Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ). MIDC CEO P Anbalagan, who was in Nashik on Wednesday, said at present such taxes are being levied and collected by the local civic bodies in rural areas.

“We are against recovery of property tax from industries by the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC). We want the property tax to be collected by the MIDC from industries in municipal corporation limits too,” Anbalagan said, adding they have already sent a proposal to the state government for approval.

Anbalagan was in the city for a meeting with industrial associations from five districts of Nashik division . Two industrial estates of MIDC, Satpur and Ambad, are located in the limits of the NMC.

The NMC collects the property tax from the industries in these two estates and in return provides road and look after maintenance of streetlights. But the agency wants more funds to create and maintain infrastructure in the industrial areas which could be garnered from collection of property taxes.

During a meeting, NIMA presidents Shashikant Jadhav had said that most of the roads in Satpur and Ambad MIDC areas have been handed over to the NMC for maintenance work. “Some roads in these two industrial areas are yet to be handed over to the NMC. Hence, the civic body is not developing these roads,” he said.

Anbalagan, however, refused handing over of roads to the NMC. “I am against handing over of roads to the NMC. We may give an NOC to the NMC for developing the roads in both the industrial estates,” he said.

New investment proposals in Nandurbar

Anbalagan on Wednesday said that two large industries have shown interests to invest around Rs 1,000 in Nandurbar. This will generate over 2,500 jobs. These industries are from textile and food processing sectors.

“Apart from Nandurbar, three other industries are also making investment over Rs 1,000 crore in Supa MIDC areas in Ahmednagar district. The land has already been given to these industries,” he said.

Trichy: The corporation has launched the beautification drive on Pudukottai road connecting the city with the airport. The median on the Trichy-Pudukottai NH-36 is being spruced up with flower-bearing plants and decorative trees.

Previously, Bharathidasan road was beautified in a similar way on a pilot basis. Following a positive response, the corporation proposed to beautify Pudukkottai road late in 2018.

The civic body reconstructed a portion of the centre median of the road passing through PWD office, Trichy SP office and Central prison at an outlay of Rs 34.4 lakh. The height of the median was increased to prevent criss-crossing of cattle and pedestrians. Four borewells on the 4km stretch to facilitate drip irrigation to water the decorative plants.

“The selection of road for the beautification project is a wise choice. With the presence of Trichy airport, a lot of international tourists use the Pudukkottai road. More such roads should be developed and maintained,” said N Manivannan, member of Trichy Intra-City Development Endeavours.

Based on suggestions from horticulture experts, flower-bearing plants that will not be consumed by cattle have been planted on the centre median. Foxtail palm trees, a decorative tree that grows for over 7 feet is also placed on the centre median of Pudukkottai road.

“We have completed 50% of the proposed beautification work. The remaining work shall be completed within a month. Permission from NHAI was obtained to beautify the stretch,” a corporation official said.

With TVS tollgate and Subramaniapuram being one of the gateways to access the city, officials said that workers have been appointed to periodically clean and water the green cover on the centre median.

Bareilly: Around 500 residents including family members of a youth, who was crushed to death when he accidentally fell on a cane carrier, staged a protest against sugar mill administration in Nighasan area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Friday. The protesters demanded compensation for the bereaved family from the mill.

Deceased, Monu Khan, a resident of Ghosiana village, had been working on contract at the sugar mill for two years. He accidentally fell on to the cane carrier and his neck got stuck into the slat conveyor chain resulting into his sudden death

The protest was called off after police filed an FIR against mill administration under IPC section 304A (causing death by negligence). Khan’s body was sent for an autopsy.

Monu is the second labourer to die while working in Lakhimpur Kheri this week. Earlier, a 22-year-old suffocated to death inside a juice tank of a sugar mill in Isanagar area on Sunday.

Mill owner Puneet Agarwal has also promised compensation to the aggrieved family.

Deepak Shukla, SHO of Nighasan police station, told TOI, “The protest was over after the FIR was registered against the manager of Tirupati Balaji Sugar Industries. Prima facie it looks like an accident. The victim was not wearing any safety gear which shows negligence on the part of mill administration.”

KOLKATA: Rupsa Mitra was in Class I when ‘3 Idiots’ was released. Years later, when Rupsa watched the film, she loved the character, Rancho, who was based on Sonam Wangchuk , innovator and Magsasay Award-winning environmentalist who lived in Ladakh. Little did she know that one day, she would follow in Rancho’s footsteps.Wangchuk, who has stopped ironing his clothes to save electricity and promote the planet, has inspired an entire school to emulate him. On Thursday, Rupsa, now in Class XI, was among the 1,800-odd girls at The BSS School who wore uniforms that were tidy but not ironed. “Our principal suggested we iron clothes one day less. When I told my parents about it, they were perplexed. After all, schools have for ages insisted that students should wear starched and ironed clothes. I had to explain to them that it would save electricity and was good for the planet,” the Arts student said.All students at the school, from Class I to XII, have been urged to adopt the practice. Class-X student Sneha Dey, who irons her clothes on Monday, Thursday and Saturday evenings, skipped doing so on Monday. “If the electricity I save helps light up even one home, it will make me happy,” she said.Principal Sunita Sen said a friend had drawn her attention to Wangchuk’s pledge on un-ironed clothes. “This is the 70th year of the school and we were looking for a pragmatic social initiative in which all students could participate without burdening their parents. The un-iron initiative is perfect,” she said.Calcutta Girls’ School principal Basanti Biswas also found the initiative heartening: “Something like this will lead to sensitisation of teachers, students and parents about energy conservation and environment.” Seema Sapru, principal of Heritage School , said she, too, felt inspired by Wangchuk’s movement and would, in fact, roll out the programme at the institute after the Boards exams were over. “I will encourage students not to iron twice a week,” she said.South City International School principal John Bagul extended his good wishes to The BSS but said it was difficult to implement it in a co-ed school as that could lead to boys turning up in crumpled clothes. “We are not yet ready for unpressed clothes,” said Bagul.Un-ironed uniform though does not mean shabby clothes. As fashion designer Rimi Nayak said, it actually translated to better care for one’s clothes. “Fold clothes with care after you wear them so that there is no awkward crease. Use hangers or fold properly and place them under the mattress. If someone decides to wash, the clothes can be straightened out and hung to dry,” she said.Wangchuk said smart crease was an indulgence one could do without to help the planet. “The power saved from ironing a person’s clothes can power four rural households,” he said. Environment activist Bonani Kakkar gave a thumbs up to the initiative. “Congratulations to the school. I hope many more schools would follow suit,” she said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73572855,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148422,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/following-in-wangchuks-footsteps-girls-at-city-school-forgo-ironing-to-save-power/articleshow/73563919.cms

AMARAVATI: The Andhra Pradesh cabinet is likely to meet on Monday to give its nod to the resolution proposing to abolish the legislative council . Later, a bill to this effect may be introduced in the state assembly.Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy on Thursday dropped enough indications on the government’s plans to do away with the bicameral system of legislature. A day after the legislative council referred the bills on three capital cities and abolition of AP Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA) to a select committee, Jagan, said, “It is high time we thought of the need of continuance of the legislative council, which has been creating obstacles to making of laws by members of the state assembly who are elected by people,” he told the assembly.Stating that the council chairman’s decision to refer important bills passed by the assembly to a select committee had pained him and many legislators, the CM pointed out it was not mandatory for states to have a legislative council as only six states in the country have the system.“The upper house was created through a law made by the assembly to give advice on key issues,” he said. “Surprisingly, the legislative council in the state has become a big impediment to implementing peoples’ agenda. People gave mandate to legislators elected by them to make laws in their interest. We need to give a serious thought on whether to continue the council if it continues to block bills passed by the assembly.”Jagan further said the present assembly has enough intellectuals including professors, doctors, engineers, IT professionals, journalists, farmers and actors. “We trust the council will really help us make better laws, but this council has shattered our trust,” he said.Targeting TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, he said the opposition leader in the assembly sat in the council gallery for hours together only to influence the chairman and breach rules. “The chairman clearly violated the rules by referring the bills to the select committee. He himself said it was against the rules. Still, he took the decision. It is like committing a murder despite knowing it is a crime,” Jagan fumed. He added that they would sit again on Monday and discuss the issue of continuing the council before taking a final call.In fact, several ministers have been talking about taking extreme measures including going for dissolution of the council. They have openly told council members to use their wisdom before trying to create hurdles to government business.The CM also requested assembly speaker Tammineni Sitaram to convene the House on Monday to discuss the issue. The assembly was originally scheduled to meet for three days, but the session was extended by a day on Thursday. On Jagan’s request, the speaker adjourned the assembly to Monday.Earlier, Jagan held discussions with former attorney general Mukul Rohatgi, who has been hired by the state government to defend the three capital cities case in the high court, and advocate general Sriram Subramanyam. He also summoned ministers and senior functionaries to the camp office and discussed the strategy to be adopted to take the issue forward.Earlier, the council was abolished in 1985. The then Channa Reddy government had passed a resolution to revive the legislative council in 1990 and sent it to Parliament for approval. Though the Rajya Sabha cleared the legislation authorising revival of the council, the legislation was stalled in the Lok Sabha due to its premature dissolution in 1991. In 2004, the YSR government passed another resolution on July 8 to revive the council, which finally happened in 2007.",amaravati,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73575743,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-409943,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/amaravati/jagan-hints-at-doing-away-with-ap-legislative-council/articleshow/73563909.cms

271,['24/01/2020'],Man gets seven-year jail term for raping minor,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Bareilly: A fast track court of additional sessions judge Shrikrishan Chandra Singh awarded seven years of imprisonment to one Sanjeev Kumar Gangwar after finding him guilty of raping a minor girl in 2009. District government counsel advocate Suneeti Pathak said, since the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 was not in existence at that time, the rapist was awarded only seven years of imprisonment under IPC section 376 (rape) of Indian penal code.

According to the FIR lodged at CB Ganj police station, on June 2, 2009, Gangwar had abducted the girl when she was 14 years old. At that time, he was in his early 20s. The girl’s family had approached police and an FIR was lodged on June 16, 2009 in the matter.

Later, police followed up a clue and on July 12, 2010, rescued her from CB Ganj area when Gangwar was waiting to catch a bus with the girl.

Suresh Babu Sahu, additional district government counsel, said after his arrest in 2010, Gangwar had managed to get bail and is now, out of jail.

“The court has order to cancel his bail. He has been awarded seven years in jail under IPC sections 363 (kidnapping), 366 (inducing woman to compel her marriage) and 376 (rape). He is also slapped with a fine of Rs 9,000,” Sahu added.

Bareilly: A man took his 18-year-old younger sister to a roadside cane field and allegedly shot at her. Thinking she was dead, he left her and fled from the spot. Police said that the girl’s brother was very upset after learning about her affair with a local youth.

The accused belongs to Budaun. On the pretext of visiting another sister, who is married and resides in Sambhal, the man took his younger sister - a BA first year student - on his motorcycle on Wednesday evening. As soon as they reached Behjoi, he stopped the motorcycle. He then shot at his sister and left her at the roadside field and fled. After regaining conscious, the girl somehow reached a road where a police response vehicle (PRV) on patrol spotted her. They took her to a hospital. Her condition is said to be critical.

The injured girl is from Aurchhi village under Faizganj Behata police station limits in Budaun district, the police said. “It was already dark and luckily our PRV team spotted the girl. She was bleeding profusely after being shot at. She was immediately taken to a community health centre at Behjoi from where doctors referred her to a higher medical facility. Her condition is critical,” SHO Behjoi inspector Ravindra Pratap Singh said.

The police added that upon reaching hospital, the girl narrated the entire incident. She told police, “I was going with my brother to visit our sister. He stopped the motorcycle saying that he needed to answer the nature’s call. Soon, he pulled out a pistol from his pocket and before I could realise what he was going to do, he shot at me. After a while I found myself lying on the field.”

The SHO also said that the girl’s brother was enraged after learning about her affair with a youth from their village. Since the girl continued to see the youth, he decided to kill her, the SHO said, adding, “We have registered an FIR under section 307 (attempt to murder) against the man, who is still absconding. Two teams have been formed to arrest him.”

MUMBAI: Several calendars that were printed by the state legislature that mentioned Devendra Fadnavis as the chief minister were removed from all offices of Mantralaya on Thursday.

These were 2019 calendars that had one additional page for January 2020, which works as a stop-gap arrangement till the government prints new calendars for Mantralaya, the state secretariat, in the new year.

As these were printed early in 2019, Fadnavis and other ministers of the time were mentioned along with their posts.

“We always give one additional page for the first month of the next year as it takes time for us to print calendars, and government holidays and leaves are marked for the first month of the new year in those calendars for the government staff to follow,” an official from Vidhan Bhavan said.

The calendars remained in use for nearly two months despite a regime change in late November. NCP MLA Jayant Patil said if the mention of the previous government was deliberate, then officials would be penalised.

Bareilly: Coming down heavily on rampant illegal constructions going on in the city, the Bareilly Development Authority (BDA) demolished unauthorised constructions of residential colonies in Bara Bypass, Izzatnagar and Bhojipura areas in the past three days.

BDA officials said despite notices to colonisers and builders, the construction work continued in these areas. Residential colonies spreading over 20,000 square metres and 18 bighas were being developed illegally in the Green Belt area, and hence, were demolished, said officials.

Speaking to TOI, BDA vice-chairperson Divya Mittal said, “The construction of residential colonies is rampant in the city, especially on the outskirts. We identified three unauthorised constructions taking place near Bara Bypass, Bhojipura and Izzatnagar areas and warned the colonisers and builders over illegal construction in the Green Belt area. We even served notices to the violators and sought their response, but to no avail. Thus, a crackdown was launched and illegal constructions were demolished during the past three days.”

BDA sources said a coloniser, Shamshuddin, had allegedly taken up the construction of a residential colony illegally after occupying around 20,000 square metres in the Green Belt area in Mudhiya Ahmed Nagar near Bara Bypass. Similarly, Bhupendra Kurmi and Vinod Kumar allegedly occupied 18 bighas for setting up a colony Maharaja Agrasen City in Izzatnagar area, while one Ghulam Sabir was allegedly constructing Aryan City in Saidpur area of Bhojipura illegally, said officials. Since all these constructions were taking place in the Green Belt area, they were demolished.

The police force from Izzatnagar and Bhojipura police stations assisted the BDA enforcement squads in carrying out the demolition drive without any hurdle, said officials.

In December, BDA had demolished as many as six residential constructions and sealed several others that had come up illegally in the Green Belt area in Mudhiya Ahed Nagar near Bara Bypass. The encroachers had occupied nearly 20 bighas for more than five years. Six structures were demolished while several others were sealed by BDA.

Bareilly: Suspended district Panchayati Raj officer (DPRO) Chandrika Prasad on Thursday met district magistrate (DM) Nitish Kumar to request that he be allowed to rejoin work, as the high court has quashed the government’s order, attaching him to headquarters. The DM asked Prasad to approach the government first, as the court order didn’t mention him. Prasad was suspended last month after he was held responsible of misappropriating public funds.

UP joint secretary Jogendra Prasad had issued the order on December 17, in which Prasad was attached to state headquarters in Lucknow, along with six other DPROs, all of whom were found guilty of misappropriating funds while releasing performance grants to village panchayats, in departmental inquiries.

The other suspended DPROs are Rajendra Prasad of Unnao, Radha Krishan Bharti of Sonbhadra, Amarjeet Singh of Bulandshahr, Arvind Kumar Singh of Lucknow, Shahnaz Ansari of Kasganj and Lalji Dubey of Pratapgarh.

On Thursday, at the meeting with the DM, Prasad argued that all six other suspended DPROs had been restored to their official positions following the HC order, but the DM was not swayed by this argument.

“I don’t follow what other DMs do. I’ll follow rules. In this case, Prasad can be allowed to join his office only after I receive such directions from the government, to whom the HC order is directed,” the DM said.

Notably, DPRO Prasad was booked for misappropriation of funds released by the Centre as “performance grants” for the betterment of self-sustaining village panchayats. The FIR was registered on November 23 at Barabanki district, where Prasad was posted before being transferred to Bareilly in September 2019.

Vigilance inspector Anil Yadav had registered the FIR against Prasad under sections 420 (cheating), 466 (forgery of record), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 166 (public servant disobeying law) of IPC, and the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The four-lane elevated corridor was planned from Sarda Circle in the heart of the city to Datta Mandir chowk a... Read More

NASHIK: The project to build a six-km long flyover at Sarda Circle to decongest the key junciton has hit a roadblock.

The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ), which was preparing the draft of the project, has conveyed its inability to do so due to financial constraints.

The four-lane elevated corridor was planned from Sarda Circle in the heart of the city to Datta Mandir chowk at Nashik Road at a cost of around Rs 1,000 crore.

The project would have reduced the regular traffic chaos at the busy Nashik Road, especially Dwarka chowk, which remains chock-a-block with vehicles daily during peak hours.

The Nashik unit of NHAI shot off a letter to the state public works department (national highway division) a few days back informing that they would not be able to undertake the project unless the Union ministry of road transport and highways provides funds for it.

It has requested the state PWD (NH division) to prepare the detailed project report (DPR). NHAI sources confirmed the developments and maintained that the agency was not in a position to implement it.

“The project is at a nascent stage as the DPR is yet to the prepared. So the other agency can implement the project,” added a NHAI official.

During his visit to the city in November 2016, Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari had announced that the flyover project would be undertaken by his ministry.

Nashik MP Hemant Godse had drawn Gadkari’s attention about the need to have a flyover to tackle the congestion in that stretch.

According to sources in the state PWD (NH division), the issue would be discussed with the senior authorities of the department. “The project entails huge cost. We would prepare the DPR if we get the nod from the department,” added PWD officials.

Initially, the state PWD (NH division) had started preparing the project DPR when it was planned but after Gadkari’s announcement, the Nashik unit of NHAI took over the responsibility of making the DPR.

Interestingly, the Nashik unit of NHAI had proposed to the headquarters in October last year to include the flyover project under the ministry’s ambitious Bharatmala project, a mammoth program for the highways sector that focuses on optimizing efficiency of freight and passenger movement across the country.

Godse claimed that he would pursue the matter both with Centre and the state government to ensure that the project sees the light of the day. “The project will be implemented even if the implementing agency gets altered. This flyover is essential to reduce the congestion at Dwarka circle and Nashik Road,” he added.

Godse said that since an elevated corridor is also planned at Nashik Road under the proposed Nashik Metro project, there is need for all agencies to have a meeting to see that both the flyover and the metro corridor at are planned properly.

Rampur: A day after taking possession of 104 bigha of land of Mohammad Ali Jauhar University, run by the Jauhar Trust, Rampur administration on Thursday launched the process of releasing “occupied land” to those farmers of Aliyaganj village who had registered 26 FIRs relating to land grab against MP and senior Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan. Six more farmers will take the possession of their land on Friday.

Rampur DM Aunjaneya Kumar told TOI that possession on 17 bighas of farmers’ land that lie on Jauhar University campus was given to 20 farmers on the spot after their names and land numbers were found in revenue records.

The land is not part of the 104 bigha that the administration took over on the directions of revenue board court in Prayagraj.

Meanwhile, Jauhar university vice-chancellor Sultan Mohammad Khan had condemned the action taken by the Rampur authorities and said they had violated the directions of the Allahabad high court order that without prior permission from varsity authorities, police and administrative officials shall not enter the campus

The 17 bigha of land was allegedly grabbed by Azam Khan for his university. In this connection, more than 26 FIRs had been lodged against Khan. Farmers had alleged that Azam had grabbed land with the help of former circle officer Alay Hasan Khan, who is on the run.

Earlier, Rampur district administration had also put up the names of Azam Khan and Alay Hasan Khan on the land mafia portal of the state government.

RAJKOT: Two accused in the Rs 91.5 lakh Limbdi angadia theft case in Surendranagar district were arrested from Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, respectively on Thursday.

One of the accused, Babusinh Tomar (30) was arrested from Fatehpur Sikri in UP, while the other, Devendrasinh Parmar (34), was nabbed from Dholpur in Rajasthan.

Earlier, Surendranagar local crime branch had arrested Udhamsinh Gurjar and Pradeepsinh Parmar, the key accused of the crime on December 25 last year.

Gurjar and Tomar had been following Ramesh Naran Angadia Firm employee, Pravin Patel, from the time the latter had boarded a bus to go to Rajkot from Ahmedabad ST bus depot on December 12 last year. The accused had plotted to steal Patel’s bag at Nandanvan Hotel on Limbdi National Highway, where the third accused, Devendrasinh, had already reached on a stolen bike.

“When Patel’s bus reached Nandanvan Hotel and he alighted along with other passengers for refreshments, Gurjar and Parmar allegedly stole his bag containing 2kg gold worth Rs76 lakh, two gold chains worth Rs10.50 lakh and Rs5 lakh in cash, and fled from the bus,” said Deepak Dhol, inspector with Surendranagar LCB.

Gurjar, who had been caught on a CCTV footage and identified, was arrested from Dholpur in Rajasthan, revealed Pradeepsinh’s name leading to his arrest. Pradeepsinh divulged the names of the other co-accused.

The other accused booked in the case include Santosh Gehlot, Pushkar Jat and Bijendrasinh Rajput. “We had formed three teams of cops and dispatched them to Fatehpur Sikri, Agra and Dholpur. We had obtained the addresses of Tomar and Devendrasinh. Hence, we nabbed them from their residences in Fatehpur Sikri and Dholpur,” said Dhol.

The police recovered 599 gram gold worth Rs 22.4 lakh from Tomar and Devendrasinh. From Gurjar and Pradeepsinh’s possession, cops had earlier recovered 1.265 kg gold worth Rs 48 lakh and Rs 1 lakh in cash.

HYDERABAD: While the Centre has made attempts to address the problem of rare diseases and even finalised a draft policy for rare diseases, experts say that the draft has completely missed out on covering the aspect of patient knowledge . In such cases, it is often the patient who may have more knowledge about the condition than doctors themselves.However, the policy in its current form fails to tap into this knowledge. Experts opine that the policy has been drafted based mostly on assumptions and does not address the real issues. It is estimated that around five to seven per cent of the population suffers from such diseases but there is no robust registry for such patients .“It does not address the crux of the problem which is to know who these patients are and where they are. They have not added the most important constituent to this conversation — patients advocates, patient groups and patients. It is a global practice to include patients while formulating a policy and it is more important in case of rare diseases. A patient is much more aware of his problem than anybody else, including the doctors and unless this knowledge is tapped, the policy will not serve the purpose,” said Syed Sanaullah, management committee member of the Indian Organisation of Rare Diseases (IORD), an umbrella organisation representing patients and patient groups for rare diseases.While the draft policy talks about having a national registry by ICMR and focussing on high-risk families (of known patients), there is no concrete attempt on identifying and diagnosing patients in a systematic manner. The focus needs to be on finding unknown patients.“It often takes years for a rare disease patient to be identified. Therefore to have a robust registry, an effort needs to be made in bringing about awareness among doctors, having a system where all patients are screened and creating some kind of a knowledge bank for reference when a doctor wants to cross check for a rare disease,” pointed out Dr Srinivas Namineni, a paediatrician who works with rare disease patients. He also said that the policy ignores the aspect of ‘orphan drugs’, which are useful to treat rare diseases but are not manufactured due to being unprofitable.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73576374,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-324908,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/policy-for-rare-diseases-on-anvil-but-fails-to-tap-into-patient-knowledge/articleshow/73563043.cms

Police said the accused, identified as Bakul Khuman, had called Nirav Joshi to see lions.

“As lion sighting has been made legal only in Sasan and Devalia of Talala taluka in Gir Somnath district and Ambardi Park in Dhari by the government, sighting the lions elsewhere becomes a crime.

Lashkar-e-Taiba operative, Abdul Karim Tunda

HYDERABAD: Fate of suspected Lashkar-e-Taiba operative, Abdul Karim Tunda (77), will be decided by Nampally court on February 4 , some six years after he was arrested for being a co-conspirator with a Pakistan national, Saleem Junaid.

Tunda was accused of being a bomb expert and declared an accused in the 1998 Saleem Junaid conspiracy module case registered by a special investigation team (SIT) of Central Crime Station (CCS). SIT officials arrested Tunda in October 2013, a few months after he was nabbed by central security agencies at the Indo-Nepal border. Prior to that, he allegedly resided in Pakistan for several years.

After conducting trial against Tunda, Nampally court on Wednesday decided to give its verdict on February 4. Tunda has been brought to Hyderabad after he was taken to different locations of the country, since he faces a bunch of criminal cases across India. Last week, he was shifted to Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh from Cherlapally jail, and he will be brought back to the city by Hyderabad police to produce him in the court on February 4.

Tunda is accused of training several youngsters to commit different terror activities in India by calling them to Pakistan and Bangladesh in the mid 1990s. One of these youngsters happened to be Pakistan national Saleem Junaid, who was nabbed in Hyderabad when he and few other members of the module were planning to commit terror strike during Ganesh festival in Hyderabad in 1998.

It was on the confession of Junaid, Hyderabad police then included Tunda, who was then a fugitive, among the 24 accused persons in the case for training Junaid and others in Bangladesh to commit offence in Hyderabad.

KOLKATA: State-run hospitals will soon start ante-natal checking for hepatitis B in order to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. This is one of the various measures that the state health department is taking up to combat hepatitis, in sync with the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) target to eliminate the virus by 2030.

“We are setting up ante-natal screening facilities for hepatitis B in all state-run hospitals across the state. This will help us take measures in case the woman is detected positive,” said a health department official on the sidelines of a dissemination meeting on hepatitis, organised by Liver Foundation West Bengal (LFWB) on Thursday.

“We need to spread awareness to every health worker so that they understand the disease burden. This will help tackle the hepatitis menace to a great extent,” said Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services.

Mysuru Bar Association members on Thursday abstained from court proceedings and staged a protest

MYSURU: A day after leader of the opposition Siddaramaiah made remarks about a section of Bar Association members that they behaved like hooligans during a recent general body meeting, the association members abstained from court proceedings on Thursday and demanded apology from him.

It has also suspended advocate Manjula Manasa who was also former chairperson of Karnataka Commission for Women, for making the bar proceedings public and turning it into a political issue.

Association president S Anandkumar on Thursday told reporters that Siddaramaiah’s statement has pained the members. He should immediately withdrew his remarks failing which a statewide protest will be launched, he said.

“Siddaramaiah while speaking to the press had claimed that a woman advocate was threatened during the meeting. It is totally untrue. No such incident has taken place,” he stated.

The Bar had decided not to represent the accused student in sedition case and it was a unanimous decision, Anandkumar added.

“Siddaramaiah today is not a member of the Bar Council or the Mysuru Bar Association . His comment on Bar members have hurt the fraternity and we demand his apology,” the president stated.

Meanwhile, Manjula Manasa, a member, who allegedly revealed the association’s proceedings in public and was along with former CM Siddaramaiah when he made his remarks about the Bar’s decision, has been suspended from membership with immediate effect.

HYDERABAD: With a call landing on ‘Dial 100’ about a group of senior citizens and youngsters being illegally confined at an old age home at Nagaram on Wednesday night, police rushed to the place and discovered that they were lodged there with the consent of family members. However, the squalid conditions at the place forced authorities to conduct a probe and they found out that the facility was operating illegally.

Police registered a case against management and family members of senior citizens. Preparations are on to shift all inmates to other rehabilitation centres under the supervision of revenue, women and child-welfare department officials.

On Wednesday, Keesara police received a call on the ‘Dial 100’ facility about people being illegally confined at Mamatha Old Age Home at Shilpanagar, Nagaram.

“Our team went there and found out that they were not kidnapped. Relatives of the inmates lodged them there by paying the organisers amounts ranging between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 per month. However, the conditions in the facility were pathetic. There is just one toilet for 73 people and there are no sufficient beds. Psychiatric patients are being chained at times,” Keesara inspector J Narender Goud said.

Police along with revenue, women and child welfare department officials conducted an inquiry into the allegations of running the facility illegally as a psychiatric rehabilitation centre with 73 inmates, including 22 women.

“The organisers, who were running the facility for the past three years, have permission to run an old age home. But they also started taking people suffering with psychiatric problems and those suffering from alcohol and smoking addiction, which is illegal. Based on the violations found, a case was registered under Sections 406,420,324,342 of IPC and Section 24 of Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 against the organisers and family members of the senior citizens,”the inspector said.

“The inmates will be shifted to other centres with proper medical care under the supervision of police, revenue and women and child welfare departments,” he added.

MYSURU: All faiths have a sole aim of uniting people irrespective of caste, creed, sex and colour, but unfortunately people these days are divided on religious lines, said Mohammed Kunhi, director of publishing house Shanthi Prakashana.

Delivering a special lecture at the religious meet organised on the third day of Suttur Fair on Thursday, Kunhi bemoaned that we are living in a polarized era.

“We should understand there is only one God for all faiths”, he added.

Renowned philosophers have pointed out in the past that world’s great civilizations were destroyed not by an external attack, but by internal squabbling and fight, he said.

“The bone of contention of all religions is over religious supremacy, but the aim of dharma is not to defeat people but to unite them. It never encourages anger and provocation among people,” he said.

In his address, Karnataka Sahitya Academy president B V Vasanthkumar advised Lingayats and Veerashaivas to stop fighting over the issue of religious status.

Hindus and Muslims must adopt the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Santa Shishunala Sharief, he added.

Shivarathri Shivayogi car festival

Thousands of devotees took part in the Shivarathri Shivayogi car festival organised as part of Suttur Jathra Mahtosav .

On Thursday, in a first, devotees pulled both the small and big chariots around the Mutt.

Following this, we will be issuing postcards from Manuu,” said Quadri.

To mark the occasion, Nalsar University will be organising a conference — Courts & The Constitution, 2019 in review — on January 25 and 26.

The conference aims to review the past, present and discuss the future of constitutionalism in India. “During the conference, various developments pertaining to courts and constitutions will be reviewed. It is an annual conference. This time, it is being conducted on the 70th Republic Day over its relevance with the day,” said a Nalsar student.

TRICHY: Re-carpeting work of the runway at Trichy international airport will begin in the first week of February during which time some flights will be rescheduled during the night, Airports Authority of India has said. Two more additional bays will also be established as part of development works, airport director K Gunasekaran told TOI.

While the runway work is estimated to cost Rs 20 crore, the additional bays will be established at a cost of Rs 1 crore. A Mumbai-based company has bagged both the contracts and Rs 19.85 crore has been sanctioned already, Gunasekaran said. The runway with a length of 2,423 metres and width of 45 metres is being re-carpeted with tar after ten years. This includes a 580-metre-long stretch made of concrete now. “Frequent landing and take-off of flights usually lead to exhaustion of runways. Natural weather phenomena like rain and sun also affect the runway surface which should be re-laid once in five years. So, re-carpeting is essential for the safety of flights as well as passengers”, Gunasekaran added.

“Re-carpeting activity on runway would lead to disruption of flight movements. To enable the work to be executed without any disruption, flight movements have been rescheduled. Flight operation has been suspended between 1 am and 8 am at the airport”, he further stated. Establishing of two more bays is also a major development work slated to begin in a few weeks. As of now, there are five bays at the airport but only two of them are connected to aprons. Hence to decongest passenger traffic, new bays are to come up with apron, Gunasekaran added.

295,['24/01/2020'],"BBMP says Bengaluru is ODF++, but urine-filled roads tell another story","The footpath on 11th Main in Malleswarm reeks of urine

TimesView It is only fair that BBMP impose the strictest penalties on people who urinate in public places. Especially, since most of them have access to toilets at home. But it’s also necessary to make sure public toilets are clean and well-maintained, and most importantly, functional. Bodily functions can’t always be controlled, but the fact that people urinate in the open is emblematic of the way we regard every deserted stretch, and sometimes even populated streets, as possible urinals. This attitude needs to change. In conjunction with building more toilets, a largescale campaign designed to discourage public urination would be necessary.

BENGALURU: Last week, BBMP declared Bengaluru Open Defecation Free (ODF)++ — which requires a city to be free from open urination among other things — and invited objections, if any, to the tag. Several Bengalureans, however, feel Palike officials should instead have taken a walk near Chickpet Metro Station to know where the city really stands.Puddles of urine pave the roads next to the station but people still manage to find space to relieve themselves. Not many can walk through these stretches — there’s no way you can avoid them if you have to go to City Market from the Metro station — without feeling nauseous.Sajjan Raj Mehta, a trade activist, said, “Chickpet is a busy market area with 15,000 shops and a daily floating population of over two lakh. But public toilets are very few. Lack of knowledge is another reason why people don’t use public loos as no signboards are put up anywhere.”Chickpet is no aberration. Such stretches dot the city. In Malleswaram, a 300-metre stretch on 11th Main is used by auto, cab and ambulance drivers to attend to nature’s call, notwithstanding that a pay-and-use toilet is only 200 metres away.“My house directly faces the spot. The issue has been brought up several times at ward committee meetings, but all the authorities do is assure us another toilet will be built soon. We are yet to see any progress,” said a member of Malleswaram resident welfare association.As per records, Bengaluru has 587 functional public toilets, including 418 pay-and-use facilities and 169 e-toilets. Another 102 pay-and-use toilets are not used.BBMP officials said they are working on ensuring people don’t urinate in public. Special commissioner Randeep D told TOI, “Currently, at some urinals, the public is charged Rs 5 or Rs 10, but we want to bring in a policy where urinals are free. One can actually see the closest toilet on Google. We also want to install signboards in a few areas. We will start restoring the 100-odd toilets that are currently dysfunctional.”It may be recalled that earlier this month Randeep had tweeted, “BBMP has imposed fines on those found urinating in public. As BBMP is keen to make Bengaluru Open Urination Free, request citizens to use Google Maps to find the nearest public toilet.”Police were earlier fining people urinating in the open. “We were asked not to impose penalties as a senior citizen raised objections saying that he was diabetic and that making him pay fine was tantamount to harassment,” a senior police officer said.Penalising those urinating in public is now the duty of BBMP health officers. There’s a proposal to increase the fine from Rs 100 to Rs 500 for a first-time offender and Rs 1,000 for subsequent offences.RWAs have lobbied with corporates to get public toilets built in their areas under CSR. But large tracts of Benglauru are still bereft of such facilities. “I have never seen a public loo in Whitefield...Lack of toilets has led to the present situation. We have e-toilets that have been installed under CSR,” said a Whitefield resident.Randeep said they need to double the number of toilets. “The challenge in coming up with more toilets is locating the correct site. If we find the right place, we don’t find sewage lines. It will take a couple of months to provide all the facilities from our end.”",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73567980,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-765414,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/bbmp-says-bluru-is-odf-but-urine-filled-roads-tell-another-story/articleshow/73561495.cms

Police seized 180 kilos of ganja worth Rs 21 lakh from the possession of the accused.

HYDERABAD: Mahabubnagar police on Thusday busted an international ganja peddling racket and arrested four persons who were transporting the contraband from Andhra Pradesh to Sri Lanka . Police seized 180 kilos of ganja worth Rs 21 lakh from the possession of the accused. The gang was using RFID tags to track the contraband during its transit across international waters.

The arrested were identified as P Satish from Madurai, K Kalyan from Hyderabad, M Ajith of Tamil Nadu ’s Theni and G Surendran of Chandrayangutta. Their associates — Sivaneswaran, Ramu, Murthy and Ram Reddy — are absconding. On January 4, a car driven by Sivaneswaran carrying 180 kilos of ganja stuffed in water proof packets, rammed into a parked lorry at Thatikonda on NH-44 near Bhootpur.

Ajith sitting in the front seat suffered severe injuries in the mishap while Sivaneswaran fled from the scene with the help of other accused in another car abandoning Ajith. The driver of the lorry noticed ganja in the car and informed the police.

During investigation, cops found out that Satish and Kalyan who have a history of ganja peddling were transporting the seized ganja from Sileru in Vishakapatnam to Madurai. Recently, Satish and Kalyan had started procuring ganja from Ramu and Murthy at Sileru for Rs 5000 a kilo and selling the same to Jayachandran of Rameshwaram for Rs 13,000 a kilo.

“From Rameshwaram area, the accused were transporting ganja to Sri Lanka through boats and selling the same in Sri Lanka for Rs 18,000 a kilo. The gang tags the contraband with RFID chips to track its movement over the sea,” Mahbubnagar SP Rema Rajeswari said.

On January 1, Satish came to Hyderabad and met Kalyan. They hired Surendran’s car to transport the contraband. On January 3, Satish, Sivaneswaran, Ajith, Kalyan and Surendran met in Bhadrachalam and went to Sileru. They purchased 180 kilos of ganja from Ramu and Murthy. Another accused Ram Reddy packed the contraband into two kilo packets and loaded in one car.

While Sivaneswaran and Ajith were travelling with the contraband, Satish, Kalyan and Surendran were piloting their vehicle in another car . After the accident, Sivaneswaran called Satish and informed him about the mishap. “Satish picked up Sivaneswaran and they fled from the scene abandoning Ajith and ganja,” the SP said. A special team formed by the SP arrested Satish, Kalyan and Surendran at Moosa Dhabha in Bhootpur on Thursday. Ajith is said to be out of danger.

KOLKATA: Thousands of students in the city are being ferried to and from schools precariously. A recent scrutiny by the transport department following the instruction of the transport minister Suvendu Adhikari has revealed that 837 buses of 153 schools in Kolkata, Salt Lake and New Town have no certificate of fitness (CF). All these buses will have to go off the roads, if they don’t undergo fitness tests within January 31.The unfit buses will be confiscated, according to a transport department official. “I will not allow unsafe ferrying of students,” Adhikari told TOI. A CF clearance is mandatory for all commercial vehicles. The transport department checks about 20 things, including road worthiness of tyres and brakes, before issuing the clearance.The scrutiny began after Adhikari had caught a school bus driver talking over phone near Fort William. The transport department officials summoned the driver and cancelled his licence. During the probe, the officials found a large number of school buses are plying illegally across the city and vulnerable to accidents any time.“We could have taken action immediately. But our minister cautioned us against causing any disruption for transportation of students. We have issued notice to the school bus owners, asking them to comply with the norms. If they don’t follow our instruction, we will take actions,” said an official.With a number of school buses not undergoing the CF tests, they have been prone to accidents. As per the Motor Vehicles Act, a vehicle must have a fitness certificate issued by the manufacturer while it also needs another fitness certificate from the state RTO authorities.However, the school buses not only ply without CF, but also have defaulted road tax. The government will earn Rs7.5 crore to regularise these vehicles. “We have already formed a team to crack down on the vehicles not complying with the CF regulations.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73573472,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-77229,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/837-school-buses-in-city-ply-without-fitness-certificates/articleshow/73563964.cms

Most of the class selected consulting as their preferred domain, with 26% of them going for it. Among the other key domains were operations (19%), sales (17%), marketing analytics (15%) and finance (12%). It has become one of the first management schools to conclude its final placements for 2019-20 academic year. Top 25% of the students have secured an average compensation of Rs 23.2 lakh a year and top 50% Rs 20.8 lakh per year. The highest offer rose up to Rs 29 lakh.

301,['24/01/2020'],Centre gives nod for common facility to help powerloom units,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Tirupur: The Centre on Wednesday gave the final approval to establish a common facility centre (CFC) to support powerloom units in Palladam and Somanur areas.

Powerloom unit owners said the facility would help them to produce value added weaving products rather than depend on master weavers every time. They found Palladam Powerloom Weavers Cluster Private Limited, a special purpose vehicle, to run the CFC.

The approval was granted at the 52nd steering committee meeting of the micro small enterprises-cluster development programme (MSE-CDP) conducted by the ministry of MSME in New Delhi on Wednesday.

The Rs 17.62-crore centre would come up at Kethanur, where the powerloom owners association had purchased four acres for the purpose. While the Centre would fund 67% of the cost, the state government and the powerloom units would bear 10% and 23% of the cost respectively.

More than two lakh powerloom units are functioning in Palladam and Somanur areas in Tirupur and Coimbatore districts. They undertake job works from master weavers.

“The powerloom units produce fabric from warp and weft supplied from master weavers. Around 10% of master weavers are from Erode, and the rest are from cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Jaipur and Kolkata,” said M Balasubramaniam, secretary of the Tirupur-Coimbatore districts’ powerloom owners association.

“As each powerloom unit could not separately set up facilities for sizing, bleaching, printing and stitching, they could not add value to the produced fabrics. But with the CFC, they would have such facilities and it would help them develop their own weaving products, both apparel and home textiles, and market them,” said Balasubramaniam, who was also managing director of Palladam Powerloom Weavers Cluster.

“We have planned to take at least 100 powerloom units on board, and so far, 54 have joined in the cluster. Nowadays, powerloom units are struggling to get regular orders and job works rates are also insufficient. With the CFC, the powerloom units would get wings to fly on their own,” he added.

302,['24/01/2020'],PAC pushes for extension of platform at railways station,"This story is from January 24, 2020

PAC members, led by chairman PK Krishnadas interacted with the passengers at Nashik Road railway station

NASHIK: The Passenger Amenities Committee ( PAC ) of the Indian Railways visited the Nashik Road railway station on Thursday and stressed on increasing the length of platform number 1 to accommodate longer trains.

Headed by chairman PK Krishnadas and members Rajendra Ashok Phadke, G. Premendar Reddy, Himadri Bal, Kaku Vijayalakshmi and C. Ravindran, the PAC held a dialogue with passengers and officials and tried to understand the issues they face, the services they want from Railways in general and from Nashik Road railway station in particular.

The PAC arrived at Nashik from Pune. According to Phadke, the PAC conducted an inspection of the station and the facilities offered by the railway administration. Later, they interacted with the passengers, sought their feedback and noted down their requests and grievances.

“The major demand of the passengers was accommodating the longer trains running long distances on home platform – PF 1 so that the passengers alighting the train can easily walk out of the station without having to take the staircase,” Phadke said.

At present, all the major trains coming from Mumbai arrive at PF 2 and those heading towards Mumbai arrive at PF 3. There are four platforms at the Nashik Road railway station.

“In either direction, passengers have to access the foot overbridge (FoB). This is a strenuous thing for women, patients and senior citizens and, hence, we have stressed for increasing the length of PF1,” he noted.

The committee has also demanded an escalator at platform 4 though the work for escalator on PF 2/3 is going on. “There is a ramp and there is staircase of PF 4. The elevator is being constructed. But the PF 4 can also be converted into home platform as the parking space outside has a direct access to the platform. If the escalator is constructed here and trains going to Mumbai are diverted to this platform it would be a major relief for the commuters,” he said.

The PAC also has suggested that the FOB connecting all four platforms should be constructed on Bhusawal-end of the station, facilitating the smooth movement of the passengers.

303,['24/01/2020'],Bengaluru: GoAir flight cancellations to continue this quarter,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representative image

BENGALURU: Cancellations on flights operated by GoAir will continue, and even increase, in the first quarter of 2020, the airline said on Thursday. Over the past few weeks, GoAir flights across routes have been cancelled due to staff crunch.

The airline had grounded several flights on the directions of Directorate General of Civil Aviation to replace the snag-prone Pratt & Whitney engines on its 13 A320 Neo fleet. Now, it has said pending delivery of aircraft will cause more cancellations and suspensions.

Several GoAir flights departing from or landing in Bengaluru have been cancelled over the past few weeks, while many scheduled for operations over the coming week have been cancelled in advance.

The cancelled flights include GoAir flight G8 403 from Bengaluru to Indore, G8 815/122 from Bengaluru to Kolkata via Hyderabad, G8 518 from Bengaluru to Hyderabad, G8 404 from Bengaluru to Kochi and G8 404 from Varanasi to Bengaluru.

“The change is due to issues beyond our control,” reads the cancellation message sent by the airline to several passengers, many of whom have been forced to spend more on last-minute bookings.

“In four weeks, we have gone through unplanned grounding of aircraft which were supporting our current fleet operations. And now, we have been informed by our business partners Airbus and Pratt & Whitney of their inability to deliver previously promised aircraft and engines by March 2020,” reads the statement issued by GoAir on Thursday.

“We have been forced to temporarily suspend certain flights that are part of our network...We have undertaken these suspensions as far ahead of time as possible in order to minimise inconvenience to customers...We expect — with the support of Airbus and Pratt & Whitney — to reinstate these flights and operate them at the earliest,” it adds.

MYSURU: Officials dragging their feet in taking action against land grabbers are likely to face suspension. This is the latest warning the department of revenue has issued as an initiative to safeguard all its properties from being encroached.

Until now officials didn’t have any accountability with regard to delay in reclaiming the encroached government properties. The Public Accounts Committee has taken a serious note of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India that has found considerable delay in reclaiming the encroached properties. Due to poor action by officers, properties worth crores of rupees belonging to government are lost. Even the wrongdoers are going scot-free.

The revenue department has dashed off a missive to the deputy commissioners of Karnataka, a copy of which is with TOI, asking the district heads to take necessary action in this connection. Deputy commissioner Abhiram G Sankar said that principal secretary of the revenue department has issued directions to look into all land encroachments by regularly reviewing the progress.

Hundreds of government properties including raja kaluve, lanes, tanks and water bodies, grazing land and gundu thopu (forested areas) have been encroached in Mysuru and in rest of Karnataka, said RTI activist BN Nagendra. Though officers are in the know, they are lackadaisical in taking action. Land grabbers are taking advantage of it to grab lands by creating fake documents. Nagendra said he has facilitated revenue and Mysuru Urban Development Authorities to identify a minimum of 50 such properties.

Principal secretary of the revenue department N Manjunath Prasad has directed deputy commissioners to take stern action against officers in case they don’t act on complaints and take necessary steps to protect government lands. The DCs have been asked to review the state of affairs in two weeks and initiate action against land grabbers. Time-bound action is a must on the part of officials and if any officers are found dragging their feet, action must be taken against them. Grabbing land using fake documents must be treated seriously. If there is suspicion on any officers helping any grabbers they should be immediately placed under suspension and inquiry must be initiated. Cases pending in court must be expedited. All government lands must be preserved by putting up a fence and a board. Most importantly, deputy commissioners must review such cases once a month, states the letter.

305,['24/01/2020'],Central govt a mute spectator to Bedi’s anarchic behaviour: CM,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Puducherry: The Union government remains a mute spectator to lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi ’s autocratic and anarchic behaviour, charged chief minister V Narayanasamy on Thursday.

Speaking at the birth anniversary celebrations of freedom fighter Netaji Subash Chandra Bose, Narayanasamy questioned whether Puducherry needs an ‘anarchic’ lieutenant governor with ‘anti-labour and anti-people policies’.

He questioned Bedi’s decision to order the closure of the government-run Anglo-French Textiles (AFT) when the council of ministers decided to extend voluntary retirement scheme to the 600-odd workers in the mill before taking a call on the closure.

“Who gave her the authority to order the closure of AFT when the general public, workers, elected members and the council of ministers decided to offer VRS to the workers? Do we need such an anarchic, anti-labour and anti-people lieutenant governor in Puducherry? We have been raising this question regularly and urging the Centre to recall her, but the Centre remains a mute spectator,” said Narayanasamy.

He pointed out that the decision on closing the mill was referred to the Centre and the President in April last year following a difference in opinion between the council of ministers and Kiran Bedi.

“In the meantime, she took the powers of the Centre and the President and forced the officials to issue orders for the closure of the mill. The status quo must be maintained until the President or the Centre takes a final call on its closure. The lieutenant governor has been posing obstacles to the government. We demand that the Centre recall her immediately,” he said.

Narayanasamy vowed that the government will not permit closure of the mill at any point of time. “The government is keen in running at least unit three in the mill,” he said.

The CM said offering VRS to the workers was one of the 38 demands of the government when all the ministers and elected members of the Congress and its ally DMK and leaders of its allies staged a sit-in protest under his leadership in front of Raj Nivas last year.

“We reached an agreement to form a committee to study the VRS option and when we sent the file seeking approval for constituting the committee later, the lieutenant governor retracted and decided to close the mill,” Narayanasamy charged.

He said Puducherry BJP president V Saminathan, who called on him along with representatives of trade unions, also endorsed the government’s decision to offer VRS to the workers and rejected Bedi’s move to close the unit.

Udhagamandalam: With a new deadline, a contract agreement with a private player has been renewed to set up a high-altitude sports training centre with synthetic track at the HADP open ground in the town.

Though the work was started in October 2016, the project has not been completed till now. As per the earlier agreement, Syncotts International, the private player, was supposed to complete the work by October 2017.

Nilgiris district sports officer S Jayachandran said a re-contract agreement with the contractor was established recently specifying the deadline for completion of the work by February 20.

In 2016, Rs 7.05 crore was sanctioned for converting the cinder track into synthetic. While a sum of Rs 5.05 crore was sanctioned by the ministry of youth affairs and sports, the rest Rs 2 crore was funded by the Hill Area Development Programme (HADP).

Jayachandran said, “As the contract with Syncotts lapsed, it was renewed with the condition that the synthetic track would be completed by February 20, 2020.” Work on football ground and synthetic track is almost over. Only erection of four floodlights is pending. “Soil test report has been obtained for erecting four floodlights,” he added.

The ground is going to be athletic cum football ground, while the football ground will be maintained as natural with grass. The synthetic athletic track will have six tacks with 400 meters distance as per international standard. The training centre will have facilities such as heat therapy and hydrotherapy for the trainees.

The HADP ground houses a sports hostel with a capacity of 60 beds. “As of now, 58 sports persons from various districts in Tamil Nadu are taking training. At present, the training is being held at the Ooty government arts college ground,” Jayachandran said.

The KMDA officials put up height barriers on both sides of the bride in the early hours of Thursday. The 45-year-old bridge connects Alipore with Kalighat over Tolly’s Nullah.

The KMDA engineers, who were alerted by the traffic control room about the incident, rushed to the spot and took stock of the damage.

Though it was a holiday, there was vehicular pressure on SP Mukherjee Road, Chetla Bridge and Durgapur Bridge due to the closure of the Kalighat Bridge.

Earlier, the bridge came under scanner for its poor health. The police and engineers, who were part of the height barrier installation, said that vehicles had to be diverted through other roads from 10pm on Wednesday to 5am on Thursday for the work.

BENGALURU: A 42-year-old sex worker recently found dead at her west Bengaluru residence was allegedly murdered by a customer who refused to heed her condition for safe sex. The woman had declined to return his money. Police said the customer, Mukunda HH, 48, a security guard in a private firm and resident of Veerasandra near Electronics City, was arrested on Wednesday and has confessed to the crime.

The woman, who was separated from her husband and lived with her minor son in Gayathrinagar near Rajajinagar, met Mukunda in Majestic around 1pm on January 11, when he was about to catch a bus to reach his village in KR Pet taluk, Mandya district. She demanded Rs 2,500 for a sexual favour and finally settled for Rs 1,500. She took Rs 500 as advance and they took a bus to Rajajinagar and an auto to reach her residence.

“Mukunda said he gave the woman an advance of Rs 500 in Majestic and paid another Rs 1,000 on reaching her house. She asked him to wear a condom for safe sex. But he declined and asked her to return his money. She refused and threatened to raise an alarm if he demanded the cash or tried to have sex with her without a condom,” police quoted Mukuknda as saying.

“He allegedly took out a knife from his bag and threatened to stab her if she didn’t return the money. In the heat of the moment, he stabbed her in the stomach and she began screaming for help. He then decided to eliminate her and slit her throat before fleeing the spot with her fake gold chain and two mobiles,” a police officer said.

The incident came to light around 3.45pm when the woman’s son returned home from school. Subramanyanagar police registered a case of murder. N Shashikumar, deputy commissioner of police (north), formed a team headed by inspector M Sadananda, which investigated the case from several angles, including monetary dispute, extra-marital affair and the woman’s troubled marriage, but made no headway initially.

“We spotted the killer with the woman in an auto after analysing footage from over 150 CCTV cameras. We also found her mobile was operational in Majestic a few hours before her death. We deployed plainclothesmen in Majestic, who traced Mukunda when he came to catch a bus to his village,” an officer said. Police produced him before a court and took him into custody.

310,['24/01/2020'],"8 yrs after getting son baptised, Gujarat Hindu mom faces FIR","This story is from January 24, 2020

AHMEDABAD: A single Hindu mother who had her son baptised at a local church in Anand almost eight years ago was on Wednesday booked under the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act for converting her child without the district collector's permission.

The police ostensibly acted on a petition filed with the Anand collectorate in 2013 by one Dharmendra Rathod, who runs an organisation called Forum for Peace and Justice. Rathod had challenged the then eight-year-old child's baptism on grounds of his mother not taking her estranged husband’s consent or applying for the district magistrate’s clearance before going ahead with the conversion.

""The inquiry had been pending for about six years. Anand district collector RG Gohil concluded it on January 3, 2020, and ordered the police to register an FIR in the case,"" Rathod said.

Collector Gohil told TOI that a Hindu parent getting her child baptised without official sanction was ""a gross violation of the Gujarat Freedom of Religion Act"". The purpose of the Act, promulgated in 2003, is to prohibit conversion from one religion to another ""by force, allurement or fraudulent means"".

According to rights activist Manjula Pradeep, the 42-year-old woman facing prosecution had visited a church on April 8, 2012, on her own and requested the Catholic priest there to arrange a baptism ceremony for her son. ""No child can choose his or her religion — he or she adopts the parents’ religion, like in this case. The child can convert on becoming an adult; so there is no ground for filing an FIR against the mother just because she got her child baptised,"" she said.

Petitioner Rathod claimed that since the child's father and mother were both Hindus, his conversion to Christianity was subject to both parents' consent and subsequent permission from the district magistrate. ""The child’s parents married in 2001 and divorced in 2008. After learning of his son's conversion, the father — a Hindu OBC from Uttar Pradesh — challenged it in a letter to the Union home ministry in 2013. The ministry directed the then chief secretary to look into the case, but no action was taken,"" he said.

The FIR against the mother has been registered under Sections 3 and 4 of the Act. Section 4 prescribes imprisonment for up to three years and a maximum fine of Rs 50,000 for any violation of the law.

PANAJI: The state government is likely to get forest clearance to cut over 1,500 tress to widen the national highway at Karmal Ghat at Canacona by March. The government will also take a final decision on the construction of the Porvorim six-lane stilt bridge by month-end.

PWD minister Deepak Prabhu Pauskar told TOI, “We will get forest clearance to cut over 1,500 trees at Karmal Ghat within two months for the expansion of the national highway.”

He added that the department has made a proposal to the forest department to plant three times the number of trees felled for the expansion at other locations. “Chief minister Pramod Sawant is also the forest minister and he is trying to get the forest clearance for the highway expansion,” he said.

“We will try to clear all hurdles blocking the expansion work,” he said.

On the six-lane stilt bridge from Pundalik Nagar to Socorro junction, Pauskar said the final decision will be made by the end of this month.

The PWD minister said that that the CM will hold a meeting with the contractor, Porvorim residents and others.

Some residents of Porvorim have gone to court over the bridge but have now agreed to withdraw the petition, he said. Others have asked Sawant to reduce the six-lane stilt from Pundalik Nagar to Socorro junction to a four-lane corridor on NH 66. “A decision will be taken at the end of this month and work will start from February,” he said.

He also said that residents of Porvorim want the height of the bridge between 6 to 6.5m, but we have decided to go with 6m.

Pauskar said that people must compromise for the development of the state as it is being done for their benefit. “We want roads to get better, we want tourism to increase. It is said that for the growth of any country, roads should be in good condition,” he said.

He said they were trying to create a hurdle for the bill despite knowing that they cannot prevent it from being passed. He asserted that the government was committed to transform right to education into right to english-medium education and is ready to walk the mile for its implementation.

As part of the initiative, the government is set to provide education kit to about 36.10 lakh children studying in government schools on June 1. The kit comprises text and note books, fabric for three-pairs of uniforms, shoes, socks, belt, school bag and tailoring charges. The kit would be handed over to the children at least a fortnight ahead of the reopening of the schools. Each kit costs Rs 1,355 and will cost the government an additional Rs 487 crore.

Jaganmohan Reddy stated that for decades several lakhs of children, particularly from SC, ST, BC and minority communities, have been waiting for English medium to be introduced in government schools as their parents could not afford private schools. English as medium of teaching is used in about 98.5% private schools while in only 35% of government-managed schools English is the medium of teaching; while 23.67% of the government schools are teaching in English at the primary level, he said.

“Children can learn fast and upgrade their skills if they are taught in English medium right from the primary level. Our intension is to provide better and quality education to the children from under-privileged sections,” said the chief minister.

COIMBATORE: The registrar of Tamil Nadu Lokayukta has forwarded a petition to the vigilance commission seeking to conduct a preliminary inquiry against the Sulur police inspector for owning assets disproportionate to his known source of income.

The petition was sent by M Kandasamy, 52, who owns a power loom unit at Kalivelampatti near Palladam in Tirupur district, a few weeks ago.

The petition was sent to the chairperson of Tamil Nadu Lokayukta, Chennai, detailing the allegations against Sulur police inspector R Thangaraj.

In his complaint, Kandasamy alleged that Thangaraj had bought eight cents of land worth Rs 25 lakh at Irugur near the city on March 2017.

After obtaining permission from the Irugur town panchayat, Thangaraj had constructed a house on the land in a build-up area of 4,000 sq ft at a cost of Rs 2 crore, the petition said. But Thangaraj did not inform the government about his new house.

In 2019, Thangaraj bought a site worth Rs 25 lakh at Kollupalayam near Kaniyur, Kandasamy said.

The petitioner also attached documents showing that the land at Irugur was registered in the name of inspector’s wife at Singanallur sub-registrar office. He has also attached the building plan approval issued for the new house.

A copy of the land document registered at Sulur sub-registrar office for land at Kollupalayam was also attached. He has also attached an RTI reply given by the office of the superintendent of police, Tirupur, for not getting any prior permission to buy lands in 2017 at Irugur.

“Thangaraj had involved in purchasing assets worth Rs 4 crore in the last three years. So, I had sent the complaint to the Tamil Nadu Lokayukta to take stringent action him,” said Kandasamy.

When contacted, Thangaraj was not available for comments.

Following the complaint, S Pandian, registrar /district judge (retired), Tamil Nadu Lokayukta, Chepauk, Chennai, had sent a replay to Kandasamy informing that his complaint has been registered as Lokayukta C No 1/2020 and the same has been forwarded to the vigilance commission, secretariat, Fort St George, Chennai, for conducting preliminary inquiry under section 19 (1) of the Tamil Nadu Lokayukta Act, 2018.

“After the Tamil Nadu Lokayukta chairperson and members instructed the vigilance to conduct preliminary inquiry, I am getting threat calls from police officials,” Kandasamy said.

Nirmala Sitharaman

TRICHY: A group of farmers from the delta districts met Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Chennai and submitted a charter of demands to be addressed in the Union Budget, including enhancing the percentage of crop loan given by nationalized banks.

The farmers said the Union government had directed all nationalized banks to hike interest rates on agriculture jewel loan to 9.90% from 7% at a time when they are struggling to earn through farming. The government also stopped prompt payment of loan incentive to farmers. The Centre should at least enhance the percentage of loan given to farmers for agriculture and allied agriculture activities to 30% from the existing 18%, the memorandum said.

Another long-pending demand of the farming community is the implementation of the M S Swaminathan committee recommendations to fix reasonable price for their produce, which is 50% over and above the actual cost of production.

The ever-increasing input and labour costs are forcing farmers to ponder whether they should continue cultivation. In such a scenario, they are not allowed to fix a reasonable price for the produce on their own. So, till farmers get a reasonable price for their produce as per the recommendations, entire crop loan taken by farmers from nationalized banks should be waived off, the memorandum added.

The farmers also said that agricultural scientist Subhash Palekar’s zero budget natural farming should be made as a farmers’ movement. His concept should be taken to each and every farmer across the country. For that, the government should undertake his mission and the same should be included and announced in the forthcoming budget.

A delegation of farmers including secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association, Swamimalai S Vimalnathan, Thanjavur met the finance minister.

PORVORIM: The state assembly’s budget committee met on Thursday to review budgetary allocation and utilisation of funds earmarked in the 2019-20 state budget only to find that the information was not available, said committee chairman Vijai Sardesai.

Sardesai, who is the Goa Forward Party president and former deputy chief minister, said that officials from the finance department who attended the meeting were ill-prepared. Sardesai has asked the government to collate the data and present it at the next budget committee meeting on February 5.

“We have come to know that a meeting of the budget committee never has been held. The government officers who came said that they are tied up with the15th finance commission and therefore don’t have the information,” he said.

There are seven MLAs on the budget committee; Joshua D’Souza, Alexio Reginaldo Lourenco, Francis Silveira, Pravin Zantye, Atanasio Monserrate and Clafasio Dias.

Interestingly, BJP MLA for Mapusa Joshua D’Souza agreed and said that he was surprised over the lack of preparation. “This is the first time the committee has met and the review is taking place. I was quite surprised at this,” D’Souza said.

The committee grilled the government officers on the budgetary allocation made to all departments, utilisation of the allocated funds, re-appropriation of sanctioned funds and whether the government was taking loans to pay salaries.

When reporters asked Sardesai if he received answers, the Fatorda MLA said, “The finance department’s officer came completely unprepared.”

“Is there any sanction that is pending which has already been approved in the budget because finance sends files back saying there are no funds. If funds were earmarked for a particular purpose then where is the question of rejecting it saying there are no funds?” said Sardesai.

BJP MLA Joshua D’Souza said that at least two major projects, the bus terminus and the bridge over river Tar in Mapusa are stuck for want of financial approval. Sardesai said that several projects in his constituency have also been stalled due to lack of funds.

“We have asked for the expenditure details on social schemes such as Laadli Laxmi and whether there is any pendency in these schemes and if there is a deficit. We have asked for details of all the big-ticket projects in North and South Goa to see if contractors are being paid on time. These are questions that are put to the government,” said Sardesai.

D’Souza agreed with Sardesai’s concerns. “He raised some valid points. Ultimately it is for the people. The secretaries and officials have to give a response to his queries,” said the Mapusa MLA.

PANAJI: Helmetless two-wheeler riders qualified as some of the highest traffic violations in the last quarter of 2019. Figures shared by the state transport department revealed that there were 64,616 violations detected from October to December, last year.This is a nearly 30% decrease from the number of violations in the same quarter last year. In the same period in 2018, there were a total of 84,787 violations recorded by the transport department for helmetless riding.However, compared to 2017, there is a 21% increase in violations (see infographic) owing to the fact that there were far lesser helmetless riders caught breaking the rules, that year.Road accident data compiled by the state for the last quarter of 2019 revealed that a total of 48 people have lost their lives in fatal accidents in October and November. Of these, 35 people that were killed were two-wheeler riders and three people were helmetless pillion riders. The statistics for December are yet to be compiled by the state transport department.“The overall licensing process of two-wheelers must be made stricter compared to four-wheeler licenses. The driving licenses of those caught riding helmetless should be suspended, and a strict penalty must be imposed to deter motorists from violating traffic rules,” said road safety activist Dilip Naik.He said that the negligence of two-wheeler riders lead to road fatalities— costing not just the riders’ lives, but “also risks the lives of the pillion rider.”",goa,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73569152,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-473769,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/over-64k-helmetless-riders-booked-from-oct-to-dec/articleshow/73564000.cms

Coimbatore: A city businessman, along with his team, has succeeded in creating a record by driving an electric vehicle to an altitude of 5,731m at Sawula Pass in the Himalayan range in western Tibet. He has broken the previous record of 5,715.28m created by a Chinese man in 2018.

N Suresh Kumar, 40, who also conducts expeditions to the Himalayas, was roped-in to perform the feat for an automobile company through his friend.

Suresh said the feat was achieved after an effort of eight days and amid harsh weather conditions of around -35°C, heavy snow and an unfriendly terrain.

“We started on January 1 from Kathmandu in Nepal. That afternoon, the notary of the Guinness Records sealed our altimeter so that we don’t tamper with it,” he said. This proved to be a challenge as they had to carry 22 power banks to power the altimeter in the cold, as they cannot open the seal to change it to battery mode.

The next seven days formed the core of the feat, said Suresh. On the fourth day, his team, which consisted of a Nepali and three Tibetans along with him, was sent back by Tibetan police at Keyrong, a valley, as there was a heavy snow fall and five to six feet of snow had covered the ground. Only on the next day afternoon, they were permitted to pass.

On January 7, they first attempted the record from a place called Saga to Sawula Pass in the Himalayan Range in Tibet. “We reached 5,682m, around 100m before the target, but turned back due to heavy snow fall. If I had travelled another 100m, we would have reached our target on January 7,” he said.

“On the route back, we stayed at a village, and requested the village head to employ a JCB vehicle to clear the snow. But as the snow was being cleared, wind brought it back to the track,” he said.

On January 8, they reached the summit at an altitude of 5,731m at Sawula Pass in their Hyundai Kona Electric Car by 3.15pm (Beijing time).

Mumbai/Pune: Five persons — two from Pune and three from Mumbai — have been put under surveillance in the past 48 hours after they landed at Mumbai airport from China to ensure that they have not been infected with the novel coronavirus.

Two of the three Mumbai residents, exhibiting mild cough and cold symptoms, were admitted to Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli late on Thursday as a precautionary measure, said an official.

The three Mumbai residents are of Jogeshwari, Kalyan and Nalasopara. “Since the passengers from Kalyan and Nalasopara have shown signs of mild cold and cough, we have asked them to come and get admitted to Kasturba Hospital so that we can run some checks and rule out any infection,” said BMC executive health officer Dr Padmaja Keskar.

State epidemiologist Dr Pradeep Awate said they had exhibited no specific coronavirus symptoms. Two of the five passengers had been to Wuhan, the epicentre of the novel coronavirus outbreak. “Those two passengers are also currently asymptomatic like the other three, who had been to other parts of China,” said Awate.

Sources said the Nalasopara traveller had stayed in Foshan city — almost 1,000km south from Wuhan — for six days. The person left China on January 21 and arrived at Mumbai airport at 4am on Wednesday. The local health officer said the woman complained of body ache and cold when the health department officials contacted her. “We referred her to Kasturba for the physician’s opinion,” said the official.

The Kalyan resident was in Guangzhou, also almost 1,000km south of Wuhan, for six days from January 16. “He had cold and cough. A complete blood count test showed normal results,” said an official.

The state health department officials have decided to follow up with the five passengers for 28 days.

A total of 1,323 passengers returning from China and other affected countries have so far been screened at the Mumbai airport since January 18.

PUNE: The Yerawada Bridge that connects Koregaon Park area to Ahmednagar Road needs urgent repairs. But, the Pune Municipal Corporation and the traffic branch of the Pune police have been unable to reach a consensus over closing of the bridge for maintenance and improvement works and re-routing of traffic.A structural audit of the 40-year-old bridge, popularly known as Bund Garden Bridge, conducted by Dhole-Patil Road based Subduction Zone Consultants has listed 15 major and minor works that need to be undertaken for safety.The civic authority first sought permission to close the bridge for traffic for one month late last year. However, the traffic department refused permission citing metro work in the surrounding areas and a heavy flow of traffic.Both entities are locked in a debate with no consensus on road closure and diversions to make way for the maintenance works.The Yerawada and Koregaon Park traffic divisions are reluctant to stop vehicular movement on the bridge and impose any diversions. The divisions have put the onus of a decision in the matter on the deputy commissioner of police (traffic) office.Officials from both traffic divisions opined that closing the bridge for traffic and imposing diversions would lead to chaos.“We estimate traffic jams up to 3km on either side of the bridge along Ahmednagar Road if diversions are not made. We have experimented routing the traffic to the Airport Road through Shastrinagar junction and even closing one flank of the Yerawada bridge, but both have led to chaos,” officials from the Yerawada traffic division said.On the proposal to turn the one-way on Babasaheb Ambedkar bridge into a two-way for the duration of the maintenance works, officials from both divisions said all the adjoining areas including Bund Garden Road (up to the RTO junction), Koregaon Park Road (up to Rajendra Sinhji Institute), Kalyaninagar, Deccan College Road and Ahmednagar Road would be badly affected.The traffic divisions have also expressed concern over what the civic body would do about the potable water pipeline running under the median of the Yerawada bridge. They also had reservations about the possible delays in completion of the maintenance.“We have written to the PMC about works that need to be undertaken before the bridge’s maintenance. If we have to close each flank of the bridge for 15 days, some works need to be undertaken to ensure smooth flow of traffic and safety of motorists. This includes removal of traffic islands, removal of encroachments, installation of railings on footpaths and installation of sign boards. Managing traffic may be possible only after these are completed,” Yerawada division officials said.Deputy mayor Siddharth Dhende said, “The bridge is dangerous and repairs are needed. The joints along the bridge have to be replaced as it could lead to a disaster if left unattended. Other works include resurfacing, repairs to railings and footpaths. The water pipeline will be left untouched during the work.”According to Dhende, a meeting with officials from the traffic department has been scheduled for Friday.

PUNE: A pickpocket stole a 43-year-old bank employee’s contactless debit and credit cards on Tuesday and went on a shopping spree.

The crook was savvy enough to know that contactless card transactions under Rs 2,000 don’t require a personal identification number (PIN), and spent Rs 41,551 at various places before the man got the cards blocked.

According to the complaint, the bank employee was travelling in a Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) bus, when the pickpocket pinched his wallet containing all the cards. Within five hours, the complaint stated, the suspect used the cards at different food outlets and clothing stores.

The complainant, a resident of Shevalewadi, has lodged a first information report (FIR) with the Bund Garden police.

Rupesh Pisal of the Bund Garden police, who is investigating the complaint, said the incident occurred when the complainant was commuting between Pune railway station and Pimpri at 8am.

At 8.23am, the complainant received an SMS alert that Rs2,000 was spent on his debit card at a food joint. Some time later, the card was used at a dairy outlet near the station. When he started getting a stream of messages, the complainant realized his cards were stolen. “By the time he got around to blocking the cards, the suspect had already spent Rs41,551,” Pisal said.

Around Rs14,000 was spent using the complainant’s debit card, while the rest was spent using his credit card. “We have yet to get details of the credit card transactions,” Pisal said.

‘Contactless payment’ is a new technology that allows a card holder to simply tap the card on the point of sale machine to pay. Contactless cards sport a little ‘Wi-Fi’ symbol on them. They are embedded with chips that make use of the ‘Near Field Communication’ technology. One PoS machine can only read one card at a time, and the card needs to be within 4cm of the machine.

Amaravati: Deputy chief minister Pilli Subhash Chandrabose and marketing minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana will be out of the cabinet once the legislative council is abolished. CM Jaganmohan Reddy had inducted them into the cabinet from the council. While the term of Subhash Chandra Bose is coming to an end in 2021 March, Venkata Ramana has term till 2023.

Although, there is no immediate threat to their job in the cabinet, once the Parliament clears the bill they have to quit the posts within six months after President gives assent. Curiously, Subhash Chandrabose himself requested the CM on Thursday to abolish the council on Thursday.

Meanwhile, TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh who is an MLC has term till 2023. Former minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, who played key role in TDP gaining upper-hand in the council has term till 2025. While nine members from YSRC would lose the posts, TDP would be the biggest victim as all of its 34 members would lose job in case the council were to be abolished. In fact, 16 members would retire in 2021 that would have given Jaganmohan Reddy a chance to gain majority in the council.

Data showed 40-45% decrease in bookings from Mumbai to China in January after the coronavirus outbreak as compared to the December travel figures.Several Puneites plan trips to China from Mumbai, which has direct flight connections to the country.Travel companies claimed that almost all their clients booked for China were calling them up to ask if they should cancel their upcoming trips to the country. Vikas Agarwal, the director of VT Travel, told TOI that four passengers who had booked air tickets to the US with a transit stop at Shanghai, China, cancelled the entire booking on Wednesday fearing issues in clearing immigration upon reaching the US.“The US has begun screening travellers from China for the new virus and my clients were worried about facing problems while clearing immigration in the US if they touched down in China during the journey. They made a fresh booking to the US with an airline with a transit stop in Dubai,” said Agarwal.He said his clients had to bear an additional cost of Rs50,000 for cancelling the earlier booking, and another Rs1 lakh for fresh and closer-to-travel-date booking.Balu Ramachandran, senior VP, Cleartrip, told TOI, “We have started to see some signs of travellers refraining from booking to China after the virus outbreak and the subsequent travel advisory.

PUNE: The utter neglect of a monument as iconic as Shaniwarwada has upset not only the descendants of the Peshwas but also history scholars in the city.Udaysinh Peshwa, one of the descendants, said the palace of his ancestors has fallen into disrepair. “I had written to the previous chief minister, but nothing has been done. Hence, I have decided not to write to anyone or speak with anyone seeking restoration. Maharashtrians have forgotten their own history,” he added.The iconic fort that was home to several Peshwes who challenged the Mughals and later the British, celebrated its 288th foundation day on Wednesday.Uday Kulkarni, author of The Era of Bajirao, tweeted to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and member of Parliament from Pune, Girish Bapat on Thursday, saying that the 18th century Ganapati painting just inside the Delhi Darwaza of Shaniwarwada is on the verge of disappearing.Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray , when told about the plight of Shaniwarwada, said, “I am coming to Pune soon. I will be reviewing all tourism related places. Once the review is done, we will see what the government can do to revamp tourist facilities.”Kundan Kumar Sathe, secretary of Thorale Bajirao Peshwa Pratishthan, said Shaniwarwada was seven floors high and it took the British seven days to burn the entire structure down.“Imagine the grandeur of the palace and think about what it has come to now. We have been sending letters to all state ministers for the restoration of the monument but nobody has done anything so far. The government needs to tell the Archaeological Survey of India to restore Shaniwarwada,” he added.Kulkarni said a lot of Maratha art history that is on the walls of old wadas is being destroyed due to neglect. “Shaniwarwada is a Grade I heritage structure as declared by the ASI. We have so much history, so much to preserve and showcase to the world, yet we do nothing about it,” he added.Several letters to the administration urging them to write to the ASI in Delhi to allocate funds for the restoration of these monuments have been written, he said.“Once all this is gone, an entire part of our rich history will be lost to future generations. Some people say painting over the old one will destroy the authenticity of the original. But if we do not restore it, we are losing it all. Hence, restoration is better,” Kulkarni said.An Archaeological Survey of India official, on the condition of anonymity, said funds are scarce for restoration. “We get money only for maintenance and not for restoration. If such funding is allocated from the headquarters, then we can take up restoration,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73568721,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1135035,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/shaniwarwada-requires-upkeep-aaditya-to-visit/articleshow/73564034.cms

The civic body undertakes anti-encroachment drive along the Dutt Mandir Road in Wakad on Thursday

PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A drive was conducted by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) to remove encroachments along Dutt Mandir Road in Wakad on Thursday.

However, the civic body’s action did not go down well with the local residents who dubbed the drive as “farce”.

Speaking to TOI, Sudesh Raje, president, Pimpri Chinchwad Housing Societies Federation, said, “Only two JCBs were used to remove hoardings and other minor structures on the civic land. The PCMC did not take any action to acquire the land which is in its possession for road widening. This shows that today’s demolition drive was just a farce ”

Another resident, Avinash Takte Patil, said, “The demolition drive was not conducted against the unauthorised stalls at the chowpatty near Ambedkar colony along Dutt Mandir Road.”

The 2km-long Dutt Mandir Road extends from near Dange chowk on Sangvi-Kiwale BRTS Road to Wakad municipal school chowk on Nashik phata-Wakad BRTS Road.

Though the development plan mentions the width of the road as 45 metres, its breadth is just half in reality. Around 10 to 20 housing societies and various commercial complexes are located along this main road in Wakad due to which there is heavy movement of traffic.

Many stalls have come up along the road on open land. As vehicles are parked on the road most of the time, they cause obstacles to free flow of traffic. So, there are long traffic snarls during peak morning and evening hours.

Shirish Poredi, spokesperson, engineering department, PCMC, said, “Farmers had sold their land to builders, who while getting permission for construction of residential and commercial projects, had handed over the land to the civic body and received transfer of development of rights (TDR) in lieu. Encroachments had taken place on the land handed over to the PCMC which were removed during the demolition drive.”

Satish Ingale, executive engineer, building permission and unauthorised construction control department, said, “Action was taken on a 20,588 sqft area along Dutt Mandir Road. Four tin sheds, 12 ottas (platforms), 3 stalls, 1 gate, 1 staircase, 25 boards and 8 compound walls were removed in the daylong drive. Police personnel, and civic employees participated in the drive.”

PUNE: The 21-year-old college student arrested on the charge of assaulting a casual worker in Dhanori was sent in police custody till February 1 on Thursday, while six teenage boys detained in the case were sent to observation home.

The alleged assault took place at Munjaba Vasti in Dhanori shortly after midnight on Tuesday, following which the casual worker, Sagar Mahadev Bhalerao (24), succumbed to his head injuries at the Sassoon General Hospital.

Senior inspector Arun Avhad of Vishrantwadi police station told TOI, “After studying their age documents on Thursday, the teenagers were produced before the juvenile justice board, which sent them to the observation home. Jagdale was produced before a city court, which remanded him in police custody till February 1.”

As per the Vishrantwadi police, the college student and the teenagers assaulted Bhalerao, a resident of Munjaba Vasti in Dhanori, while he was walking to his house. “Bhalerao allegedly abused Pritam Rajkumar Jagdale, the college student, for riding his motorcycle close to him and also threatened him,” police said.

One of the detained teenagers was riding with Jagdale at the time of the assault. Infuriated over the way Bhalerao reacted, Jagdale challenged him and told him to meet him at the nearby chowk. On the way to the chowk, Jagdale and his minor associate phoned the other boys, who gathered at the chowk. As soon as Bhalerao reached there, they launched a brutal assault on him. One of the assailants attacked Bhalerao with a bicycle chain, another hit him with a stick while the others rained kicks and blows, the police said.

Senior inspector Avhad said the police would search for the weapons used in the crime, including the bicycle chain and wooden sticks.

Later in the morning, police detained the boys and arrested Jagdale. “Further investigation is under way, the police added.

329,['24/01/2020'],Tribal activists demand more Navodaya schools in state,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Visakhapatnam: Despite being a hotbed of Maoist violence, Andhra Pradesh has the lowest number of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya schools in the country, rue tribal activists.

According to tribal activists in the state, there is dire need for more Navodaya schools in Agency areas that have been affected by Maoist activity for years. They say that repeated pleas to authorities to set up more such schools have gone unheard.

Tribal activist G Ram Gopal said that Andhra Pradesh has only 13 Navodaya schools. A proposal to set up a Navodaya Vidyalaya in Visakhapatnam Agency was rejected recently, he said.

“We still do not know why the proposal was rejected. The land has been made available,” he added. Gopal informed that the number of Navodaya schools in the state is lower than that in Odisha and Madhya Pradesh. He blames the state leadership for being unable to promote quality schooling in areas that have suffered due to Left-wing extremism.

Meanwhile, according to a letter from Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (of the Union MHRD department), the proposal was rejected because two Navodaya schools cannot be set up in the same district.

In the letter to the assistant commissioner, authorities of the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti pointed out that there is already a Navodaya school which has been running since 1987-88.

Tribal leaders argue that the case for a separate such school in the Maoist-affected areas was not made properly. Officials of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) said that on their part, they had identified 30 acres land in Chintapalli.

They said that they could only facilitate land and infrastructure only after the school is sanctioned and pointed out that their role is limited to providing infrastructure.

Now, tribal leaders have approached MPs from Araku and Visakhapatnam to take up the issue.

Pimpri Chinchwad: The standing committee has directed the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation to revise education committee’s seven “vague” proposals before sending them for approval again.

Vilas Madigeri, chairman of the PCMC standing committee, said, “These proposals are vague. They lack the number of students who will benefit and the cost of material like tablets. Besides, the tender process has not been completed so we do not know the cost at which the material is to be procured.”

One of the proposals had sought standing committee’s approval for providing tablets to Std V-VIII students of 12 schools for improving their educational quality. “Other proposals include creating e-classrooms, distributing scouts and guides’ uniforms, jackets and copper water bottles to civic school students, besides providing them one egg and one fruit in the mid-day meal scheme and introducing a pilot project in primary schools for teaching classical music,” he added.

Manisha Pawar, chairperson, PCMC education committee, said, “The proposals aimed at providing best of education material to civic school students.”

Vitthal alias Nana Kate, opposition leader, PCMC, said, “Such proposals must be approved at the beginning of the fiscal to ensure smooth roll out of the scheme. But the civic administration and the ruling party lack proper planning.”

Maruti Bhapkar, social activist said, “The education committee should have sent these proposals and got them approved at the beginning of the current fiscal or academic year.”

PUNE: A 50-year-old drifter, known to many residents and business persons on Prabhat Road and Deccan area as ‘John Baba’, was found brutally assaulted and injured on the Riverbed Road early on Thursday morning.

Senior inspector Deepak Lagad of the Deccan Gymkhana police station told TOI, “John Baba is from an educated family. Nevertheless, for unknown reasons, he started staying on the pavements and worked as a waiter at prominent restaurants in the area. Later, he gave up the job and started begging. He is a graduate and would often converse in English with local traders, restaurant customers, and others. John also has a penchant for crisp, clean branded clothes.”

The police are trying to locate John’s relatives. As of now, he has been admitted to Sassoon General Hospital and doctors said he is out of danger.

Lagad said, “The assault took place under Sambhaji Bridge on the riverbed road around 12.30am. Usually, the area remains crowded at the time owing to the eateries and tonga operators active in the stretch. Unidentified assailant(s) attempted to smash John’s head with a brick. Local traders and a police patrol team rushed to the spot on hearing his screams.”

“We have registered a case of attempt to murder although the motive behind the crime is yet to be established,” Lagad said.

Local businessman Manpreet Singh said, “John is a good human being. He greets everyone with a smile. The residents of Prabhat Road know him very well.”

“Some people from Prabhat Road and Fergusson College Road informed us that he belongs to a good family and he used to stay in a house on Prabhat Road. But his past is obscure,” Lagad said. “We have appealed local residents to come forward and help the police track his relatives,” he added.

According to the police, John Baba and two others, including a scrap collector, had been staying under the bridge. “John did not have any addiction. He would buy tea and snacks from the local shopkeepers instead of begging for food. He used to seek alms from passers-by,” Lagad said. One of the two men who used to stay beneath the bridge has been missing for the last two days, the police said.

Supriya Gandhi at a session

The first day of Jaipur Literature festival witnessed a very interesting and relevant discussion: The use of religion by Mughal emperors and modern-day politicians to woo the masses.

Speakers Manimugdha Sharma and Supriya Gandhi discussed Mughal rulers Akbar and Dara Shikoh and their policies in one of the sessions.

Manimugdha, who has written a book on emperor Akbar said, “Akbar praised the chant of Allah-Hu Akbar that indirectly glorified him and pleased the masses. Similarly, when Narendra Modi was campaigning in Banaras ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, his supporters chanted ‘Har Har Modi’ similar to ‘Har Har Mahadev’. So, religion and politics in this country can never be looked in isolation.”

William Dalrymple, who was in conversation with the authors, said Akbar out of curiosity or for political gain gave respect to every religion. So, will it be correct to say he was a secular ruler? Manimudgha disagreed to this. “The term secular is an aspect of modern world. We can say he was tolerant, but not secular,” he said.

Supriya Gandhi, while referring to her book, said Dara Shikoh like his predecessors conducted a lot of experiments with religion. He looked at religion objectively and tried to follow the footsteps of former rulers. “He was a philosopher and aspired to become a king, though for other political reasons he could not live his dream,” she said.

When Dalrymple asked that many historians blamed Akbar for using his predominantly Hindu army to capture kingdoms in south India, Manimugdha rightly denied any such strategy was used by the emperor.

He said, “At that time Akbar’s court and army were so intermingled that it wasn’t right to say he played with religion to force his authority. The army chiefs were fighting for their emperor and not for religion. In fact, Amber rulers were the first to accept the allegiance to Akbar and put an inscription at Amber fort praising him. So, they were loyal towards their rulers.”

The panel met with over 20 representatives of various political parties

PANAJI: The 15th Finance Commission headed by its chairman N K Singh, met with over 20 representatives of various political parties and local bodies here on Thursday during the panel’s three-day visit to Goa.

Both Congress and Goa Forward Party (GFP) stressed that the parameters used to allocate funds for Goa were flawed and needed a revamp.

GFP requested the commission for Rs 6,700 crore, the most while Congress and BJP sought Rs 2,610 crore and Rs 1,300 crore respectively.

GFP recommendations for higher devolution of funds was based on the state’s ecological and linguistic vulnerability. Congress also said that Goa was vulnerable, but with respect to climate change and rise in sea water levels.

“GFP demands the commission may sanction a one-time grant of Rs 6,000 crore for rehabilitating people affected by closure of mining and to provide them alternative employment till resumption of mining,” said GFP president Vijai Sardesai . BJP in contrast sought Rs 300 crore to assist those affected by the closure of mining.

BJP’s recommendations focused on mining, tourism, solid waste management and agriculture. “An amount of Rs. 250 crore may be allocated to undertake activities which shall boost tourism,” said state BJP president Sadanand Tanavade.

Congress and GFP said the influx of migrants and falling birth rates in the state had brought about societal changes and threatened Goa’s culture. In order to counter this, both GFP and Congress sought additional grants to help preserve local culture and identity.

Congress sought Rs 150 crore to implement the Goenche Daiz scheme which will benefit 80,000 traditional artisans, Rs 100 crores for conservation of ancient forts and heritage sites, Rs 5 crore for revival of Perani Zagor and Rs 5 crore to get UNESCO heritage inscription for Goa's Tiatr art form.

336,['24/01/2020'],Mahesh Kale wants youth to “discover” classical music,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Mahesh Kale during a media interaction on Thursday

PUNE: Lecture-demonstration format is not the best way to introduce youth to Indian classical music, said National Award-winning classical music exponent Mahesh Kale .

Instead, youngsters could “discover” classical music through a concert like Infusion, to be held in Pune on February 2, he said.

“The bandish Albela Saajan Aayo Re is known to today’s generation as one from the film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, and the search result on YouTube displays it on top. But if one looks carefully, one kind find a black-and-white video of Pandit Basavaraj Rajguru presenting the bandish sung in raag Ahir Bhairav. When youngsters discover it they can brag about to their friends. And that is what I want youngsters to do,” Kale told TOI after a media interaction on his latest venture.

Infusion will be held at the Ganesh Kala Krida Manch, a day after its show in Mumbai. It is the culmination of some “experiments”, a “beta test” of which he tried out at a recent concert in the city.

“I want to show to the youngsters that the essence of classical music lies in the way they listen to the playlists on their phones, as in the kind of influence that Indian classical music has on modern music,” Kale said.

The core of the two-hour concert will be classical music, but the presentation will be married to the “spontaneity” of Western music and other modern music. To that end, Kale’s show will also feature both Indian and western instrumentalists.

The show is neither a “western” music or Indian classical music concert. In fact, Kale doesn’t think that either needs to exist at the cost of the other.

“This will be a kind of concert where classical music is like the methi in a thaliepeeth. You will consume it without knowing anything about it,” he said, explaining the “bite-sized” approach to de-mystify classical music for youngsters.

Kale added that the upcoming concert may turn out to be the start of a series.

“It can be a part of a series of concerts in both India and abroad. I am part of a non-profit organisation in the US, so this can be scaled up to a larger series,” he added.

PUNE: A deeper insight into the working of the police force and interaction with the senior officers marked the “Times NIE Newsmakers ’ Meet 2019-20” held in association with the city police and The Times Foundation at the police commissioner’s office on Wednesday.

Over 170 students from NIE member schools participated in the meet, titled “Knowing Your City Police”.

The forum facilitated a dialogue between the students and police officers. The panel of police officers comprised commissioner of police K Venkatesham, joint commissioner of police Ravindra Shisve, additional commissioner of police (crime), Ashok Morale, deputy commissioner of police (crime) Bachchan Singh and deputy commissioner of police (Zone- I), Swapna Gore.

A volley of questions on challenges in policing, cyber-crime, traffic issues and juvenile crimes, among others, was posed before the senior authorities. Warning students of the vulnerability in cyber space, Venkatesham said, “You should be very careful of what you are sharing on the digital space.” He, however, affirmed that the use of technology would help in effective policing, especially to keep a check on traffic violators.

“Films are anything but normal,” said Shisve on the portrayal of jails on the silver screen. He said a lot of emphasis was laid on reformative measures of the criminals and around 80-90% got reformed through engagement in skill-set building activities undertaken in the jails.

Earlier, the students visited the Bharosa cell that included units for women, senior citizens and child-care; and the SEVA (Service Excellence and Victim Assistance) cell. A weapon display was also organized to apprise students of the arms used in different combat operations.

In the morning session, Bachchan Singh briefed the students about the working of the Bharosa and SEVA cells. This was followed by a question-answer session. Singh said the police were adopting reformative measures for the juveniles under the CARE (Counselling and Reformative Education) programme. He also said the Bharosa cell institutionalized in January 2019 was an effort to address the grievances of the general public before resorting to the legal recourse.

“The SEVA cell acts as a centralized feedback centre that keeps a track of all the visitors at the police station and analyses whether the concerned issues are resolved after the visit,” he said.

PUNE: The civic birth and death registration office in Kasba Peth is suddenly flooded with birth certificate requests from people in their 50s and 60s, especially from the minority communities.Officials said the sudden rush was predominantly driven by the fears arising out of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).“We have been observing the rush for birth certificates mainly from the members the Muslim community since January, who were born in the 1960s or 1970s. When asked, about 55 applicants admitted that they were seeking the birth certificates to prove their citizenship in the wake of the CAA and NRC,” medical expert Kalpana Baliwant, head of the birth and death registration office of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), said.Among these applicants, those born before 1965 are directed to approach court. “As per the law, if there is no record of an individual’s birth, his/her family members will have to establish the birth in the court of law. We only give the kin or the person concerned non-availability certificate (NAC), which they can before the court. It is only after court’s direction that we issue birth registration to such people or their family members,” Baliwant said.Under the PMC’s digitisation drive, which took off in 2000, the birth and deaths of those registered with it have been digitised from 1965.Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram told TOI, “There is no need to produce birth certificate as of now as the state government has not issued any guidelines on the same.

339,['24/01/2020'],‘No evidence to back charges’,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Vijayawada: The CID registered cases against former TDP ministers Prathipati Pulla Rao and P Narayana for allegedly intimidating and cheating a Dalit farmer in Venkatayapalem village in Guntur district on Thursday.

Speaking to few media persons in Mangalagiri, CID SP Mary Prashanti explained that they received a complaint from a woman farmer Pothuraju Bujji who claimed that both the ministers had allegedly purchased around 99 cents (almost an acre) of land from her by means of ‘threats’ and ‘conspiracy’.

Officials said they have registered a case under sections 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) against both Pulla Rao and Narayana.

Apart from these sections, Prashanti also explained that since the complainant happens to be a Dalit, it would also attract relevant sections under SC/ST Atrocities Act.

In terms of allegations of insider trading , Prashanti explained that they found 797 persons who had white ration cards (falling under the poverty line) of having purchased 700 acres of land across five mandals in the capital region of Amaravati that is worth Rs 220 crore. Four teams have been formed to examine all the 797 white ration card holders in possession of these lands.

Meanwhile, reacting to the case filed against him, Pulla Rao addressed a press conference calling the charge ‘fake’ and ‘part of the ruling dispensation’s vindictive politics’. He also said he will drag all the officials involved in filing the fake cases against the opposition to the court.

“It is a clear cut case of political vendetta. The ruling party does not have any evidence to back their allegations of insider trading against us” Pulla Rao said. Pulla Rao worked as the civil supplies minister while Narayana was the municipal administration and urban development minister under the previous N Chandrababu Naidu’s regime.

PUNE: The state registration department plans to set up additional sub-registrar offices in places with a high volume of property registrations .

This is a bid to ensure the waiting time is reduced, especially in areas like Pune, Mumbai and Thane.

“We are carrying out a statewide review of the workload on these offices and the registration of documents from each office. There are several offices in Pune and Mumbai where the registrations are more and a detailed review will be taken,” Omprakash Deshmukh, who took charge on Wednesday as the state’s Inspector General of Revenue and Controller of Stamps (IGR), said. “A few proposals of new sub-registrar offices are pending with the government and should be sanctioned soon. Meanwhile, we are also stressing on e-registrations and will address issues related to online registrations,” Deshmukh said.

At present, the state has 517 sub-registrar offices. Pune has 27, Mumbai has 25 and Thane (including Kalyan) has 23, according to official data. Builders’ associations have made a demand to increase the number of these offices in these cities, especially in Pune’s Paud and Hinjewadi areas.

Currently, the concurrent jurisdiction of the sub-registrar offices in the district extends to villages on the boundaries of Pune Municipal Corporation and Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, but a few villages in Mulshi taluka are not covered. There is a demand for a sub-registrar office in Mulshi taluka, for which a proposal has been sent to the government, Deshmukh said.

Credai-Pune Metro president Suhas Merchant said said there was a need for more offices in Paud and Hinjewadi, where more than 5,000 units are sold annually. Registrations are “unreasonably” delayed at these offices due to the limited slots, poor internet connectivity and outdated hardware, he said.

Award winners with DGP Gautam Sawang (centre)

Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh police have won two national-level awards in technology and training categories, at the recently-held National Conference on Police Communication in New Delhi. The Remote Area Communication Enhancement (RACE) project being implemented by the Andhra Pradesh police was selected as the best communication system in the country.

Speaking to TOI, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) G Palaraju, who designed the RACE project, said that the main aim of the project was to establish communication with district and state headquarters from remote areas where no forms of communication are available. “Two-wheeler and four-wheeler based systems were designed for this purpose,” he said.

While the four-wheeler system is used to establish communication from remote areas when there is a law and order situation, during disasters and VVIP visits, the two-wheeler system is used to replace the discharged batteries of field officers’ radios during natural calamities and spot rectification of defective radios.

The AP police also received the award for best training in technological aspects. The training manuals created to use body worn cameras, drones, CCTV cameras, Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS), laser guns, breath analysers and various mobile applications were adjudged best in the country. NSJ Laxmi, deputy inspector general for communication, received award from Union minister of state for home, G Kishan Reddy. Director general of police D Gautam Sawang appreciated both the officers on Thursday for their contribution in developing the systems and winning the awards at national level.

Maoists pasted posters at Pedabayalu-G Madugula mandal borders in which they gave call to the people to drive out the YSRC government from the state. “The governments have been trying to suppress the people’s movements by setting up of more number of the police camps in the district,” they alleged.

A team comprising senior inspector Arun Waykar, sub-inspector Hanumant Shinde and others nabbed Karan Muralidhar Chorghe (30) of Wangani in Velhe taluka.

The Pune rural police had invoked charges against him under MCOCA five years back. He was booked by the Velhi and Haveli police stations for various body and property offences, including murder, attempt to murder and also under the Indian Arms Act.

Waykar said that Chorghe was involved in robbery cases. “He was part of an organised crime syndicate. The other members of the syndicate have already been arrested by the Pune rural police,” he said.

Police said that Wangani village is a hilly area located close to the city and Chorghe made use of the topography to avert his arrest all these years.

A tip-off was received by the police that Chorghe was supposed to come to Katraj on his scooter and a trap was laid to catch him. Police have seized the scooter worth Rs 70,000.

He will be handed over to the Pune rural police for further investigation.

Kota: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) arrested Kota zila pramukh Surendra Gochar on Thursday morning for taking bribe of Rs 25,000 through his personal assistant. The ACB on Thursday noon produced the accused zila pramukh before the ACB court in the city, which ordered to send him to judicial custody till February 4.

His PA was arrested on December 13 with the bribe amount and had claimed to have accepted the bribe on behalf of the zila pramukh and a clerk (LDC) of his office was also arrested a few days later. Gochar is from the Congress party.

Meanwhile, former state minister and Congress MLA from Sangod, Kota, Bharat Singh has demanded to immediately expel accused Gochar from the party. No national political party, both BJP and Congress, has ever shown the courage to expel their corrupt leaders and party members, Singh said and added, “The party should immediately expel Gochar and should show its commitment against corruption.” BJP also has taken no action against Kota UIT ex-chairman, who was last year arrested for corruption, he added.

Gochar was arrested from his official residence in the city on Thursday morning following order received on Wednesday from the ACB headquarters, said Jaipur superintendent of police, ACB, Kota, Chandrasheel Thakur. Gochar’s role in the bribery case was confirmed in the investigation by ACB inspector Gyanchand, he said. Personal assistant of the accused zila pramukh, Chandra Prakesh Gupta (57) was arrested on December 13, 2019 for having accepted the bribe of Rs 25,000 and in the interrogation, he claimed he had accepted the bribe amount on behalf of zila pramukh Surendra Gochar and junior clerk of his office Kamalkant Vaishnav, said the SP. At the time of the trap, the PA called the zila pramukh and the clerk separately and each of the two asked him to “keep the amount with him,” which they would collect later, he further said and added that later, the zila pramukh went absconding. However, he appeared on ACB’s call for interrogation, but could not respond satisfactorily. The accused clerk Kamalkant had fled away from the spot at the time of trap on December 13, 2019 but was arrested on December 16.

The three accused allegedly demanded the bribe amount of Rs 25,000 from sarpanch of Kaliyakhedi Gram Panchayat for the financial sanctioning of the budget for developmental works in two villages of the gram panchayat area and for not visiting the site for inspection.

“The contractors will have to use an application to record details of the stray dog sterilization surgeries they perform. They will take photographs of the location from where the stray dog was caught so that it can be released there after the surgery. The photographs of the dog would also be saved on the application,” the veterinary officer Arun Dagade said.

The photographs of the surgery procedure and of the dogs released post-surgery at their original locations would also be saved in the app, he added. Each sterilized dog would be given a belt with a unique code number for identification.

He said on an average the civic body, through the appointed contractors, had sterilized 12,000 stray dogs in the last two to three years.

Residents were concerned about the stray dog population. A social activist Maruti Bhapkar said, “Packs of stray dogs are seen on roads. There is a need for an effective stray dog sterilization programme.”

A Pimpri resident Santosh Kale said, “Stray dogs are a nightmare for two-wheeler riders because they chase us when we return home late at night from office.”

Smita Shinde, a resident of Bhosari, said it was scary when a pack of stray dogs chased women and children carrying bags of food items from shops.

360,['24/01/2020'],Goa: 'Government no longer accountable to people',"This story is from January 24, 2020

Vijai Sardesai

PORVORIM: The move to blackmail PWD minister Deepak Pauskar has given the opposition fresh ammunition to embarrass the government, with Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai suggesting that citizens had stopped taking the state government seriously.

Addressing reporters outside the legislative assembly, Sardesai said the government, buoyed by its majority, had stopped being accountable to people. “When someone is extorting the minister…you have guys come here and being welcomed as ministers. There are policemen being beaten up by people. All these things have happened just in this month itself. One MLA, that too a lady, is being abused, and called Portuguese, and the ruling party doesn’t say anything about it,” said Sardesai.

He also hinted that BJP MLAs had links with the drug syndicate in the state, which would explain why the government was shying away from questions linked to the death of three youth at the Sunburn Klassique music festival last month. “Three people die at Sunburn, and then a question on the drug menace goes missing. Is that not a link? I was not on Micky Pacheco’s committee, otherwise I would have said that this is a political-drug mafia nexus. The needle of suspicion points towards that nexus,” said Sardesai.

He also said the government, from the MLAs to municipal councils, had ceased to be accountable for utilisation of taxpayers’ money and policy decisions. Recent statements made by the ruling side that the Margao outline development plan (ODP) would be reworked, showed that the BJP had scant respect for norms, he said.

“I don’t know if the Town and Country Planning Act, allows for the ODP to be reviewed after notification. The government has to go by the act. The government can come out with a modification or amendment to the act, if it wants to ‘re-work’ it” said Sardesai.

PUNE: State education commissioner Vishal Solanki has instructed all senior officials in the department to be present in their respective offices every Monday to hear the visitors’ concerns.

Solanki’s instruction comes in the wake of several instances of visitors directly approaching the commissioner with their grievances after not finding the education directors and other senior officials in their offices.

The commissioner said he has received several complaints from visitors, parents, representatives from various institutes and also students about the “perennial absence” of the senior education officials. “We have now instructed the officers to ensure their availability in office on Mondays. No visitor should go back without their queries being solved,” Solanki said.

Kuldeep Ambekar, president of Student Helping Hand, an association of pupils, said, “Instances of the visitors being told by the junior officers in the department that a director is out for some meeting, inspection and programme are common. All education offices receive visitors since morning till 5pm every day.”

The visitors have taken up with Solanki instances about officers not meeting them or not being found in seat. Many of the visitors reach Solanki’s office after failing to get answers to their respective queries. “The visitors’ issues need to be resolved on a priority basis. If any officer has to attend an important meeting or a programme, he or she has to take prior permission,” Solanki said.

Besides the education commissioner’s office, Pune has state headquarters of the primary education, secondary education, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, Maharashtra State Council of Examination, Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training, Maharashtra State Textbook Bureau (Balbharati) and the directorate of Minority and Adult Education departments, among others.

NEW DELHI: The voters of Gandhi Nagar assembly constituency in east Delhi have some complaints , but don’t have someone they can pin the blame on. For eight months, the constituency hasn’t had an MLA after Anil Kumar Bajpai, elected in 2015 as an Aam Aadmi Party nominee, joined BJP ahead of general elections last year and was disqualified under the anti-defection law.The constituency is known for being home to the biggest readymade garments wholesale market and has an interesting mix of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu communities. For 17 years it remained a Congress domain until Bajpai wrested it in 2015. The constituents claimed that development projects in the area began after AAP assumed power, but all work was put on hold after the MLA joined BJP.Complete Coverage on Delhi ElectionsRavinder Singh Chachhi, a resident of West Azad Nagar, said that Gandhi Nagar was identified as the first places in east Delhi for the installation of CCTV cameras. “Around 60 points were identified for the cameras. Construction of roads was also supposed to start. But we are clueless about the status of these projects,” said Chachhi. “We approached the MLA of neighbouring Krishna Nagar for help but to no avail.” Revamp of the ageing sewerage was among the other projects announced but not implemented, said Chachhi.Bajpai himself claimed to be the first legislator in Delhi to utilise Rs 11 crore of MLA local area development funds in 2019-20 for development work in his constituency. “I not only arranged took up drains and road reconstruction, but also development of parks. We identified 2,872 places for CCTV installation and 29 Wi-Fi hubs, but these were put on hold when I shifted to BJP,” said the former MLA.Last Tuesday, TOI saw road construction under way in various places, including Jheel Chowk and Azad Nagar. But also visible were massive encroachments on the roads, poor sanitation and unregulated traffic. Despite the Supreme Court’s explicit directions regarding the loading and unloading of merchandise during non-peak hours, there were goods vehicles and tempos parked outside Gandhi Nagar shops in the afternoon. To add to the chaos, shop owners had taken over large spaces on roads to display their wares.“We are fed up of the encroachment on roads. It has multiplied in the past five years,” said Shankar Nagar resident Kamal Bhasin. He also said that in the run-up to assembly polls, road work had been taken up in his locality. “But a lot of it is a waste of money because in some places just repairs could have sufficed. The money could have been better utilised on improving sanitation,” said Bhasin.People living in West Azad Nagar listed water supply and sewage among their woes. “Entire Azad Nagar gets poor-quality water and we are forced to use bottled water,” grumbled Pankaj Akhil. “The residents complained to the former MLA a number of times. And though officials visited our area after the complaints, the quality of water did not improve.”In the trader community, there is an undertone of surliness against the sealing of shops for violation of norms. “We are mostly supporters of BJP, but the party and its leaders have tried to distance themselves from the issue by blaming the AAP government for not amending the Master Plan Delhi. People aren’t convinced and may express their disappointment during the voting,” confided a Gandhi Nagar trader.In Old and New Seelampur, dominated by the Muslim community, the ruling party gets a thumbs up. “AAP is doing its best to help poor people through rebates in power and electricity bills.

File pic of a traffic control room with real-time updates in the city

JAIPUR: With a cost of Rs 6.6 crore, the city traffic police are preparing an “integrated traffic management system (ITMS)”, a technology-based system that will automatically detect traffic violations such as speeding with the use of traffic surveillance cameras, automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras among others, to improve mobility, discipline and safety on city roads.

According to the proposal, Jaipur police will identify 11 places in the city where the system will be installed. It will generate e-challans.

The police said that the upcoming system should be designed in such a manner so that it should have an option of integration with the existing ITMS/ANPR infrastructure present with the Jaipur traffic police , so that the whole system might function under single command and control structure.

In 2019, the existing ITMS helped the traffic police in issuing notices to 52,994 traffic rule violators and in collecting Rs 1.22 crore as penalty from them. For the purpose, the Jaipur police commissionerate on Tuesday invited expression of interest from eligible agencies for the proposals to provide design, development and commissioning of ANPR (ITMS) system at 11 entry and exit points in Jaipur city. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 6.6 crore.

According to the officials, the objective of the project is to perform ANPR on all the vehicles passing through the chosen 11 entry and exit points of the city and generation of alerts based on ANPR. Also, it will detect speed violation and other traffic violations. If someone would be found violating the traffic rules under the technology-based system, it will automatically generate e-challans for the violations. It will also provide a web-based interface so that owners and drivers will be able to check if they have a pending violation on their vehicle and pay the amount of penalty accordingly.

The system will also provide video feed to command and control centre. The system will be designed to work round the clock and it will be able to capture the number plate in night with the help of IR illuminator against the head light glare of the approaching vehicle.

For eight months, the constituency hasn’t had an MLA after Anil Kumar Bajpai, elected in 2015 as an Aam Aadmi Party nominee, joined BJP ahead of general elections last year and was disqualified under the anti-defection law.The constituency is known for being home to the biggest readymade garments wholesale market and has an interesting mix of Muslim, Sikh and Hindu communities. For 17 years it remained a Congress domain until Bajpai wrested it in 2015. The constituents claimed that development projects in the area began after AAP assumed power, but all work was put on hold after the MLA joined BJP.Ravinder Singh Chachhi, a resident of West Azad Nagar, said that Gandhi Nagar was identified as the first places in east Delhi for the installation of CCTV cameras. “Around 60 points were identified for the cameras. Construction of roads was also supposed to start. But we are clueless about the status of these projects,” said Chachhi. “We approached the MLA of neighbouring Krishna Nagar for help but to no avail.” Revamp of the ageing sewerage was among the other projects announced but not implemented, said Chachhi.Bajpai himself claimed to be the first legislator in Delhi to utilise Rs 11 crore of MLA local area development funds in 2019-20 for development work in his constituency. “I not only arranged took up drains and road reconstruction, but also development of parks. We identified 2,872 places for CCTV installation and 29 Wi-Fi hubs, but these were put on hold when I shifted to BJP,” said the former MLA.Last Tuesday, TOI saw road construction under way in various places, including Jheel Chowk and Azad Nagar. But also visible were massive encroachments on the roads, poor sanitation and unregulated traffic. Despite the Supreme Court’s explicit directions regarding the loading and unloading of merchandise during non-peak hours, there were goods vehicles and tempos parked outside Gandhi Nagar shops in the afternoon. To add to the chaos, shop owners had taken over large spaces on roads to display their wares.“We are fed up of the encroachment on roads. It has multiplied in the past five years,” said Shankar Nagar resident Kamal Bhasin. He also said that in the run-up to assembly polls, road work had been taken up in his locality. “But a lot of it is a waste of money because in some places just repairs could have sufficed. The money could have been better utilised on improving sanitation,” said Bhasin.People living in West Azad Nagar listed water supply and sewage among their woes. “Entire Azad Nagar gets poor-quality water and we are forced to use bottled water,” grumbled Pankaj Akhil. “The residents complained to the former MLA a number of times. And though officials visited our area after the complaints, the quality of water did not improve.”In the trader community, there is an undertone of surliness against the sealing of shops for violation of norms. “We are mostly supporters of BJP, but the party and its leaders have tried to distance themselves from the issue by blaming the AAP government for not amending the Master Plan Delhi. People aren’t convinced and may express their disappointment during the voting,” confided a Gandhi Nagar trader.In Old and New Seelampur, dominated by the Muslim community, the ruling party gets a thumbs up. “AAP is doing its best to help poor people through rebates in power and electricity bills. Sanitation isn’t good, but that is the responsibility of MCD,” said Anees Rehman in Old Seelampur.",elections,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73572380,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37563,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//elections/assembly-elections/delhi-assembly-elections/plenty-of-unfinished-biz-wholl-stitch-a-win-here/articleshow/73571274.cms
369,['24/01/2020'],"Now, test Sanchi milk purity at Dugdh Sangh premises","This story is from January 24, 2020

Dugdha Sangh premises

BHOPAL: The Bhopal Dugdh Sangh (Bhopal Milk Federation) has decided to allow its consumers to test purity of the Sanchi brand of milk on its premises itself. Divisional commissioner Kalpana Shrivastava has directed chief executive officer Dr K K Saxena to arrange on-the-spot testing of milk on Sanchi plant premises for consumers.

She said that the public awareness programme has already been undertaken by the federation under which consumers are being motivated to test quality of milk at their home itself under the campaign “Khud Parkho Khud Jano” (Test it yourself, know the quality yourself).

Under the campaign, a “Sanchi chariot” is visiting different places of the city to create awareness on how purity of milk and milk products can be tested by consumers themselves. Bhopal Dugdh Sangh has also issued a phone no. for people to register their complaint if they receive substandard/adulterated milk. The phone number is (0755)- 2481995.

The chariot will remain on city roads till January 31. It will visit Karond chowk on January 24, Bairagarh township on January 25, Lal Ghati area on January 27, Jehangirabad on January 29 and Sindhi Colony on January 30. The Dugdh Sangh personnel will interact with people and test the quality of milk brought by them, so that credibility of Sanchi brand could be enhanced.

Shrivastava, who was presiding over a review meeting on steps being taken by Bhopal Dugdh Sangh to ensure supply of quality milk to consumers, said that tallying the quality report of milk which reaches the plant with that of the report taken at the milk chilling plants (from where it is sent to Bhopal) has reduced the possibility of its adulteration to zero.

The divisional commissioner, however, cautioned Dr Saxena that strict quality control should be a continuous process and no leniency should be allowed to creep in the task and any employee/officer involved in activities detrimental to the prestige of Sanchi brand should not be spared.

She said that dues of those supplying milk to Bhopal Dugdh Sangh should be cleared every week rather than 20 days and vehicles engaged in milk distribution should not be allowed inside the premises without proper washing and cleaning. Quality and any possible adulteration in milk should be tested from all the tankers arriving at the plant till 10 pm.

Besides, the federation’s step like formation of 10 mobile teams, which is visiting places adjacent to Bhopal to enhance the collection of milk, bid to revive the milk committees which have become defunct, forming new committees and motivating people to rear milk-giving cattle are also bearing encouraging results, she said.

Tirupur: Amidst protest from a section of vendors, the city corporation on Thursday began demolition of Tirupur flower market on Eswaran Koil Street near the old bus stand.

The market is being demolished to construct a new one at a cost of Rs 4.47 crore under the smart city mission. A city corporation official said, “The new complex is likely to be ready in 11 months from the date of commencement of work.”

He said the demolition drive was carried out with police protection as they were facing opposition from a section of venders, who had been seeking an assurance on allocation of shops in the new complex. “We sought police protection to avoid any untoward incident. Shops would be allotted only based on tender process.”

The market was started around 90 years ago. There were 98 shops in the market and they were engaged in both wholesale and retail businesses. The official said the flower market was included in the smart city mission with an idea to redevelop the same. “We had allotted the vendors temporary shops in Cotton market complex on Palladam Road. Fearing that they would lose their shops, the vendors, however, started to oppose the project.”

The official said priority would be given to the existing vendors, but allotment of shops would only be done through tender process. The vendors, however, said the temporary flower market complex was filled with sewage.

TIRUPUR: A 15-month old baby girl died on Wednesday after she accidentally fell into a bucket that was filled with water at Angeripalayam in the city.

The Anupparpalayam police identified the deceased as Kanishka, daughter of S Kannan-Pandiyammal couple, of Avinashigoundampalayam . At the time of the incident, a police officer said, Kannan had left for his work and only Pandiyammal and the baby girl were in the house. Kannan is employed with a knitwear unit.

“Pandiyammal was cooking inside, while Kanishka was playing in front of the house, where they had stored water in many plastic vessels. When the girl couldn’t be seen, her mother came out of the house and found her struggling for life in a bucket full of water,” the officer said.

The baby girl was immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. The Anupparpalayam police have registered the case under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

Since the deceased was an infant, police gave the family a no objection certificate, so that there was no need to conduct postmortem.

NEW DELHI: In an interesting twist to the multi-crore rail e-ticketing racket , its mastermind has reached out to the Railway Police Force (RPF) chief claiming “huge gaps” in the transport behemoth’s IT security system.The main accused, Hamid Ashraf, who is in Dubai, has claimed that nabbing him or some people won’t put an end to such rackets as others can develop similar ‘illegal’ software and use them by taking advantage of the security loopholes in the IRCTC ’s system.RPF is working on a strategy to catch Ashraf, after the recent arrest of another key player in this racket Ghulam Mustafa. Ashraf had fled the country after jumping bail in 2016. He was arrested in a similar rail e-ticketing fraud when he was in Class XII.In a series of WhatsApp broadcasts, Ashraf claimed that he had repeatedly flagged loopholes in the IT security system developed by government-owned Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS), which IRCTC uses for ticketing. “The agencies did not take measures to plug the loopholes and so how can you hold me responsible? People did not pay heed to the details I had shared with them; all of them thought I was mad,” he said in the text messages addressed to RPF director general Arun Kumar.From the messages, it appeared that Ashraf reached out to RPF DG after his press conference where he said that the money was suspected to be used for terror financing . “If you give interviews to TV channels like this, no one will marry me,” he said.Pointing out that the government agencies were unable to fix “such a security issue” even after he shared details through “more than 500 emails and WhatApp messages”, he said this had raised serious questions about their ability to deal with critical cyber security issues.“We are concerned about any lapses that can be exploited by criminals and anti-national elements. We have been flagging this issue and have urged the departments concerned to take measures,” an official said.In his messages, Ashraf, who is believed to have been trained by an IT expert, has offered help to the railways, IRCTC and CRIS to secure the system. “Give me a chance, I will secure the IRCTC system and CRIS. Arresting me won’t help as there will be 10 more to come out with such software... I am not guilty or wrong so I am posting these details,” he said. The accused even went to the extent of saying that the railways can hire him at Rs 2 lakh monthly salary as an ‘ethical’ hacker as IT giants do.Claiming that he has deactivated and withdrawn the illegal software that he had sold to many, he said, “I want this tension to end so that I can enjoy my life with my girlfriend…Sir, please bachha ko maaf kardijiye. Life mein dubara railways ke software nehin banaoonga. (Please excuse me for this. I will never develop any such software for railways).”The accused listed out several steps that the railways, IRCTC and CRIS could take to ensure that none can bypass IT security system.“You allow two tickets in a day per IP address. Similarly why don’t you fix only one IRCTC ID that can be logged on to the system per IP address. People log into the system with 50 IRCTC IDs generated from one IP address and until you address this, common people will keep suffering,” Ashraf said.On in the issue of bypassing of Captcha and OTP, he claimed that he had sent the details about the bug used for this to banks and IRCTC.",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73572368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-173446,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/pay-me-2l/month-ill-fix-railway-systems-scamster-tells-rpf/articleshow/73567316.cms
373,['24/01/2020'],Odisha begins process to acquire 3k acres of land for Haldia Petrochemicals,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Bhubaneswar: Within six months of the Naveen Patnaik-led high-level clearance authority clearing Haldia Petrochemicals Limited’s (HPL) proposal to set up a petrochemical complex in Odisha, the state government has began the process of acquiring 3320.21 acres of land in Baliapal block of Balasore district for the same. Odisha Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco) was given the nod to acquire land during a meeting in the last week of December.

Once complete, the Rs 78,225 crore project is expected to generate employment for around 10,000 people. HPL would set up a hydrocarbon processing complex comprising a light crude oil refinery, aromatics complex and ethylene cracker units.

It was during the second Make in Odisha conclave in November 2018 that the West Bengal-headquartered HPL had initially expressed its intent to invest in the state. The company had made the biggest greenfield investment intent during the business summit.

Official sources said land for HPL and downstream industries has been identified close to the proposed Subarnarekha Port developed by Tata Steel with an investment of around Rs 5,000 crore. Odisha Space Application Centre has helped in identifying land with the help of the advanced differential global positioning system.

“We will soon start the process of acquiring land with the revenue reconciliation exercise. Subsequently, public hearing will be held before land is acquired,” said a senior Idco official. It is learnt that Idco has been told to complete the land acquiring process within 12 to 18 months.

The government is looking to tread cautiously on the contentious issue of acquiring land given that it had faced severe opposition in the past. A mega steel project by South Korean company Posco had failed to take off owing to land hurdle, damaging the state’s attempt to project an investment-friendly image.

Of the 3320 acres identified for the project, around 900 acres belong to private property with 700 acres falling under forest land. It also has 800 acres of government land, around 300 acres of Bhoodan land and other categories of land. As many as six revenue villages could be affected because of the land acquisition process, sources said.

Bhoodan land is land acquired by way of donation under the Bhoodan movement initiated by Acharya Vinobha Bhabe. Under the Orissa Bhoodan and Gramdan Act, 1970, such land can be used for landless people or for a community purpose.

Under forest conservation law, forest land can be diverted for industrial projects by paying the net present value of the land (rate depends on density of forest) for compensatory afforestation. Government authorities hope there would not be much of a hurdle in this regard given that the patch of land chosen has no eco-sensitive zone or sanctuary.

“After diversion of forest land, the project proponent will seek necessary forest and environmental clearances to set up industrial unit over the land,” said an Idco official.

To acquire private land, a mandatory social impact assessment would be done. As part of the assessment, public hearings would be held in affected villages. The government hopes the villagers would be favourable disposed towards the industry as they will be duly compensated.

State industries department sources said the petrochemical complex has huge potential for creating downstream industries with enormous employment opportunities. Odisha at present has Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’s 15 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) oil refinery at Paradip while its expansion to 25 mtpa has already been approved. To seek investment in chemicals, petrochemicals and plastics sectors, a petroleum chemicals and petrochemicals investment region is also being developed near the IOCL plant.

374,['24/01/2020'],Festival to shine light on struggles of blind people,"This story is from January 24, 2020

The Muzzgamchem Fest will be held on February 2

PANAJI: Come February 2, the premises of the National Association for the Blind (NAB) will host a unique community festival, the Muzzgamchem Fest.

The event aims at highlighting the struggles faced by the blind and those with limited sight. The organisers also want to educated people about the work done by NAB.

Interestingly, in the run-up to the festival, NAB will host an array of workshops for the public, including handicrafts prepared by the blind, at its premises at Santa Cruz from January 27 to February 1, from 10am to 12.30pm.

“All learnings from the workshops, right from playing of the traditional ghumot to food and handicrafts will then be presented at the festival,” said Marius Fernandes, who initiated the concept of community-organised festivals in Goa 20 years ago.

On the festival day, the opening event will be the Muzzgamchim Pasoi (walk), which will start at 11am, from the Santa Cruz church. “Santa Cruz-based historian Sanjeev Sardesai will take participants across four historic landmarks in the village and narrate the history of each one,” Fernandes said. Those participating in the walk are requested to come with one musical instrument each. “After the heritage walk, we will play music and lead the procession to the NAB premises, where the Muzzgamchem Fest will start at 11.45am,” he said.

At the festival premises, participants will be treated to performances by troupes from Kala Academy’s theatre department, students of two special schools, Lokvishwas Prathisthan and Sanjay School, and students of Goa College of Art.

An added attraction will be a ‘Make in Santa Cruz’ market. “Vegetables and fruits grown by Santa Cruz locals and salt from the village salt pans will be sold there. There will be live demonstrations by locals on how to prepare traditional sweets. Like the other community festivals, there will be no sponsors, no chief guest and no alcohol, to help keep it a community and traditional affair,” NAB’s Richard Pinto said. A skills workshop on how to pluck coconuts using a machine invented by a local will also be conducted for interested participants.

“The Goa branch of NAB was started in 1983 and the Santa Cruz centre is operating from the premises of a government primary school building provided to us by the state government. We started boarding facilities here 10 years ago. The children go to the local Santa Cruz High School and some of our older students study at Dhempe College. The children are tutored by trained teachers. They return to their homes during the vacations. We want people to come and see that these children can do anything that you and I can. They have even been trained to travel on their own by public transport to college,” NAB president Rozendo Mendonsa said.

375,['24/01/2020'],Everything falls in line for integrated bus stand at Vellalore,"This story is from January 24, 2020

The work on integrated bus stand at Vellalore is all set to begin on Friday. While the state government had announced the project almost six years ago, it was only recently that the city corporation issued work order to the successful bidder.

A source with the city corporation said, “Three bidders had participated in the tender process and the project was awarded to Erode-based P&C Projects (P) Ltd. The work order was issued to the firm on Monday and it is expected to start the construction work tomorrow (Friday).”

According to the source, the project would cost Rs 164.81 crore and the construction would be completed in 24 months from the date of commencement of work.

While 60 acres have been allotted for the project, close to 30 acres would be used to park buses. “We are planning to move the mofussil bus stands at Ukkadam, Gandhipuram and Singanallur, and the omni bus stand at Gandhipuram to Vellalore.”

The new bus stand will have a capacity to park a total of 140 mofussil buses at any given time. In addition to this, there will be close to 33 platforms to park town buses.

“It will also house a parking facility with a capacity to accommodate thousand vehicles and multi-storeyed buildings with eateries, ATMs, information centre, restrooms, office space and shops. The buildings would be rented out to make the bus stand self-sufficient,” the source said.

He said they would conduct yet another study before the completion of construction work to take effective measures to reduce traffic congestion in the city.

Shortly after the project was announced by the former chief minister the late J Jayalalithaa in 2014, the civic body had conducted a feasibility study and prepared a detailed project report. While the project was later included under the area-based development component of the smart city mission, the urban development ministry refused to grant approval for the same. The project was then handed over to the National Highways wing of the state highways department.

As the highways department was conducting the pre-feasibility study, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami announced in the assembly plans to construct the integrated bus stand in the city to manage the increasing traffic congestion. Subsequently, the highways department dropped the project and the city corporation took it under its wing.

376,['24/01/2020'],New snake eel species named after ZSI head,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Berhampur: Director of Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Kailash Chandra, has received the ultimate honour of animal taxonomists — he has had a new species named after him.

The latest entrant to the fish world is a new species of snake eel, which has been called Ophichthus kailashchandrai sp. nov. to honour Chandra’s contribution to animal taxonomy.

The term ‘sp. nov.’ or ‘species nova’ is used when a binomial name is being published for the first time.

The new kind of snake eel was discovered by scientists of the Estuarine Biology Regional Centre in Ganjam’s Gopalpur-on-Sea in the Shankarpur fishing harbour in West Bengal. “At least three specimens were collected from the Bay of Bengal around five years ago. The findings stating the discovery of the new species were published in peer-reviewed international journal, Zootaxa, in January,” said Anil Mohapatra of the Estuarine Biology Regional Centre, one of the four authors of the article.

“We have been examining the three specimens for a long time, and after comparing them with their congeners (species within the same genus), we were able to establish this as a new species,” he explained.

The ZSI director said he was thrilled to have a fish named after him, particularly as it is very difficult to discover new fishes in the Bay of Bengal.

“First of all, I thank Mohapatra and his team for naming the new fish species after me. It’s very difficult to discover fish species from the vast Bay of Bengal,” Chandra said over phone from Kolkata, where the ZSI is headquartered. “It would have been even better if the species was named after fish scientists who have dedicated their lives to the science,” he added.

The Ophichthus kailashchandrai sp. nov. is distinguished from its congeners by having its dorsal-fin origin at the posterior third of the pectoral fin, preanal length of 2.6-2.8 in TL (Total Length — length of a fish measured from the tip of the snout to the tip of the longer lobe of the caudal fin), uniserial maxillary and mandibular teeth and vertebral count (predorsal vertebrae 14–15, preanal vertebrae 54–55, and total vertebrae 180–182).

The snake eel species varies from 420mm to 462mm in length, and the specimens were collected from the harbour at a depth of around 50metre using trawl nets. The colour of the new eel is light brown while its eye rim is white. The head pores are located within the white rims. The ZSI scientists, however, said there was a lot still to be discovered about the species.

The other authors of the article are Dipanjan Ray of Bajkul Milani Mahavidyalaya, Purba Medinapur, West Bengal, Swarup Ranjan Mohanty of the Estuarine Biology Regional Centre, and Subhendu Sekhar Mishra of Marine Fish Section, ZSI, Kolkata.

This is the fifth eel species discovered by scientists of the Estuarine Biology Regional Centre in the past three years. The others are Gymnothorax odishi, Ophichthus johnmccoskeri, Gymnothorax andamanensis and Gymnothorax smithi.

377,['24/01/2020'],"Centre approves national school of planning, architecture at a cost of Rs 338 cr for Puducherry","This story is from January 24, 2020

Puducherry: The Union human resource development ministry has approved setting up of a National school of planning and architecture ( SPA ) at a cost of Rs 338 crore in Puducherry, said agriculture minister R Kamalakannan, who also holds the portfolio of education.

Speaking to the media in the presence of secretary (education) A Anbarasu and director (school education) P T Rudra Goud, Kamalakannan said the government will initiate efforts to demarcate 50 acres of land on Pondicherry University campus for the school. He said the school, which is a premier higher education institution like National Institute of Technology and Jipmer, would specialise in education and research in the fields of planning and architecture. Presently SPAs are located in Delhi, Bhopal and Vijayawada. Puducherry will be the fourth centre with an SPA, he said.

He said the government has also launched efforts to establish a National Institute of Fashion Technology in 2020-21. Preliminary work for the project has been completed and the government will soon finalise the site for the project.

Similarly, the government proposes to set up a National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology (NIELIT) at Women’s Polytechnic College and Pondicherry Engineering College (PEC).

A committee from the institute inspected the site at the polytechnic college and PEC on December 3 last year.

He said the government has established a branch of central footwear training institute at Karaikal in September last year. Three batches of students have completed certificate and skill development courses in footwear manufacturing at the centre so far. The students, who could not clear Class X and even dropouts can join the courses offered by the centre. All courses are free of cost, said the minister. He said the government will establish Puducherry technological university, the first state university in the Union territory. The government passed a bill in this regard in September last year and sent it for approval of the President in October last. He said the government will get the approval soon.

Perunthalaivar Kamarajar Institute of Engineering and Technology in Karaikal will be promoted as a non-conventional multi-disciplinary institute and introduce new courses viz., agricultural engineering, aerospace engineering, marine engineering, petrochemical engineering and biomedical engineering in collaboration with other institutions.

The government has proposed to establish an engineering college at Yanam, which will offer innovative courses like robotics and automation, geo-informatics, 3D animation and graphics, digital techniques for design and planning and computing in multimedia among others.

378,['24/01/2020'],Chairman has no power to refer bills to panel: Buggana,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Amaravati: Finance and legislative affairs minister Buggana Rajendranath on Thursday blamed opposition TDP of hatching a conspiracy to stall the passage of the two key bills in the assembly. “The council chairman’s decision to refer the bills to a select committee was part of TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu’s conspiracy. The chairman has no such discretionary powers under Rule 154. In fact, proper procedure has not been followed to refer the bills to the select committee,” he alleged.

As per rules, government business should be prioritised, he said, adding that opposition leaders raised Rule 71 which is a special provision to discuss government policy and for the legislative council to give its opinion on it. “This rule was not in any state’s constitutional procedures but under some special circumstances a few years ago, Rule 71 was included in the AP legislative council,” added Buggana.

Naidu was present at the council gallery during discussion on the bills and was sitting quite opposite the council chairman while he was reading out the note, Buggana said. “The state government is spending close to Rs 60 crore annually on the council which amounts Rs 5 crore per month. The members are supposed to give suggestions, not block the government’s work. If the council is meant to block the government’s work, there is no meaning of having assembly sessions,” he added.

Municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayan said Wednesday was the “most disastrous day” in the history of state legislative council for the shameful conduct of TDP members. He rubbished the allegations of TDP members that the ministers were in an inebriated condition during the debate. “TDP is spreading such false news to cover up its unethical action in the council,” he alleged.

Agriculture minister Kurasala Kannababu too criticised the opposition leaders’ behaviour. “Yanamala Ramakrishnudu alleged that all ministers had come drunk to the council. A TDP MLC even asked for usage of breath analyser on the members while entering the assembly. This is nothing but breach of our privileges,” said Kannababu. He also requested the speaker to summon those who made derogatory comments against ministers and legislators and initiate action.

PANAJI: During the post-monsoon period in 2019, the state government came under severe criticism for the pathetic conditions of several road stretches, as citizens pointed out to the risk of fatalities it poses. In the face of this criticism, PWD minister Deepak Pauskar had said that the state government is planning to import bitumen from Iraq and Iran. Pauskar’s reasoning was that the bitumen — a byproduct of petroleum — available in these countries was of better quality and would help in making better roads.

But, PWD officials said that after Pauskar made the statement, he was informed that the proposal could not materialise as central government norms disallow the direct procurement of bitumen from other countries. The guidelines require that bitumen be imported through public sector undertakings like HPCL and BPCL.

“The minister was told that HPCL and BPCL already procure bitumen from the Gulf and that they have their own standard testing procedures to ensure consistency in quality. As such imported bitumen is proven to be of sufficiently good quality, the proposal does not stand,” a PWD official said.

Undertakings like HPCL and BPCL procure the raw material, manufacture bitumen and market it in various grades.

Karnataka revenue minister R Ashoka

BENGALURU: After Honnalli legislator MP Renukacharya , Ballari City MLA Somashekara Reddy and deputy chief minister Govind Karjol, it appeared the turn of revenue minister R Ashoka to show the BJP in poor light with controversial and provocative comments against a minority community. This, despite a gag order issued by state BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel.

Responding to questions on the Mangaluru International Airport bomb scare incident and how the main accused would have been treated had he been a Muslim, Ashoka on Thursday said ""all anti-nationals must be shot dead"". Meanwhile, Renukacharya, also a political secretary to chief minister BS Yediyurappa, continued his tirade against Muslims, insisting the government will not extend any ""special package"" to the community.

Soon after garlanding the statue of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose on the birth anniversary of the freedom fighter, at Vidhana Soudha on Thursday, Ashoka said: ""All those who are singing the tune of Pakistan and indulging in anti-national activities, be they Hindu, Christian or Muslim, must be shot dead.""

Asked to respond to former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy’s accusation that the entire Mangaluru bomb incident was stage-managed by the BJP government to divert attention, Ashoka said the JD(S) functionary ""must measure his words"" and not speak ""like a film director who can project the police as villainous all the time"".

""Kumaraswamy is a former CM. When in power, police were his closest friends, but now that he is not in government, the same police are villains,"" Ashoka said.

The minister reiterated the government’s stand — first floated by home minister Basavaraj Bommai —

that Aditya Rao, the main accused in the Mangaluru bomb incident, is ""mentally unstable"" and needs to be medically examined.

Renukacharya, meanwhile, justified comments made on Wednesday that the government will not offer Muslims ""a special package"".

""When they [Muslims] need development funds, they come to us and seek special packages. Once they get funds, they then vote for Congress or JD(S) in elections,"" Renukacharya said on Thursday. ""We do not need people with such double standards. I will apply pressure on all ministers in the cabinet and even the chief minister to ensure they do not allocate any special package for the community.""

A cross and brass letters from Sonika Chauhan’s grave have been stolen

KOLKATA: The grave of model Sonika Singh Chauhan , who died in an accident on Rashbehari Avenue early on April 29, 2017, when she was travelling in actor Vikram Chatterjee’s car, has suffered multiple incidents of desecration, the recent being last week.

The accused had removed brass letters and a cross from Chauhan’s grave around 1am on January 17, stated the complaint by A K Biswas, secretary of the office of the Christian Burial Board, which maintained the Lower Circular Road Cemetery .

Police are certain local drug-addicts had stolen the brass letters and cross to fund their daily fix. These drug-addicts had probably desecrated the grave even earlier, police said.

It was the gardener who first noticed the theft and alerted the security-in-chief, who in turn, called up different people, including Chauhan’s family. The relatives visited the spot. A case was registered at the Beniapukur police station under section 427 of IPC (mischief). “A complaint dated January 17 has been received from A K Biswas that unidentified persons desecrated the grave top of Chauhan by removing brass letters and cross,” an officer from the Beniapukur police station said.

The official complaint from the Christian Burial Board stated: “This is to inform you that the grave, which contains the mortal remains of Chauhan, located on the left side of second pathway, have been vandalized once again.” The complaint added that when the grave was earlier desecrated, the board had taken certain precautionary measures. “This is to assure you that we have intensified our patrolling with regular vigilance…,” stated the complaint, which went on to urge the police to introduce their own watch at the cemetery. “Please treat this intimation as FIR to arrest the culprit by organizing regular patrolling on day-to-day basis at this heritage cemetery,” the complaint said.

Police said they had already recorded the statements of the gardener and the security-in-chief.

382,['24/01/2020'],AP Capital News: High court posts Andhra Pradesh capital shifting cases to February 26,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Representative image

VIJAYAWADA: Even as the legislative council referred the bill on shifting of the capital to the select committee, the high court on Thursday said it would hear all petitions connected to the issue on February 26.

The high court directed the state government to file counters in all matters within three weeks. While declining to give interim directions against shifting offices in the meanwhile, as urged by petitioners, the high court asserted that if the petitioners made out a case of such shifting, the government and individuals responsible would be made to pay for the expenditure incurred.

A special bench comprising Chief Justice J K Maheswari, Justice A V Sesha Sai and Justice M Satyanarayana Murthy was constituted to hear petitions challenging moving the capital. The court hall was jam-packed given the importance of the petitions. YSRC general secretary V Vijay Sai Reddy and TDP MP Kesineni Srinivas attended court.

Arguing on behalf of farmers, senior counsel Ashok Bhan raised the issue of the money bill and claimed its introduction was illegal as it violates provisions of Article 207 of the Constitution. Bhan argued that as the bill has special provisions of drawing funds from the consolidated fund, it had to be recommended by the governor of the state. But that did not happen in the case, making it illegal.

Contending the argument, designated senior counsel representing the government Mukul Rohatgi said the definition of money bill was clearly given in Article 199 (1) of the Constitution and the present bill does not come under Article 199 as it is not a taxation bill, but an infrastructure bill. He argued that the bill was introduced as an ordinary bill in both the Houses.

The chief justice suggested that as the bill had not been passed by the legislative council yet, it would not be appropriate to take up the hearing now. He asked the advocate general S Sriram about the status of the bill in the council.

Replying to the bench, the advocate general said the bill had been referred to a select committee by the chairman. According to the constitutional process, the select committee will revisit the contents of the bill and make suggestions or amendments if required. In case of amendments, the bill will be sent to the assembly again.

Continuing his arguments, Ashok Bhan said the state government should be pulled up for contempt of court for not giving farmers the opportunity to submit their grievances to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) as directed by court, based on which the high power committee submitted a report to the government, following which the decision to shift the capital was taken.

As the chief justice suggested to take up the hearing after three weeks, Bhan requested the bench to give interim directions not to shift any office in the meanwhile. He said oral directions are being given to the officers to shift their offices. However, the chief justice did not consider his request, but said if the petitioners make out a case on it, the court will hold the government and individuals responsible for the expenditure incurred on such shifting.

Directing the advocate general to share copies of the expert committee report to all the petitioners, the high court posted all the matters connected to the capital issue to February 26 and asked the government to file counters within three weeks’ time.

VASCO: Members of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) gheraoed Mormugao joint mamlatdar Saiesh Naik on Thursday afternoon over the deletion of names from the Mormugao constituency’s voter list . They alleged that workers and municipal councillors owing allegiance to urban development minister Milind Naik were acting as booth-level officers by identifying and submitting names of non-BJP voters.

The joint mamlatdar, who is in charge of the constituency, assured that he would re-enter the names of voters that had been deleted if they satisfied him with proper documents. The GPCC, however, threatened to approach the Election Commission if proper action was not initiated.

GPCC convener Amarnath Panjikar alleged that about 1,400 non-BJP voters were being deleted from the voter list of the Mormugao constituency and about 750 new names were being added.

The joint mamlatdar, however, said that only 900 names were deleted and 282 new names were added. “The names were deleted after objections were raised and procedure was followed,” he said.

Amaravati: TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu while interacting with party functionaries via a teleconference on Thursday showered praises on his party MLCs for exhibiting ‘exemplary fighting spirit’ and said council chairman MA Shariff has championed the cause of Amaravati farmers.

Naidu said victory in the council has instilled public faith in democracy again. “In fact, it was the spirit of the people who have been on the streets for the past 37 days that made our resolve stronger and helped us emerge victorious,” said Naidu.

He said the council chairman did not take any side while referring the bills to the select committee but acted as per the rules. He criticised YSRC functionaries, including the ministers, for abusing Shariff. Naidu alleged that the ministers have only stopped short of attacking the council chairman. He also condemned the behaviour of the ministers who tried to attack his son and MLC Nara Lokesh.

Refuting the charges that he was doing injustice to Rayalaseema region, Naidu asked YSRC leaders to study the history to know about who has done what. He said that he was proud to say that he hails from Rayalaseema region and had worked overtime to transform the region into an industrial hub. “I have taken several measures to provide irrigation water to the region,” he said.

385,['24/01/2020'],Cocoon production goes up by 20% in five years,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Coimbatore: The demand for cocoon is still high, despite its production going up by 20% in the past five years in the district, according to the district sericulture centre.

On an average 1.5 tonnes of cocoon is auctioned daily at the government cocoon market in the city.

“About 20 to 25 farmers sell their cocoon at the market daily. At times, the production goes up to 3.5 tonnes a day. Yet, the demand for cocoon has not been met,” an official with the district sericulture centre said. In Coimbatore, cocoon is produced at Annur, Narasipuram and Thondamuthur.

Pointing out that the state government usually comes up with new targets every year to increase the production, the official said this year the production target has been increased to 400 tonnes and that the centre had already met 75% of target.

The entire silkworm rearing cycle is just 28 days and farmers could earn on monthly basis. But due to lack of awareness, the official said, many farmers were not taking up the rearing process. Even though the quantity of silk thread produced from bivoltine silk cocoons is lesser than that of crossbreed yellow cocoons, most farmers produce bivoltine cocoons because of their ability to reflect the colour after dyeing. About 700–900 metres of thread could be obtained from a cocoon and a kilogram of cocoon is sold for Rs 440 approximately, he added.

“Until a decade ago, farmers will have to rear the silkworms from the day 1 during which the worms are prone to diseases and survival rate was low. A certain temperature should be maintained, and it should be fed four times a day. The leaves should be shred properly. But, now the rearing process is not complicated at all,” the official sad.

With the introduction of Chokki Rearing Centres (CRC), where worms would be reared till it attains the stage 2 before handing it over to the farmers, the entire process has become simple, the official said, adding that the state government has, also, been giving subsidies for setting up of shed, plantation and installing drip irrigation.

Naveen Patnaik

BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday announced a development plan to decongest Cuttack city. The plan involves upgrading the existing ring road into a six-lane road and building a new township.

Naveen visited the land reclamation site on the occasion of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose’s birth anniversary to review the development plan. State 5T secretary V K Pandian and works secretary Krishan Kumar briefed the chief minister.

The township has been proposed over 424 acres of land between Hadiapatha to Baliyatra ground on the Mahanadi river front in line with the existing Cuttack Development Authority (CDA) township.

“The reclamation of land from our lifeline Mahanadi has created a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to breath fresh life into the core of our ancient city. Every inch of the 424 acres will be utilized to add ecological, recreational, sporting, cultural, aspirational and technological value in the lives of the people of Cuttack,” Naveen said.

The chief minister said it will be the state government’s endeavour to prepare a decongestion plan for Cuttack with facilities like wider roads, better accessibility, public spaces, utilities, parks, modern urban infrastructure, parking and greenery.

The new township will be surrounded by a world-class river front. The state government plans to spend around Rs 1500 crore for the purpose.

The government will engage an international-standard city planner to prepare the plan. The government will also seek suggestions from the people before preparing the final plan, an official source said.

State urban development minister Pratap Jena said with the increase in population there is a need to create a new township with facilities like residential areas, space for official and commercial activities, convention hall, sports complex and tourism points. The 2011 census pegged the city’s population to around 6.01 lakh.

“The guidelines of the National Green Tribunal will be kept in mind while preparing the plan for the new city,” said a senior official.

Representative image

While the idea of integrated bus stand at Vellalore was conceived to reduce traffic congestion in the city by redirecting outstation buses to its periphery, activists and the public are doubtful of the project meeting its purpose.

K Kathirmathiyon, a member of road safety committee, said, “Developing infrastructure like access road is very important. The city corporation is yet to conduct a meeting with various stakeholders in this regard. If it focuses only on constructing the bus stand, it would have the same fate of the new bus stand at Mettupalayam which by and large remains unused.”

Citing the high court directions, he said the buses that ply to places within 55km radius of the city should be operated from Gandhipuram bus stand. “It means, buses to Tirupur, Mettupalayam, Pollachi and Sathyamangalam should be operated from Gandhipuram bus stand.”

Pointing out that the project was earlier proposed to be implemented by the National Highways wing of the state highways department, Kathirmathiyon also wondered whether the city corporation would be developing infrastructure that was mandated by the central government.

Devendran, a member of Coimbatore road safety association, said the new bus stand would cause a lot of inconvenience to the commuters. “At it is located on the outskirts of the city, traveling to the bus stand itself would be a tedious process.”

M Velankanni Raj, general secretary, Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said steps should be taken to reduce the traffic congestion in the present setup, instead of integrating all the bus stands at one place and causing inconvenience to the public. “Traffic congestion would only increase if the bus stand is moved to the outskirts of the city, as additional buses would be plied to ensure connectivity to the all the places from the bus stand. This would also affect the entire schedule of buses.”

NEW DELHI: Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday that if a visit to Shaheen Bagh by him could end the stir, he would have ended it in five minutes. When pointed out to him that people were suffering because of the road being blocked by protesters, the chief minister said that no inconvenience should be caused to people due to a protest, which, however, was everybody’s right.

Addressing a town hall with Times Now, Kejriwal accused the central government of bringing in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to divide people because it was unable to solve unemployment and economic crisis. “It is beyond my understanding that when the country is going through such a bad phase of economic downturn what the need to bring CAA was. If CAA and NRC are removed, people will return to their homes,” said the chief minister.

Complete Coverage on Delhi Elections

Asked whether he thought Hindus and Sikhs who escaped from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and were staying in six different camps in the city should get citizenship, Kejriwal said for the sake of these six camps, the entire nation had been plunged in turmoil. When he was asked if the problems of millions of Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis and Christians were of no consequence to him, Kejriwal said he was bothered about the problems of millions of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Christians, Parsis and Muslims living in the capital.

Questioning the need for CAA, the CM said, “This has been done to divert attention from the issue of unemployment among members of these communities in the country... The uproar has been created because they do not have the guts to talk on economy and unemployment. This country is made of various religions and castes. Those who are trying to divide the country will never succeed. Better education, health, infrastructure, electricity and water — and not CAA and NRC — will take this country forward. People of this country are great, and they will not let divisions creep in.”

Kejriwal will be addressing several town halls till the end of the month. On Thursday, he elaborated on the work done by the Aam Aadmi Party government and the ‘Kejriwal Ki 10 Guarantee’ cards which are being distributed among people. In this card, Kejriwal has promised that all free public services being provided currently — free electricity up to 200 units, 20,000 litres of water per month and free bus ride for women — will continue for the next five years besides making other promises.

The CM apologised for the delay in some work like installation of CCTV cameras in buses. “In the past five years we have done a lot of work and the remaining work will be done in the next five years,” he said.

About his next plans for the next five years if his party returned to office, Kejriwal said his government will augment the primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare system. “More mohalla clinics and polyclinics will be built. Yamuna will be cleaned, and 11,000 buses will be procured,” he added.

PANAJI: The Corporation of the City of Panaji has sought Rs 500 crore in grants from the 15th Finance Commission, which will be utilised for solid waste management , public transportation, environment protection and heritage conservation, said mayor Uday Madkaikar.

Madkaikar also informed the commission that the state government was not sharing any funds with local governing bodies.

“Earlier we used to get octroi. But with GST coming in, we have stopped getting octroi. In the last three years, we did not get a single rupee. We used to directly collect octroi from the fuel stations. But then the government took over that, saying they would give it to us. However, now that has also stopped. For the last three years, we have not received anything, and this is affecting us a lot,” said Madkaikar.

CCP had sought Rs 1,000 crore from the 14th Finance Commission, but received just Rs 15 crore. “We have asked a total of Rs 500 crore. They asked us why we want Rs 500 crore, and we showed them why we need that much money. The main thing is we need to clear Panaji’s garbage and we need to improve transportation. We also need money to develop a parking app,” he said.

Vijayawada: A 16-year-old girl, identified as Hema, died allegedly of high fever in Ibrahimpatnam on Thursday. A day after she was cremated, her father Likita Babu alias Krishna registered a complaint with the police accusing his parents Kunchala Sivaiah (65) and Tirupatamma (60) of killing Hema.

Police said that prima facie evidence indicated that the girl was suffering from fever before she died. But based on the complaint of Likita Babu, they registered a case of suspicious death.

Police said that Hema was raised mostly by her grandparents. Her father in intervals would often return to claim the child back and then again give the child back to his parents. Matters had come to a head when the women and child welfare department had to intervene and Hema was sent to stay in a hostel before she was sent to live with her grandparents again.

394,['24/01/2020'],Goa: New qualification norms for constituting pollution board,"This story is from January 24, 2020

PANAJI: The chairman as well as member secretary of Goa State Pollution Control Board will both have to be well-qualified and experienced in environment-related studies.

However, an officer from the government or semi-government body or from the university, having the necessary qualification and experience could be appointed to these posts. With this, the chances of a politician occupying the chairman’s post will be very slim.

The environment department has proposed new guidelines for constitution of the pollution board as the Supreme Court had directed all states in 2017 to formulate guidelines for the purpose.

As per the guidelines, the chairman should have a master’s degree in science relating to envirnonment, or a bachelor’s degree in engineering in a discipline relating to envirnonment/doctorate in environment management, and experience from a recognised unversity or institution, and “excellent record of peer reviewed research publications”. He/she will also need to have ten years experience relating to environment protection, including in industrial pollution mitigation, water treatment or air pollution. He/she could be an officer from the state/public sector undertaking or university holding analogous post and possessing ten years practical experience relating to envirnment protection.

The member secretary will have to have a master’s degree in science relating to environment or bachelor’s degree in engineering in a discipline relating to environment. He/she could also be an officer from the state government or from the university, or any other statutory bodyholding a PhD in science related to environment.

Members representing local civic bodies will have to have bachelor’s degree in science or engineering, or at least HSSC in science/diploma in engineering.

395,['24/01/2020'],"People from Jamia, Kashmir have come to Uttarakhand to disrupt peace: CM Rawat","This story is from January 24, 2020

Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat

DEHRADUN: Chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat said on Thursday that he had “got feedback that some people from Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia as well as from Kashmir had come to Uttarakhand with an intention to disrupt law and order situation in the state by provoking people.”

Rawat added that “such people will not be allowed to succeed and strict action would be taken against them.”

The CM was speaking on the sidelines of an event in the state capital. “People have the right to hold peaceful protests, but we will not allow people from Jamia and Kashmir to provoke people of Uttarakhand. We will not tolerate it at any cost.”

Rawat added, “Agar bahar ke log yahan aakar uksaane ka kaam karenge to humko sakhti karni padegi (If people from outside provoke people here, we will be forced to take strict steps.”

The protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Uttarakhand have remained largely peaceful and limited to districts such as Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar. Political observers linked the CM’s statement with the ongoing protest against CAA-NRC at Haldwani, which has continued for the second day in succession.

Meanwhile, taking a swipe at CM Rawat for his statement, Congress state chief Pritam Singh told TOI, “In democracy, one has the right to protest in a peaceful way. I fail to understand how the government can stop a person from protesting in any part of the country.”

Singh added, “It appears that the CM’s statement was meant to create confusion and disrupt law and order in the state. If some so called anti-social elements had entered Uttarakhand, police would act against them. In fact, in that case, the CM should be telling people what action has been taken against the provokers.”

Singh added that “while the CM is silent over key issues such as deaths due to illicit liquor consumption, migration and lack of jobs, he does not shy away from making a statement on sensitive issue such as CAA and NRC.”

Meanwhile, DG law and order Ashok Kumar said that so far, protests have been peaceful in the state. “There was a protest in Haldwani on Thursday and we had inputs that some people from Jamia and Kashmir were involved in the protest there,”he said.

Kumar added that police is on alert mode. “I have directed DIG Kumaon and SSP Nainital to remain alert on the issue and keep a tab on people who are coming from outside to take part in the protests.”

VIJAYAWADA: Drugs Control Administration officials cracked the whip on blood banks across the state on Thursday by conducting surprise inspections at 43 blood banks, including 13 government blood banks, where they found various irregularities.

The director general of DCA Kripa Nand Tripathi Ujela, in a statement, said that they found various irregularities like absence of medical officers, non-maintenance of calibration records of equipment and instruments, not performing quality control tests for blood components , improper maintenance of records and improper storage of blood and blood components. “Show-cause notices have been issued to all blood banks and once we receive their explanation, legal action deemed fit will be initiated against the violators as per the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940,”he said Kripa Nand.

397,['24/01/2020'],Crop insurance: State moots loss and profit sharing model,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: The state government is pushing what it calls the cap and cup model for Prime Minister’s crop insurance scheme. Launched during first term of the BJP government, the scheme is heavily subsidized by the Centre and state with farmers having to shell out only 2% of the premium.

Now, the state has come up with a proposal that if an insurance company suffers losses beyond a certain level, the government will intervene and share the burden. Also, if the profits exceed a specific level then it has to be shared with the government by the insurance company.

The scheme has, however, drawn flak from farmers’ groups who say it has only ended up with insurance companies netting in huge premiums with a little payout to farmers as compensation. This is because of the terms and conditions of the policy, the groups pointed out.

As the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture visited Nagpur as a part of its tour to study the insurance scheme in the state, government official also came up with the cap and cup model suggestion, said sources. The committee headed by Parvatagouda Gaddigoudar, BJP MP from Bagalkot in Karnataka, held a meeting on Thursday at a plush hotel which also led to severe criticism.

Under the cap and cup model, level of sharing the losses and profit can be kept at 20% or so on both sides, said a source. The plan is just at drawing board level. Further details like whether the sharing will be done by the state government or both state and Centre have to be worked out, the source said.

The state’s agriculture department has also mooted that crop insurance must be made voluntary. At present, it is mandatory for those who are availing crop loans. A section of farmers feels it is their money that is being used to pay the compensation for those in crisis-ridden areas like Marathwada, which is prone to losses.

As members of the parliamentary committee met farmers’ representatives, a common grievance was over the system of measuring losses by insurance companies. Farmers’ groups also made calls for doing away with the system of allotting areas to insurance companies and allowing all the companies to freely compete in a given market.

At present, specific areas are allotted to companies on the basis of bidding. Farmers, however, want the right to choose among all insurance companies, said sources.

“Crop insurance is the only scheme where there is no freedom of choosing the service provider because a specific company is allotted a given area. The point is valid and will be taken up,” said a source privy to the meeting’s proceedings.

There were calls to reduce the geographical area for calculating the losses too. In Maharashtra, a block of villages is considered as a single unit. So if only a village is affected by natural calamity, farmers cannot get the compensation if the entire block is not affected. This prevents many from getting the benefit of the insurance scheme. In Rajasthan, the unit has been fixed at panchayat level, this covers 2-3 villages and at times only one, a source said.

Navneet Rana, MP from Amravati and also part of the committee, said, “Insurance companies are earning almost Rs21 crore a day, but farmers hardly get anything in the name of compensation. The basic unit for measuring losses need to be brought down to village or panchayat level.”

Dehradun: Taking umbrage to Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat’s statement that Jamia students and Kashmiris are disrupting peace in the state, the members of Jammu & Kashmir Students Association asked the CM to focus on ensuring the safety and security of Kashmiri students “rather than issuing provocative statements”.

Terming the remarks of the CM as “bizarre and shocking”, spokesperson of the association Nasir Khuehami said, “What the CM has said is not acceptable and must be condemned in harshest words. We, the Kashmiris, are a peace-loving people and one shouldn’t use us for their political benefits.”

He further said it was “disheartening to hear such baseless and concocted statements from a democratically-elected chief minister of a state”.

“He must look to ensure and strengthen the law and order of the state rather than issuing such baseless statements,” he said, adding that the association urges all Kashmiri studying in Uttarakhand to desist from any activity that could disrupt peace. Notably, there are over 1200 Kashmiri students studying in various institutions across the state. Several Kashmiri students of the hill state had also faced a backlash after the Pulwama attack in 2019.

They also claimed that HAL, which was part of the team that organized the aero show, had said that no parking fee was levied on any of the exhibitors or visitors who had parked their cars in P4 parking area where the fire incident took place.

The factory was auctioning the molasses at Rs 2,550 per tonne, when their regular rate with Goa Dairy was Rs ... Read More

PONDA: The registrar of cooperative societies (RCS) has directed the Sanjivani Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana at Dharbandora to keep in abeyance the auction of around 1,000 tonne of molasses till further order. Admitting that the RCS has emailed the directive to the factory, a highly-placed officer at Sanjivani said that the very same body (the RCS) had earlier cleared the auction of the byproduct.

The officer, who did not want to be named, said they could not keep the molasses for a long time, and were in the process of auctioning it only after taking the permission from the RCS.

“As there was only one party that had responded to the tender floated by the factory late December 2019, we had to accept the bid— even though the rate quoted by them was very low, as compared to the rate finalised to Goa Dairy,” said the officer.

Molasses is a liquid byproduct that is separated from raw sugar when it is processed in the centrifugal machine. During the last crushing season of the factory, between December 13, 2018 and February 28, 2019, a total 1,088 tonne of molasses was generated, and the factory was attempting to sell it. However, as the rate of Rs 2,550 per tonne quoted by the firm that had won the bid, Siddhi Enterprises from Kolhapur, Maharashtra, was very low, the workers of the factory first raised their suspicions about the deal . Later, the sugarcane cultivators opposed the move as well.

Molasses is also used in preparing cattle feed and Goa Dairy has been purchasing it from the Sanjivani Sugar factory at a rate of Rs 9,500 per tonne. As a result, factory workers said, selling the molasses at such a cheap rate to the Kolhapur-based company, was just not justifiable.

After they raised suspicion over the deal, the RCS has directed the factory to keep the auction in abeyance.

The sugar factory official said that Goa Dairy does not have sufficient space to store large quantities of the molasses, and is therefore unable to purchase all the stock.

Dairy administrator Arvind Khuntkar said that they already have sufficient stock of molasses to last them until February. The dairy’s cattle feed plant uses around 120 tonne of molasses per month, and only has the room to store the stock required for three months.

BENGALURU: The JD(S) is looking to leverage anti-Citizen (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and National Population Register (NPR) sentiment sweeping the country to revive itself and will hold protests in Bengaluru and New Delhi.

The Bengaluru protest is scheduled for Friday. At a meeting of party workers in Bengaluru on Thursday, party patriarch HD Deve Gowda and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy urged the rank and file to participate in the rally to send out a loud and clear message to the BJP.

""The BJP has set out to make Muslims second-grade citizens. India has 40 crore Muslims, can these communal forces eliminate them all?"" Gowda said in his address. ""We should have the guts to launch a massive protest at Jantar Mantar. We should be prepared to go to jail in the fight against [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi and [Union home minister] Amit Shah.""

Gowda said he will lead the rally in Delhi and urged secular parties to unite to take on the BJP. ""It is important that regional parties, which share a secular ideology, unite on a common agenda and fight the BJP. Bihar, Kerala and Odisha have said they will not implement CAA. The sentiment is likely to spread to other states,"" Gowda said.

Kumaraswamy said not only Muslims but many other communities will also bear the brunt of BJP’s ""divisive politics"". ""This pair of Hakka-Bukka [Modi and Shah] is not targeting Muslims alone,"" he said. ""For them, all communities other than upper caste Hindus are inferior Shudras. They will treat even Lingayats, Vokkaligas and Dalits with the same contempt.""

The former CM made a special appeal to Lingayats, who generally back the BJP, to stop supporting the saffron party’s caste-oriented politics. ""You had appreciated my farm loan waiver scheme and promised support in the elections. But, the results were contrary to that,"" he said.

The JD(S) passed three resolutions including one to condemn the Centre for enacting CAA. The others were to protest against the Centre’s indifference to the floods in the state and the failed economic policy of the Centre.

DEHRADUN: To check the issue of migration from the hills, chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Thursday directed all the government departments to prepare a report on work done in this regard in a month's time.

The chief minister also proposed to establish a ‘Migration Mitigation Fund’ to encourage locals to stay back in their native places and provide job opportunities.

For the areas lying close to the border, the CM said that officials should “make flexible plans, that are suitable to the needs of people living in these belts.”

""In such areas, the opportunities are limited and we need projects which are flexible in nature and can be easily done, and also provide financial stability to people,” the chief minister said.

Uttarakhand has witnessed large-scale migration in the last two decades with over a thousand villages left with no residents. Rawat pointed out that special projects have to be started in the identified villages to check migration and boost reverse migration in the hills.

Rawat also directed the officials of forest department and tourism department to “work as a team to come up with a strong eco-tourism policy.” The tourism officers were further told to come up with a mobile app which had district-wise information of a place’s flora and fauna, tourism spots, trekking routes, hotels and homestays.

“This will help tourists in exploring new and different locations in the state during their visit,”added the CM.

DEHRADUN: Hundreds of women and children are observing a 72-hour-long protest against CAA and NRC at Haldwani ’s Taj Chauraha.

While the protest at Taj Chauraha, which started on Wednesday will continue till January 24, another organisation, ‘Samvidhaan Bachao Manch’ will also hold a 72-hour-long protest in Haldwani from January 25 onwards.

Over 300 women and children, covered in blankets, blazers and shawls, sat on protest at Haldwani’s Taj crossing, braving the low temperatures and icy-cold winds. The protesters said that they were determined to register their voices of dissent against CAA and NRC which have been passed by Parliament recently.

Ekra Ali, one of the children at the protest site, said, “How can we sit at home at a time when our country is in danger? India’s secularism and Constitution is under threat by these laws that have been framed unconstitutionally,” she said.

Ruksara Begum, 50, added that “even though I am unable to walk properly due to knee pain, which has increased due to the extreme cold, I came to take part in the protest since it is for a rightful cause.”

Meanwhile, leader of opposition Congress’s Indira Hriyadesh reached the spot on Thursday to extend her support to the protesters. “I want to assure you that our party is with all of you in this fight,” she said.

The district administration meanwhile said that the protesters should have taken their protest to the designated ‘dharna sthal’ in the city rather than sitting at Taj Chauraha.

From Saturday, members of ‘Samvidhaan Bachao Manch’ will hold a 72-hour-long protest at Buddha Park. One of the protester said that they will also celebrate Republic Day at the same spot on Sunday.

INDORE: Over 1000 residential and commercial structures are coming in way of road development projects proposed under Indore Development Scheme (masterplan) 2021.

Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has recently conducted a GIS survey and identified 1160 buildings in 48 colonies that will pose hurdles in development of five roads - MR-5, MR-11, MR-3, MR-9 and RE-2.

However, officials have not confirmed how many of these structures will be affected and said it would be decided only after a physical survey.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh, “These structures have been identified on the basis of a GIS survey and a physical verification of each one of these structures would be done. Once completed, we will start issuing notices and remove constructions. Their owners will be provided with TDR benefits.”

The proposed roads will be developed under town planning scheme. IMC will be able to impose ‘betterment charges’ on property located up to 500 meter with the roads after implementation of the scheme.

“Betterment charges will be collected along with property tax on fixed annual instalments for three years,” added Singh.

The civic body has also made provision for these projects in its annual budget, and officials are in process to obtain Rs154 crore loan from Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) to develop the roads.

State government has also been given its nod for construction of four roads. However, approval of MR-9 Road has been put on hold because of Indore Development Authority’s (IDA) scheme – 171, which is coming in the way of this project.

MUMBAI: November 6, 2019, was an ecstatic day for residents of Charkop Jin Prem cooperative housing society in Kandivli (West).Their gleaming new 14-storey tower finally received a “full occupation certificate”—permission to occupy the premises—from the building permission cell of Mhada , the state housing authority.What makes this project unique is that it was executed by residents themselves under the self-redevelopment scheme. No builder was involved. The planning, funding, selection of building contractor, right down to choosing the tiles and fittings was entirely done by the 28 society members.“We completed the project in two years,” said a beaming Manish Asgaonkar, secretary of Jin Prem society. On a recent afternoon inside his family’s new flat, Asgaonkar said taking the onus of redevelopment was not a cakewalk. Some junior level civic officials and engineers created obstacles, trying to fling non-existing rules at them and, at times, demanding speed money for building clearances, he alleged. “But ultimately, we challenged them and prevailed,” he said triumphantly.The experience of Charkop Jin Prem society will be a case study for thousands of housing societies that want to redevelop their properties but do not want a builder to step in. The model, where residents rebuild their homes without a builder, is still in its infancy, but slowing gaining momentum.With thousands of families left in the lurch by fly-by-night builders , a new model has emerged with architects, project management consultants, contractors and others taking full responsibility for successful execution of such projects.Last year, the state framed rules for self-redevelopment, granting incentives to societies that chose it.Jin Prim was Mhada’s high-income group (HIG) building constructed in 1991. Its residents, mainly Gujarati and Maharashtrian, occupied 1BHK, 418-square-foot flats. Over the years, the building was twice repaired for leakages and plastering. In 2014, the 22 flat owners and six shopkeepers decided to redevelop the five-storey building themselves and passed a resolution. They were also aware of several stalled redevelopment projects in the neighbourhood, which had been abandoned by builders.Under Mhada’s 33 (5) Scheme, the society redeveloped the property into a 14-storey tower with 53 flats, each a 3BHK measuring 705 sq ft. Three flats in the new building were handed to Mhada as its share under the scheme . Six more were sold to outsiders for Rs 85 lakh to Rs 90 lakh each. These six flats were sold at Rs 2,000 a sq ft less than the market rate. The remaining larger free sale flats were brought by society residents themselves, who paid a concessional Rs 60 lakh each. The project cost Rs 17.5 crore. “No bank loan was taken. We raised the money ourselves,” said Asgaonkar. Bhushan Desai, Mhada’s executive engineer (self-redevelopment cell), said it has offered 11 offer letters to societies keen on self-redevelopment.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73571385,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-352410,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/charkop-building-to-serve-as-case-study-for-self-redevpt/articleshow/73560240.cms

Mumbai: A six-year-old daughter of pavement dwellers who was sleeping between her parents under the Matunga flyover was kidnapped, hit with a brick and perhaps sexually assaulted by an unknown person late on Wednesday night. The child has been admitted to Sion Hospital where she is battling serious injuries.

What has baffled the police is that the child was kidnapped from under the flyover which a stone’s throw away from Matunga and Sion police stations.

On Thursday evening, Matunga police were in the process of registering a kidnapping and a suspected sexual assault case against an unknown person.

Sources said if it is medically confirmed that the child was sexually assaulted, police will register an offence under stringent sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act. Offences under the Act are non-bailable.

According to Matunga police, the child slept off between her parents under the Matunga flyover on Tuesday night. Around 4am on Wednesday, her mother rose to find her daughter missing. She immediately woke her husband and the two began to look for her.

Around 8am, a college student found the child lying injured behind an ashram at King’s Circle.

She alerted the police who rushed to the spot. The child’s parents too reached soon after. They rushed her to Sion Hospital where she is being treated.

Police said prima facie it appears the child was kidnapped for sexual assault and suspect the assaulter hit her with a brick in a bid to kill her and fled.

Matunga police have formed a special team to trace the suspect. “We have got blurred images of the suspect (from CCTV footage) and have launched a hunt for him,” said an officer of Matunga police.

INDORE: Breaking the record for the third time this academic session, the highest placement package of Devi Ahilya Vishwavidyalaya (DAVV) turned out to be Rs 30.5 lakh per annum as the varsity concluded its last phase of campus recruitment.

A+ grade in National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) seems to have boosted the centralized placement cell (CPC) and has helped attract over 70 organizations to the varsity for campus placement.

“While the centralized placement cell had been working efficiently in getting students placed, it is after the grade that over 500 students placed at these organizations,” CPS coordinator Dr Dr Suresh Patidar told TOI.

This year’s highest package of Rs 30.5 lakh was bagged by a student of Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).

“Final year engineering students of IET from Computer Science and IT department have bagged the highest packages. Whereas two MCA students of IIPS also got a package of Rs 15 LPA,” said member of CPC, Nitin Nagar told TOI.

Over 1000 students of the varsity have received offer letters and some of the placement offers are still expected by the varsity.

Nitish Kumar

HARIDWAR: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to intervene in the case of Sadhvi Padmavati who has been on an indefinite fast at Matri Sadan ashram in Haridwar since December 15 last year to press for cleanliness and uninterrupted flow of the Ganga .

In his letter dated January 22, the CM expressed concern over the deterioration in Padmavati's health and underlined the need for getting her fast terminated early. He requested the PM that “meaningful initiatives should be taken on the issues raised by the sadhvi.” This was revealed by the water resources minister of Bihar Sanjay Kumar Jha who along with Nalanda MP Kaushalendra Kumar, reached the ashram on Thursday to lend support to the sadhvi's fast. Notably, Padmavati is a resident of Nalanda in Bihar.

Her chief demands include cancellation of all dam projects — under construction or proposed on the Ganga in Uttarakhand, maintaining a minimum of 50% regular water flow in Ganga as per an IIT expert study, and compliance of all orders of the National Mission for Clean Ganga regarding mining in Ganga and its tributaries. Padmavati is also demanding formulation of a Ganga Act as well as initiation of an active discussion involving Matri Sadan and other organisations working to protect Ganga.

Nalanda MP Kaushalendra Kumar while interacting with mediapersons termed Sadhvi Padmavati as “Nalanda's daughter”, adding that “people were with her as she wants that Ganga should flow without hinderance.”

Seers at Matri Sadan meanwhile said that the ashram felt particularly betrayed by the government which had promised in writing a ban on construction of all dams on Ganga as also on mining in the river and its tributaries when Brahmachari Atmabodhanand ended his 194-day fast in May last year. But the government went back on its promise, they alleged.

Bhubaeswar/Sambalpur: Rich tributes were paid to legendary freedom fighters Subhas Chandra Bose and Surendra Sai on their birth anniversary on Thursday.

Janakinath Bhawan, the birthplace of Netaji at Odia Bazaar in Cuttack, was decked out as hundreds of people from different walks of life visited the place to pay floral tributes to the leader.

Governor Ganeshi Lal and chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday visited the Janakinath Bhawan, which has been converted into Netaji museum. They paid floral tributes to Netaji statue there.

Schoolchildren and visitors made a beeline for the museum on the occasion and got to know about the leader’s life through memorabilia displayed in various galleries. An array of activities, including sand art, blood donation camps and cultural programmes, were organised at the museum to mark Bose’s birth anniversary.

Members of All India Forward Block observed Netaji Jayanti in Bhubaneswar by garlanding his statue. They demanded the day be declared Deshprem Divas.

The 212th birth anniversary of Suredra Sai was observed in different parts of the state. In Khinda, which is the birthplace and located 40 km from Sambalpur, people from all walks of life gathered to pay homage to the son of the soil. A torch rally was organised at Khinda during the occasion. The rally originated from Khinda high school and culminated at the birthplace of Surendra Sai.

Similarly, several programmes were organised in Sambalpur to mark Surendra Sai’s birth anniversary. People, including members of political parties and cultural and social organisations garlanded the statue of Surendra Sai at Jail Chowk in Sambalpur. The district administration and Odisha Sanskrutik Samaj, a Sambalpur-based socio-cultural organisation, jointly organised a memorial meeting in the evening. Students of the various schools took out rallies.

Surendra Sai was born in a royal family on this day in 1809. He started a revolution against the British at the age of 18 only. Sai was captured by the British in 1840 and lodged at Hazaribagh prison. During the Sepoy Mutiny, his supporters broke the Hazaribagh prison in 1857 and freed Surendra Sai. And, he resumed his revolution against the British. “In 1864, Surendra Sai was again sent to Asirgarh Jail near Burhanpur, where he died on February 28, 1884,” said Deepak Panda, a writer.

The role of Surendra Sai in the resistance movement against the British colonialism is a turning point in the history of freedom movement in Odisha. “He fought a battle for self respect. Surendra Sai and his supporters fought against the British for 20 long years. Sai spent 37 years in prison,” said Panda.

COIMBATORE: Teachers, who handle Classes XI and XII, say errors in government textbooks are yet to be notified. With just about a month to go for board exams, teachers said they were forced to point out corrections to the students without any official source material.

Teachers in the district said the Tamil Nadu State Council for Education Training and Research (TN SCERT), which prepares the content for the textbooks, had formed a review committee and asked subject resource persons from across the state to send in their inputs regarding the errors spotted in textbooks.

“We had sent reports more than two months ago to SCERT in Chennai. But so far there has been no official announcement regarding the issue. We have to now identify the errors to be rectified and ask students to correct them. With the students preparing to face board exams in March, this has caused a serious concern,” said a Class XII teacher, who is also a resource person from the district.

Teachers said there were logical, spelling and printing mistakes in the textbooks. For example, in the seventh chapter, ‘Differential Calculus’, of Class XII mathematics textbook, answers are given wrong.

Pointing out that some portions of the syllabus were heavy for the students, resource persons said those portions could be omitted. “The solution book, which was published recently, doesn’t have answers for these sections. We have not been officially announced about dropping the sections,” said the resource person.

A teacher, who has authored a chapter in Class XII mathematics textbook, said authors had compiled the errors and submitted them to SCERT. “The work is ‘under process’ at the council.”

When contacted, SCERT officials denied to respond, saying the principal secretary to the department of school education was the authorized person to comment on the issue. Attempts to contact principal secretary Pradeep Yadav didn’t yield any result.

NEW DELHI: Responding to an emergency requirement in the Maldives , India on Thursday supplied 30,000 doses of measles/rubella vaccine to Male . While measles has been eliminated from the Maldives, four cases have tested positive in the last week and the local government suspects an outbreak.

Male had initially approached Denmark and also Unicef for the vaccine but both apparently said they would require at least four weeks to arrange and supply it. It was then that the Maldives government approached the Indian embassy on January 20.

""The MEA , working closely with the ministry of health, procured supply of 30,000 doses of measles/rubella vaccine from the Serum Institute of India, Pune, and delivered the consignment on January 23. This will suffice the immediate requirement of Maldives,'' an official source said here, adding that India once again proved to be the first responder in an emergency for Maldives.

The government said in a statement that India's swift response underlined that health remained one of the strongest pillars of bilateral cooperation between India and Maldives.

In 2015, India had responded to a water crisis in Male due to breakdown of the main RO plant . India airlifted water and sent supplies by ship, including an RO plant. In 2004 too, India sent assistance when a tsunami struck Maldives.

Talking to reporters at Salem on Thursday, Dhinakaran said that it was saddening that Rajinikanth has spoken about Periyar based on false information at 50th anniversary function of Thuglaq magazine.

“Periyar struggled throughout his life for the upliftment of Tamil people without any expectations. Rajnikanth should have avoided his speech about Periyar,’’ he said.

“Rajini’s remarks are condemnable,’’ he said.

Meanwhile, Ramanuja Jeeyar , the pontiff from Mannargudi, backed Rajinikanth.

Santosh Kumar Upadhyay inaugurates the hospital

BERHAMPUR: A food processing unit will soon start functioning from the Berhampur circle jail . The construction of the Rs 1.03 crore building is nearing completion.

The unit will be operated by the jail inmates and they will get incentives for this, director general of police (prisons), Santosh Kumar Upadhyay, told the media here on Thursday. He inaugurated a 30-bed hospital building inside the circle jail.

At present, a weaving unit, tin trunk-making unit and a printing press are operating inside the circle jail and the inmates are working in the units. The incentives, which they earn by working in different units of the jail, will help maintaining their families outside the jail, he said.

Now the hospital is functioning in a ward with 10 beds in the jail while outdoor is functioning separately.

Of 30 beds in the proposed hospital, 10 are earmarked for women, he said.

Though two doctor posts, including that of a psychiatrist and a medicine specialist, have been sanctioned for the new hospital, it would initially run by the existing doctor. There are two other staffers — a male nursing orderly and an attendant. The hospital will cater to the needs of about 800 inmates in the jail.

At present, around 150 inmates visit the outdoor. Besides, serious patients are also treated in the hospital as the circle jail has declared it as a referral jail, an official source said.

“We are giving much stress on health of inmates and hygienic condition in the jails across the state,” he said. In the circle jail, he said, there is a need to maintain cleanliness of toilets. He also said the old buildings of the circle jail need repair.

The top police officer said sophisticated devices will be procured from abroad to monitor use of the mobile phones by the inmates from inside the jail.

ALAPPUZHA: Sixteen people including 13 tourists (two babies and a child) from Kannur had a narrow escape after a houseboat caught fire near Pathiramanal isle in Vembanad Lake at Muhamma on Thursday. Muhamma police suspect either a short circuit or LPG leak from the kitchen as the cause of the accident.

“The incident took place around 1.15pm. Muhammad Fazal, 24, and Abdul Rasheed, 25, of Nellunni, Kannur, and their family and relatives boarded the double decker boat ‘Oceana’ from Kumarakom around 11.30am. The guest team comprised six women, four men, two babies and a four-year-old boy. Besides them, there were three boat crew members. As the boat reached near Pathiramanal, the kitchen part caught fire and it spread to the rest of the boat. Fortunately, there were sand bars nearby with just five feet of water. So, the tourists and the boat crews jumped onto them,” police said.

The state water transport department’s boat ‘S-54’, conducting service from Muhamma to Kumarakom witnessed the incident and came to their rescue. They shifted three women, one man, two babies and the boy to the main land. Though a speed boat had come to shift the remaining people, it sank near the sand bar. They were later shifted to Muhamma in another boat.

Muhamma sub-inspector Ajay Mohan said that no one suffered any injuries and all of them were shifted to Alappuzha Guest House.

Houseboat operators have demanded an exclusive fire station for the tourism sector but it is yet to materialize.

Vijaydan Detha aka Bijji, the Rajasthani folklorist writer, would have been pleased if he was there at JLF on Thursday.

Author Vishes Kothari who translated Bijji’s work and released a book was part of a discussion at the fest.

He said the tradition of storytelling has always been a work of the poor. “Most of the oral traditions are followed by people from the most unprivileged background. Among those, women are the treasurer of the tradition who would sing hymns and songs while doing their daily chores. Men would work outside and women would keep the tradition alive. Dijji followed those people and recorded their stories,” Vishes said.

Chandra Prakash Deval, who was part of the conversation, said folk tales could create magic. “Folk tales should not be looked from the glasses of literature. The power of folk tales has been continuing for thousands of years. Hitopdesh and Arabian Nights are a few examples which are still prevalent. If a story is good, it will be remembered for generations to come. Dijji recognised and collected these stories from people,” Deval said.

Talking about Dijji’s work, Vishes said to keep the Rajasthani touch in the stories, he kept original words and phrases in the same language. “I had to convince my publishers about it. There are words that have different meanings in Hindi and Rajasthani. There are many traditions followed in Rajasthan that will lose its relevance if translated,” he added.

During the bull race at Kothakottai on Wednesday, a bull owned by R Raman, a farmer, died after falling into a well located near the finishing line. A police officer investigating the case said, “The bull race organisers did not adhere to prescribed safety norms due to lack of safety measures at the arena. After a commotion by the crowd that had gathered led to damage of public property, the Vaniyambadi taluk police arrested bull race organisers R Pazhani, M Shankar and M Boopalan and remanded them in judicial custody. Police have launched a search to nab C Annasamy, S Chinnathambi, and the bull owner Raman, who were absconding.”

Addressing the media, Tirupattur DSP Balakrishnan said, “The accused were arrested under Section 289 (negligent conduct with respect to animals), Section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle, etc.), Section 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC, and under various sections of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 2017, and Prevention of Public Property Damage Act.”

File photo used for representational purpose

CHENNAI: More than half the youngsters in Chennai who drink outside their homes do so in cars, carparks and on beaches as they can’t afford bars and pubs, says a recent survey. They also complain that they often don’t get their favourite tipple unlike in other cities.

The survey was conducted 45 days ago by the International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), a representative body of multinational alcoholic beverage companies. Amrit Kiran Singh , ISWAI executive chairman, said in Chennai the survey covered 3,000 respondents comprising both men and women in the age group of 21 to 35 years. “We carried out the survey in seven top liquor selling states including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu,” he said.

Among the revelations was that 48% of the respondents prefer to have a drink outside their homes. But since there were no affordable pubs, 44% drank in cars and parking lots and 10% in public places such as beaches.

“We have not come across a similar issue in Bengaluru as reasonably priced pubs are available there. In contrast, Tamil Nadu has unique rules such as the one that a pub must be attached to a hotel with a minimum of 10 rooms,” he said. This made services in the pubs expensive.

One of the main grouses of respondents was that their favourite brands were not available and if they were, they had to pay more. Besides, 79% 0f respondents said illegal sale of liquor after permitted hours and on dry days was prevalent in the city.

Amrit Kiran Singh said TN was facing acute shortage of popular international brands manufactured within India. “We met the Tasmac MD on Thursday with a representation to procure all varieties of IMLF manufactured in other states. It will bring revenue to the state, as well,” he added.

428,['24/01/2020'],Conversation about female sexuality shouldn’t only be about consent but also desire: Elizabeth Gilbert,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Publisher Alexandra Pringle with Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert at the JLF on Thursday

On her maiden visit to the Jaipur Literature Festival , American author Elizabeth Gilbert spoke about her writing journey from her bestselling memoir ‘Eat, Pray, Love’ to her latest novel ‘City of Girls’, published in 2018.

Gilbert spoke of facing a two-year-long depression after her first divorce. “I was fraught with shame. I had done everything you were supposed to do to be a good woman: gotten married and settled down, but I had a nervous breakdown because that life didn’t suit me,” she said. “And it made me physically, emotionally and spiritually ill.”

Gilbert also spoke of her dislike of the institution of marriage and how it resulted in her writing her next book ‘Committed’, just as she was remarrying. “I didn’t want to enter that institution again, so I spent time learning about the history of marriage,” she said.

“There is not a single sociological data at which single women don’t outperform married women — they live longer, they’re healthier, have more wealth.”

Gilbert went on to talk about creativity, as explored in her book ‘Big Magic’. “Art is making something more beautiful than it needs to be,” she said. “It’s our shared human encounter and we can’t be emotional or spiritually healthy without creating.”

Describing her last book ‘City of Girls’ as a “celebration of female sexual desire”, Gilbert spoke of how it questions the omnipresent literary trope of the “ruined woman”. The book was also written during the height of the MeToo movement in 2017.

“I don’t want the conversation about female sexuality to only be about consent. It places women in a passive role. What that takes away is the real aspect of female desire and longing.”

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The bodies of eight Keralites, comprising two couples and four children from two families who died in a mountain resort at Daman in Nepal on Tuesday, are expected to be brought in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode on Thursday and Friday respectively.

The embalmed bodies of five persons from the family residing in Chenkottukonam near Thiruvananthapuram will be flown from Kathmandu to New Delhi on Thursday morning and then to the state capital by an Air India flight late in the evening, it is learnt. According to the information provided to relatives, the bodies of the three persons hailing from Kunnamangalam in Kozhikode will reach Kerala only on Friday.

After the autopsy and the embalming procedures were completed by Wednesday noon, the bodies were moved to Tribhuvan University Hospital in Kathmandu.

The state government announced that it will bear the entire cost of bringing back the bodies, following an initial ‘miscommunication’ with the Indian Embassy in Nepal. “Indian embassy officials did not communicate to us in time that the embassy will not be able to bear the expense,” said a Norka official.

The initial confusion occurred as the deceased were on a leisure trip to Nepal, where visa is not required for Indians and there was no clarity whether they had tourist insurance coverage, the official said.

The transportation would cost anything between Rs 8-10 lakh, and the chief minister’s office intervened immediately after some news channels reported that the Indian embassy wouldn’t be bearing the expense. According to embassy officials, they were yet to receive a directive from the Union ministry of external affairs or the central government for providing financial assistance.

CMO then directed Norka department to bear the entire expense. Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran expressed shock at the ‘disrespectful’ stand taken by the Indian Embassy.

“We need to take a humane approach in such situations. We shouldn’t push the bereaved families into deeper grief. Whatever assistance is needed to bring the bodies back will be borne by the state government,” said Surendran on Wednesday.

Marcus du Sautoy

The inaugural session of Jaipur Literature Festival kicked off with a keynote address on ‘The Arts, Sciences and Creativity’ by Oxford University professor Marcus du Sautoy and classical singer Shubha Mudgal. Sautoy began by talking about the stories that science can tell. “Science requires precision but also huge amount of imagination,” he said. “Mathematics in India used to be written in poetic form – mathematics was poetry and there is poetry in mathematics.”

Highlighting the important role of AI in our lives, Sautoy addressed the fear of this new technology taking over. “But we believe AI will never be able to do is match human creativity, after all isn’t it an expression of our inner soul,” he says. “But in this decade, it seems AI might show signs of creative acts. How long before we have a piece of AI telling us at JLF, telling us about its new novel? It’s not so far away.”

Sautoy also argued that literature can be a way to give empathy for humans. “Literature gives us a way to understand each other,” he says. “We are worried whether AI really understand us. We want AI to be our side, and I think it is through stories that we can find a pathway together as collaborators and not competitors.”

Mudgal spoke on art and creativity through a fable of a king who wanted to sculpt, but was told by a sage to first learn the basic of painting, instrumental and vocal music. “It illustrates the overarching significance of an interdisciplinary approach in the Indian tradition,” she said. “It illustrates the vast scope and many directions in which one can journey with the arts. Calling creativity “an exercise in extending the boundaries of your chosen discipline”, Mudgal ended the session on a melodious rendition of a Sahir Ludhianvi poem .

Jayshree Periwal, who introduced the session on Mythology for Millennial with Meenakshi Reddy Madhavan and Anand Neelakantan, kicked off the discussion with the remark mythology is not science, but a way of life.

The session was essentially about ways of writing mythology in modern times and the relevance of these tales.

Neelakantan, who penned the famous Bahubali series said, “I rationalise what I write. There are no gods, no devils, no villains, no heroes in what I write. I essentially do not write about what’s good or evil, but more about the political scenario. There is no right or wrong, but a perception of what we try to get from history.”

While agreeing that epics are still relevant, Madhavan added, “Epics are relevant even now. The drama is still the same, but societies change.”

Both the authors expressed concern about the current scenario with references to ‘good days’ and ‘Hindutuva’, they agreed that there were no ‘godliness in their writings’.

Neelakantan said, “The aim is to take the message from history and books that we write are a part of convenience. Good versus evil is a western concept. Stories change with changing times and societies.”

Madhavan said, “I believe in living and adapting to things and what is in our head doesn’t mean that it is not real.”

The authors lamented that though they take inspirations from mythological characters, they add characters to their books as per the requirements.

Actor Nandita Das on Thursday joined the list of celebrities opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act. She endorsed the series of protests being held at Shaheen Bagh and other parts of country. While speaking with reporters at JLF, she expressed her urge as a ‘human being’ to speak against such laws while denying any politics behind the protests.

“I believe everyone should speak about it. In fact people are speaking. There are spontaneous protests all over country,” she said.

She said the youth and common citizens protesting against the Act are triggering ‘hope’ while the CAA with National Register of Citizens (NRC) pose a dangerous mix. She insisted the CAA went against the sentiment of equality and divided people on religious lines.

“People who have been here for generations and you are telling them this is not your country. This is upsetting,” she said.

The Manto director was at the festival to speak about her experience of directing a movie and writing a book. “It is not easy to get technical aspect in the movie and apart from direction, it was also an emotional experience for me. In today’s scenario in the country, Manto’s struggle becomes even more important and relevant. Now even the Bollywood fraternity is speaking about the ongoing situation in the country.”

She also appeared concerned on the issues of unemployment, economic slowdown and corresponding reports in foreign media. She felt India was being discussed as a country where people are being divided on religious lines.

She was delighted that few members from the film fraternity, too, have spoken against the Act. She, however, seemed reluctant to discuss the ongoing controversy between the actors supporting the Act and those against it.

This is also likely to spike the state’s production of gram and wheat in the coming period, stressed the state agriculture department officials.A report released by the ministry on the area coverage under rabi crops as on January 10, 2020, stated that higher-wheat sown area had been reported from Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, among others.A state agriculture department official told TOI that area under rabi had been on the rise this time. “When there is late rain, like it happened in September and October 2019, the moisture availability in soil increases. This prompted farmers to plant more gram and wheat. It is likely that the area under the two crops may also go up,” he said.Ravi Patil, programme coordinator, Krushi Vikas Gramin Prashikshan Sanstha, said, “The rain during September and October last year increased moisture content in soil. Considering the optimum moisture level in soil, farmers planted more gram and wheat.” Anmol Raut, who heads a farmer-producer company, said the area under gram and wheat had gone up for most farmers in his company. “Area under gram has seen a spike compared to wheat, which means there will be an increase in gram harvest,” he said.",pune,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73571310,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-524532,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/wheat-gram-sowing-area-rises-in-state/articleshow/73562891.cms

CHENNAI: The first phase of Census 2021 in Tamil Nadu will be held for 45 days in June and July, says the state government’s communication to the census department. The second phase will be held between February 9 and 28 next year. The first phase will consist of house listing and housing census in which 34 questions will be posed to every household.

“Since 1971, we have been having two phases of census. We started preparing for this year’s census three years ago. Maps have been readied based on the number of districts in a state. There is a number code based on the state, district, taluk, town panchayat, village panchayat, municipality, corporation and ward. If an enumerator is working in a ward in Chennai city, he or she will be collecting details under a numerical code,” said a census official. Tamil Nadu has 37 districts, including the newly created ones. “We have made all arrangements for enumeration even for the new districts. But any further division of districts will not reflect in the forthcoming census,” said the official.

Training of enumerators will start in April-May. Four national trainers have been deputed to Tamil Nadu. They will train master trainers at district level. “About 1.5 lakh enumerators (mostly school teachers) will be on the field. There will be a three-day training programme for enumerators during which time they will be trained to handle the census app. All entries will be carried out using the apps installed in their smartphones,” said the official.

The first phase is likely to take about 20 minutes per household. “We had a dry run a few months ago in Ilayangudi in Sivaganga district , Coonoor in Niligirs district and Maraimalainagar in Chengalpet district . We observed that the app can work offline and once the enumerators starts using the app frequently, the time per household will come down,” he said.

Along the state borders, people who are well versed in Tamil and the regional language of the neighbouring state will be deployed for enumeration. Apps can be downloaded in all regional languages. For instance, an enumerator in Kanyakumari district will use both Tamil and Malayalam apps. The app will be available in Tamil, Kannada, Telugu, Malayalam and Hindi, he said.

The centre is spending more than Rs 500 crore for carrying out census in Tamil Nadu. If a house is locked during the enumerator’s visit, the staff will pay one more visit within the 45-day schedule fixed for enumeration. If the house is locked during the second visit also, it would be recorded as locked house, said the official.

Puducherry: The Karaikal police on Thursday arrested notorious woman goon R Ezhilarasi alias Meera, who was booked in three murder cases, including the murder of former speaker and minister V M C Sivakumar, under the Goondas Act .

The action came after the Karaikal collector issued an order to detain her under the Goondas Act following recommendations from the district police.

A police team, which reached the goon’s house, arrested her and took her to the SP’s office for preliminary inquiries. This is the second time she has been booked under the act. She was set free by the Madras high court after she was detained under the Goondas Act earlier.

The second wife of slain liquor merchant Ramu alias Radhakrishnan, Ezhilarasi was involved in a series of murders and attempt to murder cases. She murdered her husband’s first wife R Vinodha in 2015 and a travel agent Iyyappan in 2014 to avenge the murder of her husband. She engaged goons to murder the former minister in 2017 following a dispute over the properties of her husband. The former minister and her husband were close friends but turned foes after her husband abandoned his first wife and married her.

Pune: The state government’s department of sainik welfare has decided to formulate a policy for mandatory registration and regulation of private military training academies to check rising instances of cheating of army job aspirants.

Laxminarayan Mishra, the department’s officiating director, told TOI, “We have decided to form a team which will study the nitty-gritty of functioning of these academies and based on their findings, we will draft a policy which will be submitted to the general administration department (GAD) under which our department functions.”

Mishra said that there is a need to register and monitor these centres on a regular basis. Currently, they register themselves with the state’s charity commissioner’s office. “But their periodical inspection is needed for monitoring their functioning,” he added.

Over the last two years, the Military Intelligence (MI) unit of the Army’s Southern Command and the police in Kolhapur and Satara have exposed five cheating cases in which either owners or staffers of private military training academies were involved in illegal activities.

“In the absence of a proper regulatory mechanism, these academies exploit job aspirants. The government should delegate powers to either the district sainik welfare officers or the tehsildars for carrying out periodical inspection of these academies and check possible malpractices,” said another officer from the department.

As of now, more than 100 such academies operate in Satara, Sangli, Kolhapur and Pune. Most of them are run by ex-servicemen. These academies run classes for physical fitness, written examinations, etc on a daily basis.

“Since the owners are ex-servicemen, it becomes easier for them to lure job aspirants by boasting of their connections in the armed forces. Many aspirants and their parents fall for such claims and pay hefty amounts to the academy owners,” a senior official said.

NEW DELHI: The new deadly coronavirus infecting people in China has no cure at present. No vaccine exists either to prevent the disease. India, therefore, is on alert to prevent the spread of the infection here from China, where it originated. In case it does spread, top doctors say, the hospitals are well-equipped to handle the situation.The virus causes flu-like symptoms, for example cold, chills and respiratory distress.Dr Randeep Guleria , the director of AIIMS , told TOI that evidence so far suggests mortality rates of the virus aren’t very high. “The government has already put in thermal scanners at airports to detect possible cases. So far, there have been none. But even if such cases are found, we have enough infrastructure and expertise to contain the spread of the disease,” he said.AIIMS, Dr Guleria said, has a cubicle where six to seven patients can be isolated for treatment. “Depending on the requirement, we can increase the capacity of isolation wards 100% or more,” he said. Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) and Safdarjung hospitals, too, have infrastructure in place to create isolation wards at short notice. Infected people may be required to be separated from other patients and the general population.Like seasonal influenza , which is quite common these days, coronavirus infection also spreads from an infected person to others through the air, by coughing and sneezing or through close personal contact. Dr Amit Suri, consultant in medicine department at RML hospital, said maintaining hand hygiene and following respiratory etiquette is important to prevent the spread of the disease.According to Dr Rommel Tickoo, senior consultant for internal medicine at Max Saket, not many people are aware of the new infection at present. “If a case is diagnosed in India, then people may panic. We need to have plan in place to educate the public about preventive measures if such a situation arises,” he said.Last year, scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) — the most important health research bodies in the country — had identified 10 emerging viral infections that could pose a threat to public health in India. The list included MERS-CoV, or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to 26 countries.The Wuhan illness, as the new infection is being described because its epicentre is in the Chinese city called Wuhan, is of the same family that caused MERS-CoV.“National Institute of Virology, Pune is developing protocols to test the infection. In the next few days, more laboratories may be equipped to test people suspected to be infected,” Dr Chand Wattal, chairman of the microbiology department at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said.Union health secretary Preeti Sudan on Thursday said she has asked states and union territories to review hospital preparedness in terms of isolation and ventilator management of critically ill patients, identify gaps and strengthen core capacities like surveillance and laboratory support.Thermal screening is being done at the international airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin.In Video: Taking all preventive measures, no need to panic, says Kerala Health Minister on coronavirus",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73571473,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-525729,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/ready-to-deal-with-chinese-virus-hospitals/articleshow/73564420.cms

Thiruvananthapuram: The tragedy that occurred in Nepal has once again underlined the meaning of friendship. Friends of Praveen and Ranjith, who died in an unfortunate accident at Nepal, have taken the lead to help their bereaved families. They are coordinating procedures to bring back their bodies while ensuring help to relatives.

Ram Kumar and Jayakrishnan, who were travelling with Praveen and Ranjith, were busy on Wednesday. Ram and Jayakrishnan shuttled from hospital to embassy and the airport in Kathmandu to arrange the transport of the eight bodies and ensuring travel arrangements for five of their family members. Two of their friends from college days had rushed to Kathmandu on Monday itself. Another batchmate, who is working in the US, made the reservations for the family members to travel home.

Sandeep Krishnan, a batchmate of Praveen and Ranjith, said the autopsy procedures were completed and they were waiting to transport the bodies. “The flight tickets are yet to be confirmed but we expect the bodies of Praveen and his family to reach Thiruvananthapuram by Thursday evening. There are also reports of flights being delayed, so it is yet to be confirmed whether it will be possible. The families of both Ram and Jayakrishnan along with Ranjith’s elder son Madhav are on their way home,” he said on Wednesday evening.

Praveen’s neighbour Sreejitha G said that Praveen’s parents are deeply depressed. “His aged father and mother are mentally drained after learning about the tragedy. They had to be given medical assistance on Tuesday night. Praveen’s sister Praseetha’s husband came back from Dubai on Wednesday morning,” she said. Neighbours and relatives are staying with the family.

Vikram Sampath, Hindol Sengupta & Makarand R Paranjape

Swami Vivekananda’s call for national consciousness, Savarkar’s idea of Hindutva and Sardar Patel’s unapologetic Hinduness were held up to scrutiny at the Jaipur Lit Fest on Thursday, as writers and historians Vikram Sampath , Makarand R Paranjape and Hindol Sengupta came together to discuss the three “enigmatic” figures from modern Indian history.

Along the discussion, the speakers arrived at the conclusion that the common thread tying these three historic characters was their assertion for a “national identity, independent from religion”. “There’s an elephant in this room… It is ironic that we are having a conversation about these three individuals in the Mughal tent,” said Paranjape, while responding to an audience question. He added that there was an elephant in the Mughal Tent, and that was a non-mughal elephant. The “difficult question” that remained unaddressed, according to Paranjape, was the idea of a “political Hindu identity”, which was propagated by all three historical figures.

The speakers, while calling their branch of study as “corrective history”, maintained that the subjects of their research were not given their due in history. “It’s not surprising that there was no biography written about Sardar Patel for several decades before I wrote about him,” said Sengupta, adding that these figures were not studied because it did not suit a particular idea that the mainstream historians were trying to promote. Sampath said the same of Savarkar. “Savarkar was a persona non grata for the longest time. He was not studied by those who criticised him, or even those who claimed to have ownership over him. He was an untouchable when it came to academicians,” said Sampath, adding that it was important to revisit history and write it from different prisms and lenses.

Thanjavur: Technological gaps and post-harvest losses have led to acute shortage of pulses in India, director of IIFPT, C Anandharamakrishnan has said.

Addressing a two-day workshop jointly organized by the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and National Research Council of Canada for strengthening scientific partnership and collaborations in research on pulses, Anandharamakrishnan said that currently there is an acute shortage of pulses for consumption in India. “There is a 50% decline in per capita availability of pulses (since the last) three decades. The situation leads to the import of around five million tonnes of pulses annually,” he said.

“Due to lack of appropriate technology at field-level, post-harvest losses in pulses have also increased by 10%. There is a strong need to increase the domestic output, novel technologies for value addition, waste minimization and development of alternative food products for protein supplementation. So, the workshop aims to derive action points for conducting collaborative research with Canada to bridge technological gaps in Indian food industry and improve the economic prosperity of farmers by creating a strong backward linkage,” he added.

“The key areas of collaboration between two countries would be development of value-added products from pulses, engineered dynamic gastrointestinal system, technology for production of vegetarian meat with pulses and establishment of a pulse biopark in Tamil Nadu, alternative dairy products and alternative protein supplementation replacing the pulses,” he added.

Pitam Chandra, former director, Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering, Bhopal, inaugurated the workshop. Ramesh Vijayan, scientist, SERB, Sankaran Krishnaraj and Sijo Joseph from Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Kishore Rajagopalan from National Research Council, Canada, represented the Canadian delegation.

KOLKATA: The extinction of Dholavira — the biggest and most spectacular Harappan city in present-day Kutch district of Gujarat — was caused by the drying-up of a massive river that originated in the Himalayan glaciers in prehistoric times because of climate change , research by a team of scientists from IIT Kharagpur suggests.The river that ran through the desert of the Rann of Kutch was one of the main sources of sustenance for Dholavira. The scientists, led by geologists from IIT Kgp, said this was the first time that the existence of a perennial river located by a Harappan site was being vouched for.The findings, which have excited historians and archaeologists across the world, have been published in the Wiley Journal of Quaternary Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal published on behalf of the Quaternary Research Association. It covers research on any aspect of quaternary science, an inter-disciplinary field of study focusing on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years.The scientists said the river dried up because of climate change, when the glacier feeding it melted away. They said the river might remind one of the mythical Saraswati, which is also said to be lost, but is definitely not the same. The researchers have not been able to christen it yet, but have concluded that it might have been a distributary of the Indus, or might have been a “paleochannel” that ran beside Dholavira. A paleochannel is a remnant of an inactive river or stream channel that has been filled or buried by younger sediment.The river existed since prehistoric times but the civilisation started proliferating from 5,500 years ago and died about 3,800 years ago. The research has concluded that when the residents of Dholavira sensed that the river was gradually drying up, they adopted an advanced water-conservation system that helped them to survive for the last 1,700 years.While the research was led by Anindya Sarkar and his team from the department of geology and geophysics, the other agencies that collaborated were the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Deccan College PGRI Pune, Physical Research Laboratory, and the department of culture, government of Gujarat.“Our data suggest that prolific mangroves grew around the Rann, when the river existed in the near southern margin of the Thar desert. This is the first direct evidence of the glacier-fed river, quite like the Saraswati, in the vicinity of the Rann,” Sarkar said.Ravi Bhushan and Navin Juyal from PRL, Ahmedabad dated the carbonates from human bangles, fish otolith and molluscan shells by accelerator mass spectrometer and confirmed the dating of the site. From potsherds and other remains found at the site, the researchers have also concluded that the Dholavirans were probably the original inhabitants of the region and had a fairly advanced level of culture even at their earliest stage. The study indicates that the city expanded for 4,400 years followed by an abrupt decline. Researchers R S Bisht and Y S Rawat from the ASI, who originally excavated the site, concluded that the decline was evident in the degeneration of architecture, craftsmanship and material culture of Dholavira.Arati Deshpande Mukherjee of the Deccan College said: “We have evidence from high-resolution oxygen isotopes in snail shells Terebralia palustris, which typically grow in mangroves and was a source of food for the Dholavirans.” Researchers also concluded that the snail isotopes suggested that the mangrove was fed by a glacial river that existed near the site. The drying of the river coincided with a mega drought period that is known in history as the Meghalayan drought. “Indeed, Dholavira presents a classic case for understanding how climate change can increase future droughts,” added Sarkar.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73567974,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-711350,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/climate-change-wiped-out-ancient-river-city-iit-study/articleshow/73565345.cms

The repoll will be held on January 24 between 7am and 5 pm. Incidentally, in all the impersonation cases, women cast votes.

According to TSEC secretary M Ashok Kumar, a woman voter, wearing a burqa, entered the polling station number 101 in Ward No 41 of Kamareddy municipality cast her vote in the morning at about 7.45 am. At about 4pm, another woman with the same voter slip number, claiming she was the genuine voter, cast a tendered vote with the permission of the presiding officer. The district collector admitted that there was laxity in the identification of the voter and also polling agents did not object to the impersonation due to either collusion among them or appointment of ineligible persons as polling agents.

At polling station 87 of Ward No 32 of Bodhan municipality, a woman voter, also wearing a burqa, walked into the booth around 10.45am and cast here vote. Later, around 1.45pm, another woman, claiming to be the actual voter, found her vote had already been cast by another woman. She produced her Aadhaar and other identity proofs too. She was allowed to cast a tendered vote after verification. The district collector found grave irregularities in the conduct of poll process at the polling station. In this municipality too, the SEC ordered repoll on January 24.

Repoll was also ordered in the Mahbubnagar municipality, where-in polling station 198 of Ward No 41, two burqa-clad women cast their votes. “When the polling staff asked them to remove the burqa, the women refused to do it stating that it was against their custom. They were allowed to vote based on their documents. The original voters came in the afternoon and exercised their tendered vote,” the secretary said.

452,['24/01/2020'],Top cop promises ‘security audit’ of lovers’ points in city,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Nagpur: City police chief BK Upadhyay on Thursday promised a survey of places lovers visit for some quiet moments, putting themselves at risk of being targeted by goons. After the recent gang rape of a Standard XI student, Upadhyay wants to ensure security cover at such locations between 7pm and 10pm, when lovers are most likely to meet.

City police already have ‘dark spots’ identified in their anti-crime strategy, where patrolling and manpower are pressed into action at specific time slots. The latest survey too aims to thwart goons targeting couples at isolated places.

The city has witnessed some attacks on lovers at desolate places. Mohd Afroze Pathan and his gang had targeted several couples in the dark stretches along the Outer Ring Road in 2014 before being nabbed. The gang, like in the latest incident, would rob couples and also rape the women.

The police had promptly arrested the three culprits, including a juvenile, in the latest incident near Bhilgaon-Ranala Road on Tuesday. The top brass is now contemplating a more comprehensive security plan at certain isolated places. Lovers are known to visit these places despite awareness being created about locations more prone to attacks.

Upadhyay had in the past tried to create awareness among youngsters and their families to avoid isolated places as they are more risk-prone. This was done after the Hyderabad gang rape and murder incident. However, some sections of society did not heed the warnings nor implemented self-security measures.

“I intend to instruct officers to conduct a security audit in their police station jurisdiction, and identify the spots where couples mostly visit. We need to identify the unsafe places and introduce patrolling during vulnerable hours,” said the city’s top IPS officer. Upadhyay said police vehicles would visit such places at least twice or thrice in the sensitive time period.

In the meantime, New Kamptee police have allowed the court to take Shaikh Anwar and Mohnish Borkar into magisterial custody after producing them before the magistrate on Thursday to enable an identification parade soon. The cops have reserved the right to take the accused in remand later. The minor was sent to the government shelter home.

INDORE: Dearth of writers for visually impaired students appearing in board examinations is a problem that arises every year. Students run pillar to post in search of writers and often are forced to give it a miss unable to find one.

But still no concrete steps have been taken by directorate of public instruction (Lok Shikshan Sanchalnalay) for these special children, who overcome all the odds to appear for the board exams .

Over 400 visually impaired students from Indore district and nearly 8000 visually impaired students from Indore division will appear for the board examination this year. And the problem is making them apprehensive and alarmed.

“Although it’s easy to find a writer for visually impaired for competitive examinations, it becomes a tedious task during board examinations. Although its’ duty of exam centre to provide a writer for visually impaired student, it’s only on paper. In reality it’s the visually impaired student that takes his own writer,” coordinator of Sanjeevani Seva Sangam, Sunil Singh Tomar told TOI.

Writer needs to be one class junior as writer for visually impaired student for which it becomes a task for them to find a suitable writer as their exams and that of the regular students take place in almost the same time.

“The biggest task that students appearing for board exams face is finding an eligible writer, who is able to understand and write in a good speed. In Class 10, my friend and I were ditched by our writer and so this time, we decided to find an additional writer to be sure,” said visually impaired student Kamlesh Patel, who will be appearing in Class 12 exam this year.

Other issues faced by visually impaired students are slow speed, bad handwriting and low understanding capacity of writer. There have been times, when visually impaired students are unable to give board examination due to unavailability of eligible writer.

“We also have a writer bank for competitive exam as there are no rules for such exams except the fact that writer should have basic knowledge of computer as most exams are conducted online,” development officer of National Association For The Blind (NAB), Sanjay Lokhande told TOI.

Moreover, there are times when new invigilator, who are unaware of rules end up wasting additional time in checking papers and asking for additional documents.

Indore: A man hired by an NGO for monitoring ‘illegal ways’ of Dewas Municipal Corporation (DMC) catching stray dogs with metal pincers for sterilization under Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme was allegedly held captive for more than four hours by civic staff.

The man identified as Manish Vishwakarma was hired by Roopa Patvardhan, a local animal activist of Dewas to follow DMC’s workers engaged in catching stray dogs.

In a complaint to MG Road Kotwali police station, Patvardhan alleged that Vishwakarma was standing in front of DMC headquarters at 8.00am, when four DMC workers approached him and started hurling abuses.

“My worker was standing on main road and was speaking to me over phone when he was roughed up by Hemant Ubnare, a DMC health officer and three others. They abused him, snatched his mobile phone and dragged him to headquarter building and made him sit inside control room for more than 5 hours,” said Patvardhan while speaking to TOI.

She also claimed that workers also threatened him of dire consequences for recording videos, when they go and catch stray dogs. Patvardhan reached control room and asked DMC workers to let the guy leave. “DMC employees were not ready to let go my worker and he was released only when I approached police and lodged a complaint in this regard,” she added.

DMC commissioner Sanjana Jain refuted to allegations and said that the man was caught by workers on suspicion of theft of valuable items kept on premises of DMC building. “There were complaints that some individuals were stealing items like bathroom fittings etc from our premises on suspicion of which our staff caught the man and handed him to police,” commissioner said. Kotwali police said that they have received complaints from both victim and accused corporation employees. “While complainant alleged misbehaviour and being held captive, corporation employees accused him of stealing their equipment and hampering work. We are looking into the matter,” DSP Kiran Kumar Sharma told TOI. Animal activists had been alleging DMC staff of capturing stray dogs with metal pincers. Around 20 days back, Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) had issued a warning to DMC for using metal pincers to capture strays.

INDORE: Tukoganj police have arrested two persons including son of a policeman posted to 15th battalion colony for trying to extort money from manager of a coaching centre by posing as cops.

The accused were identified as Shubham Bansotiya, resident of 15th battalion colony and Rahul Kokre, 25, resident of Bhagirathpura.

According to police, complainant Vaibhav Sharma , resident of Vidyapati building, who ran an online learning education website, told police that two persons posing as police official had asked for Rs1 lakh from him. They said that his website hadn’t been registered and if he wants to continue his business without any hindrance he should pay them the money, police said.

One of the accused told complainant Sharma that he had been posted in Vijay Nagar police station. Sharma became suspicious and went to Vijay Nagar and enquired about them and came to know that there had been no policeman of such names. He then lodged complaint with Tukoganj police.

Meanwhile, Sharma bargained the amount of money with accused and the deal was done in Rs 25,000, police said. Both accused went to his office for collecting the money from him on Friday evening, when police arrested them. Kokre worked in a private company and was a friend of Shubham’s friend and went along with him, police said while talking to TOI.

AHMEDABAD: A 15-year-old girl from Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh, which was recently in the news due to two particularly brutal rape cases there, was brought to the city with the promise of work by a distant cousin and his wife, who then allegedly pushed her into the flesh trade in the Sola area of the city.According to the FIR registered at Sola police station, the girl, from Kailash Khera-Patan village in Unnao district, whose mother is widow, was lured to the city by the Sola-based couple with the promise of work. The accused, Dipak and Varsha Verma, both around 35, were arrested by police on Thursday.“The Vermas went to Unnao in December, where they told the girl’s mother that they would get her a job in Ahmedabad. The girl, a Class VIII dropout, was not ready to leave her widowed mother alone, as her two brothers work in Nepal and Kanpur, and she refused at first,” said Inspector D H Gadhvi of Sola high court police.Gadhvi said that the girl was then promised a great deal and she ultimately decided to take up the offer. On December 22, 2019, they brought her to the city and took her to a shop at a mall on Science City road.“The shop looked like a spa from the outside but was actually where a prostitution racket was running. On December 23, they forced the girl to go with a man, who raped her,” said a city police official.The girl was raped every day since December 23 by various men.

He was sent to Sola police station, where an FIR was registered.Gadhvi said they have registered an FIR for rape and molestation along with charges under the POCSO (Protection of Children against Sexual Offences) Act.“We have conducted the medical examination of the girl which confirmed that she was raped multiple times,” said Gadhvi.He said police are hunting for the men who had sexually abused the girl.",ahmedabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-73573741,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-164038,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/unnao-teen-pushed-into-sex-work/articleshow/73563318.cms

Jaipur: The budget session of the assembly beginning on Friday is likely to be stormy. The session has been convened early to pass a resolution against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and to approve the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill extending reservation to SC/STs in the state assemblies and Parliament.

The law providing reservation to members of SC/ST communities for the past 70 years in Lok Sabha and state assemblies is due to end on January 25, 2020.

The Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha on December 12 while Lok Sabha had passed the bill on December 10. The state assemblies have been asked to pass the amendment by January 25 by the Union government.

The session will also see the state Congress government pass a resolution against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)

“The Rajasthan government will introduce a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the assembly session beginning Friday,” deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot told reporters at the PCC HQs here.

He said the Centre should listen to the people protesting against the Act across the country and asserted that the democracy weakens if there is no dialogue.

“We are requesting the Central government to reconsider the Act. The Constitution has given the right to protest but if someone does it, they are attacked and called anti-nationals,” said Pilot on Thursday.

Kerala and Punjab have already passed the resolution seeking withdrawal of the new legislation.

After passing the resolution, which is likely on Monday, the session will be suspended until the state budget is ready for presentation by February end after the Union budget.

“Business Advisory Committee meeting of the House will be held after the obituary references on Friday,” said Mahesh Joshi, chief whip of the assembly.

He said it is likely that the assembly will be in session on Saturday also.

The Opposition will also corner the government on the delay in panchayat elections after a tussle between the state election commission and the panchayati raj department over delimitation of panchayats.

Meanwhile, the Opposition BJP at its legislature party meeting held on Thursday issued whip to all party MLAs to be present in the House during the session.

While talking to media, Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria questioned the move of the ruling party and asked how could Congress bring a resolution against CAA when the matter is pending at Supreme Court. He said there could be no discussion in the House on a sub judice matter.

He added that the SC/ST reservation bill was passed in assemblies and parliament in December but the state government was sleeping all this time and now an assembly session has been called hurriedly to pass the legislation.

Vaishalini further states, “My sister-in-law was not in good terms with me after my husband’s death. So, she very often picks up fights over trivial issues.”

“When I was standing at a swing inside the club at around 7pm on Thursday and was holding my cellphone in my hand. My sister-in-law and her two kids passed from nearby and asked me why I was clicking their photos. When I told them that I did not click their pictures, they began abusing me,” Vaishalini states in the FIR.

NAGPUR: Patrolling cops, led by zonal DCP Vinita Shahu, intercepted a car in the wee hours of Thursday near Futala Lake in which five drunk persons, including two defence personnel, were travelling. Cops have booked car driver for drunk driving.

According to sources, during night patrolling, DCP Shahu spotted a car suspiciously stationed near Futala Lake. “On seeing the police vehicle, car driver tried to flee. The police chased and intercepted the vehicle at some distance. The police found that the driver was under the influence of liquor. Four others in the car, including two defence personnel, were also in inebriated condition. We booked the driver for drunk driving and others were let off after warning them under sections of 110 and 17 of CrPC,” said the DCP.

It is learnt that of the two defence personnel, one was from army while other was from navy, both on leave. The five had stopped near the lake while returning from a private function.

“I have directed cops to send a report of the incident to the respective units of the defence personnel. We have increased patrolling in Futala area to keep a tab on anti-socials as such elements were seen consuming liquor openly. The increased patrolling has certainly reduced the number of anti-socials indulging in unruly behaviour near the lake,” said the DCP.

HYDERABAD: Women turned up in large numbers in the polling held for 120 municipalities and nine municipal corporations on Wednesday. Nearly 70% women had exercised their franchise, 1% more than male voters, 69 per cent. Interestingly, at six places, 90% of the total woman voters turned up to cast their votes, while at a dozen places, women polling percentage crossed 85. The woman voters’ turnout is nearly same as the state poll average, i.e., 70.26%.

Of the 34.95 lakh votes polled on Wednesday, 17.37 lakh voters were women, approximately 69.94%, while 17.13 lakh voters were males (68.80%), Telangana State Election Commission (TSEC) authorities said.

The women seem to have shown more interest in polling in the municipalities than the corporations. In the Choutuppal municipality in Yadadri-Bhongir district, 93.22% of women turned up to vote, while 92.46% in Chandur and 92.22% in Pochamapally in Nalgonda and Yadadri districts respectively.

“During the previous civic body elections in 2014, woman voters’ polling percentage was about 65, which was 5% more than the previous election. The number of woman candidates in the electoral contests is also rising with every election,” a senior SEC official said.

Among districts, Yadadri-Bhongir topped the list with the maximum turnout of women, scoring 87%, followed by Warangal Rural (84%), and Suryapet, Sircilla and Khammam (83% each) rescpectively.

Election analyst S Ramakistaiah said, “It is a good sign that women turned up in large number at the polling stations, but we have to see whether it will be an advantage to the woman candidates. Even politicians believe female voters are more faithful than their male counterparts.”

464,['24/01/2020'],How Madras SaaS ‘mafia’ is giving desi cos a ticket to US,"This story is from January 24, 2020

CHENNAI: After years of disciplined execution in building global products out of Chennai, a growing crop of Chennai’s tech product entrepreneurs crossed the seas in 2019 to prove their mettle in Silicon Valley.

From building teams and aligning to new cultures, it’s not an easy transition, but the new ‘Madras-Bay Area’ mafia has made it a point to help other Indian founders. They are acting as sounding boards for other founders with global ambitions and making their playbooks accessible to them to share common pitfalls.

Further, to formalise this support, a few Software as a Service (SaaS) entrepreneurs are working to launch a separate startups charter as part of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a non-profit for Indian-US bilateral ties since 2017.

With the US accounting for 70% of business for Indian SaaS, being closer to customers and outperforming American competitors are key reasons for making the move. It is also easier for startups to go public in the US markets -- an inevitable next step for them to provide lucrative exits to global investors.

As customer support platform Freshworks gears up for an initial public offering, co-founder Girish Mathrubootham wanted to go beyond being a rock star entrepreneur in Indian startup circles, and moved permanently to Silicon Valley. “It has helped me interact with other CEOs who have gone through this journey to see growth,” he says.

Umesh Sachdev, co-founder of conversational AI startup Uniphore, shifted base to Palo Alto last year as almost half of the $350 billion customer support industry is in the US. With the US and Europe as its primary markets, founders of Chennai-based Chargebee are contemplating a move. “We spend three to four months in the US and I am considering moving this year to mainly build presence closer to customers and assist sales,” Krish Subramanian, co-founder and CEO, Chargebee, says.

Vinod Muthukrishnan, co-founder of Cloudcherry, moved to the US in 2017, and since then, has been acquired by global giant Cisco.

These startups hire a mix of sales and deep tech leaders along with frontline marketing staff in the Valley. While Cloudcherry hired 15-16 people locally, for Freshworks and Druva, the number of hires in the US is significantly higher.

Giving back to the ecosystem comes naturally to SaaS entrepreneurs, says Muthukrishnan. “Everyone hosts founders who visit the Valley, help with introductions, and help others avoid common mistakes.""

As more B2B SaaS startups adopt a dual headquarter structure between India and the US, the soon-to-be-launched USISPF Startup Connect aims to help CEOs make the transition smoothly and ensure steady pipeline of future moves. Uniphore’s Sachdev and CloudCherry’s Muthukrishnan are volunteering to lead the programme as co-chairs for now. “In its initial phase, USISPF Startup Connect wants to nurture and grow the wave of B2B startups from India and operating in the US-India corridor to drive value,” Sachdev says.

A standout feature of Chennai and Indian SaaS community is how close-knit they are, Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence says. “We hear of such a culture in the Valley, but I don’t think a parallel exists in any other industry here,” he says.

A case in point is the SaaSBoomi conference (launched as SaaSX in 2014), which brings together the community to help peers. “The objective is to get as many companies into the Rs 25 crore [revenue] and above segment as quickly as possible by helping them avoid the same mistakes other founders made,” Suresh Sambandam, founder, Kissflow, says.

With 2019 breaking down fundraising barriers for SaaS, India is all set to emerge as the SaaS hub of the world, say industry trackers.

“SaaS companies based out of India can now go and win global enterprise deals,” Mathrubootham says.

“It is great to see products being developed out of India. We need more ventures that do deep R&D in the country,” says Zoho’s chief evangelist Raju Vegesna. However, he is quick to strike a note of caution. “We haven’t seen many SaaS companies in the West turn profitable yet and we shouldn’t expect different results if Indian companies here follow the same formula,” Vegesna adds.

NASHIK: Two teams from the Centre, comprising two members each, have been in the city for the past five days for Swachh Survekshan 2020.

A Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) official said the survey began on last Friday and is expected to continue for few more days. The teams visited various parts of the city to ensure that garbage is lifted regularly, cleanliness is being maintained and citizens are not throwing waste on the road.

They also inspected some public toilets to see if they are being maintained properly. Moreover, the teams also took feedback from citizens about garbage collection and waste segregation.

The city had ranked 67 during last year’s Swacch Survekshan, but was included in top-10 clean cities during the first two quarters of cleanliness survey.

In Swachh Survekshan, there are around 40 different indicators including garbage lifting, waste segregation and composting, cleanliness drive, cleanliness of roads, public toilets and markets.

“The teams are conducting the survey and we have tried to do well in all segments to improve city’s ranking,” an NMC official said.

“We are doing our best to be among top-10 clean cities in the country. But contribution of the citizens is also important. Citizens should ensure that the city remains clean and they should segregate waste at source,” he added.

Nashik did not fare well in SS 2019 as its ranking among 425 cities had dropped to 67 from 63 in 2018. Citizens’ feedback accounts for 35% marks in the survey. But according to data compiled by union ministry of housing and urban affairs, there was poor response from the citizens of Nashik.

Apart from this, the NMC had not carried out proper documentation of cleanliness activities conducted by the municipal corporation in view of the Swachh Survekshan last year.

Nashik had figured among the top-10 cities in the first two quarters of the Swachh Survekshan League 2020. In the first quarter (April-June), the city was ranked fourth, while it slipped to seventh rank in second quarter (July-September).

NEW DELHI: Following an outcry over the move to replace “Abide with Me” by “Vande Mataram” in the “Beating Retreat” ceremony, the military bands are awaiting a final decision and practising both the tunes in the run-up to the musical ceremony on January 29.

Several prominent people have objected to the proposed discarding of Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite ‘Abide with Me’, the haunting Christian hymn composed by poet Henry Francis Lyte but usually sung to William Henry Monk’s melody “Eventide”, from the enchanting ceremony and replacing it with national song ‘ Vande Mataram ’.

A Congress spokesperson has also questioned the motive behind the move to drop ‘Abide with Me’ altogether from the ceremony held at Vijay Chowk on the majestic Rajpath . On Thursday, the Mizoram Congress slammed the Union government for pushing its “hidden Hindutva agenda”, with a senior leader claiming this was yet another move by “BJP and the Sangh Parivar organisations to suppress Christianity and other religious minorities”.

Defence ministry officials, however, said no final decision has yet been taken in the matter. They said the emphasis in recent years has been on replacing western tunes by “desi tunes” composed by Indian composers, with the popular “Sare Jahan se Achha” also replacing the decades-old tradition of playing ‘Abide with Me’ at the end of the ceremony.

Similarly, sitars, tablas and other Indian musical instruments have also been introduced in the ceremony over the last few years. This has caused some umbrage among purists who contend “Beating Retreat” is a traditional military ceremony of bugles, pipes and drums. The buglers sounded the retreat in ancient and medieval times as a signal to halt fighting, recall patrolling units and lower flags at sunset.

In 2018, 25 of the 26 performances were tunes composed by Indian musicians, with ‘Abide with Me’ being the only western tune. Last year, ‘Abide with Me’ was among the eight western tunes out of the 27 performances. This time, ‘Abide with Me’ and the ‘Drummers Call’ are the only western tunes among the 27 performances being rehearsed for the ceremony.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Thursday directed the Enforcement Directorate to file a status report on its probe into a money laundering case lodged against some officials of AirAsia India whose licence has been challenged by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy .

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar made ED a party in Swamy's petition challenging the flying licence and Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to AirAsia, a joint venture of Tata Group and Malaysia's largest budget airline AirAsia Berhad.

The court directed the probe agency to file its status report in a sealed cover before the next date of hearing on May 14. Swamy had earlier urged the court to seek a report from ED on the status and progress in its probe.

The BJP leader had, in July last year, moved a plea to stay the airline's application for permission to operate international flights but the high court had dismissed it.

In his primary plea, Swamy has contended that the flying rights granted to the carrier were in violation of the government's policy on foreign investment. He has argued that as per the policy, foreign investment was allowed only in existing airlines and was not meant for floating or starting a new airline, like AirAsia India.

The Centre has denied that there was any violation of FDI norms while granting approval to the low-cost AirAsia (India) Pvt Ltd.

Gujarat's deputy chief minister Nitin Patel (File Photo)

AHMEDABAD: Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel on Thursday said that the educated people of the country who are opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) are blind to the reality behind the changes in the citizenship law.

He further said that people with vested interests were trying to mislead others about CAA. Patel said this at the Gujarat University campus on Thursday, at an event to pay tribute to Subhash Chandra Bose, on his birth anniversary.

“Many are seeking freedom. I request PM Narendra Modi to open the country’s borders for some time so that such people can go wherever they want,” he said adding that such people (who seek freedom) “lack mental capacity”.

About the protests against CAA and the all-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Ahmedabad recently, Patel said he had no issues with students protesting outside the Indian Institute of Management . “But I have an issue with their parents for not giving proper guidance to their children,” he said.

KOZHIKODE: They all have inhaled a gas which made them go to a deep sleep. They will not wake up again and have gone to be with God. You should not try to wake them up when you see them tomorrow and should give them a parting kiss — two days after the death of his parents and younger brother in the Nepal resort tragedy , seven-year-old Madhav, the lone surviving member of his family, was told about his grievous loss by the teachers and a counsellor from his school on Thursday.

Young Madhav stared at them listless for some time and broke down in tears later.

The four-member team from Silver Hills School , including the principal and the class teacher of Madhav, broke the news to the child at his relative’s house next to Madhav’s maternal house at Mukavoor in the afternoon. Madhav had arrived at his home in the early hours of Thursday and was expecting his parents and brother to arrive on Friday.

“It was a heart-wrenching moment for all of us and we were all moved to tears. Madhav stood silent for some time and later he cried. He seemed to have somewhat understood that he has lost his parents for ever. We all consoled him and made him feel that we are all with him and later brought him a new bicycle to cheer him up,” Nikhil MC, cousin of Madhav’s mother Indu Lakshmi said.

On getting the new cycle, Madhav was upbeat and went around showing it off to his friends and relatives and riding it, seemingly forgetting about his loss for the moment.

Madhav’s class teacher Simmi S Nair said that they revealed the news of demise of his parents and brother to Madhav indirectly as being a child he cannot fully understand the concept of death.

Relatives said till then Madhav was thinking that his parents will be coming back the next day and he had told his cousins that they will be bringing chocolates, which he will share with them.

Madhav told his teachers that his parents were near him when he went to sleep at the Nepal resort and that when he woke up in the morning he had cried after finding that they were not around. Madhav also told the teachers that his father’s friend Ram uncle took him to a nearby room where he saw his parents and others all lying in the bed and that they were then taken to the hospital.

MANGALURU: The 438km Kochi-Koottanad-Mangaluru re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) pipeline that GAIL India Ltd is laying could be commissioned by March this year. Completion of this line will help GAIL India Ltd commence RLNG supply to industries and other stakeholders. This comes after GAIL failed to meet the September 2018 deadline due to issues in laying the pipeline across the Chandragiri and Nethravathi rivers.

GAIL had awarded the contract to lay the 111-km pipeline in north Kerala and Karnataka at an estimated cost of Rs 160 crore in August 2017. Work on laying the pipeline across the Nethravathi to a length of 410 metres between Innoli and Arkula should be completed by February 15, said Tony Mathew, general manager, GAIL, Kochi. The company adopted cut and cover method to lay the pipeline beneath the riverbeds with help of cofferdams

GAIL’s latest attempt in May to complete the crossing was futile, Mathew told TOI on Thursday. We faced a big challenge in crossing the Chandragiri River that is abutted by steep hills on both sides and thickly populated areas. We had to adopt drilling technology from hill to hill as it was difficult to move machinery to the river bank. At the present pace, we should complete the Chandragiri crossing by February-end, Tony Mathew said.

Workers executing the pipeline work at the Nethravati worksite at Innoli-side said the welded pipeline has been laid 6 metres below the riverbed almost up to the middle of the Nethravathi River. “We hope to complete the rest of the work by February 15,” they said. GAIL at the same time has taken up work on RLNG terminal on Arkula-side to pump gas towards Malavoor and further towards the terminal near Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilisers.

Kochi city is already deriving benefits of clean fuel, Mathew said. Most autorickshaws and taxis have been converted to use compressed natural gas as alternative fuel. Autorickshaws derive mileage of at least 40 km/kg. City gas distribution in Mangaluru with CNG as auto fuel will take time as the contractor has to lay the distribution pipelines across the city. The pipeline is designed to transport 16 million cubic metres of RLNG, he said.

Former MP VS Ugrappa said that he was willing to take on Union home minister Amit Shah in a debate on CAA

HUBBALLI: Responding to Union home minister Amit Shah ’s challenge to the BJP’s political opponents to a public debate on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act ( CAA ), former MP and senior Congress member VS Ugrappa on Thursday announced his readiness for a verbal joust with the former.

A confident Ugrappa asked the BJP to merely specify the date, place and time, and he would come prepared to take on any senior member of the saffron party. “Let Shah or Prime Minister Narendra Modi or Union minister for parliamentary affairs Pralhad Joshi step forward to participate in the debate on the controversial Act,” said Ugrappa.

During the ‘Jan Jagran’ rally in Hubballi, Shah had invited former president of the All India Congress Committee (AICC) Rahul Gandhi for a debate with Joshi. “I would ask leaders of the BJP to first face leaders such as myself before they take on Rahul, who is a tall leader. If Shah is really interested in a debate on CAA, let the BJP decide on a date, and we will be ready,” said Ugrappa.

Stepping up his attack on Modi and Shah, Ugrappa called the duo progenies of ‘Shani’ (a Demigod in the Hindu pantheon believed to bring misfortune). “Under Modi’s leadership, the country is gradually moving towards a dictatorship. Both Shah and the PM appear to be bent on destroying the spirit of the Constitution, and the secular fabric of our country,” rued the former MP.

Reiterating the Congress’ stance against the CAA, Ugrappa said that the Act discriminated between people on the basis of faith, and violated many articles of the Constitution. “The Modi government has failed on multiple fronts and meet the expectations of the people,” said Ugrappa.

The former MP was also critical of the BS Yediyurappa-led government for the declining law-and-order situation in the state, of which the bomb scare at the Mangaluru airport was an example. “It reflects the failure of the intelligence wing,” said Ugrappa.

Former MP IG Sanadi, and other Congress members such as Anil Kumar Patil and Altaf Halwoor were among those present at the press conference with Ugrappa.

MANGALURU: In a move aimed at giving wings to the dreams of air wing National Cadet Corps (NCC) cadets, the 6 Karnataka Air Squadron of NCC on Thursday started giving its junior cadets a unique opportunity to take to the skies. It is almost after a gap of more than 15 years that this NCC Air Squadron has again started this activity using Pipistrel Virus-D aircraft, for which senior air wing cadets had to go either to Bengaluru or Belagavi.

With Colonel A K Sharma, group commander, Mangalore group HQ of NCC, taking the lead to resume NCC flying in this coastal city, it was left to Group Captain A G Srinivasan who is commanding the 6 Karnataka Air Squadron to pilot this twin-seater aircraft with NCC junior wing cadets joining him for the sortie. The directorate-general of NCC has issued this Pipistrel Virus-D aircraft to the Karnataka and Goa Directorate of NCC.

Group Captain Srinivasan told TOI that it was a historic moment for the 42 junior air wing cadets undergoing their annual training camp to undertake this air experience sortie on board the aircraft that can fly to height of 13,000 feet. “Due to constraints, these sorties on an average, last anywhere between five to seven minutes,” he said, adding in the odd chance that the aircraft must hover due to the movement of other commercial aircraft, the ride becomes a bit longer.

These air sorties, also referred to as joyrides, are mandatory for cadets appearing for their A certificate. Such cadets should have passed their written test based on a syllabus, and the flying part is the practical aspect, he said. Resumption of NCC air flying at Mangaluru is also the result of efforts of earlier commanding officers of the air squadron, Group Captain Srinivasan said, hoping that flying such sorties could spur the cadets to go on and join the Indian Air Force.

474,['24/01/2020'],"Relentless opposition to CAA only way to get law repealed, says former bureaucrat","This story is from January 24, 2020

DHARWAD: Exhorting the citizenry to sustain the momentum of the agitation against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), former bureaucrat Kannan Gopinath on Thursday said, “Continuing this protest is the only way we can get the CAA repealed, and prevent the National Register of Citizens (NRC) from being implemented.”

Gopinath, participating in a symposium organised by Left parties and other like-minded organisations at the Karnataka Vidyavardhaka Sangha, said that the people needed to be a proactive part of the democratic polity. “The people’s voice must be heard in a democracy. So it is vital the people intensify the stir against CAA, NRC and the National Population Register (NPR) to keep up the pressure on the government. We must remember that the Emergency ended not because of an order issued by the Supreme Court but relentless opposition from the people,” said Gopinath.

Founder-president of the Samaj Parivartan Samudaya SR Hiremath hearkened back to the days of the Nav Nirman Movement launched by freedom fighter Jayaprakash Narayan , and opined that there was a need for a similar campaign against the CAA, NRC and NPR. “The participation of large number of women, students and other youngsters in the protests has raised my hopes of such a mass movement eventualising again,” Hiremath said.

Meanwhile, activist Ramanjanappa Aldalli questioned the Supreme Court’s reluctance to consider cases filed against the CAA, NRC and NPR. “The BJP-led NDA government is trying to make it appear as though the protest against these laws is associated with one particular community. The Congress, in its 50-year-rule over India, tried to divide the country along communal lines, while the BJP has done more in this direction in a mere five-and-a-half years. It is important for the people to continue protests against the Centre, but it is equally important that we don’t allow political parties eyeing electoral dividends to hijack the movement,” Aldalli said.

Ramzan Darga, Dr MI Sheikh, Isabella Xavier, MM Haveripet, Laxman Bakkai were among those who participated in the symposium.

BELAGAVI: It was the pride of Belagavi, the 9,600sqft national tricolour , the tallest in the country, fluttering at the Kote Kere front.

Now, the Belagavi City Corporation has decided to reduce the size of the flag that was erected on a 110-meter-tall flag pole. The size will be reduced to 5,400 sqft. And, residents here are understandably upset.

The 350-kg used to be hoisted every day. However, hoisting was discontinued after the flag was reportedly damaged in the inclement weather.

The flagpole was erected at Fort Lake, famously called Kote Kere in March 2018. A 10hp motor costing Rs 1.62 crore was used to hoist the flag. The flag had become a tourist attraction.

Assistant executive engineer, Mahantesh N who is privy to the development said the flag size will be reduced to 5,400 sqft. The corporation has decided to start hoisting the flag from January 26. Four flags at Rs 75,000 each have been stitched by a Mumbai-based company. These flags will be hoisted on rotation. The flag will be hoisted every day for a week on trial basis. If it withstands the vagaries of the weather, it will be hoisted every day. However, if it is damaged once gain then hoisting will be discontinued.

Speaking to TOI, City Corporation commissioner Jagadish H K said he will hold talks with the flag manufacturer as to how the flag can last longer.

476,['24/01/2020'],Accused used public transport to mask unlawful activities: Police,"This story is from January 24, 2020

Accused Aditya Rao being brought to court in Mangaluru on Thursday

MANGALURU: Aditya Rao ,36, an engineering and management graduate and the mastermind behind the bomb scare at Mangalore International Airport(MIA), preferred to use public transport as he thought it would make it harder for the authorities to detect his unlawful activities.

Aditya Rao, a resident of Mannapalla in Manipal, Udupi, had surrendered before the police in Bengaluru on Thursday, and was later brought to Mangaluru by the authorities. Police sources said that the accused had used public transport extensively, as it would make it harder for the authorities to trace him. “Aditya, who zeroed in on MIA as his target, had travelled in and around the airport more than four times to do a recce. He used public transport to travel to MIA. On January 20, the day he dropped the bag with the explosive material at the airport, he travelled from Karkala in a private service bus to State Bank bus stand in the city, and later boarded a bus going to Bajpe. He boarded an autorickshaw to reach the airport,” the source added.

He continued to use public transport even after dropping the explosive-material-laden backpack at the airport, and fled from Mangaluru city by using a KSRTC bus. He went to Sirsi and Shivamogga before finally going to Bengaluru. “Aditya learnt through the media that the police is searching for him and that he is the prime suspect in the case. The CCTV grabs of him were displayed across the media, and as he knew that he had less chance to escape, he boarded a bus to Bengaluru and surrendered before the police,” said P S Harsha , city police commissioner.

Why did he take up a hotel job ?

Aditya, who earlier worked in white collar jobs, which included MNCs, insurance companies and in the automobile sector, later shifted to blue collar jobs. He worked as a security guard in various colleges in Mangaluru and Bengaluru, before moving to the hotel industry. Aditya received a BE in mechanical engineering from a prestigious college in Mysuru and an MBA in marketing and operations from a college in Manipal. He worked for a brief period in all firms where he was recruited. He had forged his experience certificate when he joined an automobile company in Bidadi, which he quit in a few months.

PS Harsha said that he started blue collar jobs from 2012, starting with working as a security guard and later shifted to the hotel industry. “He found the hotel industry to be conducive as he felt less pressure. Apart from it, it provided him three meals a day and free stay. The investigators learnt that he worked in more than eight food joints including American fast food joints. He had joined a restaurant in Mangaluru in the first week of December, and quit the same on January 18. Three days before the incident, he joined another hotel in Karkala as a steward.

Device used was an IED: PS Harsha

Clearing the air about the contents of the bag, which was dropped by the accused at Mangalore International Airport, P S Harsha, city police commissioner, said it was an improvised explosive device (IED). “It was a technically sound device and the same was revealed by Aditya during primary investigation. However, I will not disclose about the contents due to security reasons,” he said.

Harsha added that Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) tests will be able to give a more clear idea about whether the bomb was linked to a timer or not, and other related details.

Mentally unstable? Harsha says no comment

When the city police commissioner was asked whether the accused was mentally unstable , he chose not to answer, and said that the issue is related to a national threat to the country and an act of sabotage. The police have taken it seriously, he said.
