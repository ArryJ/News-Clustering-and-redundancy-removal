Lakshya Sen’s stunning win over Asian Games champion Jonatan Christie went in vain as the Indian men’s badminton team went down fighting 3-2 to two-time defending champion Indonesia in the semifinals and settled for a bronze at the Asia Team Championships here on Saturday.

World No. 31 Lakshya dished out a clinical performance to notch up a sensational 21-18, 22-20 win over World No. 7 Jonatan in the second singles to keep India in the hunt after B. Sai Praneeth retired following a 21-6 thrashing by Anthony Ginting in the opening game of the first singles.

The doubles pair of M.R. Arjun and Dhruv Kapila then played its heart out before going down narrowly 21-10, 14-21, 23-21 to three-time world champions and second-ranked Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan.

2018 SaarLorLux Open champion Subhankar Dey then shocked World No. 20 Shesar Hiren Rhustavito 21-17, 21-15 in the third singles as India once again drew level 2-2.

In the deciding second doubles, Chirag Shetty paired up with Lakshya but lost to World No. 1 combination of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo 21-6, 21-13.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/india-goes-down-fighting/article30831350.ece
1,2020/02/15,"Saurav, Joshna are the National champions","Saurav dismantles Abhishek while Joshna outlasts Tanvi

Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa have bigger things to achieve on the pro squash tour, but their commitment to play in the SRFI-77th senior Nationals has been exemplary.

The top-ranked Indians on the world arena and the top seeds here justified their billing to bag the men’s and women’s titles for a record 13th and 18th time respectively.

Saurav clinically dismantled Abhishek Pradhan 11-6, 11-5, 11-6 in the men’s final while Joshna encountered a minor scare to outlast Tanvi Khanna 8-11, 11-6, 11-4, 11-7 in the women’s summit clash.

Not overawed by the occasion, the 23-year-old Tanvi showcased her repertoire in the first game, rattling the champion with finely executed drops and attacking play from the backcourt.

Taking an 8-2 lead, Tanvi looked like closing out the game in quick time when Joshna clawed her way back to 6-8, but Tanvi raced ahead to pocket the first game.

Delicate drops

The 33-year-old asserted her dominance from the second game. Pushing the Delhi girl to the backcourt with neat angles, Joshna won a lot of points through some delicate drops to Tanvi’s forehand. The third game was a breeze for Joshna.

Tanvi, however, would not leave without a fight. She matched Joshna stroke for stroke from the front as well as from the backcourt in the fourth. Joshna had to produce her best to win each and every point.

Trailing 3-5 in the fourth, Joshna levelled at 5-5. The moment Joshna took a 9-7 lead when Tanvi was forced to hit a forehand to the ‘tin’, it was clear who the winner would turn out to be.

No trouble

Saurav, on the other hand, had no trouble in defeating Abhishek. He led comfortably in all the three games.

“I wasn’t expecting an easy match,” said Joshna about the final. “She (Tanvi) comes prepared. She has improved a lot. This was my hardest match in the Nationals in the last 15 years. My goal is to do well in the 2022 Commonwealth Games.”

Saurav was happy to have tried out a few patters in the event. “I wanted to try out a few things here. A lot of them was executed,” he said.

Sticking to its stand of selecting only the players who took part in the senior Nationals for the Asian Team Championships, Squash Rackets Federation of India said on Saturday that the semifinalists of the premier domestic tournament would form the team for the Asian event to be held in Kuala Lumpur from March 25 to 29.

Team announced

The men’s team includes Saurav Ghosal, Abhishek Pradhan, Abhay Singh and Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu while Joshna Chinappa, Tanvi Khanna, Sunayna Kuruvilla and Sanya Vats are in the women’s team.

The results (final):

Men: 1-Saurav Ghosal (TN) bt 2-Abhishek Pradhan (Mah) 11-6, 11-5, 11-6.

Women: 1-Joshna Chinappa (TN) bt 3/4-Tanvi Khanna (Del) 8-11, 11-6, 11-4, 11-7.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/saurav-joshna-are-the-national-champions/article30830232.ece

3,2020/02/15,Elite shooters have an exciting time in Hampi,"Walking in bright sunshine, and watching the ruins of the historic Hampi, elite Indian shooters had a look at Indian history, during their High Performance training camp at the Inspire Institute of Sports set up by Jindal Steel Works (JSW).

“I had always wanted to come to Hampi. This was a good chance, and we had a great time. All my family members had visited it earlier,” said Asian Games gold medallist Rahi Sarnobat, who reads four books at a time, and has a good sense of history.

It was a four-day camp for those who had won the Olympic quota, and 11 of them benefited from listening to various experts that the JSW arranged during the stint, including an interactive media session.

While Olympian Mairaj Ahmad Khan had to leave for home on Saturday morning, the other shooters along with coaches Suma Shirur and Ved Prakash Pilaniya, visited temples and other marvels of the Krishnadevaraya period.

“We don’t have a range here. We only had physical conditioning. It is a very good facility. For me, it was an off period and it suited nicely to be here and visit the places with the team,” said World Championship silver medallist Anjum Moudgil.

“I had been practising a few things, and it was a confirmation of my methods, while listening to the experts here,” said Rahi, confident about the way she has preparing for the Tokyo Olympics for the last few years, even before she won the Olympic quota.

“I have the experience of being there, and not being there!,” said Rahi, who had competed in the London Olympics but had missed the Rio Games.

Apurvi Chandela who had a memorable 2019, winning two World Cup gold medals, with world record to boot, was thrilled to find a little monkey giving her leg a hug, after she had treated it with a banana, at the Virupaksha Temple in Hampi.

“It was a cute sight”, said Manisha Malhotra, who has been working with the athletes for the JSW and had arranged the camp and the tour.

For young shooters like Manu Bhaker, Yashaswini Deswal, Chinki Yadav, Divyansh Singh Panwar, Abhishek Verma and Deepak Kumar, it was a memorable experience. Ashwary Pratap Singh Tomar had opted to stay back at the institute.

Four shooters who had won the Olympic quota — Saurabh Chaudhary, Sanjeev Rajput, Tejaswini Sawant and Angad Vir Singh Bajwa — were unable to join the camp, owing to various reasons.

“Empowering the athletes with knowledge and the right technological support is our focus,” said Manisha who was the administrator of the Mittal Champions Trust when its ace athlete Abhinav Bindra won gold in the Beijing Games in 2008.

Education and entertainment went hand-in-hand for the ace shooters, who have so much expectations riding on them for the Tokyo Olympics. Now, it was the time to soak some history and digest some key points to sustain their high standard.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/msmllz/article30830571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16SHOOT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/elite-shooters-have-an-exciting-time-in-hampi/article30830572.ece
4,2020/02/15,Asia Team Championships: Lakshya stuns Jonatan; India lose 2-3 to Indonesia in semifinals,"Indian men settled for their second bronze medal, having won the first one at the 2016 Hyderabad edition.

Lakshya Sen’s stunning win over Asian Games champion Jonatan Christie went in vain as the Indian men’s badminton team went down fighting 2-3 to two-time defending champions Indonesia in the semifinals to settle for a bronze at the Asia Team Championships in Manila on Saturday.

World No. 31 Lakshya dished out a clinical performance to notch up a sensational 21-18 22-20 win over world no. 7 Jonatan in the second singles to keep India in the hunt after B Sai Praneeth retired following a 6-21 thrashing by Anthony Ginting in the opening game of the first singles.

Doubles pair of M R Arjun and Dhruv Kapila then played their heart out before going down narrowly 10-21 21-14 21-23 to three-time world champions and second-ranked Mohammad Ahsan and Hendra Setiawan as Indonesia made it 2-1.

2018 SaarLorLux Open champion Subhankar Dey then shocked world no. 20 Shesar Hiren Rhustavito 21-17 21-15 in the third singles as India once again drew level 2-2.

In the deciding second doubles, Chirag Shetty paired up with Lakshya but they were no match for the world no. 1 combination of Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo, who took just 24 minutes to register a 21-6 21-13 win and seal their place in the finals.

Indian men thus settled for their second bronze medal, having won the first one at the 2016 Hyderabad edition.

Earlier, the 18-year-old Lakshya, who had a stellar run in 2019 with five titles, showed his prowess during his straight-game win over Jonatan, who is one of the top medal contenders at the Olympic Games.

In his first meeting with the Indonesia star, Lakshya matched his senior pro in all departments of the game. The Indian erased a 2-4 deficit and enjoyed a three-point lead at the break when his opponent hit long.

Lakshya kept moving ahead and gained a game point when he pushed the shuttle to the forehand corner. Jonatan saved two game points before sending one out again as Lakshya earned the bragging rights.

In the second game, Jonatan eked out a 3-1 lead early on but Lakshya came back strongly to take a 7-5 advantage before managing 11-9 at the interval. The Indian jumped to a healthy 19-15 lead at one stage but Jonatan clawed his way back with four straight points.

The Indian grabbed a match point when Jonatan hit long again and even though the Indonesia saved one, he stumbled upon two more unforced errors to hand over the match to the Lakshya.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/llg7ho/article30829616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LAKSHYASEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/asia-team-championships-lakshya-stuns-jonatan-india-lose-2-3-to-indonesia-in-semifinals/article30829617.ece
5,2020/02/15,Russia to lose Sochi Olympic gold medal in new doping case,"Germany is in line to inherit the relay gold, subject to IOC confirmation

Russia is set to lose a biathlon gold medal from the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in a new doping case.

The International Biathlon Union on Saturday announced a two-year ban for Evgeny Ustyugov, who was part of the gold medal-winning men’s relay team six years ago, citing evidence he used the banned steroid oxandrolone around the time of the Olympics.

When confirmed by the International Olympic Committee, that will knock Russia off top spot in the Sochi medal table in terms of golds. The host nation would have 10 golds, against 11 for Norway, and 28 total medals, the joint-most along with the United States.

Germany is in line to inherit the relay gold, subject to IOC confirmation.

The Salzburg-based IBU also announced a similar two-year sanction for Svetlana Sleptsova, a Russian who didn’t win any medals at Sochi, over the banned substance ostarine.

The cases are based on disputed data from the Moscow anti-doping laboratory.

The computer files were obtained last year by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which has since said it considers some of the data to have been tampered with to cover up doping. WADA has banned Russia’s name and flag from the 2020 Olympics as a consequence.

A WADA panel said in November that attempts were made to delete files in two biathlon cases whose details appear to match those of Ustyugov and Sleptsova, but that computer experts recovered the files.

Any appeal by Ustyugov is likely to focus on whether the data can be considered reliable evidence. Even if he wins an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, he could still face a ban in a separate doping case.

The Biathlon Integrity Unit, a new anti-doping arm of the IBU, said Thursday it charged Ustyugov with a doping violation based on unusual data in blood samples he gave between Jan. 2010 and Feb. 2014. That could potentially threaten his gold medal in mass start and relay bronze from the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver.

The IOC and WADA didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rj9puj/article30829452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SLOVENIABIATHLONRUSSIADOPING,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/russia-to-lose-sochi-olympic-gold-medal-in-new-doping-case/article30829453.ece

11,2020/02/15,It’s Mr. Mathrubootham vs WhatsApp history lessons,"If she is really daughter of Nehru then why her surname is Gandhi? Why it is not Indira Nehru?

Respected Madam/Sir,

Yoga means what? No, no, you tell me. Hello madam/ sir, you answer my question. Yoga means what? Yoga means relaxation and peace of mind and all no? Instead what is happening to Mr. Mathrubootham? Nonstop irritation.

Two days back, after Seniors Intermediate Yoga, our friends group is walking home and doing normal daily talks. Politics cricket cinema Modi and all. Suddenly Prathapan said hello friends whether you are knowing that Indira Gandhi is actually secret daughter of Mahatma Gandhi with Mrs. Mountbatten? Mohammed Usman started laughing and laughing as if tractor getting breakdown. He said Prathapan, what nonsense you are talking? How can Lady Mountbatten become mother of Indira Gandhi? What nonsense I say?

Prathapan said, Usman, look in my phone. I will show you message on WhatsApp. Full story is there with secret photos and all. Whether they will put such shocking truth in history textbook? Never. Thank god people are now finding out these real truths because of WhatsApp.

I said Prathapan, whether you will believe anything coming on WhatsApp? He said Mathrubootham, anything means what? Look, there is photo and full details of secret letter from secret government department and U.K. intelligence agency and all. As if people will sit at home and do lies and chicanery and distribute?

Tell me Mathrubootham. If she is really daughter of Nehru then why her surname is Gandhi? Why it is not Indira Nehru? EUREKA! LIES EXPOSED! AGENDA EXPOSED!

What I should have done? I should have said Prathapan, enjoy WhatsApp. See you tomorrow for yoga. Instead, what I did? I said, Prathapan come to my flat. I am going to solve this. We sat on dining table and I put laptop and mobile phone ready for investigation. Firstly, I opened Internet encyclopaedia website on Mrs. Gandhi and Mahatma Gandhi and Mrs. Mountbatten. I said look, Prathapan not even one 1 mm information is there. He said these are all lies being spread by Indian government and royal family of U.K. See! Encyclopedia itself is called Britannica.

Then I took phone and called Mrs. Mathrubootham close friend Mrs. Bhatia. She is professor of history in one college in Bhopal. I said hello Mrs. Bhatia, this is Mathrubootham from Chennai. Whether you are remembering? She said there are 2 million Mathruboothams in Chennai, please be clear I have class in 20 minutes. I am Kamalam Mathrubootham’s husband, I said, calling for urgent matter.

She said oh my god what happened to Kamalam? Oh my god, why god did not take me before my dear Kamalam. I said Mrs. Bhatia, no no. She is perfectly fine. I said one urgent question is there. Whether Mrs. Indira Gandhi is really daughter of Mahatma Gandhi and Mrs. Mountbatten? Immediately Mrs. Bhatia is cutting the phone, but after saying 10-15 words. I think it is Punjabi abuses.

Prathapan said see Mathrubootham, they are afraid to admit the shocking truth. I said Prathapan, we will do more research. What is the age difference between Mrs. Mountbatten and Mrs. Gandhi? Mrs. Mountbatten is in boarding school in U.K. when Mrs. Gandhi is being delivered. While Mahatma Gandhi is doing gajabuja against Britishers in Bombay. Now you see, you fool?

Prathapan said, maybe British Intelligence agency has changed all the dates. If you have guts, show me birth certificate. Oho. You will show WhatsApp mannankatti but I have to show birth certificate is it, Prathapan? Ok, then I am sending you something on WhatsApp, please believe every word okay? Then I sent him all the abuses Mrs. Bhatia is saying on phone.

Yours in exasperation,

12,2020/02/15,A great way to go,"An emotional Leander Paes, who has possibly played his last ATP event match in India, stated that he will miss the massive home crowd support that he has enjoyed over his long career. The 46-year-old shed a few tears when asked about his fans, at the post-match press conference here on Saturday.

“The fact that I’ve played my last match in India — it sunk in after the match when I was signing autographs.

“A young girl — must have been five or six years old — gave me a ‘One Last Roar’ t-shirt which was twice her size. She gave it to me and said, ‘Leander, can you sign this?’. She must have been about 40 years younger to me, and she wanted my autograph. It meant a lot to me, because she recognised the effort I have put into my career,” Paes said,

“And when I signed the t-shirt and gave it to her, she turned around and said ‘Bye’. She said bye. That’s a great way to go.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/a-great-way-to-go/article30831263.ece
13,2020/02/15,No fairytale finish for Leander Paes,"Ramkumar-Purav combine triumphs in style; Bonzi to meet Duckworth

Ramkumar Ramanathan and Purav Raja, who have played second fiddle to Leander Paes and Matthew Ebden for the bulk of the $1,62,000 Bengaluru Open ATP Tennis Challenger here, forced their way to the forefront when it counted most.

In a clinical display, the duo whipped Paes-Ebden 6-0, 6-3 in the final at the KSLTA Stadium here on Saturday and ensured that Paes — playing possibly his last ATP event in India — would not ride into the sunset as a champion.

While Purav was all class at the net, Ramkumar covered the back-court well and muscled his groundstrokes. Paes and Ebden simply had no answers to the devastating one-two punch, in a summit clash that lasted just 56 minutes.

Service proves the difference

Ebden and Paes both struggled with their serves, recording a poor 49% combined first-serve percentage. Ramkumar, on the other hand, was devastating, consistently finding the right spots at around 220-kmph.

Ramkumar and Purav, who have now won three titles in the four tournaments they have entered, collected a cheque of $9,300 and 125 ATP ranking points.

“I’ve never had such good results with a new partner. The future looks bright. I don’t want to take Ramkumar away from his singles commitments, so I will have to work out my schedule so that we can play together often,” Purav said.

Ramkumar, whose main focus has been on singles, stated that he is enjoying his doubles run.

Bonding well

“Purav and I know exactly what to do in big moments. Purav knows where I will serve, and we know each other’s weaknesses and strengths. We bond well and the vibe is good — that is important,” said Ramkumar.

In singles, unseeded Benjamin Bonzi took out second seed S. Travaglia 6-3, 6-4 in the semifinals. Bonzi, who has beaten four higher-ranked rivals here, reached his second Challenger final.

The Frenchman will face Australian James Duckworth in the final on Sunday. Duckworth cruised past Italy’s J. Ocleppo 6-3, 6-3 in the other semifinal.

The results:

Singles (semifinals): James Duckworth (Aus) bt J. Ocleppo (Ita) 6-3, 6-2; Benjamin Bonzi (Fra) bt S. Travaglia (Ita) 6-3, 6-4.

18,2020/02/15,"Pope sides with traditionalists, says nothing on priest celibacy","Idea of married priests, women deacons in the Amazon nixed

In quashing the idea of married priests in the Amazon, Pope Francis has appeased traditionalists while disappointing progressives, who had hoped for a historic turning point in the Catholic church.

In his “apostolic exhortation” on the Amazon basin published on Wednesday, the Pope slammed the door on a progressive proposal offered by the region’s bishops during a synod on the region in October.

The synod had suggested that the way to solve a shortage of priests in the remote and inaccessible area was to allow married indigenous men to become priests.

Without even mentioning that proposal, the Pope instead argued for more missionary priests in the Amazon and for women and lay people to take on larger roles, falling short of another synod idea to ordain women as deacons in the region.

The Argentine pontiff’s thoughts, coming after months of speculation and hand-wringing within the Vatican, were welcomed by some, including a vocal opponent of the Pope, German Cardinal Gerhard Mueller.

For five years Cardinal Mueller was in charge of church dogma, holding the key Vatican post of Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith until 2017 — when he was not reappointed by the Pope. He saluted the document’s potential for “reducing internal Church factions.”

Conservatives within the Church were outraged by the regional synod’s proposal, even were it to be an exception limited to the Amazon, seeing it as potentially paving the way to the abolition of priest celibacy globally.

U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, a staunch traditionalist, suggested last year that Francis would be heading into a “schism” were he to give his stamp of approval to the synod’s proposals.

Failing to reform?

But to others, the text lacked the audacity that has marked the papacy of the first Jesuit pope.

Francis’ document marked a “failure in the reforming impulse of the pontificate,” according to longtime Vatican analyst Marco Politi.

The pope, “abruptly slowed down” by a strong and multifaceted opposition, also disappointed those local Amazon bishops whom he had called on to offer up new ideas to help guide the Church, Mr. Politi said.

“Francis finds himself more alone today, having caused disillusionment among a notable mass of his supporters,” Mr. Politi said.

Key among them are Catholic feminist organisations, some of whom have been fighting for women’s access to the priesthood.

In his text, Francis cited the contributions of women and argued that their roles be increased, but dismissed the idea of their ordination.

Women’s Ordination Worldwide (WOW) said Francis had “dropped the ball” for women within the Church.

“Francis has opted to perpetuate the shameful elitist men’s club that, as he so brazenly points out in the document, is held up by the second class status of women who do most of the work with none of the recognition,” the group said in a statement.

Still, the issues of women’s ordination, and married priests, are not dead, some say.

The German Church, which contains a strong progressive branch, has just launched a two-year debate on top controversial issues, including the end of priestly celibacy and a greater place for women.

Meanwhile, Brazilian Cardinal Claudio Hummes, a proponent of priestly marriage, sees the question as still open, telling the publication Estadao: “It will be taken up again.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pope-sides-with-traditionalists-says-nothing-on-priest-celibacy/article30831503.ece
19,2020/02/15,Pakistan court frees Pashtun activist,"His lawyer Saeed Akhtar said that he had already been bailed on three of five complaints against him

A Pakistani court on Saturday ordered the release of a Pashtun rights leader critical of the military, his lawyer said, weeks after he was arrested on sedition charges.

Manzoor Pashteen, chief of the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), was arrested last month on charges of sedition, hate speech, incitement against the state, and criminal conspiracy.

His lawyer Saeed Akhtar told AFP that he had already been bailed on three of five complaints against him.

“Today the court has granted him bail in the remaining two, against surety bonds of one hundred thousand rupees ($650) each,” Mr. Akhtar said.

He added that he hoped Mr. Pashteen would be released from jail on Saturday. A government prosecutor also confirmed the bail.

Mr. Pashteen, a former veterinary student, and the PTM have rattled Pakistan's military since 2018 with calls to end alleged abuses by security forces targeting ethnic Pashtuns in the restive tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.

Once plagued by militancy and unrest, the region is where Washington believes Pakistan provides safe haven to militant groups including the Afghan Taliban and Haqqani Network.

The army has carried out many operations in the region, and security across Pakistan has dramatically improved in recent years.

But the PTM claim the operations came at a heavy price because of alleged abuses — including enforced disappearances and targeted killings.

The movement remains peaceful, but has been notable for its direct verbal attacks on the armed forces in a country where such criticism is largely seen as a red line.

Islamabad and the military have repeatedly denied the claims and arrested PTM activists.

A far-reaching media blackout has kept news and images of peaceful PTM rallies off TV screens and front pages nationwide.

An opinion piece written by Pashteen in the New York Times in 2019 was censored in Pakistan.

Pashtuns are a fiercely independent ethnic group that straddles both sides of the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

20,2020/02/15,"‘The West is winning,’ U.S. tells China; France wary","U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was no crisis in Western leadership

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended on Saturday his nation’s global role despite misgivings in Europe, vowing that Western values would prevail over Russian and Chinese desires for “empire”.

Seeking to reassure Europeans troubled by U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America first” rhetoric, his ambivalence over the NATO military alliance and tariffs on European goods, Mr. Pompeo said there was no crisis in Western leadership.

“I’m happy to report that the death of the transatlantic alliance is grossly exaggerated. The West is winning, and we’re winning together,” he said in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, listing U.S. steps to protect liberal democracies.

Mr. Pompeo’s Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, accused him of telling “lies, not based on facts” about Beijing’s intentions.

Mr. Pompeo had been, in part, responding to German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who on Friday accused the United States, Russia and China of making the world more dangerous.

French President Emmanuel Macron told the conference of international leaders, lawmakers and diplomats he was not surprised by Mr. Steinmeier’s speech and had liked it.

“We cannot be the United States’ junior partner,” Mr. Macron said, adding that while he supported NATO, Europe needed to be able to tackle threats in its neighbourhood and at times act independently of Washington.

“I’m impatient for European solutions,” Mr. Macron said.

Trump’s decision to pull out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, as well as the Paris climate accord, have undermined European priorities, while moves such as recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital have weakened European diplomacy, envoys say.

Mr. Pompeo defended the U.S. strategy, saying Europe, Japan and other American allies were united on China, Iran and Russia, despite “tactical differences.”

Mr. Pompeo, however, reiterated Washington’s opposition to the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline under construction between Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea, a project backed by the government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Citing Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, cyber threats in Iran and economic coercion by China, Mr. Pompeo said those countries were still “desiring empires” and destabilising the rules-based international system.

Wang responded to Mr. Pompeo by saying: “All these accusations against China are lies, not based on facts.”

But he added that Beijing was willing to sit down with Washington for “serious dialogue” and seek a less confrontational relationship.

POLICY OF DEFIANCE

Mr. Macron said the West’s policy of defiance towards Russia in recent years had failed and, as nobody wanted to confront Moscow directly, the only option was to have a closer dialogue to resolve differences.

“I hear the defiance of all our partners, I’m not mad, but I know that being defiant and weak ... is not a policy, it’s a completely inefficient system,” Mr. Macron told the conference.

“There is a second choice, which is to be demanding and restart a strategic dialogue because today we talk less and less, conflicts multiply and we aren’t able to resolve them, he added.

U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, who spoke immediately after Mr. Pompeo, focused his remarks solely on China, accusing Beijing of a “nefarious strategy” through telecommunications firm Huawei.

“It is essential that we as an international community wake up to the challenges presented by Chinese manipulation of the long-standing international rules-based order,” Mr. Esper said.

He said it was not too late for Britain, which last month said it would allow Huawei a limited role in building its 5G networks, to take “two steps back,” but added he still needed to asses London’s decision.

“We could have a win-win strategy if we just abide by the international rules that have been set in place for decades ... that respect human rights, that respect sovereignty,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s3qch4/article30831443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Pompeo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-west-is-winning-us-tells-china-france-wary/article30831444.ece
21,2020/02/15,"Chinese President Xi Jinping urges more policing as toll hits 1,500","Government wants to tighten control on online media as it cracks down on those ‘spreading rumours’

Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for tightened control over online discussion and increased policing to ensure “positive energy” and social stability, state media said on Saturday, as the country struggles to contain the deadly new coronavirus.

Mr. Xi’s remarks were made public as the authorities have faced rare bouts of public anger over the handling of an epidemic that has killed about 1,523 people and infected some 66,492 across the country. Outside mainland China there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths - in Japan, Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.

Censors had allowed some online criticism of local officials in central Hubei — the epicentre and origin of the crisis — but calls for freedom of speech and political reform were scrubbed after the death of a whistleblowing doctor from the virus.

The government must “strengthen the management and control of online media,” and “crack down on those who seize the opportunity to create rumours” on the internet, Mr. Xi said in the February 3 speech published by state media.

Simultaneously, “it is necessary to increase use of police force and strengthen the visible use of police,” Mr. Xi said, calling for a crackdown on behaviour that “disrupts social order” including hoarding medical supplies.

Discipline by law

Mr. Xi urged party members to “dare to criticise” those who had failed to carry out the Communist Party central committee’s instructions, and warned “those who fail to perform their duties shall be punished according to discipline and law.”

Local officials in Hubei have already begun to feel the force of Mr. Xi’s orders.

On Thursday, the political chiefs of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, were sacked and replaced by Xi loyalists with security backgrounds. The province’s top two health officials have also been fired.

Mr. Xi also called for the government to emphasize effective actions it has taken and “vividly describe touching deeds” from the frontlines of the fight against the virus.

“Let positive energy fill the cyberspace from start to end,” Mr. Xi said in the speech, given earlier this month at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, China’s ruling council.

Mr. Xi kept a low profile in the early weeks of the crisis but has stepped up his public rhetoric in recent days on what he has called a “people’s war” against the virus.

Those returning to Beijing from the holiday have been ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to prevent the virus' spread. Many factories are yet to re-open, disrupting global supply chains for everyone from smartphone makers to car manufacturers.

While there has been some hope expressed this week that the disease may be peaking in China, numbers keep rising and a trend has been hard to discern, especially after a reclassification that widened the definition of cases.

The biggest cluster outside China has been on a cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, quarantined off Japan's Yokohama. Out of about 3,700 passengers and crew on board, 285 people have tested positive and been sent to hospital.

The U.S. said on Saturday it plans to send an aircraft to pick up American passengers and take them back home where they face two weeks of isolation “out of an abundance of caution”.

‘Free wine’

Passengers on another cruise ship, which finally docked in Cambodia after being rejected by five other countries, were taking their saga in good heart.

“Everyone says 'poor you'. But there was no poor you. We had free internet and free wine. We had three-course meals. There was so much choice,” said Zahra Jennings, a retired staff nurse from Britain who had been on the MS Westerdam with more than 2,300 passengers and crew.

U.S. President Donald Trump thanked “beautiful” Cambodia for taking the castaway cruise ship in a rare message to a nation that has often been at odds with Washington.

U.S. curbs

The United States has imposed some of the toughest curbs on travellers from China, going beyond World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and offending Beijing.

In Hong Kong, which has seen months of anti-Beijing protests, hundreds marched on Saturday to demand full closure of the border with mainland China and to oppose plans to turn some buildings into quarantine hubs. The sickness, now officially labelled COVID-19, has killed around 2% of those infected.

22,2020/02/15,Revolt in the time of carnival,"Brazilians turn samba into a means of protest against the government in their street parties

On a street with old warehouses and bars sitting side by side in the old quarters of the city, a group of 100-odd people — all wearing red T-shirts with an image of Fidel Castro smoking a Cuban cigar — danced around a drummer and singer belting out a samba song. With beer flowing like water, the group sang a samba that made fun of President Jair Bolsonaro. That was the birth of “Bloco Ursal”, a street carnival party in Sao Paulo, just a few weeks after Bolsonaro was inaugurated last year.

Brazilian carnival is often confused with the glamorous parade in Rio de Janeiro, which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists and millions of television audience from around the world every year. But the real carnival takes place on the country’s streets in the form of parties called blocos — all centred around a specific theme — organised by common people who compose samba and play it for hours with their friends and neighbours. Bloco Ursal was created by a group of journalists in 2019 as a reaction to a bizarre episode during the 2018 election debate, when a fringe right-wing candidate accused Ciro Gomes, a centrist leader, of being part of “Ursal”, an imaginary “union of socialist republics of Latin America”.

The election got over and the right-wing candidate sank without a trace, leaving behind the term “Ursal”, whose intended insult was turned on its head by the creators of this bloco to celebrate the Latin American left. In 2019, the group paid tributes to Castro; this Sunday (February 16), they will be gathering at the same place to pay homage to former Uruguayan President Pepe Mujica, with a new samba. “From WhatsApp has leaked a news/It is Free Lula. So good/I miss my former President. I had a dream that democracy is back. In my dream the Earth was round again/And Mujica came back. In my dream, sexism disappeared…,” reads the lines of samba of Bloco Ursal.

Moment of liberation

Nothing defines — and describes — Brazil better than its carnival. Football probably comes a distant second. According to Roberto DaMatta, a Brazilian anthropologist, the carnival “reveals the background of Brazilian society”. “It reverses the role, brings the bottom of the well up, like turning a bag upside down or a suit inside out. In Brazilian society, ‘where everything is prohibited’, the carnival brings the moment of liberation,” says Mr. DaMatta.

To the outsiders, the carnival looks like a period of pure hedonism and non-stop partying. But as the country’s liberal traditions, progressive groups and mixed cultural values come under attack, the carnival has turned into a platform for political protest.

After Mr. Bolsonaro rose to power on a far-right message, last year’s carnival started a cultural war as several blocos and samba schools chose themes that challenged the far-right narrative. In his imitable style, the President responded by tweeting a graphic video as he condemned Brazil’s biggest festival and soft-power export to the world.

The tensions, sparked last year, have become more intense in 2020 as Brazil’s black population, women, followers of African religions and samba schools feel the heat of far-right propaganda that dominates the government narrative. The carnival parade of this year, which will take place in Rio and Sao Paulo over the next weekend, will turn into a political act as at least 10 samba schools have composed their lyrics criticising Mr. Bolsonaro. Mangueira, the samba school which won the parade trophy in 2019 by honouring Marielle Franco, the black and gay councillor who was assassinated in 2018, will be presenting the story of Jesus Christ as someone “who has a black face, indigenous blood and the body of a woman”. Luiz Carlos Maximo, one of the composers of the samba, says their idea is to “portray Jesus as a man persecuted by the State and kidnapped by the prophets of intolerance”.

The high glamour quotient of Brazilian carnival can’t hide the fact that this show is actually put together by the residents of favelas (slums), who are mostly black and poor. With them facing the brunt of Mr. Bolsonaro’s policies, the favelas are in full revolt at this year’s carnival. Padre Miguel, another top samba school, will be portraying social and racial inequality. “We need to protest through our samba as we are facing attacks on African-based religions and there is no debate about racism in Brazil,” says Marcio Silva, who will be taking part in the carnival parade. “We need to tell the world what is happening in Brazil.”

With millions on the streets, the message will be loud and clear.

23,2020/02/15,Remember the dead and fight for the living,"An art summit in Dhaka touches upon a broad set of themes from geological to social and feminist

Rahela Khanam was not an artist, never meant to be. After losing her 19-year-old son, Fazle Rabby, to Bangladesh’s worst industrial disaster in 2013, Ms. Khanam found her life hollowed out. To carry the memories of her son into the future, she embroidered her sorrows into a handmade quilt, a seemingly permanent space in her fleeting life. It’s part of Memorial Quilts, a moving collection of statements from the families of those who died in the Rana Plaza collapse about seven years ago.

Taslima Akhter, a documentary photographer and rights activist, put them together at the Dhaka Art Summit, renewing global attention to the struggles of garment workers, who drive Bangladesh’s stellar economic growth, but themselves fall by the wayside.

The stories of those families upended by the disaster emerged as a collaborative effort to remember the dead and fight for the living. A counter-narrative to disasters, these quilts empower families to memorialise their loved ones and bring together a growing number of allies who demand better wages and safer workplaces.

Habiba Nowrose explores complex human relationships and the ambiguity of identity through photography. The Life of Venus, an ongoing project that started in 2014, portrays veiled women in a dazzling burst of colours and offers glimpses into their faceless world. “My photography is true to myself. I’m inspired by the patterns and colours women wear in Bangladesh all the time. I have been fascinated by those patterns and colours and wanted to include them in my works. That’s one of the reasons my works are vibrant and colourful,” Ms. Nowrose said in an interview.

The images of women shed light on the loss of identity that Ms. Nowrose felt in her life as a woman. “I was experiencing a lot of pressure from my family and peers to express myself in a particular way. I had a feeling that I was losing myself.”

Freedom or the lack of it took centre stage in the theme, Seismic Movements. The art summit touched upon a broad set of movements from geological to social to feminist. The movements create the conditions that “move us to act and the power that comes with moving collectively,” said Diana Campbell Betancourt, chief curator of the summit.

Chitra Ganesh expands upon her exploration of gender and power in a futurist imaginary that takes the 1905 utopian, sci-fi, feminist novella Sultana’s Dream by author and social reformer Begum Rokeya as a point of departure to consider a world where men stay home, and women innovate new ways of being by harnessing the power of the sun.

Throughout the world, people of colour, indigenous peoples and people of diverse sexual and gender orientation continue to fight for space to express themselves. They immerse themselves in fantasy and poetry to reimagine new territories that emancipate them from the everyday violence of capitalism, patriarchy and religious fundamentalism.

Sense of alienation

On the other hand, Tahia Farhin Haque, a Dhaka-based photographer, traces the broken lives in the brutal aftermath of the Partition of India in 1947. Through the images of veiled women, Ms. Haque explores the public gaze and prejudice that follows a Muslim woman in a country where she happens to be part of the religious minority.

It is a jarring reminder of the turmoil and terror her grandmother had suffered more than seven decades ago, running away from her home in Kolkata with a child in her womb. The oppression of minorities has always existed and is evident even today. “Strolling through the streets [in Kolkata], I was always acutely aware of the eyes on me due to my identity and the pang of alienation that accompanies it,” Ms. Haque wrote in a booklet on the overarching theme of her works.

In another corner, a vast canvas scroll by Nilima Sheikh, a prominent visual artist from Baroda, reflects on the tragedies in Kashmir, the epicentre of the destruction left in the wake of the Partition and later exacerbated by rising Indian nationalism. The narrative scroll immerses the viewer in a sense of loss and mourning often articulated in silence. Ms. Sheikh has been visiting Kashmir since she was a young child, and has envisioned a pluralistic society through her works since 2002.

As the nine-day summit came to an end on Saturday, Ms. Khanam’s memorial quilt will be removed from the gallery at the Shilpakala Academy just like other exhibits, and she will continue to come to terms with the eternal absence of her beloved son in her own small world.

24,2020/02/15,No room for dissent in Putin’s Russia,"The crackdown on an anti-fascist group is the latest case of the government stiffling criticism

In what has emerged as yet another case of the state cracking down on anti-government activism, a court in the central Russian city of Penza has sentenced seven members of a left-wing activist group ‘Set’ (Network) to a cumulative term of 86 years.

Dmitriy Pchelintsev, 27, received the harshest sentence — 18 years in a colony of strict regime. Others, Ilya Shakurskiy, 23, Andrey Chernov, 30, Maksim Ivankin, 25, Mikhail Kulkov, Vasiliy Kuskov, 31, and Arman Sangynbayev, 27, received somewhere between six and 16 years.

The convicted men are among the 11 people detained in 2017 in Penza and St. Petersburg for “plotting” terrorist attacks during presidential elections and the football World Cup in 2018.

Another activist believed to be a part of the ‘Set’, Igor Shishkin, was handed a three-and-a-half-year term in 2019. So far, he is the only one who has confessed to the charges. He collaborated with the investigation. According to Human Rights Watch, he did so after repeated torture. Two others, Viktor Filinkov and Yulian Boyarshinov, are awaiting their sentence later this month.

What do these young men have in common? Some of them belong to leftist, anti-fascist and anarchist movements, and most of them have been playing a popular outdoor game “airsoft”, in which participants shoot at each other with plastic balls using a pneumatic weapon.

The Federal Security Service (FSB), which has opened a criminal case against them, claimed the games were actually ‘training exercises’ as part of preparation for insurgency. Families of the youth and those under trial as well as human rights experts in Russia and abroad maintain the case was “fabricated” and no serious evidence has been produced by the prosecution while the facts proving that some testimonies were obtained through torture were completely ignored by the court.

Plotting insurgency

What is the most astonishing in this case, experts and activists say, is that the harsh terms were given for just “plotting” insurgency and not for something that was actually done.

“Everything we know about the ‘Set’ case suggests that it was entirely fabricated. A blatantly unjust verdict shows the complete paralysis of the independent judicial system in our country. Unlike those fake terrorist attacks that the accused were allegedly plotting, the court decision itself is the real act of terror that strikes a blow to the very foundation of Russia’s statehood,” says a public petition started on February 12. Within two days, it was signed by over 3,000 people.

Inability of the judges to question ‘powerful’ investigators such as the FSB has been pointed out by many commentators in Russia. “If the judge doubts anything, it means that he has questioned the qualifications of FSB employees, and no one wants to get involved with this. The career of both a prosecutor and a judge can be over in a moment,” said Olga Romanova, head of the NGO Russia Behind Bars.

Andrei Kolesnikov, a senior fellow and the chair of the Russian Domestic Politics and Political Institutions Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center, believes double-digit jail terms handed to young men who have neither killed or shot or beaten anybody nor stolen billions is “pure Stalinism”.

“The harshness of the sentences for the throwing of plastic cups and for organising outdoor training, as the Network group did, is intended to demonstrate the State’s readiness to defend itself from any manifestations of dissatisfaction and dissent, even action that is not particularly vividly expressed,” he wrote in one of his op-eds.

Most of the experts speaking out on the case — which is hardly covered by the largely government-controlled mainstream media — believe the fear of mass dissent is something the Russian government is not able to tolerate because it doesn’t really know how to deal with it. The 2019 summer protests rattled Moscow both because of their size and strength and because of the brutal force the police used to crack them down. The Kremlin would not like those incidents being repeated.

Sociologist Konstantin Gaaze reminds that the Russian government has always considered youth belonging to countless anti-fascist leftists groups spread across Russia an important concern. Mainly because these groups, unlike those belonging to so-called “systemic opposition”, are not under the direct control of the Kremlin and the FSB. The Set members violated the monopoly of the Kremlin-sanctioned opposition.

25,2020/02/15,WHO experts set to join battle against COVID-19 in China as death toll crosses 1500,"The virus emerged in central Hubei province in December before spreading across the country and some two dozen countries

Top WHO experts are set to arrive in Beijing this weekend to assist China to contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as the death toll climbed to 1,523 in China and France reported the first fatality outside Asia, fuelling concerns about the epidemic.

More than 66,000 people are now infected from the virus in China, health officials said.

On Saturday China’s Health Commission said the death toll in China rose to 1,523 after 143 more people died in the country, most in Hubei, the epicentre of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

There were reports of 2,641 new confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2infection and 143 deaths on Friday from 31 provincial-level regions, it said.

A top Chinese health official said efforts to prevent and control the virus outbreak reached its most crucial stage as the virus epicentre Hubei province continues to grapple with growing fatalities over a month after the virus outbreak even though the cases began dropping in rest of China.

The virus emerged in central Hubei province in December before spreading across the country and some two dozen countries.

In France, an 80-year-old Chinese tourist died from COVID-19 , French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said on Saturday.

Only three other deaths have been recorded outside mainland China — in the Philippines, Hong Kong and Japan.

The most concentrated number of cases outside China is on a cruise ship quarantined off the Japanese coast, which is holding at least 285 people with the virus among its 3,711 crew and passengers.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, are among the 3,711 people on board the quarantined ship. Three Indians are among those infected on the ship.

Several countries have banned arrivals from China and major airlines have cut services with the country.

The COVID-19 has posed a big threat to the medical staff in China as more than 1,700 Chinese health workers have been infected by the virus while treating the patients and six of them have died so far.

While China dispatched more medical teams and poured more resources to virus-hit Hubei and its provincial capital Wuhan, experts of the World Health Organisation (WHO) are converging here this weekend to join Chinese health specialists to contain the virus.

The prevention and control of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is currently at its most crucial stage in China and Hubei Province remained the main battlefield, a senior health official said.

A total of 217 medical teams with 25,633 medical workers had been sent to Hubei to help combat the COVID-19 as of Friday. Of the medical workers, 20,374 are now working in Wuhan, figures from the NHC show.

Meanwhile, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the international joint mission with China on the novel COVID-19 is moving forward, with the full team expected to reach China over the weekend.

The team will consist of 12 international and WHO experts and a similar number of their Chinese counterparts. An advanced WHO team arrived here on Monday.

“The China mission will include in-depth workshops’ data review, a series of meetings with key national level institutions and field visits in three provinces to understand the application and impact of response activities at province and country levels, including urban and rural areas,” Mr. Tedros was quoted as saying by state-run Xinhua news agency.

Mr. Tedros said that one of the goals of the joint mission is to rapidly inform the public of the next steps in the COVID-19 response and preparedness activities in China and globally.

“Particular attention will be paid to understanding the transmission of the virus, the severity of disease and the impact of ongoing response measures,” he said.

Furthermore, he said, it will be important to review which type of information is needed so that the world can use this window of opportunity to prepare health systems and workers for possible outbreaks.

“I want to say again from my heart that this is the time for solidarity not stigma,” he stressed.

China’s National Health Commission said the joint mission with WHO experts will also pay field visits to China’s three provincial-level regions to learn the implementation and effectiveness of the epidemic prevention and control measures taken in China’s urban and rural areas.

One of the goals of the joint mission is to provide suggestions on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and globally, it said.

In addition, the expert team will visit epidemic-related institutions focusing on epidemiology, medical treatment, laboratory detection and scientific research, said the NHC.

One task of the WHO team along with their Chinese counterparts is to come up with standard medicine to cure the disease.

China has applied Traditional Chinese Medicine in treating more than half of the confirmed patients of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hubei province, Mr. Wang said.

The TCM has been applied in treating more than half of the confirmed patients of SARS-CoV-2infection in Hubei province, he said.

The Chinese government has also approved field trials for experimental U.S. antiviral drug, Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir has been used recently to treat Ebola virus in Africa.

Jiao Yahui, also a senior official at the National Health Commission, said that the combination of traditional and western medicines have shown supportive results.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/wzn8lk/article30765215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-WHO-chief-Tedros-Adhanom-Ghebreyesus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/who-experts-set-to-join-battle-against-covid-19-in-china-as-death-toll-crosses-1500/article30830501.ece
26,2020/02/15,Pakistan anti-corruption officials raid properties of Nawaz Sharif,"An accountability court had exempted the 69-year-old PML-N supremo from appearing before it in the money laundering case on medical grounds

Pakistan anti-corruption officials raided the properties of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Lahore on Saturday to collect evidence in a money laundering case, even as his mother left for London to be with her son ahead of his cardiac treatment.

An accountability court here has already exempted the 69-year-old Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo from appearing before it in the money laundering case on medical grounds and adjourned the hearing till February 28.

“Nawaz Sharif’s mother Shamim Bibi left for London to be with her son while he undergoes heart treatment,” PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Aurangzeb tweeted on Saturday.

Ms. Aurangzeb said Ms. Bibi had been advised not to travel because of her age, 90, and illnesses but she expressed her wish to be present during her son’s treatment.

On Saturday, National Accountability Bureau (NAB) officials raided businesses and properties of the Sharif family in search of evidence related to the money laundering charges.

The accountability bureau has accused Mr. Sharif of being a direct beneficiary of Chaudhry Sugar Mills and his daughter, Maryam, who was arrested in connection with the case in August along with her cousin Yousuf Abbas, of holding over 12 million shares in the sugar mills.

The three-time premier is undergoing treatment in London for coronary artery disease. Mr. Sharif was on November 4 last year granted bail on humanitarian grounds by the Lahore High Court in the case.

The former prime minister left for London on November 19 in an air ambulance.

Mr. Sharif is suffering from “complex multi-vessel coronary artery disease and substantial ischemic and threatened myocardium for which he is due to undergo surgery, says his personal physician Dr. Adnan Khan.

The Imran Khan government has not allowed Maryam Nawaz to go to London and placed her name on a no-fly list as she is also named in the money laundering case.

Mr. Nawaz’s counsel advocate Amjad Pervez told Lahore High Court that his client is likely to undergo coronary angiography on February 24.

“The medical reports suggest that Mr. Sharif requires continuous monitoring by the doctors in London,” Mr. Pervez said, and asked the court to extend exemption to Mr. Sharif from personal appearance in proceedings against him.

The court allowed the application and adjourned hearing till February 28. The Punjab government has not yet given extension to Mr. Sharif for his London stay, seeking fresh health reports.

The medical reports prepared by the London doctors have not so far advised Mr. Sharif about air travel.

Dr. David Lawrence, a cardiac surgeon known for performing minimally invasive chest surgery and lung cancer surgery, penned the report detailing Mr. Sharif’s medical history from 2003 to 2019 as well as his current treatment plan.

“The stability of healthcare management is of vital importance for the patient, hence he [Nawaz] should remain under the care of his healthcare providers in the U.K. until his diseases are adequately addressed,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xa1lvs/article30830137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTAN-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-anti-corruption-officials-raid-properties-of-nawaz-sharif/article30830138.ece
27,2020/02/15,"Chinese tourist in France dies of COVID-19, first death in Europe","Beijing's latest figures on Saturday showed 66,492 cases and 1,523 deaths

An elderly Chinese tourist infected with COVID-19 has died in France, Paris said on Saturday, becoming the first fatality in Europe and the fourth outside mainland China from an epidemic that has rattled the world.

Thought to have originated from a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the outbreak has dented the world's second largest economy and presented a huge challenge to the ruling Communist Party.

Beijing's latest figures on Saturday showed 66,492 cases and 1,523 deaths, mostly in central Hubei province. Outside mainland China there have been about 500 cases in some two dozen countries and territories, with four deaths in Japan, Hong Kong, the Philippines and France.

In the French case, the 80-year-old Chinese man died at the Bichat hospital in Paris of a lung infection due to the flu-like virus, Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said.

After an extended Lunar New Year holiday, China urgently needs to get back to work. But some cities remain in lockdown, streets are deserted, employees are nervous, and travel bans and quarantine orders are in place around the country.

Those returning to Beijing from the holiday have been ordered to undergo a 14-day self-quarantine to prevent the virus' spread.

Many factories are yet to re-open.

While there has been some hope expressed this week that the flu-like disease may be peaking in China, numbers keep rising and a trend has been hard to discern, especially after a reclassification that widened the definition of cases.

“They are very concerned about spreading the virus, and theres no good way to transport people from Japan without possible transfer of virus, so it is the logical thing to do,” passenger Sawyer Smith, 25, said.

Beijing upbeat

The United States has imposed some of toughest curbs on travellers from China, going beyond World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations and offending Beijing. China has called for science-based responses and not panic.

In Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which has seen months of anti-Beijing protests, hundreds of demonstrators marched on Saturday to demand full closure of the border with mainland China and to oppose plans to turn some buildings into quarantine hubs.

“Doing that (opening such centres) is like creating more wounds rather than trying to stop the bleeding,” said Chan Mei-lin among the protesters. TV images showed police making some arrests and using pepper spray.

The sickness, now officially labelled Covid-19, has killed around 2% of those infected. Cases have spread faster than other respiratory viruses this century.

A senior Chinese official sought to project optimism on Saturday.

“The impact of the epidemic on the Chinese economy will be short term and temporary,” foreign affairs vice minister Qin Gang said at the Munich Security Conference.

“When the epidemic is over, the subdued consumer demand will be released rapidly and the economy will rebound strongly.”

The Chinese central bank said on Saturday the country's lenders will tolerate higher levels of bad loans as part of efforts to support firms hit by the epidemic.

“We will support qualified firms so that they can resume work and production as soon as possible, helping maintain stable operations of the economy and minimising the epidemic's impact,” said Fan Yifei, a vice governor at the People's Bank of China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/falnsd/article30829345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-tourist-in-france-dies-of-covid-19-first-death-in-europe/article30829346.ece

31,2020/02/15,China's central bank says lenders to tolerate higher bad loans to support firms hit by coronavirus outbreak,"“We will support qualified firms so that they can resume work and production as soon as possible,” said Fan Yifei, a vice governor at the People's Bank of China.

China's central bank said on Saturday that the country's lenders will tolerate higher levels of bad loans, part of efforts to support firms hit by the coronavirus outbreak.

“We will support qualified firms so that they can resume work and production as soon as possible, helping maintain stable operations of the economy and minimising the epidemic's impact,” Fan Yifei, a vice governor at the People's Bank of China, told a news conference.

He added that the problem will be manageable as China has a relatively low bad loan ratio.

Liang Tao, vice chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, told the same briefing that lending for key investment projects will be sped up.

Separately, Xuan Changneng, vice head of the country's foreign exchange regulator, said China was expected to maintain a small current account surplus and keep a basic balance in international payments.

32,2020/02/15,Sri Lanka ‘strongly objects’ to U.S. blacklisting its Army chief,"‘There’re no proven allegations against Gen. Shavendra’

Sri Lanka has taken “strong objection” to the U.S. blacklisting its Army chief over allegations of “gross human rights violations” that the State Department on Friday called “serious and credible”.

In addition to a statement from the U.S. State Department, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a tweet: “I am designating Shavendra Silva making him ineligible for entry into the U.S. due to his involvement in extrajudicial killings during #SriLanka’s Civil War. The U.S. will not waver in its pursuit of accountability for those who commit war crimes and violate #humanrights.”

Responding swiftly to the development, Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Foreign Relations said: “The Government of Sri Lanka takes strong objection to the imposition of travel restrictions on Lt. Gen. Silva and his immediate family members by the Government of the United States, based on independently unverified information.”

“The Government reiterates that Lt. Gen. Shavendra Silva was appointed as the Commander of the Army by the then Head of State, taking into account his seniority and that there were no substantiated or proven allegations of human rights violations against him. His elevation as the Acting Chief of Defence Staff by the current Head of State President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, was on account of his being the senior most serving military officer,” the Ministry said in a statement issued late on Friday.

Observing that the “timing” of the imposition — six months after Lt. Gen. Silva’s appointment as Army Commander — was concerning, Colombo urged the U.S. to “verify the authenticity of the sources of information and to review its decision”.

Mr Silva was appointed to the post by former President Maithripala Sirisena last year. The move, that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights termed “deeply troubling”, set off concern among Tamils and civil society groups demanding war-time accountability. Mr. Silva, who commanded the 58 Division of the Sri Lankan army during the final stages of the war, is linked to the infamous “white flag” incident when surrendering LTTE cadre were reportedly executed, after being assured safety.

Joining the government in defending the controversial Army commander, Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa on Saturday termed the travel ban on a “heroic field commander” regrettable and unfortunate. “All of us stand by him and his family at this hour of need. As a country we shall always stand with the war heroes that brought about an end to 30 years of terrorism,” he said in a tweet.

The Tamil National Alliance said it hoped that the ban “opened the eyes” of the governments that have been avoiding accountability in the 10 years since the war ended. “We see this as a small improvement as a result of the affected Tamil people’s long struggle for justice,” its spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran said in a statement, urging the Sri Lankan government to act upon evidence from international investigations and bring perpetrators to justice.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fyke1q/article30823118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Silva,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-takes-strong-objection-to-us-travel-ban-on-army-chief-requests-to-review-decision/article30827872.ece
33,2020/02/15,No handshakes: Viral outbreak spooks Asian places of worship,"A Protestant church in Seoul shut its doors and switched entirely to online worship services after one of its followers tested positive for the virus on Jan. 30.

In a popular Catholic church in the Philippines, nearly half of the pews were empty for Sunday Mass.

The few hundred worshippers who showed up were asked to refrain from shaking others’ hands or holding them during prayers to prevent the spread of the virus that started in China.

In Hong Kong, Cardinal John Hon Tong, wearing a mask, announced the suspension of public Masses for two weeks and urged churchgoers to instead watch them online.

Buddhist temples, Christian churches and Muslim mosques have been ordered closed since Jan. 29 in mainland China, where the new coronavirus strain was first detected in central Wuhan, under an order to avoid “collective religious activities.”

The restrictions and dwindling crowds in religiously diverse places of worship underscore the extent of the scare over the outbreak that has permeated many aspects of life in the hard-hit Asian region.

An image of a coronavirus.

The virus has killed more than 1,500 people and infected more than 67,000 others, mostly in China, where several cities that are home to more than 60 million people have been placed under lockdown in an unprecedented effort to contain the disease.

All but three of the deaths have been in China. Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines have reported one fatality each.

In Japan, where Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines are tourist destinations, a sharp decline in the number of foreign visitors has been a palpable setback. At normally popular Suzumushi, or Crickets, temple, a sign read, Due to the impact of the COVID-19, no waiting expected, using the name given to the disease by the World Health Organization.

We assimilate with parishioners and many other people. We know that the talk of the town is really this virus and it’s obvious that many are scared, said the Rev. Siegfred Arellano, a priest at the Binondo church in the Philippine capital’s Chinatown.

Attendance at Masses, Arellano said, has really dropped. After consulting health experts, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines announced steps late last month to fight the virus. Churchgoers were advised to avoid hand contact and receive the Eucharist, which symbolizes the body of Jesus Christ, in the hand instead of the mouth.

They said holy water should be replaced more often in church stoups and a protective cloth installed on the grills separating priests and worshippers in confessional boxes.

In Hong Kong, Tong initially approved precautions that included a choice for churchgoers to watch Sunday Mass online. Those who opted to go to churches were asked to wear masks and told that singing is suspended, except for short hymns like Allelulia. The new virus is spread through respiratory droplets, according to health officials.

He later announced the two-week suspension of Masses, saying the move was crucial to suppressing the outbreak and asked Hong Kong’s 400,000-strong Catholic community not to panic.

Crowds also have thinned at Bangkok’s popular Wat Pho, a centuries-old Buddhist temple complex known for its giant reclining Buddha. The temple is normally visited by thousands of tourists, many of them Chinese, during the peak travel season from December to February, but large numbers of visitors as well as locals have stayed away since the outbreak began, said Phra Maha Udom Panyapho, a monk in charge of tourism at the temple.

A Protestant church in Seoul shut its doors and switched entirely to online worship services after one of its followers tested positive for the virus on Jan. 30.

Other Protestant churches in South Korea have sprayed their halls and rooms with disinfectant, canceled children’s Bible school programs and asked followers to minimize socializing. Hundreds of Catholic churches in the country have halted the use of holy water stoups, allowed churchgoers to wear masks during Masses and discouraged those with flu-like symptoms or those who came from countries with confirmed cases of infection from attending.

Unlike public areas such as shopping malls, recreational centers and parks, discouraging the devout from going to their places of worship and imposing other restrictions on sacred sites can be extra sensitive. Amid the risks, some devotees consider going to religious gatherings as a test of faith.

The virus can’t dampen my faith, said Rey Gilber, a 55-year-old father of two who went to Mass at the Binondo church in Manila with his family. God is always there and won’t abandon us. A key mosque in Malaysia’s administrative capital of Putrajaya and two other mosques briefly closed their doors last month to non-Muslim visitors amid the virus scare, but later reopened after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called the move irresponsible.

Tens of thousands of ethnic Hindus, meanwhile, gathered last weekend to celebrate an annual festival called Thaipusam in the central Malaysian state of Selangor, undeterred by the outbreak. Malaysia has reported 19 cases of the virus.

Still, hundreds of staff and temple workers along with two dozen ambulances stood by. Emergency medical outposts were established as a precaution at the Batu Caves temple on a limestone hill, where pilgrims and tourists descended to watch devotees pierce their skin with hooks and skewers and carry offerings up a flight of 272 steps to the temple.

We will not get the virus because God exists here, said Saratha, a 60-year-old housewife.

35,2020/02/15,Erdogan raises Kashmir issue in Pakistan Parliament,"The Turkish President draws parallel between Gallipoli and Kashmir

Notwithstanding India’s objection, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday raked up the Kashmir issue in Pakistan Parliament, vowing that Ankara will support Pakistan’s stand. On an official visit to Pakistan, Mr. Erdogan said that Turkey will back Pakistan in its efforts to come out of the “grey list” of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

“I also want to emphasise that we will give support to Pakistan which is subject to political pressure in the Financial Action Task Force meetings,” he said on the upcoming meeting of the anti-terror financing watchdog.

Voicing his country’s support to Pakistan’s stand on the Kashmir issue, he said it can be resolved not through conflict or oppression but on the basis of justice and fairness.

“Our Kashmiri brothers and sisters have suffered from inconveniences for decades and these sufferings have become graver due to unilateral steps taken in recent times,” Mr. Erdogan said, apparently referring to India revoking the special status of Jammu and Kashmir in August last year.

“Today, the issue of Kashmir is as close to us as it is to you (Pakistanis).

“Such a solution (on the basis of justice and fairness) will serve the interests of all parties concerned. Turkey will continue to stand by justice, peace and dialogue in the resolution of the Kashmir issue,” the president said.

The Turkish President, in his address, likened the “struggle” of the Kashmiris with that of his country in the World War I against foreign domination.

Drawing comparison with the battle of Gallipoli which was fought in Turkey between the Allied Powers and the Ottoman Empire in which over two lakh troops were killed on the both sides, Mr. Erdogan said “there is no difference between Gallipoli and Kashmir“.

“Turkey will continue to raise its voice against the oppression,” he told Pakistani lawmakers in his address to the National Assembly and Senate, which was his record fourth address to the Pakistani Parliament over the years.

In September last year, Erdogan raised the Kashmir issue during his address at the United Nations General Assembly.

India rejects comments

Reacting to his remarks in the UN, India said it “deeply regrets” the statement of Turkey on the Kashmir issue, and termed it an internal matter.

External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar called upon Turkey to have a proper understanding of the situation in Kashmir before making further comments.

India revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5. Reacting to India’s move, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.

37,2020/02/15,40 killed in attacks in restive central Mali,"A local government official blamed the attack on a Dogon hunters' group

Forty people, including nine soldiers, have been killed in a spate of attacks in central Mali, authorities said Friday, with most of the deaths caused by inter-ethnic violence in the deeply troubled region.

Thirty-one people were killed in an attack overnight in Ogossagou, a village mainly inhabited by Fulani people where 160 died last March in a massacre blamed on Dogon militiamen, the government said, raising the death toll.

About 30 gunmen carried out the new attack, village chief Aly Ousmane Barry told AFP. ""Huts and crops were set alight, livestock was burned or taken away,"" he added, vowing that the government would find the perpetrators.

A local government official, who requested anonymity, had earlier said that 28 people were missing. He blamed the attack on a Dogon hunters' group — an assertion that could be not be verified independently.

The official and village chief Aly Ousmane Barry both said the attackers moved in several hours after government troops had pulled out of the area.

Eight soldiers killed in ambush

Later Friday eight Mali soldiers were killed and four others injured in an ambush in the central Gao region, the army said.

The Malian force also suffered ""material damage,"" the military said on social media sites, without indicating who had carried out the attack in the village of Bentia.

Also on Friday a soldier was killed in an attack on a military camp in Mondoro, also in central Mali, security officials said.

The camp had already been hit before — as part of a joint raid by militants that also targeted the military camp of Boulkessy near the border with Burkina Faso, killing at least 25 soldiers.

Central Mali became gripped by ethnic violence after a jihadist revolt broke out in the north of the country in 2012. The insurgency has claimed thousands of lives and spread to neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso. Tit-for-tat attacks in central Mali flared after Fulani people, also called Peul, became associated with jihadists.

Led by a firebrand Islamic preacher Amadou Koufa, a militia called the Katiba Macina recruited members from among the Fulani and has been accused of ethnically-motivated attacks.

Other ethnic groups such as the Bambara or the Dogon began to form self-defence groups that have been accused of reprisal massacres.

In addition to the latest attack at Ogossagou, 14 Fulani were killed in central Mali in January.

Around 75 Dogons were killed in the villages of Sobane Da, Gangafani and Yoro in June last year, in an attack blamed on Fulani militants.

'Epicentre' of violence

Human Rights Watch this month pointed to the ethnic patchwork of central Mali as the country's ""epicentre"" of violence. It said over 450 civilians had been killed in the region in 2019, ""the deadliest year for civilians"" since the jihadist insurgency began.

Reflecting the chronic instability, Malian soldiers are themselves frequently targeted.

On January 26, Al-Qaeda-linked militants attacked a military camp in Sokolo, central Mali, killing 20 gendarmes and wounding five more. The violence in central Mali coincides with renewed hopes that the fragile government can reassert control over the largely lawless north. Troops returned on Thursday to Kidal, a northern town that had been a bastion of Tuareg rebels, after a six-year absence.

Regular forces returned to the town accompanied by former rebels who have been integrated into the army under a regional peace agreement. The deal, reached in Algiers in 2015, is considered one of the few avenues Mali has for escaping the cycle of violence.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/c6sghh/article30827532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001F24GL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/40-killed-in-attacks-in-restive-central-mali/article30827533.ece

40,2020/02/15,Mexican demonstrators splash presidential palace red in protest over murder of women,"An average of 10 women a day are killed in Mexico. Last year marked a new overall homicide record, official data shows.

Demonstrators graffitied the phrase “femicide state” in blood-red on Mexico's presidential palace on Friday, before marching under heavy rain to the offices of newspaper La Prensa to protest the publication of a gruesome image of a murder victim.

The heated Valentine's Day demonstration, led by women, was sparked by the killing of 25-year-old Ingrid Escamilla in Mexico City and the publication of graphic photos of her mutilated corpse in newspapers.

The protesters, numbering at least a couple hundred and comprised mostly of women, burned vehicles belonging to La Prensa and briefly clashed with security forces who prevented them from entering the newspaper's offices.

Chanting “not one more murder” and carrying signs saying “we demand responsible journalism,” “Ingrid we are all you” and “sexism kills,” the demonstrators demanded justice.

An average of 10 women a day are killed in Mexico. Last year marked a new overall homicide record, official data shows.

“It's not just Ingrid. There are thousands of femicides,” said Lilia Florencio Guerrero, whose daughter was violently killed in 2017. “It fills us with anger and rage.”

She called on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who was inside the palace during the protests, to do more to stop the violence.

One protester spray-painted “INGRID” in tall pink letters on a door of the presidential palace. Many participants noted that Escamilla's was only the latest in a wave of brutal murders of women that have been dubbed “femicides.”

Others graffitied slogans including “they are killing us” on the building's walls and ejected bright flames from cans of flammable spray-paint.

Inside the stately palace, where Lopez Obrador lives with his family, the president attempted to reassure the activists during his morning news conference.

“I'm not burying my head in the sand. ... The government I represent will always take care of ensuring the safety of women,” he said, without detailing new plans.

Protesters also admonished the newspapers that published photos of Escamilla's corpse, chanting, “The press is complicit.”

La Prensa, which ran the image on its cover, defended its record of reporting on crime and murder, subjects that it said the government prefers to keep quiet. The paper said it was open to discussion on adjusting its standards beyond legal requirements.

“We understand today that it hasn't been sufficient, and we've entered a process of deeper review,” the paper said in a front-page statement on Friday.

A 22-year-old student dressed in black, with a mask covering her face and carrying a can of spray paint, said the protests after Escamilla's death already seemed to have an affect.

La Prensa, she said, had caved to “pressure from feminists.”

Another newspaper, Pasala, had filled nearly its entire tabloid cover with the photo of Escamilla's corpse, under the Valentine's Day-themed headline: “It was cupid's fault.” The cover sparked anger not only at the gory display, but also the jocular tone over a crime for which Escamilla's domestic partner has been arrested.

41,2020/02/15,"COVID-19: death toll in China surges past 1,500; over 66,000 infected","Chinese authorities have placed some 56 million people in Hubei under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.

The death toll from China's new coronavirus epidemic surged past 1,500 on Saturday after 143 more people died in the country, according to official data.

The National Health Commission also reported 2,641 new cases of the COVID-19 strain, with the vast majority in hard-hit central Hubei province.

More than 66,000 people have now been infected in China from an illness that emerged in the Hubei capital Wuhan in December and spread nationwide a month later.

Also Read WHO to not call novel coronavirus by official name

All but four of the 143 new deaths were in Hubei, raising the toll to 1,523.

Chinese authorities have placed some 56 million people in Hubei under quarantine, virtually sealing off the province from the rest of the country in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus.

A number of cities far from the epicentre have also imposed tough measures limiting the number of people who can leave their homes, while schools remain closed nationwide and many companies have encouraged employees to work from home.

The scale of the epidemic swelled this week after authorities in Hubei changed their criteria for counting cases, adding thousands of new patients to their tally.

Cases “clinically diagnosed” through lung imaging are now being counted in addition to those that have shown up positive in laboratory tests.

The revision added nearly 15,000 patients to Hubei's tally on Thursday, with the World Health Organization noting that cases going back weeks were retroactively counted.

There were over 4,800 cases reported in Hubei on Friday and 2,420 on Saturday.

The number of new cases confirmed has been steadily falling outside Hubei, with 221 infections reported on Saturday.

Authorities said Friday 1,716 medical workers have been infected during the outbreak, with six dying from the illness.

Most of the infections among health workers were in Hubei's capital, Wuhan, where many have lacked proper masks and gear to protect themselves in hospitals dealing with a deluge of patients.

The grim figures come a week after grief and public anger erupted over the death of a whistleblowing doctor who had raised the alarm about the virus in December and been reprimanded and silenced by police in Wuhan.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5bsvvr/article30827354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1200821315THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-death-toll-in-china-surges-past-1500-over-66000-infected/article30827355.ece
42,2020/02/15,China's Hubei Province reports 139 new coronavirus deaths on February 14,"The number of new deaths in China's central Hubei Province from the coronavirus outbreak rose by 139 as of February, the Province's health commission said on its website on February 15.

A further 2,420 cases had been detected in Hubei, the epicentre of the outbreak, taking the total in the Province to 54,406.

Experts question China's numbers

Infections and deaths from the new virus in China ballooned for a second straight day on February, on paper at least, as officials near the epicenter of the outbreak struggled to keep up with a backlog of patients’ lab work.

The acceleration in cases was not necessarily an indicator of a surge in the illness known as COVID-19 because the hardest-hit province of Hubei and its capital of Wuhan changed the way it counted cases. But public health experts wrestled with what exactly could be deduced from the numbers given the shift in approach.

""If you change the way you count cases, that obviously confounds our capacity to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of the quarantine,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in the United States. “We have to interpret the numbers with great caution.”

The WHO pressed for more details on Friday on the change in tabulating cases. Doctors in Hubei are now making diagnoses based on symptoms, patient history and chest X-rays instead of waiting for laboratory confirmation.

""We’re seeking further clarity on how clinical diagnoses are being made to ensure other respiratory illnesses including influenza are not getting mixed into the COVID-19 data,” said WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Meantime, the vulnerability of health workers responding to the epidemic was crystalized with other data emerging from China. More than 1,700 medical workers in China have contracted COVID-19 and six have died, according to the health commission, which said it was “highly concerned” by the infections.

WHO echoed that, with Mr. Tedros saying more information was needed on when the workers were infected and under what circumstances. Transmissions to front-line health workers can signal problems in infection control policies and signal that a disease is becoming more easily transmissible.

Dr. Schaffner said he was optimistic that China’s unprecedented quarantines — putting 60 million people in its hardest-hit cities under lockdown — would help reduce transmissions. But without consistent numbers, he said, it was hard to draw any such conclusion.

""China and the world community would like to restore a sense of normalcy but in order to do that we need to have confidence in what is going on and we’re not there yet,” Dr. Schaffner said.

China has come under intense criticism within the country for its response to the crisis and has been the target of complaints from elsewhere too. But WHO’s chief of emergencies, Dr. Michael Ryan, defended China’s handling of the outbreak and its cooperation with others.

""From our perspective, we have a government that’s cooperating with us, that’s inviting in international experts, that’s shared sequences with the world, that continues to engage with the outside community,” he said.

The vast majority of cases are in China but reverberations from the outbreak were felt around the world, with hundreds of infections reported elsewhere.

More than 580 cases have been confirmed outside mainland China, including the first infection on the African continent, reported on Friday in Egypt. Experts and African leaders have expressed concern that should the virus spread there, it might wreak havoc among less developed countries with fewer health resources.

43,2020/02/15,Spades or no trump,"Today’s deal is from a competition in Australia, where the “weak” no trump, 12-14, is popular. Proponents show a 15-17 no trump by opening one of a minor and rebidding one no trump. When partner responds in opener’s four-card major, opener has a choice of rebids. North, with a completely flat hand, chose to rebid one no trump instead of raising spades. South made a quantitative raise and North finally showed his spade support at the six level.

South was Mike Cornell, a world champion from New Zealand. Had they played this deal in six no trump, declarer would have had to pick up two out of the three missing queens. In spades, however, Cornell showed that it was only necessary to find the queen of trumps, provided that the trumps split 3-2. It is slightly better to play West for the queen of spades, as you can pick up a possible queen-nine-fourth only in the West hand. Accordingly, Cornell won the opening club lead with dummy’s king, led a spade to his ace, and then led a spade to dummy’s jack. Success!

It was now a simple matter to draw the last outstanding trump, cash the ace and queen of clubs, and then cash the ace and king of hearts. Cornell then exited with a heart, not caring which opponent won the trick. Whichever opponent had the queen would be end played and forced to yield a ruff-sluff or break the diamond suit. Cornell just faced his cards and the opponents conceded.

44,2020/02/15,It’s super annoying. But I accept it as just one of those things that happen: spamming,"From real estate deals to sex advice to restaurant coupons, telemarketing offers are endless

I went to a Chinese restaurant once in 2016. They noted down my phone number “for their records”. I’ve never been there since; the food wasn’t particularly good and I’m not a big fan of Chinese food either. Plus, it was a different city from where I live. Yet, once every few months, the restaurant sends me a WhatsApp message with photos of whatever new dish or deal they’ve introduced. This has been going on for four years now. I haven’t blocked the number because it’s become a tradition of sorts: they send me a photo, I look at it, curse half-heartedly, and move on.

It’s weird how spam is just a normal part of life now. Every single day, I get about 10 phone calls from numbers I don’t recognise. Five of those I answer and hang up immediately because there’s music playing and a robot voice talking some rubbish with fake enthusiasm. The other five are real humans trying to sell me something, usually insurance or some bank-related stuff. I have a rehearsed answer — “not interested, thank you” — which I repeat more emphatically a second or third time if they’re persistent. Sometimes they ask me to hear them out at least, but I don’t. Other times, they understand and cut the call, moving on to the next number on their list. Then I block their number, so they call me from a different number the next day.

Accounting for both call and SMS spam, I have so far blocked 376 numbers on my phone, a phone I bought less than six months ago. Even then, there are around 20 new additions to my collection every day. My morning routine begins with periodically deleting all the spam emails I’ve gotten in the time I spent sleeping, despite the presence of a pretty vigilant spam filter on Gmail. On my phone, I’m targeted with all the usual stuff: real estate, astrology, sexual virility assistance, insurance, credit cards, restaurant deals, lottery wins, “friendship clubs”. But a puzzling addition to all this is fish spam. For some reason, wholesale fish suppliers in Mumbai keep bombarding my phone with great offers for 10 kilos of surmai and pomfret. I have no idea why; I’ve never bought raw fish in my life.

And yet, I rarely feel outright anger. Sure, it’s super annoying. But I accept it as just one of those things that happens — a repetitive, ritualistic exchange that serves neither spammer nor spammee — and one moves on.

Nothing meaningful

Which isn’t to say that others don’t feel rage. Some people get vindictive about it and in a misguided attempt at retribution direct their anger at the person calling them. But it’s mostly just a momentary need to vent; a fickle anger that doesn’t lead to anything meaningful. We’ve all just learnt to accept spam as a maddening part of everyday urban life. Like charging your phone. It sounds absurd only when you take a step back to think, “Why are strangers calling or texting me around 150 times a week to ask for my money? That can’t be a normal thing that happens.”

Except it does. And I can’t remember when the change took place. Phone and email spam have always been a thing; companies have been sharing our information behind our backs for years, and we’ve always been furious. There’s even a Do-Not-Disturb registry to which you can add your number for a relatively spam-free life. But for some reason, it feels to me like the past couple of years have seen spam rise considerably.

Loosely, I’d say it’s because we’re now registered on so many apps — for ordering food, for calling a cab, for hotel accommodation, for booking flights, for talking to friends, for meeting strangers, for putting up photos and videos, for counting how many steps we took today, for making payments, for listening to music — so there’s a much wider pool to mine our data from. And there’s, of course, the fact that literally everyone (barring one entire former State) has quick and easy Internet access now. So it makes sense, on the surface, for companies to direct their efforts into spam marketing. But does it even work? How many people, out of the lakhs that they presumably target, actually pay up? It can’t possibly be worth all the trouble. But who will tell them?

45,2020/02/15,An Agatha Christie mystery on the Kerala backwaters,"Christie’s ghost continues to haunt people who are continents away from her prim English countryside

Twelve of us, gathered for a weekend of books at a homestay on the Kerala backwaters. Coconut palms rise into an azure sky, a houseboat’s moored to the jetty, a yellow hammock’s strung across trees. Now all we need is a murder, à la Agatha Christie.

High above the coconut palms a Brahminy kite soars and dives, and on the water, herons skim over the hyacinths. Less than a kilometre away in the wetlands is the notorious Cerbera odollam tree, whose green apple-like fruits cause instant death. On this still sunny early Friday evening in the backwaters, everything seems calm. But calm has never been particularly reassuring in a Christie novel.

I look around at the other 11, and it strikes me how little we know about each other. We could — all of us, anyone — be characters in a Christie novel.

There’s A, whose travels take him for Vienna to Varanasi. In between he makes stopovers at the capital, where the powers-that-be accept files full of market reports from him.

There’s R, who learnt Russian, because he fell in love with Dostoevsky and wanted to read him in the original. A son of the soil, his friends and acquaintances range from Polish, Czech and Canadian fellow students to chess grandmaster Kasparov and possibly even Putin.

Cosmopolitan cast

And D, who interestingly enough, works with the U.S. government, in the Department of Education, holding a position that sounds like the codeword for a spy. D seldom shrinks from speaking her mind. This sometimes draws her into controversy with her northern neighbour, the Canadian. A tall bluff man, hearty. He has a keen knowledge of the country and is well networked, being a member of two book clubs and a regular at little-known conferences. And if this sounds too John le Carré, there’s also the Artist. She travels. Exhibitions in Paris and Dubai this year, in unknown other places coming up next year. Perhaps she is more than what she seems.

The last few to complete this motley mix are the Doctor of Development, the Tech Titan, the Chocolate Man, the Ghost Writer and the CEO. The Doctor of Development is Scandinavian, her work takes her to the smallest districts in India; the Tech Titan’s travels are more international. The Chocolate Man commutes too, weekdays in Singapore, weekends in Mumbai.

Everyone’s read Christie, starting from when we were about 10. Christie, like Enid Blyton, sells more in India than in England. Agatha Christie gave us our first lessons in psychology. We were mesmerised by Miss Marple, the elderly aunt who unerringly sniffs out out homicidal tendencies in a roomful of strangers. Christie gave us the first warnings about false news, with a tutorial on unreliable narrators. And all this complexity in such simple language.

Someone’s missing

Back to the homestay, where teams are being drawn up for a Christie quiz. We realise someone is missing. It is the Ghost Writer.

We call out, we walk to the houseboat moored alongside. If this homestay were an English countryhouse, surely this houseboat would be Dead Man’s Folly. In the Agatha Christie novel of that name, a game of guess-the-murderer turns sinister as a local girl turns up dead.

Thinking about this can spook us out, so we don’t. We call out instead and there she appears, the Ghost Writer. She’s been musing over the murders in And Then There Were None. Her edition looks unfamiliar, because the original had a title deemed racist now. Set on a lonely island, where a group of 10 fall prey to multiple murders, the book was called Ten Little Niggers.

It’s dark by now: dinner has been served. The herons, kites and cormorants have retired for the night, only a frog or two croaks. Time to make our way through the darkness to our bedrooms.To sleep through the night, to come back to appams and coconut chutney for breakfast. And to a complete count of the original 12 of this cast, all alive and arguing still.

46,2020/02/15,"In the time of smartphones, I read a book, almost","If there is one thing I’ve learnt from our government, it is that you should never play down your achievements, even if they don’t exist

Last Sunday, sitting at my desk, I wept tears of joy and self-improvement. For the first time in months, I had managed to read seven entire pages of a book. By book, I don’t mean a text mounted on a screen — no Kindle-swindle. I mean a physical book, with pages that can’t be scrolled, provision to insert a hand-made bookmark, and infinite battery life.

Believe it or not, I didn’t break off even once — not to check my phone, not to Google a reference, not even to rescue Indian democracy from fascism. I think the last time I accomplished a feat of this magnitude was in 1987, when I hit four consecutive boundaries off the last four balls of the last over to take my school to victory against Donnie Brasco Senior Secondary School, the then under-14 defending champions of West Mambalam.

Unfortunately, my joy was short-lived. The wife picked up the book and discovered that the bookmark was on the opening page of Chapter 1. “How do you claim to have read seven pages?” she demanded.

Well, this is what sets apart a true bibliophile like me from the millions of pretenders. It all comes down to how you count the pages. I am old school. I adopt the time-honoured practice followed by every publisher when they declare the number of pages in a new title: I count from the copyright page. So yes, when I said I read seven pages, I may have forgotten to mention that this included the copyright page, the title page, the author bio-page (he divides his time between New Jersey and Old Pyjama), the dedication page, two pages of ‘Contents’, and one blank page. I had just made it to the first full page of closely printed text when I got an urgent ping on my phone, and the rest, as they say, is Netflix.

Mighty feat

Nonetheless, if there is one thing I’ve learnt from our government, it is that you should never play down your achievements, even if they don’t exist. So, while it may be true that I haven’t finished a book in a long time, it must also be acknowledged that advancing seven pages deep into unknown bookish territory is no mean achievement in this day and age.

People who grew up in the pre-smartphone era would remember how easy they had it. All you had to do was curl up in bed with a book and keep turning the pages until you reached the last page. You didn’t have to contend with a passive-aggressive gadget suffering from an attention-seeking disorder, as we all do now. I remember, as a teenager, having The Brothers Karamazov for breakfast, War and Peace for lunch, and Vanity Fair for dinner. Each of them is more than 1,000 pages long. And I finished them all in 24 hours flat. That’s the kind of concentration I had. But today, all it takes is a momentary remembrance of pings past, and I drop the dead tree text for the digital device.

There was a time when I would never venture out without a book. What if I have to wait? Of course, I was the one who was always late. I think the last (and first) time I was expected somewhere and didn’t turn up late was the momentous occasion of my birth — I arrived three weeks early. Since then I’ve been the aam aadmi’s Godot, prone to making anyone wait anywhere any time for purely existential reasons.

Compulsory no more

Still, you never know. What if the person I’m meeting has an accident or something, and ends up being more late — later? — than even me? So a book for me was a compulsory accessory. But not anymore. Now I have, in the palm of my hand, so much material that I can comfortably wait not just for hours or days but months and years. I can spend the rest of my life simply waiting, say, for Indians to stop electing hateful Voldemorts while I finish every episode of every season of every series on my watch list.

The only problem is I have an image to keep up — of this person who reads a lot, supports the publishing industry by buying books, and boosts the self-esteem of struggling writers by donating free blurbs. None of this is sustainable if I don’t actually, you know, read. So, whenever I feel like taking a break from streaming video, I try to read a book. Along the way, I give myself some positive reinforcement for effort — as without effort, I wouldn’t have able to keep notifications at bay for the 13 treacherous seconds it took me to navigate from the copyright page to line 1 of page 1 of chapter 1. This may be an insignificant step for cynics without WiFi. But it’s a giant leap for someone whose ‘reading habit’ is limited to subtitles.

47,2020/02/15,This little Telangana village hosts one of the biggest festivals: Sammakka Saralamma Jatara,"Every two years, Medaram village turns into a riot of colours as millions of people gather for a centuries-old Koya festival

As waves of protests led by women reverberate through the country, a four-day carnival, which celebrates women’s valour in another era, unfolds in Medaram village, Telangana. Sammakka Saralamma Jatara, the centuries-old festival of the Koya tribe, has turned the dusty little village into the venue of one of the country’s biggest festivals. Over four days every two years, usually between February 5 and 8, some 1.3 crore people throng to the village to make offerings to the goddesses Sammakka and Saralamma.

One of the legends is about the revolt of the Koya tribe against the Kakatiya rulers who asked them to pay taxes during a year of drought. “The Kakatiya rulers sent their army to fight the Koyas who were no match for the better equipped and disciplined Kakatiya army,” says Jayadheer Tirumala Rao, an academic who has collected the oral histories of the Koyas.

One after the other the Koya warriors fell, forcing the matriarch Sammakka to enter the battle fray. She too could not win against the skilled Kakatiya soldiers and retreated to the jungle with injuries. She cursed them, saying the Kakatiya reign would soon end. It is to commemorate the mother and daughter, Sammakka and Saralamma, who wielded swords much before the Kakatiya queen Rudrama, that the Koyas began to organise the jatara. And now, every two years, this ancient story is brought to life, enchanting millions in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.

Bringing them home

Carrying a whip, and wearing an oversized mask of a goddess, a group of dancing pilgrims makes its way to the VIP queue complex. “My ancestors did it, we are continuing the tradition,” says Subaiah, a farmer from Khammam, who walks ahead of the drummers leading the band of revellers.

A day earlier, in the middle of the month of Magh, Koya priests had climbed down the Chilkalgutta hillock carrying a bhariney (casket) with vermilion symbolising Sammakka, who must be brought to her place of residence for three days. Saralamma is brought down from another hillock, Kannepally. As the priests descend the hillock, a police official fires three rounds into the air and a frenzied mass of people follows the priests as they race to bring the goddess to the altar. A round platform surrounded by tall railings is the gadde (throne or altar) for Sammakka for three days, and another one is dedicated to Saralamma.

Sacred, sexual

In the liberating anonymity of the festival, men dress as women with daubs of lipstick, trans people don oversized nose pins, and, together with young boys and married women, some carrying blocks of jaggery on their heads, jostle towards the twin gadde.

Before the devotees begin prayers, they must bathe in the river Jampanna Vagu, named after the martyred brother of Saralamma, which is a tributary of the Godavari. The brave ones step into the shallow, muddy, red water, while others choose to stand under the showers that pump treated water.

The sacred, the spiritual, and the sexual coalesce in this village fringed by a river and ringed by hillocks and forests. Thousands of makeshift tents dot the village where families wait for an opportune moment to pray to the goddesses. For some families, it is 10 days of revelry, where they get to let their hair down, to sing and dance to the tinny two-tone drumbeat whipped by the tribal elders. The women stick to beer while the men wash down the food with plenty of hard liquor.

From the watchtower, the bathing ghats appear like colourful grains of sand scattered on the riverbanks. In the water, groups of women huddle and then some of them go into a trance. A spiritual frenzy takes over as the ‘possessed’ women shake, convulse and flail their arms, swaying their hair and contorting their faces; they talk, shout and gesticulate: for the moment, they are oracles conversing with the gods.

Adilakshmi, 40, has travelled from Vemulwada, about 180 km away. Her family drags a vermillion-smeared lamb and chicken to the sacrificial spot created between two mounds of jaggery, coconuts and a quarter bottle of liquor. Adilakshmi goes into a trance. “What wrong have I done? When will I have a child? Amma tell me,” a family member asks, as Adilakshmi mutters, grunts and rocks. Her reply is considered the words of the goddess. “Be nice to your family, you will have a child,” someone translates the incoherent words.

Deva, who had walked 13 km from Gonepally with her family, will stay in the village for 10 days. Her breath has that overpowering smell of molasses, just like almost every person at the jatara. They visit every two years whenever the festival takes place, to pray for the family’s well-being, she says.

Coconuts and helmets

But the closer the devotees get to the altar, the mayhem increases. The pilgrims send their offerings of coconuts and jaggery pieces sailing through the air to the altar. In the middle of it all is a tall bamboo, decked with a hairpiece and draped in saris. Today, several non-tribal beliefs have become part of the festival. “The tribal communities don’t have idols. Also, until 1955, some 2,000 people used to visit Medaram, of which the main group of worshippers comprised 1,500 tribal people,” says Dyavanapalli Satyanarayana, who has researched tribal traditions and beliefs in Telangana.

According to the 2011 Census, the Koya language is spoken by 4,07,423 people in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha. These original worshippers now form just 2% of the pilgrims, and the teeming masses largely comprise 1.3 crore non-Koya people and others. The Koya worshippers once carried a large triangular flag or pagide. “The flag was handed down the generations and had inscribed on it the story of the tribe with the names of ancestors, stories of their valour, and their origins. These flags are difficult to spot now,” says Rao.

In the main altar, volunteers are wearing cricket helmets or hard hats as offerings can turn into dangerous missiles. “We are treating some hundred injuries every day, some of them serious and requiring dozens of stitches. Most of the injuries are to the head from coconuts and large chunks of jaggery being hurled,” says R. Chaitanya, the duty doctor near the altar. The injured include devotees. “I was standing in the queue and got hit by a coconut,” says Chandramouli from Bhadrachalam, as he walks out of the health centre with a bandage and a blood-soaked shirt.

On the third night of the festival, as the full moon rises, the frenzy to pray to the goddesses reaches a crescendo. A police force of 12,000 tries hard to control the people pushing and shoving to try and break through every gate and entrance to pray at the holy site. The Telangana police’s artificial intelligence technology for crowd control fumbles as the revellers leap across walls and jump the queues to reach the inner sanctum.

Tomorrow is another day. The priests will prepare to take the goddesses back to their hillocks. And soon, Medaram will return to being another village of 1,642 people.

48,2020/02/15,Help the visually challenged by joining Lit the Light’s Read Fest 2020,"A call out for volunteers: If you have the time to spare and would like to help the visually challenged, join Lit the Light’s Read Fest 2020

“From experience I can say there are many people who do not know that they can volunteer to make the life of the visually challenged better,” says Barath S N, the founder of Chennai-based Lit the Light, a group formed four years ago to help visually impaired students across Tamil Nadu. The NGO is organising the year’s first ‘Read Fest’ in temple town to sensitise more people to reading and scribing for the visually challenged.

Read Fest – 2020 is planned like an exclusive reading campaign that will give an opportunity to first time volunteers to come together in support of all those who cannot see. “It will be an experiential programme for people who do not have exposure about the struggles of the visually challenged and are not aware how they can contribute,” says Barath.

The event will be held with 150 high school students of Indian Association for the Blind at Sundarajanpatty. The students will sit in a one-to-one reading session with the walk-in volunteers, who will read out portions from prescribed text books. “Both the volunteer and the student will gain from each other, the former will get an insight into the world of darkness and understand the need and importance of voluntary service and the students will have the benefit of learning and perhaps find a new friend too,” says Barath, who had conducted the first Read Fest in Chennai in 2018. The day long event there saw the participation of 1500 volunteers. He hopes the Madurai event too will see a good footfall and help to increase the band of volunteers.

He says the visually-impaired children study in Braille until the eighth standard. In later years, they require the help of others to read and then scribe for them in exams. For the last four years, his organisation has been sending out volunteers all over Tamil Nadu to help.

“But we fall short of volunteers as mostly college students and young professionals take out time on weekends and evenings to work with those in need,” he says. “Housewives is one category we are yet to tap fully. Though many people enroll as volunteers, not everybody is free on the day and time required,” he says.

Many volunteers help by reading the textbooks and recording audio files which are then played to the visually challenged students. “But it is during the school, college and public exams time that the requirement for volunteers spikes,” he adds. At present, there are 7,000 volunteers from Tamil Nadu enrolled with Lit the Light, of which 200 are for recording books. There are small groups in USA, UK and Bahrain as well who record the audio-books.

It all started when Barath volunteered for a reading session at the Poonamallee Government High School for the Blind, Chennai, in 2012. “When one of the students scored high marks in Class XII Board exams, it made me realise how little help can take them forward and it motivated me to help more,” says Barath. Along with his friends Ram Kumar, Sakthivel, Adhiyan and and Ravi K, he continued and the school scored centum results with 11 students writing the Class XII exam the next year. This led to the formal launch of Lit the Light in 2014 and today the coordinators assist the visually impaired by conducting reading sessions, recording study materials, arranging scribes, giving technology training and discovering hidden talents. They have also started a free browsing centre with Braille in Porur to help the specially abled in applying for higher studies and jobs.

“By helping, we can empower the visually challenged individuals,” says Barath and cites the example of Jothi, who became a playback singer after music composer G V Prakash gave her a chance to sing in the movie Adangathey. “We identified her talent in 2015 and made her sing on every stage we could get for her,” says Bharath. And she was spotted when one of her videos went viral. The volunteer-based service operates in Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, Vellore, Thiruvannamalai and Salem. The team is now working on creating a digital audio library. “We are covering books in different categories such as academics, motivational and competitive exam materials and will make the audio books available online so that visually challenged students can download it anytime and use it.”

The Lit the Light Read Fest-2020 is at The IAB, Sundarajanpatty, Alagar Koil Main Road. On February 15.

The next read-fest will be held on March 1, 2020, at Presidency College (opposite Kannagi statue), Marina beach, Chennai

As much as 43-48% of new three-wheelers (excluding e-rickshaws), and 12-17% of new two-wheelers sold in India will be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2024, Crisil Research said in a study. But the traction may be low for four-wheelers, with only 5% of new sales likely to be EVs.

Looking at demand, supply and policy growth drivers for EVs such as battery costs, government subsidy and charging infrastructure, the study said that faster adoption of two-and three-wheelers would be a function of cost.

Typically, electric scooters are cheaper to run compared with ICE scooters. And e-autos are cheaper to both own and run compared with their ICE counterparts.

“Supply will also be a critical factor for adoption. The top five electric two-wheeler manufacturers are expected to increase their capacity for electric variants from 0.4 million units in fiscal 2020 to over 3 million units by fiscal 2024. And in three-wheelers, even incumbent original equipment manufacturers are launching e-autos at a rapid pace. But low-speed, four-seater e-rickshaws are fast emerging as an alternative to e-autos because of being 30% cheaper,” said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research.

But, sales of personal e-cars will remain low due to high acquisition and ownership costs, in the absence of demand incentives. Cab aggregators, however, would opt for EVs as these will provide better operational economies and subsidies.

A cab aggregator e-car that runs 50,000 km a year, for instance, can save about ₹1.65 lakh a year compared with ₹35,000 for a personal e-car that runs 10,000 km a year. The study added that in commercial vehicles, subsidies to State transport undertakings will drive sales of electric buses for intra-city operations. But poor public charging infrastructure will impact adoption.

Crisil Research expects the landed cost of the lithium ion battery, a key driver of EV adoption, to fall in line with an expected drop in global prices by fiscal 2024.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/j7am1y/article30831412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THBUEAUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/by-2024-half-of-new-3-wheelers-sold-will-be-evs/article30831413.ece

Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance is seeing higher offtake of plans with riders (additional coverage) in the last one-and-a-half months.

Subhasis Ghosh, senior executive vice-president and head of Marketing and Group Insurance, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance, told The Hindu here recently that the life insurance industry launched the ‘Sabse Pehle Life Insurance’ campaign in December. The position that Kotak has taken is to focus on plans with riders. While customers have the option to choose just the base plan, there are products with riders such as critical illness and accidental disability. Between April and December last year, 60% of the customers had taken plans with value adds. In the last one-and-a-half months, this had increased to 75%. The company has 243 branches across the country and Tamil Nadu is its third biggest market.

53,2020/02/15,Board for aligning RBI’s fiscal year with govt.’s FY,"Move on Jalan panel’s recommendation

The board of the Reserve Bank of India has recommended that the financial year of the central bank align with the government’s fiscal year from the current financial year. The RBI’s financial year starts from July and ends in June.

“The Board recommended aligning the financial year of RBI, currently July-June, with the government’s fiscal year (April-March) from the year 2020-21 and approved forwarding a proposal to the government for its consideration,” the RBI said after its board meeting on Saturday in New Delhi.

For this financial year, 2020-21, it will start on July 1, 2020, and be for nine months up to March 31, 2021. Thereafter, all financial years will start on April 1 every year, aligned with that of the government. The decision to align RBI’s financial year with the government’s fiscal year was recommended by the Bimal Jalan committee that was primarily set up to review the economic capital framework of RBI.

Since Saturday’s board meeting was the first one after the Union Budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman addressed the RBI board, as per the custom.

“The Finance Minister indicated increased complementarity in policy between the RBI and the government to address growth concerns. Complimenting the Finance Minister on the Budget, the Board members made various suggestions for the consideration of the government,” the statement said.

The board reviewed the current economic situation and various areas of operations of the RBI, it added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/board-for-aligning-rbis-fiscal-year-with-govts-fy/article30831406.ece
54,2020/02/15,Govt. closely monitoring agriculture credit given by banks: Nirmala Sitharaman,"The government in Budget 2020-21 has raised the farm loan disbursal target by 11% to₹15 lakh crore for the next fiscal and allocated ₹1.6 lakh crore to implement various plans in agriculture and allied sectors

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the government is monitoring farm credit given by banks in rural areas, adding that she expects to meet the increased target of ₹15 lakh crore for the next fiscal.

The government in Budget 2020-21 has raised the farm loan disbursal target by 11% to₹15 lakh crore for the next fiscal and allocated ₹1.6 lakh crore to implement various plans in agriculture and allied sectors as it chases the goal of doubling farmers income by 2022.

The government has allocated ₹75,000 crore for the PM-KISAN scheme for the next fiscal, which is same as the budget estimate for this fiscal but higher than revised estimate of₹54,370 crore.

“Credit limit has been expanded. I am sure it is based on local ground level requirement...we expect the demand to grow and credit requirements to also meet up with it. I am actually closely monitoring banks and their extension of credit facility particularly to rural areas. So I think we’ll be able to meet that,” she told reporters after addressing the central board of RBI here.

The farm credit target for the current fiscal has been set at ₹13.5 lakh crore.

Normally, farm loans attract an interest rate of 9%. But the government is providing 2% interest subsidy to ensure farmers get short-term farm loan of up to ₹3 lakh at an effective rate of 7% per annum.

With regard to proposed mega consolidation of public sector banks, Ms. Sitharaman said there was no discussion on the issue at the RBI board meeting on Saturday.

“I don’t see any reason to go back or any reason which is particularly causing any delay for any notification...you will hear on it as it when it comes,” she said.

Last year in August, the government announced merger of 10 public sector banks into four. United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce are to be merged with Punjab National Bank, making the proposed entity the second largest public sector bank (PSB) from April 1 this year.

It was also decided to merge Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, and Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank. Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be consolidated with Union Bank of India.

In April 2019, Bank of Baroda, in the first three-way merger exercise, amalgamated Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with itself.

SBI had merged five of its associate banks— State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Hyderabad as well as Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself effective April 2017.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ys7470/article30794638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BUNIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/govt-closely-monitoring-agriculture-credit-given-by-banks-nirmala-sitharaman/article30828613.ece

58,2020/02/15,Doctors warn against use of weight-loss drug,"It has been withdrawn from the U.S.

Indian doctors have cautioned against the use of lorcaserin (brandname Belviq or Belviq XR), a weight-loss drug that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently said is linked to a “possible increased risk of cancer.”

“Lorcaserin has been withdrawn from the U.S. market after caution by the FDA because of cancer risk. We have been using this drug to help reduce weight but were not impressed by results. We are now informing all our patients,” said endocrinologist Anoop Misra.

The FDA requested the drug manufacturer to voluntarily withdraw lorcaserin, after a post-marketing trial with more than 12,000 subjects revealed an increased occurrence of cancer.

The agency also said that health care professionals should stop prescribing and dispensing the drug to patients.

“Contact patients currently taking lorcaserin, inform them of the increased occurrence of cancer seen in the clinical trial, and ask them to stop taking the medicine. Discuss alternative weight-loss medicines or strategies with your patients,” it advised.

The decision is based on the agency’s review of the five-year trial, which was designed to evaluate cardiac health risk with the drug and ended in June 2018.

59,2020/02/15,"Human-elephant conflict most acute in W.B., Odisha, Assam","Three eastern States contribute to about half the human, elephant fatalities, ministry data reveals

Three States located in the eastern and north eastern parts of the country — West Bengal, Odisha and Assam — account for about half of both human and elephant deaths in the overall human-elephant conflict in the country, according to the latest data provided by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

Over the last five years, from 2014-15 to 2018-19, 2,381 human deaths were recorded in elephant attacks across the country, of which 1,132 (48%) fatalities were from these three States, as per the data tabled in the Rajya Sabha. West Bengal had the highest number of human casualties: 403, followed by Odisha with 397 and Assam with 332 deaths.

When it comes to unnatural deaths of elephants (mainly due to poaching, train accidents, electrocution and poisoning), the country recorded 490 deaths in the same period (2014-15 to 2018-19). Of these, 259 (53%) occurred in these three States alone. The figures were tabled in the Rajya Sabha on February 10, in response to a question by Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Majoj Kumar Jha.

Interestingly, these three States are home to just about 31% of the total population of all elephants in India. The last synchronised elephant survey in the country in 2017, had given a figure of 27,312 elephants — of which Assam had recorded 5,719 elephants, Odisha 1,976 and West Bengal 642.

Elephants electrocuted

Commenting on the particularly high incidence of human-elephant conflict in the three States, Raman Sukumar, an elephant expert and ecologist from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said that these particular States had been a “neglected region in terms of building up the knowledge base on elephant ecology”. However, the three States “have been trying to redress this in recent years by commissioning various studies,” added Prof. Sukumar, who has been studying elephant behaviour for decades.

Among the reasons for unnatural deaths of elephants, electrocution is at the top of the list, accounting for 68% of elephant deaths in the country. Of the 490 deaths in the past five years, 333 were due to electrocution. Assam accounted for 66 electrocution deaths, followed by Odisha with 57 deaths and Bengal with 39 fatalities. The second most common cause for unnatural deaths of elephants is train accidents. Between 2014-15 to 2018-19, 77 deaths were due to train accidents, whereas poaching led to the death of 27 elephants and poisoning to nine deaths.

Prof. Sukumar said that deaths due to electrocution were rising because elephants were dispersing from their traditional habitats to the wider agricultural and industrial landscape, and were also increasingly moving from one State to another.

“During their movements, the elephants increasingly come into contact with high tension wires as well as with electric wires around farms set up to keep away other wild animals like wild pigs,” he added.

The data on human-elephant conflict assumes significance when India is moving to include Asian Elephants in the list of species that merit heightened conservation at the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals scheduled to be held at Gandhinagar in Gujarat later this month.

Big Challenge

Describing the proposal to list elephants as an “interesting” development. Prof. Sukumar observed that the “most pressing issue” needing to be addressed was minimising the elephant-human conflict.

Pointing out that habitat fragmentation, mining inside forested areas and linear infrastructure building had all contributed to impinging upon the habitats of elephants, the ecologist added that at the same time scientists were not very sure about “how climatic variability has influenced elephant dispersal in this region”.

“A drought almost certainly played a role in the initial large scale dispersal of elephants from Jharkhand to southern West Bengal during 1986-87. More dispersals have since taken place into Chhattisgarh and beyond into Madhya Pradesh,” Prof. Sukumar noted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tzuisc/article30830920.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELEPHANTHINDU0506200901,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/human-elephant-conflict-most-acute-in-wb-odisha-assam/article30830921.ece
60,2020/02/15,Centre favoured telcos by deferring recovery of dues: Congress,"What is the quid pro quo, it asks Modi govt.

The Congress party on Saturday accused the BJP-led Central government of ‘favouring’ private telecom companies by deferring the recovery of their dues to the Department of Telecommunications, despite the Supreme Court orders.

Hitting out at the Centre at a press conference, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said, “What is the quid pro quo for the Modi government to defer the recovery of the dues? By delaying the payment of the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues they owe to the government, the government has unduly benefited them.”

Mr. Surjewala alleged that the Centre had approved deferring the recovery of ₹42,000 crore of “Spectrum auction instalments” of the companies for 2020-21 and 2021-22.

“The government has also issued an order not to take any coercive action,” he alleged.

Mr. Surjewala also alleged that the Centre was allowing the firms who had increased the pre-paid tariff rates to fleece the customers.

63,2020/02/15,"Masood Azhar and family missing, Pakistan tells terror financing watchdog FATF","The JeM chief was listed as a designated terrorist by UNSC1267 Committee on May 1, 2019.

Pakistan has informed global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that Masood Azhar, founder of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and his family are “missing.”

Azhar was listed as a designated terrorist by the United Nations Security Council 1267 Committee on May 1, 2019.

Pakistan has claimed that there were only 16 U.N. designated terrorists in Pakistan, of which “seven are dead”. Out of the nine who are alive, seven had applied to the U.N. for exemption from financial and travel restrictions. They are: Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed, LeT financiers and members- Haji Muhammad Ashraf, Zafar Iqbal, Hafiz Abdul Salam Bhuttavi, Yahya Mohammad Mujahid and Arif Qasmani and al Qaeda financier Abdul Rehman. The restrictions involve freezing of bank accounts.

Pakistan has said that as many as 5,500 bank accounts of individuals and members of groups listed by the U.N. committees were frozen but added that “these individuals were allowed to work for wages,” unless arrested in criminal cases. Pakistan has claimed that it had achieved 222 convictions of terrorist financiers but most were imprisoned for only a few days, a source said.

FATF reviewing Pak case

The FATF is presently reviewing Pakistan’s case to see if it fulfils the global standards criteria to combat terror financing. The FATF is currently chaired by China.

When Pakistan’s response to action initiated against U.N. designated terrorists was sought at a meeting in October last, it “continued to state that Masood Azhar and his family were missing”, the source said. It could not explain why terrorist financing investigations were not launched against Azhar, 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi or the Haqqani leadership, the source added.

JeM had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 last year where 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a car-bombing. Following this, a training camp run by it at Balakot in Pakistan was hit in a precision strike by the Indian Air Force on February 26. On March 5, Pakistan’s Ministry of Interior claimed that 44 members of banned organisations, including Azhar’s son Hamad and his brother, Abdul Raoof, were taken into “preventive detention.”

Pakistan has stated that it has arrested 38 district commanders of various terror outfits but none of them were designated by the U.N. body. Saeed was sentenced to five-and-a-half years on terror finance charges by a Lahore court on February 12, the first time he has been formally convicted of an offence. The case was registered in July 2019.

In the last FATF meeting held in January in Beijing, Pakistan is understood to have cleared about 14 of the 27 specific counter-terror goals set by the FATF to escape being placed on the “blacklist”. The final Plenary Group meeting is set to begin in Paris on February 16 onward. The adverse listing by FATF implies that it would be difficult for Pakistan to get aid from the IMF, the World Bank, ADB and the European Union.

On Grey List

Pakistan was placed on the Grey List by the FATF in June 2018 and given a plan of action to complete it by October 2019, or face the risk of being placed on the blacklist with Iran and North Korea. Pakistan was placed on the Grey list in February 2012 and was removed from it in February 2015 after it passed a National Action Plan (NAP) to deal with terrorism following the Peshawar school massacre in December 2014. It was placed under severe restrictions in 2008-2012.

64,2020/02/15,Party appointments: A delicate balancing act between Amit Shah’s regime and the new one under Nadda,"Madhya Pradesh and Kerala unit chiefs changed while those of Maharashtra and Sikkim retained

BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda made a slew of organisational appointments on Saturday, with Madhya Pradesh and Kerala getting new chiefs. After pushing for continuity in Maharashtra with Chandrakant Dada Patil and Dal Bahadur Chauhan in Sikkim, the appointments in Madhya Pradesh and Kerala mark a change, a delicate balancing act between Mr. Shah’s regime and the new one.

A communique from the BJP’s national headquarters said Khajuraho MP Vishnu Dutt Sharma had been appointed as the president for Madhya Pradesh and K. Surendran for Kerala.

Both Mr. Sharma and Mr. Surendran had been general secretaries in their State units. Mr. Surendran was the BJP’s candidate in the Pathanamthitta Lok Sabha constituency in 2019. While he managed to increase the party vote share, he came third behind Anto Antony of the Congress and Veena George of the LDF. The post had been vacant for the last few months ever since former chief P.S. Sreedharan Pillai had been appointed Governor of Mizoram.

In Madhya Pradesh, Mr. Sharma is widely regarded as the RSS’ choice and has spent most part of his career in the ABVP and the RSS including a stint as organisation mantri for Jharkhand.

66,2020/02/15,PSA on J&K leaders pressure tactics by BJP against its opponents: Congress,"Jammu and Kashmir Congress President G.A. Mir Mir was responding to a question about the slapping of the PSA on former IAS officer-turned-politician Shah Faesal

The Jammu and Kashmir Congress on Saturday criticised the administration for slapping the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on mainstream politicians in the Valley, accusing the BJP of using “pressure tactics” against its opponents.

“It is not only about valley, the BJP government is implicating anyone who is opposing its policies throughout the country and are misusing the law like PSA which is most abused over the past four decades,” Congress State President G.A. Mir told reporters during a protest demonstration here.

Mr. Mir, who led the demonstration in support of continuation of the reservation for Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs) outside the party headquarters, said those who were slapped with the PSA have worked with the BJP in the past at the Centre and in the erstwhile state.

“(National Conference vice president) Omar Abdullah was a Union minister in the A B Vajpayee-led BJP government at the Centre, while (PDP president) Mehbooba Mufti shared a plate with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the PDP-BJP government in the erstwhile State,” he said.

Mr. Mir was responding to a question about the slapping of the PSA on former IAS officer-turned-politician Shah Faesal.

He said the BJP was using “pressure tactics” against its opponents throughout the country and slapping of the PSA against mainstream leaders in J and K tantamounts to trampling of democracy.

“It (BJP) will not get any benefit from this formula and when the time will come, the people of Jammu and Kashmir will make the right decision.”

On the eight-phase by-election to over 12,500 vacant panchayat seats in Jammu and Kashmir from March 5, Mr. Mir questioned the timing of the polls and the decision to conduct the elections on party-basis.

“About 70% to 75%(panchayat) vacancies have been filled in 2018 elections on non-party basis and now they want to conduct the elections of the vacant seats on party basis....the government should correct the current notification to hold elections on party basis or declare the earlier polls conducted at the end of 2018 as invalid,” he said.

The Congress leader said he is representing the rank and file of the party in the UT and when his representatives are barred from doing any political activity in Kashmir, where most of the seats are lying vacant, what type of elections they are going to conduct.

“It is merely an eyewash,” he said, adding “in such a scenario, what is the option available with us other than boycotting the polls? Then they criticise us for boycotting the democratic exercise”.

He alleged that the BJP government and its parent organisation RSS is adamant in ending reservations for the economically and socially poor citizens of the country.

“The Congress has taken to the roads to give an assurance to the reserved categories that it will not allow the ruling party to snatch the constitutional rights from the poor whatever the consequences,” Mr. Mir said.

He alleged that the BJP “marketed hollow promises” to remain in power but is “getting exposed with each passing day.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ji1lei/article30441913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GAMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/psa-on-jk-leaders-pressure-tactics-by-bjp-against-its-opponents-congress/article30829650.ece
67,2020/02/15,"Over 10,000 policemen to be deployed in Gujarat for Trump road show","65 assistant commissioners, 200 inspectors and 800 sub- inspectors, will be deployed at strategic locations in Ahmedabad

More than 10,000 police personnel, to be led by 25 senior IPS officers, will be deployed for U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s roadshow in Gujarat on February 24, a senior official said on Saturday.

During his maiden two-day visit to India, Mr. Trump will take part in a roadshow in Ahmedabad and also tour the Sabarmati Ashram. He is also scheduled to inaugurate the newly-built cricket stadium in Motera.

More than 10,000 police personnel, including 65 assistant commissioners, 200 inspectors and 800 sub- inspectors, will be deployed at strategic locations in the city, deputy commissioner of police (control room) Vijay Patel said.

This massive deployment will be in addition to officials of the United States Secret Service, and officials of the National Security Guards (NSG) and the Special Protection Group (SPG), he added.

Mr. Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and Narendra Modi will travel along a 22-km long route, starting from the Ahmedabad International Airport to Sabarmati Ashram, and then to Motera stadium via Indira Bridge, Patel said.

“An anti-sniper team of the NSG will also be stationed along the route. A bomb detection and disposal squad of police has already started scanning the entire route,” the senior officer said.

He said the police is using a specialised software to check hotels for information about new guests, especially those who had arrived from abroad.

Explaining Trump’s itinerary, he said, “Once the dignitaries reach Sabarmati Ashram from the airport, the Prime Minister will explain to them the history and importance of the place, after which they will proceed to Motera stadium“.

More than 1.10 lakh guests, who were given personal invites, will be present at the stadium, he said, adding that the police are also conducting background checks on the invitees.

68,2020/02/15,Blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national hurts ethos of democracy: Justice Chandrachud,"Justice Chandrachud also said that use of state machinery to curb dissent instils fear, which violates the rule of law

Calling dissent a “safety valve” of democracy, Supreme Court judge Justice D.Y. Chandrachud on Saturday said “blanket labelling” of dissent as anti-national or anti-democratic strikes at the “heart” of the country’s commitment to protect Constitutional values and promote deliberative democracy.

Delivering a lecture in Gujarat, Justice Chandrachud also said that use of state machinery to curb dissent instills fear, which violates the rule of law.

“The blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national or anti-democratic strikes at the heart of our commitment to protect constitutional values and the promotion of deliberative democracy,” he said.

Also Read Peaceful agitators not traitors: Bomaby High Court

Protecting dissent is but a reminder that while a democratically elected government offers us a legitimate tool for development and social coordination, they can never claim a monopoly over the values and identities that define our plural society, Justice Chandrachud said.

He was speaking on the topic,”The Hues That Make India: From Plurality to Pluralism,” as part of the 15th Justice P.D. Desai Memorial Lecture.

“Employment of state machinery to curb dissent instils fear and creates a chilling atmosphere on free peace which violates the rule of law and distracts from the constitutional vision of pluralist society,” he added.

Justice Chandrachud’s comments came at a time when the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) has triggered massive protests in many parts of the country.

“The destruction of spaces for questioning and dissent destroys the basis of all growth — political, economic, cultural and social. In this sense, dissent is a safety valve of democracy,” he said.

Justice Chandrachud also stated that silencing of dissent and the generation of fear in the minds of people go beyond the violation of personal liberties and a commitment to constitutional value.

Notably, Justice Chandrachud was part of a bench that had in January sought response of the Uttar Pradesh government on a plea seeking quashing of notices sent to alleged protesters by the district administration for recovering losses caused by damage to public properties during anti-CAA agitations in the state.

“The attack on dissent strikes at the heart of a dialogue-based democratic society and hence, a state is required to ensure that it deploys its machinery to protect the freedom of speech and expression within the bounds of law, and dismantle any attempt to instill fear or curb free speech,” he opined.

Commitment to the protection of deliberative dialogue is an essential aspect of every democracy, particularly a successful one, Justice Chandrachud said.

He added, “A democracy welded to the ideal of reason and deliberation ensures that minority opinions are not strangulated and ensures that every outcome is not a result merely of numbers but of a shared consensus“.

Justice Chandrachud said the “true test” of a democracy is its ability to ensure the creation and protection of spaces where every individual can voice their opinion without the fear of retribution.

“Inherent in the liberal promise of the Constitution is a commitment to a plurality of opinion. A legitimate government committed to deliberate dialogue does not seek to restrict political contestation but welcomes it,” he further said.

Justice Chandrachud also underlined the importance of mutual respect and protection of space for divergent opinions.

“Taking democracy seriously requires us to respond respectfully to the intelligence of others and to participate vigorously, but as an equal in determining how we should live together,” the supreme court judge said.

Democracy is judged not just by the institutions that formally exist but by the extent to which different voices from diverse sections of the people can actually be heard, respected and accounted for, he said.

According to Justice Chandrachud, the “great threat to pluralism” is the suppression of differences and silencing of popular and unpopular voices offering alternative or opposing views.

“Suppressionof intellect is the suppression of the conscience or the nation,” he said.

The supreme court judge further said the country was conceptualised“as incorporating its vast diversity and not eliminating it“.

“National unity denotes a shared cultural values and a commitment to the fundamental ideal of Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteednot just fundamental rights but also the conditions for their free and safe exercise,” he said.

He said the country’s pluralism underlines a commitment to protect “the very idea of India as a refuge to people of various states, races, languages and beliefs“.

“In providing spaces to a multitude of culture and free space to diversity and dissent, we reaffirm to our commitment to the idea that the making of our nation is a continuous process of deliberation and belongs to every individual,” he said.

No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India, he said.

Justice Chandrachud also referred to a “positive obligation” for protecting a plural identity.

“The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India,” he said.

Justice Chandrachud also said the framers put trust on the futuregenerations to create a common bond of what it means to be an Indian, which “shunned homogeneityand celebrated diversity in what is meant to be an Indian“.

He compared the “layered Indian identity” to Matryoshka dolls, and said this is what makes us Indian “and must be central to our understanding of pluralism and efforts to foster it.”

“Homogeneityis not the defining feature of Indianness. Our differences are not our weakness. Our ability to transcend these difference in our recognition of our shared humanity is a source of our strength.

“India is a sub continent of diversity in itself. Pluralism has already achieved its greatest triumph — the existence of India. The nation’s continued survival shows us that our desire for a shared pursuit of happiness outweighs the difference in the colour of our skin, the languages we speak, or the name we give the almighty,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kp6h2p/article30829440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JUSTICEDYCHANDRACHUD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-anti-national-hurts-ethos-of-democracy-justice-chandrachud/article30829420.ece
69,2020/02/15,Amend law to make reservation mandatory for States: Mallikarjun Kharge,"Congress general secretary said amendment was necessary to “undo” the BJP-led Uttarakhand government’s “mistake” of filling up posts in public services in the state without providing reservation to SCs and STs

Congress general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge on Saturday demanded that the Centre amend law to make it mandatory for the states to implement reservation as envisaged under the Constitution.

He said amendment was necessary to “undo” the BJP-led Uttarakhand government’s “mistake” of filling up posts in public services in the State without providing reservation to SCs and STs.

He was addressing a press conference here.

“The Uttarakhand government is trying to weaken the case for reservation,” Mr. Kharge alleged.

The Supreme Court recently held that states are not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions.

The apex court passed the order while dealing with pleas regarding the Uttarakhand government’s September 5, 2012 decision to fill up all posts in public services in the state without providing reservation to SC/STs.

Expressing dismay over the SC verdict, Mr. Kharge said, .

“The apex court made certain observations, like reservation is not a fundamental right, which were not required.

“Reservation is mandated in the Constitution to provide equality of opportunities,” he added.

The Congress leader termed as “manuvadi” the Uttarakhand government’s argument that there is no fundamental right to claim reservation in appointments and promotions in public posts.

Calling it the “first step” towards ending reservation, he said the Congress will oppose the move.

Mr. Kharge said the Uttarakhand government pleaded in the court that reservation is not a fundamental right despite constitutional provision and Supreme Court did not give any direction to the government.

“PM Narendra Modi has not commented on this development when he extensively highlighted the reservation for economically weaker sections during the election campaign.

“The Centre is not filling up vacancies and instead closing down PSUs,”he said.

As far as railways is concerned, the government has privatised 150 routes, he said.

“It (Centre) is in the process of closing all the PSUs. It is trying to dismantle whatever Pandit Nehru had started soon after Independence,” he alleged.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/j0y3gd/article29937044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MALLIKARJUNKHARGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amend-law-to-make-reservation-mandatory-for-states-mallikarjun-kharge/article30829400.ece

A day after the Supreme Court rapped telecom companies for failing to pay their dues to the Department of Telecommunications despite orders, the Congress lashed out at the Centre, accusing it of “favouring” private players by deferring the recovery of dues.

Posing a question to the Union government, Congress leader Randeep Surjewala asked, “What is the quid pro quo for the Modi government to defer the recovery of dues from telecom companies?”

The apex court had on Friday directed top executives of telcos to explain why contempt action should not be initiated against them for the non-compliance of its October 2019 order to pay adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of ₹1.47 lakh crore to DoT.

Mr. Surjewala alleged that on January 23, the Narendra Modi government had issued an order “for not recovering the dues from telecom companies and not to take any coercive action”.

71,2020/02/15,Google Maps marks Kashmir’s outlines as ‘disputed’ when seen from outside India,"Launched 15 years ago, Google Maps has become one of the most-used and recognizable products for the search engine giant.

Google Maps has redrawn the world’s borders which look different depending upon where the user is viewing them from, with the popular search engine showing Kashmir’s outlines as a dotted line acknowledging “dispute” when it is seen from outside India, a leading American daily has reported.

According to the Washington Post, “the borders on Google’s online maps display Kashmir as fully under Indian control. Elsewhere, users see the region’s snaking outlines as a dotted line, acknowledging the dispute“.

From Pakistan, Kashmir appears disputed while from India, it appears as a part of India, the Post report said, adding that “Google Maps changes disputed borders based on what country you search from”.

Responding to the Post report, a company spokesperson said: “Google has a consistent and global policy to depict disputed regions and features fairly, showing claims made by the disputed or claiming nations on its global domain.

“This does not endorse or affirm the position taken by any side. Products that have been localised to the local domain, such as maps.google.co.in, depicts that country’s position as per the mandate of the local laws”.

“We’re committed to providing our users with the richest, most up-to-date and accurate maps possible. We do border updates based on data from our providers as new or more accurate data becomes available from authoritative sources or geopolitical conditions change. As we did for the state of Telangana in 2014,” the Google official told PTI.

According to the Post report, “From Argentina to the United Kingdom to Iran, the world’s borders look different depending on where you’re viewing them from. That’s because Google — and other online mapmakers — simply change them“.

Google’s corporate mission is “to organise the world’s information”, but it also bends it to its will, the Post report said, adding that with some 80 per cent market share in mobile maps and over a billion users, Google Maps has an outsize impact on people’s perception of the world.

Headquartered in California, the company’s decision-making on maps is often shrouded in secrecy, even to some of those who work to shape its digital atlases every day, the Post report said.

“It is influenced not just by history and local laws, but also the shifting whims of diplomats, policymakers and its own executives,” the report quoted as saying people familiar with the matter on the condition of anonymity.

72,2020/02/15,Pakistan summons Indian diplomat over alleged ceasefire violations along LoC,"The Foreign Office said that the Indian security forces fired in Nezapir and Rakhchikri sectors of the Line of Control (LoC) on February 14

Pakistan on Saturday summoned a senior diplomat from the High Commission of India and lodged a strong protest over the alleged ceasefire violations along the LoC.

The Foreign Office said that the Indian security forces fired in Nezapir and Rakhchikri sectors of the Line of Control (LoC) on February 14.

The “indiscriminate and unprovoked firing” caused serious injuries to a 13-year-old girl in Fatehpur village, it said.

The FO alleged that the Indian forces along the LoC and Working Boundary have continuously been targeting civilian populated areas with artillery fire, heavy-caliber mortars and automatic weapons which still continues.

“The unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1970 ceasefire violations. This year India has committed 287 ceasefire violations to date,” it alleged, adding that they are a threat to the regional peace and security, and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.

Pakistan urged the Indian side to instruct the Indian forces to respect the ceasefire, in letter and spirit; and maintain peace on the LoC and the Working Boundary.

The FO said India should permit the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to play its mandated role as per the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions.

73,2020/02/15,India urged to extend renewal date of OCI card till Dec. 31,"The Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card, among other benefits, allows multiple entry, multi-purpose life long visa to an Indian-origin foreign national to visit India.

In view of the inconvenience faced by the diaspora having OCI card in the U.S., an eminent Indian-American social activist has urged the Government of India to extend the date of its renewal till December 31.

The Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card, among other benefits, allows multiple entry, multi-purpose life long visa to an Indian-origin foreign national to visit India.

In December, the Ministry of Home Affairs’ Foreigners Division issued an office memorandum directing the relevant government agencies and airlines that Overseas Citizen Of India (OCI) card holders not between 20 and 50 years of age and who have renewed their passport can travel to India as long as they also have in their possession their old cancelled passport.

They were given time till June 30 to renew their OCI card.

But now, based on the feedback that he has been receiving from Indian-Americans and the diaspora community, Indian-American Prem Bhandari said that June 30 is not enough as it needs a massive awareness campaign on part of the Indian government.

“My humble request to you is to extend the date of renewal of OCI cards till December 31, 2020 such that the Non-Resident Indian/Person of Indian Origin community had enough time to understand the new requirement and renew their OCI cards,” New York-based Mr. Bhandari, who last year took up the matter, said in a latest communique to the Indian government this week.

Mr. Bhandari, who heads Jaipur Foot USA, has sent his communique to the External Affairs Ministry and other relevant ministries including the civil aviation and home affairs.

“This will give ample time to the Indian diaspora to renew their OCI cards and facilitate a pleasurable visit to India,” he told PTI.

This week, the Indian Consulate in New York and other Indian diplomatic missions issued a clarification on the OCI renewal.

“As you are aware with the advisory issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Civil Aviation to airlines, overseas Indians and PIOs have been facing great difficulties in travelling to India during the busy holiday season in December 2019 and January 2020,” the letter said.

“As many did not have updated OCI cards or were not carrying their old passports, they were stopped by airlines from boarding. We are grateful to the Ministry of External Affairs and the Ministry of Home Affairs for granting assistance and for helping people to travel to India without their old passports and extending the date of renewal of OCI to June 30, 2020. This has considerably ameliorated the situation,” Mr. Bhandari said in the letter.

However, many Indian-origin travellers faced difficulties at airports in boarding as airlines frequently misinterpret the rules or are inflexible although Indian Immigration has been allowing people to enter the country without new OCI cards or even without old Passports, he said.

“You are aware that a large number of OCI cards have been issued and it is not possible for everyone to be aware of the rules. Many a times I have intervened to get people to board aircraft by using personal influence. Several times, I have sought the help of Consulate in New York to help the people to board,” Mr. Bhandari continued.

Although the Government of India and Consulates are trying the best to diffuse and disseminate this information regarding renewal of OCI, many people still remain unaware and “we are hearing daily horror stories,” he said.

Indian-Americans have complained that they were not aware that every time an OCI card holder below the age of 20 and above the age of 50 years renew their passport they have to apply for the renewable of OCI card too.

“For all practical purposes, OCI card is not a multipurpose life-long visa, as it has been billed by the government. To clear the confusion, it is important that the government, immediately, say that it is not a multipurpose life-long visa and then take steps to fix the loopholes in this regard,” Mr. Bhandari had said last year.

He had raised the issue last year also with then India’s ambassador to the U.S. Harsh Vardhan Shringla and secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation Pradeep Singh Kharola. Both of them, Mr. Bhandari said, were instrumental in coming to the rescue of the Indian diaspora.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ueeurk/article30084011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OCIJK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-urged-to-extend-renewal-date-of-oci-card-till-dec-31/article30828274.ece

IAS topper and J&K People’s Movement chief Shah Faesal was booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) on Saturday, becoming the eighth prominent mainstream politician to face the stringent law.

Mr. Faesal was detained at the Delhi international airport in August second week last year following his interviews to several media channels, expressing strong views against the Centre’s move to revoke J&K’s special status.

“Kashmir will need a long, sustained, non-violent political mass movement for restoration of the political rights. Abolition of Article 370 has finished the mainstream. Constitutionalists are gone. So you can either be a stooge or a separatist now. No shades of grey”, was the last tweet he made on August 13.

Mr. Faesal was shifted to a detention centre in Srinagar on August 14 last. Since then, he has been in preventive custody under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). At present, he is detained inside the MLA hostel in Srinagar.

Sources said Mr. Faesal’s wife withdrew a habeas corpus petition before the Supreme Court to avoid the administration’s step to book him under the PSA, which can detain a person without trial for up to three months and the detention can be extended up to two years.

His family was assured that he would not face the stringent law if he withdrew his petition, a close friend said.

Mr. Faesal topped the IAS examination in 2009 and emerged as a poster boy for locals to prepare for such competitive examinations. He launched his party last year after quitting the government job.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, were among the 3,711 people on board the quarantined ship that arrived at the Japanese coast earlier this month.

It was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship.

The Indian Embassy is in contact with Japanese authorities, the ship management company and Indian nationals on board the ship.

“We have continued our efforts with all of them for early disembarkation of our nationals after the end of the quarantine period and subject to favourable results of their tests for COVID - 19,” an embassy official told PTI on Saturday. A third Indian crew on board a cruise ship off the Japanese coast tested positive for the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of Indians infected with COVID-19 to three.

The embassy has contacted all three Indian nationals who have tested positive for COVID-19 and are currently receiving treatment at medical facilities.

“Their health conditions have been confirmed to be stable and improving. Embassy is also in constant contact with the relevant Japanese authorities to ensure the well-being of all Indian nationals on-board the ship,” it said.

The embassy also sent an email to all Indian nationals on board the ship, assuring them of all help and assistance. They are also requested to follow the Japanese government’s health and quarantine protocols, the embassy said on its Facebook page.

The Japanese government on Thursday announced that passengers aged 80 or older will be given the option to disembark the ship if they test negative for COVID-19. Those who meet the age requirement and have pre-existing conditions or are staying in rooms without balcony will be prioritised for disembarkation.

India on Saturday urged Turkey to not interfere in its internal affairs and reminded Ankara of the threat of terrorism emanating from Pakistan.

The first Hindu temple in the UAE’s capital Abu Dhabi witnessed a major construction milestone as the first concrete pouring ceremony for its raft foundation took place here, officials said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for the Swaminarayan temple of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sansth (BAPS) temple in 2018 via video conferencing from the Dubai Opera House.

“This could not have been possible without the grace of god, the complete support of the community and the love of everyone present here today,” he said.

“All I can say is that I have to give credit to my predecessor who supported this initiative and most of all the UAE government to take this enormous and very generous decision not just to donate the land but to give the first license to the temple,” Ambassador Kapoor said.

Permanent Account Number (PAN) will become inoperative if it is not linked with Aadhaar by March 31, 2020, the Income Tax department has said.

The deadline for linking of PAN and Aadhar has been extended several times and the current deadline ends on March 31, 2020.

Till January 27, 2020, over 30.75 crore PANs have already been linked to Aadhaar. However, 17.58 crore PANs are yet to be linked with the 12-digit biometric ID.

“Where a person, who has been allotted the permanent account number as on July1, 2017 and is required to intimate his Aadhaar number under sub-section (2) of section 139AA, has failed to intimate the same on or before March 31, 2020, the permanent account number of such person shall become inoperative immediately after the said date for the purposes of furnishing, intimating or quoting under the Act,” the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said.

Through a notification, the CBDT amended Income Tax rules and inserted Rule 114AAA, stipulating the “manner of making permanent account number inoperative”. The notification further said that persons whose PANs become inoperative shall be liable for all the consequences under the I-T Act for not furnishing, intimating or quoting the permanent account number.

For those linking PAN with Aadhaar after March 31, 2020, the I-T department said it shall “become operative from the date of intimation of Aadhaar number”. Section 139 AA (2) of the Income Tax Act says that every person having PAN as on July 1, 2017, and eligible to obtain Aadhaar, must intimate his Aadhaar number to the tax authorities.

The Supreme Court had in September 2018 declared Aadhaar as constitutionally valid and held that the biometric ID would remain mandatory for the filing of income tax returns and allotment of PAN cards.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bkr8dd/article26621660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24AADHAAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pan-to-become-inoperative-after-march-31-if-not-linked-with-aadhaar-i-t-dept/article30827358.ece

Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, in the State budget presented on February 6, proposed a hike in the excise tax on liquor and a tax on the MRP of feni.

Goa Forward Party chief and Fatorda MLA Vijai Sardesai questioned the decision to impose such a tax.

“Whose idea was it to tax the heritage drink, which has GI? Did it come as a suggestion from the pre budget online suggestions that the Govt sought? Or was it an original idea by the head of the Govt? #Goa needs to know!” he tweeted.

State Ports Minister Michael Lobo said he would request the Chief Minister to consider reducing tax on wine and feni.

84,2020/02/15,"In Nagaland, protests defer training of 1,200 police ‘recruits’ for 206 posts","The police recruitment process, started in November 2019, has allegedly been shrouded in mystery

The Nagaland government has deferred the training of 1,200 police recruits – almost six times more than the 206 posts advertised for – following protests by a tribal organisation although the stated reason was inadequate infrastructure at the training centre.

The training for 10 months was to have begun on Friday at the Nagaland Armed Police Training Centre (NAPTC) at Chumukedima in Dimapur district.

The recruitment process, started in November 2019, has allegedly been shrouded in mystery. But it wasn’t until a week ago that local organisations learned about the Neiphiu Rio government having recruited 1,200 people against the vacancy of 206 posts.

The Naga Tribal Union Chumukedima Town has threatened to prevent all the recruits from taking part in the training unless the government came clean on the recruitment process.

“We demand from the authorities concerned a clarification with facts and figures, including official references of posts advertised for public consumption,” theunion said in a statement. It criticised Chief Minister Rio for his silence on the issue and asked the government to keep the training on hold until the confusion was cleared.

The government did not issue any clarification, but the State police, via a wireless text message accessed by The Hindu on Thursday night, indicated that the training has been postponed.

“Due to incomplete arrangement of barracks and other training infrastructure, all units are directed not to send their RCs (recruits) on 14/02/2020 for the basic training at NAPTC and PTS (Police Training School) till further orders. However, the RCs should be kept in readiness for reporting to the training centre at short notice,” read the message from the Deputy Inspector General (Headquarters) of Nagaland Police to all district police chiefs and battalion commandants.

At least two students’ unions reacted to the development on Friday. The Dimapur Naga Students’ Union asked the authorities to justify the selection of 994 candidates more than the requisite number of 206. The union also threatened to “go to any extent” for justice.

The Naga Students’ Federation, the apex body of students in Nagaland, has convened a meeting with all its district and tribe-based students’ units on February 22 to discuss the issue of back door appointment and future course of action.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-nagaland-protests-defer-training-of-1200-police-recruits-for-206-posts/article30825638.ece

The Railways plans to run a new train, Ramayana Express, with Ramayana-themed interiors and religious songs playing on board to give the passengers a feeling of ‘traveling in a temple.’

The train is likely to be launched after March 10, said Railway Board Chairman V.K. Yadav on Friday, adding that the train schedule will be released in the coming week.

“The train will originate from different locations, north, south, east and west, so that people from across the country can avail its services. The exterior and the interiors of the train will be Ramayana-themed. We can have bhajans playing on board .... IRCTC is planning the schedule and packages, and we are hoping to run the train after Holi,"" he said.

Mr. Yadav added that this will be different from ‘Shri Ramayana Express’ that was introduced in November 2018 to cover important destinations related to the epic.

Projects of national importance

Mr. Yadav said the Railways has charted out a plan to complete long-pending projects of national importance in Jammu and Kashmir and in the northeast by 2023. Additionally, the Ministry aims to commission 50 ‘super critical’ projects where capacity enhancement is needed, by the way of doubling or tripling the lines, by 2022. Eight such super critical projects have been commissioned, he added.

Mr. Yadav said that for the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL), which was declared a national project in 2002 by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government, 161km section has been commissioned at a cost of ₹6,000 crore, while the remaining 111km that is expected to cost over 21,000 crore will be commissioned by 2022.

By 2023, the Railways expects to complete the 51.38km Bhairabi-Sairang project in Mizoram that was sanctioned in 2008-2009 and is estimated to cost a cost of Rs 5,021 crore, besides BG line connectivity from Dimapur (Dhansiri)-Zubza (Kohima) in Nagaland sanctioned in 2006-07 and the Sivok-Rangpo new BG line (44.39km) in Sikkim which was sanctioned in 2008-2009.

88,2020/02/15,CPI questions govt. after reports of NRC data loss,"Party points to administration’s lack of efficiency

Reports of alleged loss of NRC data in Assam raised numerous questions on efficiency of BJP government's administration, CPI MP Binoy Viswam said in a letter to Home Minister Amit Shah.

After reports on the NRC data going missing, the Home Ministry in an official clarification last week, had said that the data is safe and there are certain technical issues which are being resolved.

Mr. Viswam, in his letter to Mr. Shah, said that despite the reassurances given by the Home Ministry, there is no credible way of knowing the fate of the data. “Given the sensitive nature of the data and your government’s lack of transparency, these events are deeply worrying,” he said.

Non-payment of funds

Wipro Private Limited,the back-end technical vendor for the project, in a statement had complained about non-payment to the company for their services. The contract with Wipro ended in October, 2019, and their contract was not renewed since.

“It is astonishing that the Central Government has failed to pay the service provider for such an important exercise that directly affects the fundamental identity of millions of citizens. This indifferent attitude of the government towards the plight of the citizens of India is condemnable and cannot be accepted,” Mr. Viswam said.

Such a lackadaisical atitude of the government aggravates an already difficult situation. “Finally, the loss of this vital data raises numerous questions as to the efficiency of your administration and the politics being played with regard to the entire NRC exercise,” Mr. Viswam said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cpi-questions-govt-after-reports-of-nrc-data-loss/article30825631.ece

90,2020/02/15,CBI books former ED official on graft charge,"He has been accused of scuttling a probe in exchange

The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked a former Enforcement Directorate official for allegedly receiving bribe to scuttle a probe under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

The accused, Gurnam Singh, was earlier repatriated to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (Chandigarh) under the Ministry of Home Affairs, from where he retired as Section Officer. The CBI registered the case following the Ministry's clearance.

It is alleged that Mr. Singh, while working as a Deputy Director with the ED in Chandigarh, took a bribe of ₹2.5 lakh from the father of one Disha Gupta in January, 2017, to settle a FEMA probe related to an FIR lodged by the Chandigarh Police in February, 2015.

The police case alleged that Ms. Gupta had misappropriated ₹1.10 crore of Health Bio Tech Limited. In March 2015, the ED received a copy of the FIR and initiated investigations into suspected foreign exchange violation.

The agency summoned Ms. Gupta and her parents in November 2016. As alleged, when they appeared before Mr. Singh, he demanded ₹2.5 lakh from Ms. Singh's father to help him “settle” the matter.

In two installments, the bribe amount was transferred to the account of Mr. Singh's mother. It was then sent to his son's account, the FIR alleges.

The CBI had earlier registered an alleged disproportionate assets case against the official in November 2017.

In March 2018, the ED raided the premises of Mr. Singh and his two contacts, following charges of extortion in connection with the ₹600-crore Unipay2U scam. Properties worth ₹4.8 crore were also attached.

The agency then filed a charge sheet, accusing him of having received bribes from the promoters of Ponzi schemes and extorting money from the investors.

91,2020/02/15,Congress MP seeks domestic production of generic drugs to treat TB,"There is an urgent need to start domestic production of generic medicines required to treat drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), Congress MP T.N. Prathapan demanded in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday.

Mr Prathapan’s letter comes in the backdrop of ongoing negotiations to frame the India-U.S. trade agreement. The Patents Act that allows compulsory licensing of a specified drug is a major point of friction in the negotiations. This provision can also be used to override international patents.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who was expected to be in New Delhi on Thursday, put off his trip to India amid signs that trade talks have hit a rough patch, just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit.

The World Health Organisation in 2015 introduced bedaquiline and delamanid for the treatment of drug-resistant TB. These medicines are currently under patent monopoly. “Instead of taking steps to start the domestic generic production of these essential medicines, the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is depending on donation and charity pricing from the originator companies to treat patients,” Mr. Prathapan said.

According to WHO’s Global TB Report of 2018, India accounts for 24% of global “multi-drug resistant” TB cases. As per the World Trade Organization agreement, a compulsory license can be invoked by a national government to allow someone else to produce a patented product or process without the consent of the patent owner, when it is done for the cause of public health.

“The dependency on donation is one of the important barriers in the scaling up of treatment. If the status quo remains, India will not achieve the target of ending TB by 2025,” Mr. Prathapan stated. He made three demands: first, the two medicines be made available to all patients of drug-resistant TB; second, the medicines be a part of the national list of essential medicines, and third, to put an end to dependency on drug donation and initiate their domestic generic production.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-mp-seeks-domestic-production-of-generic-drugs-to-treat-tb/article30825623.ece

He urged farm scientists to work on enhancing productivity of small and marginal farmers and develop bio-fortified and nutrient-rich crop varieties.

“While the position on food front is comfortable with a total food grain production of 283.37 million tonnes, India, however, ranks 102nd in the Global Hunger Index,” said Mr. Naidu.

“The alarming prevalence of malnutrition and hidden hunger are matters of grave concern. I am told that more than 80% of adolescents in India suffer from hidden hunger. This problem has to be addressed on a war footing as youth are the backbone of the nation,” he said.

According to an analysis by the United Nations’ World Food Programme, food grain yields have risen 33% over the last two decades. However, there are stark inequalities in access to food, with the average per capita consumption of energy among the poorest.

At least 30% of the population recorded consumption of 1,811 kilo calories per day, which is much lower than the norm of 2155 kilo calories per day. At the current rate of progress, one in three Indian children under five years will still be stunted by 2022, a sign of chronic malnutrition, the WFP report said.

While the country has achieved self-sufficiency in food production, nutritional security requires measures to improve protein and vitamin deficiencies, Mr. Naidu said.

The Vice President also expressed concern over the “galloping population” of the country, an issue that does not get enough attention from policy makers. “Political parties are feeling shy, politicians are feeling shy, Parliament also do not adequately discuss about the issue,"" he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a6jfka/article30825611.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14NAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/venkaiah-naidu-calls-for-improved-nutritional-security/article30825612.ece
96,2020/02/15,"Facilitate HC shiftto Kurnool, Jaganurges Law Minister","He also makes strong pitch for Council dissolution

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday urged Union Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to take steps for shifting the principal seat of the High Court (HC) from Amaravati to Kurnool as resolved by the State government.

According to an official release, Mr. Jagan pointed out that the BJP had promised to set up the HC in Rayalaseema and had incorporated the same in its 2019 election manifesto.

At a meeting with the Union Minister in New Delhi, the Chief Minister said the Legislative Assembly recently passed the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020, to have the legislative capital at Amaravati, Executive capital in Visakhapatnam and the judicial capital in Kurnool in fulfilment of the sub-regional aspirations.

By doing so, the State government intended to ensure equal development of all the regions, Mr. Jagan told Mr. Prasad during their meeting that lasted about an hour.

Mr. Jagan told the Minister that the clearance of the Ministry of Law and Justice was needed to move the HC out of Amaravati.

Disha law

He also sought steps for Parliament’s nod to the A.P. Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2019 (to be known as the Disha Act), saying that it was aimed at ensuring women’s safety and gave the mandate to deliver the judgment within 21 days in rape cases. Besides, it contemplated death penalty to the convicts and provides for increased jail term for sexual offences against minors.

Mr. Jagan also took up the issue of the State government’s decision to abolish the Legislative Council and urged Mr. Prasad to get it approved in Parliament.

The CM alleged that the Council obstructed important government Bills thereby made a mockery of democracy. The State government had, therefore, considered it appropriate to disband the Council and passed a resolution for it in the Assembly.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1v0do4/article30831758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VJPAGE1JAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/facilitate-hc-shiftto-kurnool-jaganurges-law-minister/article30831759.ece
97,2020/02/15,"Dream big and achieve it, students told","Poverty is not a hindrance to success, says expert

R S Praveen Kumar, Secretary of Telangana Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society (TSWREIS), who has spotted talent in hundreds of students, exhorted the students to aim high and persevere to succeed.

He stressed the need for students dreaming big and succeed by overcoming distractions of different kinds. He inspired members of GenX to excel by sharing the success stories of a good number of students of the social welfare hostels in the twin Telugu-speaking states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, including Malavath Poorna and Anand Kumar who created history by scaling Mt.Everest.

Summiting of the highest peak by APSWREI students has been a turning point in the history of SWREIS, he explained, adding students with humble background started realising that they were inferior to none after the Everest mission in 2014 and that poverty was no hindrance to success. As many as 150 SC/ST students had cleared NEET to join medicine and another 530 students cleared JEE Main to join IITs and NITs last year. This was in contrast to a handful of SW students faring well in the past.

Students should not to tread on the beaten path but aspire for a career in new areas as well, said the founder of the SWAROES movement launched to ignite the young minds. Some of the students had become aviators and sea captains. They should make mark as entrepreneurs as well, he added.

SWROE girls had included to SWAROES Ten Commandments 11th one not to get married before they become economically independent making child marriages a thing of the past, he said during the interaction with the students here organised by Bahujan Rashtriya Samiti president Jai Bheem Nageswara Rao.

98,2020/02/15,Pawan strongly opposes change of capital,"Jana Sena chief vows to stand by farmers in Amaravati region

Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan has said that no one has the power to change the capital from Amaravati. Mr. Kalyan along with party leaders toured the Amaravati region, for the first time, after coming back from Delhi.

Addressing a series of meetings at Yerrebalem, Krishnayapalem, and Rayapudi where local land owners have been agitating for the last two months against the State government’s move to decentralise administration and have three capitals, Mr. Kalyan said that the decision to establish the capital at Amaravati was taken in 2014 and the then opposition, YSRCP, approved it.

‘Action plan soon’

“I reiterate that the crisis relating to Amaravati is not just limited to 29 villages, but it related to five crore people of the State. Every time, a government changes, they can not change the capital wasting crores of rupees. I vow to stand by the farmers here and soon, we will chalk out a joint action plan with the BJP. The central leaders of the BJP were busy with elections in Delhi and now they will join the agitation,” said Mr. Kalyan.

Speaking to farmers at Krishnayapalem, Mr. Kalyan said that land owners have given their lands with the hope that the capital would come up in the region. “The locals have given away their lands to the government which promised them a new capital would come up in their area and not for ‘Navaratnalu.’ If you have issues with the TDP, resolve with them, why are you directing your ire at innocent farmers in Amaravati? So far, 41 farmers have committed suicide in this region. Our state is a small State with just 13 districts and I urge Chief Minister not to take hasty decisions which affect the entire population,” said Mr. Kalyan.

99,2020/02/15,"BJP rules out any truck YSRCP, TDP","We and Jana Sena will fight local body elections together, says Deodhar

Bharatiya Janata Party State co-incharge and national secretary Sunil Deodhar has ruled out any alliance with TDP and YSRCP.

Addressing the media here on Saturday, Mr. Deodhar made it clear that BJP and Jana Sena Party would fight the coming local body elections together and a long battle was ahead with political rivals YSRCP and TDP.

When asked whether YSRCP would join NDA, he said: “It is the NDA chairman to take a call on admitting any party into NDA, but he will not welcome YSRCP since BJP and Jana Sena Party decided to fight jointly against it.”

His comments came in the wake of Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister Botcha Satyanarayana stating that YSRCP would not mind joining NDA in the interests of the State.

He said it was a routine for the Chief Minister of any State to meet the Prime Minister or the Home Minister and it did not mean that some alliance was in the works. If a Minister thought like that (about alliance) it was his problem, he said adding BJP was very clear that both TDP and YSRCP were very dangerous to Andhra Pradesh.

‘Rampant graft’

Both parties were indulging in rampant corruption. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was making mistakes whether it was sand policy or giving away freebies to the poor. While the poor must be supported, the revenues of the State should be increased to do it, but companies were leaving Andhra Pradesh, he said.

While the TDP government had borrowed ₹.2.5 crore, the YSRCP government had added another ₹.50,000 crore, he said.

Predicting that the State would fall in deep financial trouble, he said in future they would blame Mr. Modi for it but the Central government could only fulfil its legitimate responsibilities in financial matters.

Mr. Deodhar said the BJP as a party at both national and State level was committed to Amaravati as capital and it did not believe in capitals at various places.

Dig at Naidu

Mr. Chandrababu Naidu wasted an opportunity to develop capital in four years and backstabbed farmers. To solve the problem, YSRCP should expose corruption and instead it was politicising the issue. He wondered whether it was real love of the ruling party for Visakhapatnam, alleging both parties were indulging in corruption and using black money to win elections.

While Mr. Pawan Kalyan was an actor who turned into a politician, former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was a politician turning into an actor, Mr. Deodhar said adding he was acting as if he was receiving calls from Amit Shah and assuring cadres that everything would be right.

100,2020/02/15,Three more members added to SIT on ‘land scam’,"About 1,400 applications were received, says SIT chief

The Special Investigation Team (SIT), constituted by the State government in October last year to undertake fresh inquiry into the alleged land scam in Vizag, has strengthened its team by adding three more members.

Initially, the SIT was constituted with three members comprising former IAS officers Vijay Kumar and Y.V. Anuradha and retired district and sessions judge T. Bhaskara Rao. Now it has added another former bureaucrat K. Durganand Prasad Rao, an IAS officer from Chhattisgarh, Commissioner of Police Rajeev Kumar Meena and Chief Conservator of Forest Rahul Pandey.

This was disclosed here on Saturday by Mr. Vijay Kumar who heads the SIT as chairman.

It may be recollected that the SIT had submitted a 150-page interim report to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last week of January and had requested for extension of time to complete the investigation. Based on the request, the State government has extended the tenure by another three months.

Speaking to the media, Mr. Vijay Kumar said that about 1,400 applications were received and the SIT had already examined around 400 applications.

According to him, most of the applications scrutinised so far deal with irregularities in allotment of government lands to private individual or private organisations, NOC lands and change of classifications, which includes 22A lands.

“In our reports we have mentioned about the nature of irregularities, who is responsible for the irregularities and who has benefited from it. But the final report will be disclosed later,” he said.

SIT members Anuradha and T. Bhaskara Rao, District Collector V. Vinay Chand, GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana, VMRDA Commisioner Koteswara Rao, DCP Ranga Reddy, District Revenue Officer M.

The Begari community members, categorised as scheduled castes, primarily work as gravediggers and security guards at the cemeteries. The Begari association, under the aegis of Kula Vivaksha Vyatireka Porata Samithi (KVPS), protested outside the Collectorate on Saturday.

The protesters demanded that the government must give identity cards for everyone who engages in the occupation. They also asked for ₹5,000 as pension for everyone who has crossed the age of 45 years and accidental insurance.

Apart from that, as work has come down significantly, they asked that the government must provide two acres of land to cultivate. “The government must also give houses constructed on three cents of land,” demanded a protester.

Explaining their issues in the villages, a protester said that farmlands of Dalits are being occupied by powerful people. The protesters demanded that the government must take strict action against the occupiers.

They threatened to stop burying deceased persons across the district if the government failed to solve their concerns.

Assistant Superintendent of Police M. Sattibabu on Friday appealed to the Yanadi tribe members to encourage their children to get educated in government schools. He urged them to realise the importance of education to bring about a change in their lives.

Mr. Sattibabu has adopted the Yanadi tribal colony in the Narayanaraopeta colony near the railway station here after the lack of education among the tribal children and their living conditions were exposed during Operation Muskaan. The drop-out rate among the Yanadi tribal children is high and the parents encourage their children to accompany them to work.

107,2020/02/15,"‘A.P., Telangana still have common production costs for agri-produce’","Our farmers suffering losses as a result, says Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu

A separate system and machinery for calculating the cost of agricultural produce in Andhra Pradesh is yet to be created even six years after the bifurcation of A.P. and Telangana, Minister for Agriculture K. Kannababu said.

The Minister, addressing experts at a workshop organised by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) on the Price Policy of Kharif Crops 2020 of Southern States, said that the practice of calculating common production costs for both States even six years after bifurcation is forcing farmers in Andhra Pradesh, who work under different climatic conditions, to suffer losses.

Responding to Mr. Kannababu, CACP chairman Vijay Pal Sharma said that the matter would be looked into immediately.

Representatives from the southern States of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Telangana participated in the workshop.

Delegates unanimously called for the announcing of Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for pulses, oilseeds and millets. They also drew the CACP’s attention to the ‘huge disparity’ between the cost of production fixed by the commission and the actual cost of production.

Andhra Pradesh Agriculture Mission vice-chairman M.V.S. Nagi Reddy said that paddy, groundnut and cotton are the major crops in the State. “The MSP of these three major crops, when observed for the past three years, is not in tune with the increasing cost of cultivation,” he said in a presentation.

The MSP was much lower than the cost of production and it was not possible to sustain agriculture at these prices, Mr. Nagi Reddy said. In the past two years, the cost of farm machinery operations has increased by ₹900 per acre in the State, he explained.

TTD Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal and Joint Executive Officer P. Basanth Kumar took part in the festivities, while priests formally hoisted the flag amid chanting of Vedic hymns during the auspicious ‘Meena Lagnam’.

Mr. Singhal said that civil works worth ₹24 lakh and electrical decorations worth ₹6.75 lakh were taken up to spruce up the temple.

“Similarly, we have roped in 250 ‘Srivari Sevaks’ and 150 scouts and guides to take up voluntary activities during the festival,” he said.

The ‘Pushkarini’ was cleaned and filled with water ahead of the ‘Chakra Snanam’ ritual slated for February 22. Arrangements for Anna Prasadam (food) have been made for 500 devotees every day, which would go up on Garuda Seva day (February 18).

At the Sri Kapileswara temple in Tirupati, the Dhwajarohanam (flag hoisting ceremony) was performed as per Saiva Agama tradition at 8.04 a.m. in Kumbha Lagnam.

TTD has spent ₹20.5 lakh on civil works and ₹6 lakh on serial illumination, apart from procuring four tonnes of flowers for decoration of the temple.

109,2020/02/15,"Jagan discusses three capitals plan, Disha Bill with Shah","CM seeks Centre’s assistance for setting up forensic lab

Close on the heels of meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi a couple of days ago, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Friday met Union Home Minister Amit Shah in New Delhi and brought to his notice a host of issues, which included the plan to have three capitals, the Legislative Assembly resolution to abolish the Legislative Council, lapses in the bifurcation of the Police Department, the Disha Bill, and issues relating to the A.P. State Reorganisation Act.

“There are lapses in the division of the Police Department between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. All the technical logistics and premier institutions were left behind in Hyderabad,” Mr. Jagan told Mr. Shah.

The Centre had allotted State Forensic Lab in 2017 with a total budget of ₹253.4 crore. While the Central share was ₹152 crore, the State’s share was ₹101.4 crore. The project was put on the back burner during the previous government’s tenure, he told Mr. Shah, and urged him to reconsider the project and allocate funds for the same.

Explaining the government’s efforts to ensure safety of women, the Chief Minister urged Mr. Shah to direct the Central Home Ministry to approve the Disha Bill passed in the Assembly. He said that 18 Disha police stations were set up across the State with special teams. Fast-track courts to try cases under Disha Bill were being set up, he added.

Outlining the need for decentralisation of administration and development in the State, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy told Mr. Shah that a Bill was passed in the Assembly to set up three capitals – Visakhapatnam (Executive), Kurnool (Judicial) and Amaravati (Legislative).

The Centre had released ₹1,000 crore for construction of the capital as against the allocation of ₹2,500 crore, he pointed out.

Polavaram project

Asserting that the Legislative Council had outlived its utility and was going against the Bills passed by the Assembly, the Chief Minister urged him to direct the Law Ministry to take necessary action in this regard.

Referring to the Polavaram project, Mr. Jagan said that the total estimated cost of the project turned out to be ₹55,549 crore. The State required ₹33,010 crore for the R&R package, he said.

“The State government intends to complete the project by 2021.

Professor K.P.J. Reddy of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru, who has patented a shock tube technology called Reddy Tube, said that the innovation can help in declogging of drip pipes thus improving soil health.

Prof. Reddy was making a presentation on ‘Acid-free declogging of drip pipes using shockwaves’ at the Andhra Pradesh State Sericulture Research and Development Institute (APSSRDI) at Kirikera near Hindupur in Anantapur district.

The professor explained the novelty of the technology and its importance in the present-day scenario in declogging of drip pipes using the shock tube, which prevents the use of acid to clean clogged drip pipes. Anantapur district is among the top few districts in the country to adopt drip irrigation on a massive scale.

During his presentation, Prof. Reddy expressed concern at the prevailing practice of cleaning drip pipes with acid, as it spills on to soil. The adoption of shock wave technology will help save the soil from the toxic effects of acid and will help in preserving microbes.

The meeting was attended by scientists of APSSRDI, senior officials of the Department of Sericulture, progressive sericulture farmers and trainees of Agri Clinic and Agri Business Centre of the APSSRDI. Institute Director P. Jagannatha Raju said that the demonstration of the technology to farmers was essential to drive home the advantages of the technology to save soil health for future generations.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/shock-tube-technology-can-save-farmers-soil-health/article30825299.ece

The TDP has reacted vociferously to the YSRCP criticism that the Income Tax riads have exposed the corrupt deeds of former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.

Former Finance Minister and TDP Polit Bureau member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, in a statement on Friday, said it was clear that the YSRCP did not understand the contents of the statement issued by the I-T Department.

“The former personal secretary is not related to the TDP. It is not correct to attribute motives to the party. As many as 26 inquiries were ordered against the TDP chief in the past too. House Committees and judicial inquiries were also ordered. But nothing substantial had come out, nor were the allegations against him proved,” he said.

Kondepi MLA D. Bla Veeranjaneya Swamy said that corruption was the foundation of the YSRCP.

YSRCP leaders such as Amanchi Krishna Mohan were speaking as if they were holy cows. “They seem to have forgotten that their leader is involved in corrupt practices to the tune of ₹1 lakh crore,” he alleged.

“How can the I-T raids conducted elsewhere in the country be attributed to Mr. Naidu?” he asked.

TDP general secretary Varla Ramaiah pointed out that the CDBT press release was being misquoted by the State government. It merely said that ₹2,000 crore worth foreign transactions had been done by evading taxes.

112,2020/02/15,Expert panel to verify govt. report on sand mining in the Krishna,"NGT gives it two months time and posts the matter for hearing on May 13

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has constituted a team of experts to verify the report submitted by the Andhra Pradesh Government on the damage to the ecosystem of the Krishna due to free sand mining.

The report defended de-silting (dredging) from the river, and sought dismissal of the petition against it.

The NGT’s principal bench, led by its Chairman Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, however, constituted the committee, comprising representatives of the Expert Appraisal Committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Central Pollution Control Board, and IIT Dhanbad and Bangalore.

The NGT gave the committee two months time to verify the report validate the observations made, and posted the matter for hearing on May 13.

Study to assess damage

The applicant in the case and NGT advocate, Sravan Kumar, said the tribunal had asked the government to arrange for the conduct of a study to assess the damage done to the avifauna (birds), aquatic llora (water plants) and fauna (animals of water).

The NGT also sought a detailed land survey to estimate the volume of sand required to restore the flood plains, and the cost of restoration at Lingayapalem and Rayapudi, where extensive sand mining had been carried out.

A bathymetric survey of the reservoir (upstream Prakasam barrage) was sought to assess the depth of the mining and current situation in it.

Submitting that various agencies, government and non-government, had been entrusted with the job of conducting the survey, the government asked the NGT to dismiss the original application (OA), which the NGT disregarded.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/expert-panel-to-verify-govt-report-on-sand-mining-in-the-krishna/article30825191.ece
113,2020/02/15,Private school teacher building a temple for his village,"Culture and traditions can be preserved only if there are temples, he says

A private school teacher is building a temple for Lord Krishna using his own money in his village of Vedullavalasa, at Garividi mandal in Vizianagaram district.

Durgasi Suryanarayana said his decision to build the temple, at a cost of ₹35 lakh, was borne out of a need to ‘preserve local culture and traditions’.

“Temples used to play a key role in villages. They were not only places of worship, but also centres for cultural and educational activities. However, many temples in the villages are in a dilapidated condition, and some of them have collapsed entirely. A majority of the villages developed in the last few decades do not have temples due to various reasons,” Mr. Suryanarayana said.

Although he is facing troubles in making ends meet, he said that he is striving to complete the temple by March this year.

Long journey

Mr. Suryanarayana bought 40 cents of land in 2015 at a cost of ₹4 lakh to build the temple. While he was able to overcome the initial hurdle of finding a suitable plot of land, he struggled to secure funds for its construction. Several villagers initially were reluctant to support him in his endeavour, but were won over by his determination, Mr. Suryanarayana said.

The school teacher later engaged two sculptors B. Raju and B. Nagendra for speedy construction of the temple. Apart from a tall statue of Lord Krishna, idols of Sri Maha Vishnu, Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Siva, Goddess Parvati and others are being readied.

“In an era of rapid globalisation, we must ensure that our youngsters are rooted in our culture. It will be possible only when elders uphold the practice of visiting temples regularly. That is why I took the initiative of building a temple in our village,” Mr. Suryanarayana said.

His wife D. Bhavani said she was overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from the villagers in surrounding areas like Garividi, Cheepurupalli and Rajam. “Our aim is to impart training in music and dance to the children on the temple premises. Great epics such as Ramayana and Mahabharata will also be taught by trained teachers,” Ms. Bhavani said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/l3i6ek/article30825142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14-VJ-KRISHNAMANDIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/private-school-teacher-building-a-temple-for-his-village/article30825143.ece
114,2020/02/15,"TDP fountainhead of corruption, alleges YSRCP","‘I-T Department’s exposures point an accusing finger at Naidu’

Launching a broadside against the TDP, the YSRCP leaders have said that the raids by the Income Tax Department on the houses of the former personal secretary of TDP national president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu are just the tip of the iceberg.

“More skeletons will tumble out of the closet to prove that the TDP leadership is the fountainhead of corruption,” the leaders said in a press release issued by the party central office here on Friday.

“None can escape the long arm of the law,” said Minister for Housing and district in-charge Ch. Sriranganatha Raju.

ED probe sought

“The I-T raids have proved the corrupt practices of Mr. Naidu,” Agriculture Minister K. Kannababu alleged, and demanded an inquiry into Mr. Naidu’s assets by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

The role of Mr. Naidu in the multi-crore scam was evident, and a CBI inquiry should be ordered into it, said Energy Minister B. Srinivasa Reddy.

“Corruption had reached its zenith in the execution of the Polavaram and Pattiseema projects under Mr. Naidu’s term,” alleged Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao.

Deputy Chief Minister Amzath Basha said Mr. Naidu’s “corrupt past” would now be the talking point across the country. The Centre should initiate legal action against him, he demanded.

“This is just the beginning. More shady deals of Mr. Naidu, his son Lokesh, and their followers will come to light soon,” he said.

Endowments Minister V. Srinivas said the Central government should look into the “wrongdoings” by Mr. Naidu during his term.

Snipe at Pawan

“The former Chief Minister had barred the CBI from entering the State as he was afraid that his deeds would be exposed,” Mr. Srinivas alleged, and alleged that JSP president Pawan Kalyan was not reacting as he too was “involved in the scams.”

“Mr. Naidu proved to be the brand ambassador for corruption, which started with the note-for-vote scam,” alleged government chief whip G. Srikanth Reddy.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-fountainhead-of-corruption-alleges-ysrcp/article30825132.ece
115,2020/02/15,Cong. demands all-party meet on Centre’s assurances to A.P.,"Jagan conveniently forgot this demand after coming to power, says Sailajanath

Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee president S. Sailajanath on Friday asked Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to convene an all-party meeting to step up pressure on the Central government for the implementation of the assurances given to the State in the A.P. Reorganisation Act.

Addressing a media conference here, he said that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was unable to question the Central government over the denial of funds and the Special Category Status for A.P. “Opposition leaders Chandrababu Naidu and Pawan Kalyan too don’t have guts to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah as all of them had their political compulsions. Their inability had led to injustice to residual A.P.,” he said.

“When Mr. Jagan was in the Opposition, he used to talk about the importance of an all-party meeting and leading a delegation to New Delhi over the implementation of promises made during the division of the State. Now he has conveniently forgotten these two important aspects after assuming power. Instead of demanding them, he is pleading with Mr. Modi and Mr. Amit Shah for justice. He always highlights what he has asked from the Central government, but never reveals what has been assured to the State by the Prime Minister. Mr. Jagan should speak out clearly on this issue,” said Mr. Sailajanath.

Debt burden

Party senior leader N. Tulasi Reddy and Srikakulam DCC president Yedla Adiraju said that the real justice to Vizianagaram district and other parts of A.P. was done only during the Congress regime. “During the TDP regime and the governance of the YSRCP in the last few months, nothing has been done to A.P. Instead, the State has been pushed into a debt trap. Mr. Jagan, who used to criticise over the heavy debt burden of the State, has borrowed nearly ₹35,000 crore. It will lead to a financial crisis in the State,” Mr. Tulasi Reddy said.

PCC women’s wing chairperson Pedada Ramani Kumari and A.P. Youth Congress president P. Rakesh Reddy said that the frontal organisations were fully geared up to face the ensuing local body elections.

Earlier, addressing the party cadre, Mr. Sailajanath and other leaders said the party candidates who contested the recent Assembly polls should strive to strengthen the party from the grassroot level.

116,2020/02/15,Congress protests ‘misuse of police’ in State,"Siddaramaiah alleges double standards in police action

Just ahead of the State legislature session, scheduled to begin on Monday, the Opposition Congress on Saturday held a protest against the alleged misuse of the police force against those opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The protest comes in the wake of the recent sedition case against a woman and a teacher over a play at a Bidar school and such instances.

The protesters, led by Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah, tried to lay siege to the Chief Minister’s office. They were prevented by the police, who detained several senior party leaders and later released them.

“While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in the State is filing false cases, including sedition, even against those opposing the CAA peacefully, several BJP leaders who have made provocative speeches have gone scot-free,” he said.

Attacking the State police for the sedition case over the play at Shaheen School in Bidar, he said it was sad that a dialogue in a play by a child could bring the wrath of sedition. He said a speech by Congress leader U.T. Kahder was “deliberately misrepresented” and a case slapped against him, while Minister C.T. Ravi’s statement threatening “Godhra-like riots” invited no action, he said. He added that “outrageous statements” by Uttara Kannada MP Anant Kumar Hegde too attracted no action.

“The State police has become a political tool in the BJP’s hands,” said Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president Dinesh Gundu Rao.

Mr. Siddaramaiah also pointed out how the High Court of Karnataka had sought an explanation from the city police over their excesses. “The High Court has held the imposition of prohibitory orders during anti-CAA protests in December 2019 bad in law. The court has also come down on the police for illegally demolishing sheds at Kariyammana Agrahara under the garb of action against illegal Bangladeshis,” he said, and argued that these instances showed that the “State police had crossed a line and were now acting only to please the BJP government in the State”. He advised the police to “act as per law and in the spirit of democracy and not be reduced to acting on the whims and fancies of the BJP.”

Mr. Rao said the Congress would raise this issue in the Assembly session. Other senior Congress leaders Ramalinga Reddy, D.K. Suresh, B.K. Hariprasad, V.S. Ugrappa, and H. M. Revanna, among others, participated in the protest.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/eyue0g/article30831898.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGCONGPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-protests-misuse-of-police-in-state/article30831899.ece

Hundreds of activists and members of the Shaheen School management received and welcomed them as they came out of the jail.

The school management people whisked the two women away to avoid their interaction with media representatives and activists.

Ms. Nazbunnisa has been accused of sedition as her 11-year old daughter had, in a play staged during the annual day celebration on January 21, delivered a dialogue which allegedly insulted the Prime Minister. Ms. Fareeda Begum, headmistress of Shaheen School, was arrested for allowing the performance of the controversial play.

118,2020/02/15,"After Delhi defeat, Karnataka Congress leaders call for reinvention of party","After the Congress’ crushing defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections, several party leaders in Karnataka have called for a radical reinvention of the party.

Karnataka leaders, including Jairam Ramesh, M. Veerappa Moily, Dinesh Gundu Rao, and many MLAs, including N.A. Harris, have demanded a clear-cut strategy to overhaul the party at the top.

Mr. Ramesh, former Union Minister, termed it “unmitigated disaster like coronavirus” and said the party must “ruthlessly” reinvent itself or face the prospect of becoming irrelevant. Echoing the views of Mr. Ramesh, another former Union Minister Mr. Moily said, “This is the time to act for rejuvenation of the party. It has to be revamped.”

KPCC president Mr. Rao said it was time for a clear-cut strategy to revamp the party. “There is no time to lose,” he said.

Mr. Harris, MLA for Shantinagar, too questioned the contribution of the party’s office-bears to the Delhi election results and wondered whether “the office-bearers work for the party or for their self-interest”. The party has to learn from its defeat and take steps to re-energise the cadre. “The party’s failure to wake up to several defeats is very dangerous,” the MLA said.

The Congress failed to win even one seat for the second consecutive time in the Delhi Assembly elections. Its vote share halved to 4.26% this time. The party’s downfall started in 2013. The party lost in all the elections either to the Lok Sabha or to the Assembly since 2015.

119,2020/02/15,Independent retires from Council bypoll contest,"Victory of Laxman Savadi is now a foregone conclusion

With the Janata Dal (Secular)-backed Independent candidate Anil Kumar deciding to retire from the byelection to the Karnataka Legislative Council from the Legislative Assembly constituency, the victory of the BJP candidate and Deputy Chief Minister, Laxman Savadi, will be a foregone conclusion. As the Congress decided against the supporting him, Mr. Kumar on Saturday announced his retirement from the contest.

Since the candidate has retired from the contest after the last day for withdrawal of nomination papers (February 10), the polling, scheduled on Monday from 9 a.m., will be held and the result known by evening.

There were differences among State Congress legislators on supporting the JD(S)-backed Independent candidate.

Though JD(S) leader and former Minister H.D. Revanna had sought the Congress support to defeat the BJP candidate, senior Congress leaders had opposed the revival of the alliance with the regional party. The JD(S) had hoped for cross-voting by “disgruntled” BJP MLAs, sources said.

No numbers

While senior leader D.K. Shivakumar had reportedly agreed to support Mr. Kumar, the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who has allegedly been nursing a grouse against the JD(S) for his defeat in the 2018 Assembly elections in Chamundeshwari constituency and subsequent political developments in the State, had expressed his reservation in supporting the Independent. His argument had been that both the parties do not have numbers to ensure the victory of the candidate, and therefore, defeat would only dent the morale of the party cadre again, sources said.

KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao too toed the line of the former Chief Minister and both the leaders ruled out any alliance with the JD(S) for the byelection.

The seat fell vacant following the resignation of Rizwan Arshad, who was elected as an MLA. The term of the member who will be elected now will be till June 14, 2022. The governing BJP, with 116 MLAs (excluding the Speaker), has majority in the Assembly.

121,2020/02/15,Minister inspects land for Kannada centre,"It is owned by the University of Mysore, and leased to the government

In all probability, the Centre of Excellence for Studies in Classical Kannada will be housed on the land belonging to the University of Mysore which has come forward to give it for establishing the centre.

Minister for Kannada and Culture and Tourism C.T. Ravi, who was in Mysuru, accompanied by a team of officials from the University, Kannada and Culture Department and the Central Institute of Indian Languages visited the site where the centre had been proposed to be established, here on Saturday.

The site is located on Hunsur Road where the old Tahsildar office and Adult Education Office existed earlier.

University of Mysore Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar, Registrar Shivappa and CIIL Director D.G. Rao were present during the inspection.

The site houses a building where offices functioned earlier.

The 3.5-acre land is owned by the University, which had leased it to the government for housing the offices.

Prof. Kumar said the land had been given on lease to the offices and the same can be cancelled paving the way for setting up of the centre. The land would be transferred to the CIIL after completing the formalities, including the lease agreement.

“After making repairs to the building, the CIIL has been asked to locate the centre at this new site until further instructions from the Centre on building the new structures. As of now, the centre is functioning in one of the buildings given by the University to the CIIL near Fire Brigade at Saraswathipuram,” the VC said.

The Classical Kannada language promotion was in limbo with confusions over its location with constant moves to shift it to Bengaluru.

Later, Mr. Ravi told reporters that the confusions have ended and steps had been taken to establish the centre on the new campus in Mysuru.

Bahuroopi at Rangayana began from Friday.

The 100-plus photographs had been carefully selected from an archive of 10,000-plus photographs on the Mahatma to chronicle his life – from childhood till his last days – and the works. The photographic story of the most photographed man is incredible and visitors must not miss exploring his journey.

Thanks to the National Gandhi Museum, New Delhi, which had the rare collections of his black and white photographs and brought them before the public, the expo commemorates the 150th birth anniversary of the Mahatma and aims to take his message to the masses.

One could see the young Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his ancestral house at Porbander in Gujarat in the expo. Every photo displayed is captioned in detail.

One of the photographs is of the epic march Gandhi led in 1913. The photograph of Salt Satyagraha is another prized exhibit. Gandhiji led a march to Dandi on the coast on March 12, 1930 to disobey the Salt Law that imposed tax on salt making.

The sole representative from Karnataka in the march was Mailar Mahadev from Motebennur, says the description.

Gandhiji had believed that no job was mean and there is a photograph in the expo which shows him attending to the sanitary work when he was in Wardha and Sevagram.

Another picture shows Gandhiji travelling by third-class in a train. The caption says he had chosen to travel by third-class in trains so that he could meet the poor people who normally travel in that section.

Spinning the Charka was the way and wheel of life for the Mahatma. He used to spin during his spare time to set an example for millions of people.

The expo chronicles Mahatma’s love for animals too. He had a special compassion for cows and he used to be around them when he was staying in Sevagram.

There is one photo that features the Quit India resolution which was adopted in 1942 and the leadership was entrusted to Gandhiji. When he issued the do or die call, he and other leaders were arrested the next morning.

There are many other interesting and rare photographs with interesting history on the Mahatma. The expo concludes on February 19.

123,2020/02/15,Comply with safari norms in tiger reserves: NTCA,"It calls for maintaining 500-m distance between vehicles

The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has taken umbrage at the violation of maintaining a minimum distance of 500 metres between two safari vehicles that has to be followed in national parks and tiger reserves.

Though this is an old and standing instruction, it is often violated in pursuit of the big games – mainly tigers – that results in crowding around the animal and causing disturbance.

Hence, the NTCA has written to all the Chief Wildlife Wardens of national parks and tiger reserves reiterating the directives complying with the 500-metre norms between safari vehicles operating in the tourism zone.

In a circular dated February 12, 2020, the NTCA has stated that the tourism carrying capacity in respect of a tiger reserve is calculated as maximum number of vehicles permitted per day as per the guidelines. The carrying capacity is determined with the presumption that the gap between the two consecutive vehicles is maintained at a minimum distance of 500 metres, said the circular.

“But it is often observed that safari vehicles inside the tiger reserve do not maintain the minimum distance with other vehicles and often results in crowding around animals sighted during the trip to the detriment of wildlife. This defeats the very purpose for which the carrying capacity was fixed,” said the NTCA circular.

Officials respond

However, officials in the Forest Department told The Hindu that this was a problem mainly with some of the tiger reserves in north and central India and was not a serious issue as far as Karnataka was concerned.

Jim Corbett National Park allows nearly 180 safari vehicles per day in different zones, while about 140 safari vehicles enter the Kanha National Park daily. But none of the tiger reserves in Karnataka come anywhere close to this figure, according to the officials.

It was pointed out that some of the best national parks to sight tiger and elephants in Karnataka are Bandipur and Nagarahole and the number of safari vehicles that are in service is not more than 10 or 15, said an official.

Though the guideline is fine on paper, it is difficult for drivers to ensure half a km gap between the two vehicles in practice especially when there is a sighting. But efforts are made to ply the vehicles to different zones to ensure that the 500-metre norm is adhered to the extent possible, the official added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1ae8uv/article30831419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGNTCA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/comply-with-safari-norms-in-tiger-reserves-ntca/article30831420.ece
124,2020/02/15,Yaduveer recommends naming Mysuru airport after Jayachamaraja Wadiyar,"Contribution of the Wadiyars to various fields hailed

The Mysuru airport at Mandakalli is likely to be named after the last maharaja of the erstwhile princely State of Mysore Jayachamaraja Wadiyar whose birth centenary is being celebrated this year.

A suggestion in this regard was made by the scion of the erstwhile Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar at the centenary celebrations of the last maharaja organised by the Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage and the JSS Women’s College here on Saturday.

This was in response to Mysuru MP Pratap Simha’s request to Mr. Yaduveer to suggest a name from the family in view of their contribution to various spheres in the socio-economic, cultural and industrial development of the State.

Mr. Yaduveer responded stating that Jayachamarja Wadiyar’s name would be apt in recognition of his contribution to the development of aviation in India.

Delving into history, Mr. Yaduveer said the last maharaja backed the idea of manufacture of planes in India. Though the promoters Walchand Hirachand approached many rulers across India, most backed out but Jayachamaraja Wadiyar not only invested in the project but allotted nearly 700 acres for the establishment of the factory, he added.

Mr. Yaduveer pointed out that the airstrip at Mandakalli was completed sometime around 1940-41 where many of the aeroplanes would land during World War II. In addition, his grandfather (J.C. Wadiyar) had procured one of the planes for personal transportation but it was mostly used by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for his travels, said Mr. Yaduveer.

Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi said the contribution of the Wadiyars whose history spans more than 600 years, has not been nationally acknowledged. Historians tend to be biased and write hagiography and reduce everything to caste, he added.

Though the Wadiyars were monarchs, they were democratic in spirit and it was evident in their social welfare programmes all of which helped provide a cushioning effect to the people of the region against the repressive British rule. But in the present times, there is dynastic worship and succession despite the country being democratic, he added.

Mr. Simha said there was no field to which the Wadiyars had not made their contribution and recalled the establishment of the State Bank of Mysore, HAL, Indian Institute of Science, introducing reservation in jobs, Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS), providing power to the cities of Mysuru and Bengaluru among others.

“We talk of the golden age with reference to the Gupta and the Vijayanagar empire but if at all people continue to benefit from the initiatives of the maharajas even to this day, it is the contribution of the Wadiyars in various fields,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5uewp0/article30831374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGYADUVEER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yaduveer-recommends-naming-mysuru-airport-after-jayachamaraja-wadiyar/article30831375.ece
125,2020/02/15,Robbery case probe helps police avert honour killing,"Seven persons, including a couple, were arrested by the Malavalli police on Saturday on the charge of plotting to kill a man, who married the couple’s daughter against their wishes.

Surprisingly, the couple was robbed by five other accused on Friday for not paying the agreed amount to execute the murder plan.

“With the arrests, we have averted an honour killing in the district,” K. Parashuram, Superintendent of Police, told The Hindu.

The arrested were identified as Venkatesh and his wife Puttathayamma of Vaddara Colony in Malavalli; Mahadeva (45) of Malavalli, Lokesh (35) and P. Lokesh (38) of Udayanagar, Kumar (36) and Mohan (38) of Srinivasapura near Kengeri in Bengaluru.

The couple’s daughter recently married a person belonging to another caste, following which they plotted the murder of their son-in-law.

127,2020/02/15,Missing woman from T.N. reunited with family after 14 years,"Lurdhumary was being taken care of by White Doves, an NGO in Mangaluru, since 10 years

Forty-six-year-old Lurdhumary from Kortampet near Vellore in Tamil Nadu, who had gone missing 14 years ago, was reunited with her family on Saturday thanks to the efforts of White Doves, an NGO in Mangaluru.

She was brought to White Doves by the Mangaluru City Police about 10 years ago, which took care of her all these days by offering psychiatric treatment, food and shelter.

She could speak only a few words in Tamil and had told us that her name was Mary. She remained in White Doves since then and was under treatment, said Corrine Rasquinha from the NGO.

Things changed when Fr. John Lewis from Tamil Nadu came to the NGO on a courtesy visit. White Doves’ manager Jerald Fernandes urged the priest to speak to the ones speaking Tamil so that they could get some leads to find out the families.

When the priest spoke to Mary in Tamil, she surprisingly remembered her home town as Kortampet. Fr. Fernandes then spoke to the priest from Kortampet, who announced in the local church about Mary staying in Mangaluru. As the word spread, someone contacted Mary’s daughter who was doing her paramedical course in Coimbatore, who in turn informed her elder brother who works as a driver that their mother was alive.

Later, it transpired that Mary had three children, eldest being a boy, Kulandaiyesu, who was nine when she disappeared. Second daughter was Gnana Anthony, who is doing her paramedical course and the third daughter Rackeal Lisiya who is in class 12 at a boarding school in Tirupathur. The youngest was just a few months old when Mary went missing. In the meanwhile, Mary’s husband Johnson too passed away while her name was deleted from the ration card presuming she was dead.

It was a happy ending on Saturday when Kulandaiyesu and Gnana came to receive Lurdhumary.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/missing-woman-from-tn-reunited-with-family-after-14-years/article30831360.ece
128,2020/02/15,Fundamentalists destroying history and freedom: Baragur,"Expressing concerns over the projection of fundamentalism as nationalism, writer Baragur Ramachandrappa held that those who were quiet, even though they knew that fundamentalism and nationalism were two different concepts, were committing a self-deception.

“Fundamentalists are destroying history and freedom. They don’t know history and yet speak on it. Those who know history, particularly the historians, need to respond to them. Failing to do so would force the innocent people to mistake falsehoods for the truth,” he said.

He was delivering the inaugural address at 29th History Congress held at Kannada University at Hampi in Ballari district on Friday.

Pointing to the controversies surrounding Tipu Sultan, the writer held that discourse on whether the 18th century ruler was a nationalist or an anti-national is meaningless as the concept of nation was not in existence in those days.

“Nothing is misinterpreted as much as religion and culture in India. Real historians are asked to go on compulsory leave. No ideology should be stagnant. It should move beyond a party and a religion. Then only the construction of real history is possible,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/u54xny/article30831346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGBARAGUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fundamentalists-destroying-history-and-freedom-baragur/article30831347.ece
129,2020/02/15,Hebbalkar takes out rally against delay in flood relief,"MLA and Congress leader Laxmi Hebbalkar took out a rally in Belagavi on Saturday, to protest against the delay by the State government in distributing relief to flood-affected families.

She walked to the Deputy Commissioner’s office along with members of several flood-affected families of her constituency of Belagavi Rural.

The protesters raised slogans against the delay in release of compensation. Ms. Hebbalkar said the State government had remained oblivious to the problems of the poor families who had suffered owing to the floods.

“Their houses have collapsed, their crops damaged, and they have lost their sheep and cattle. Bu the government that had to compensate the losses, has failed to carry out its duty,” she said.

“Every morning, several people come to me saying their property has been damaged in the floods. Officials tell me that they have conducted a flood loss survey four times till now. But the State government is yet to release money for the repair or reconstruction of houses . Officials have estimated that 1,500 families have lost houses in my constituency alone. But officials have not released the promised compensation of ₹5 lakh to any one of them. Officials are creating confusion by saying that the houses are being categorised into A, B, C, and D groups. This should stop and the poor should be compensated immediately,” she said.

“Public infrastructure like schools, anganwadis, roads, and electricity facilities has been damaged. But the government is yet to start their repair. The government is blind to the suffering of the poor. We have to wake up the people who are ruling us. We have to carry on protesting. Our voices should be so loud that the Chief Minister hears us,” she said.

She vowed to raise the issue in the State Assembly and attract the attention of the government. “I will make sure that the problems of my people are heard by those in power. No one needs to worry about it,” she said. She said that if the state government did not listen to the pleas of the flood-affected families, she would lead a rally in Bengaluru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hebbalkar-takes-out-rally-against-delay-in-flood-relief/article30830596.ece
130,2020/02/15,Yaduveer for Devaraja Market conservation,"The scion of the erstwhile royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar has opposed the proposed demolition of Devaraja Market.

Interacting with mediapersons in the city on Saturday, Mr.Yaduveer drew attention to the recent statements of the Mayor and other MCC council members that the expert and heritage committee members have given their consent for demolition of the 135 year-old heritage building on the grounds that it was structurally weak.

Mr. Yaduveer said the expert committee did not have professional conservation architects or archaeologists well-versed with the conservation of buildings using lime and mortar. The expert committee was filled with civil engineers who know only of cement and modern construction materials but are unaware of conservation aspects using traditional materials. Hence the expert committee reports cannot be accepted and has to be rejected, he said.

Mr. Yaduveer said it was not correct to state that the High Court has ordered its demolition; it had only directed that a committee of heritage and conservation experts be formed and a decision taken based on its report.

Mayor Tasneem and other councillors had paid a visit to the Devaraja Market early this month and had announced that the council would recommend its demolition as it entailed the safety of the public. The final decision has to be taken by the government but other sources in the MCC said in the absence of funds for construction of a new market, and a DPR which is approved by the MCC council and other authorities, the demolition cannot be rushed through. Meanwhile, the issue is still pending before the Court as the Devaraja Market tenants had filed a case and the final order is still awaited.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yaduveer-for-devaraja-market-conservation/article30830577.ece
131,2020/02/15,GESCOM’s demand to hike power tariff comes under fire,"Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission holds public meeting

The demand of the Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (GESCOM) to hike the power tariff, by 74 paise per unit, faced criticism from residents and various associations during a public hearing held by the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) at the Deputy Commissioner’s office here on Saturday.

KERC Chairman Shambu Dayal Meena and members D.M. Ravi and H.M. Manjunath conducted the hearing.

GESCOM Managing Director Ragapriya detailed the factors that had forced the company to seek power tariff revision. Ms. Ragapriya proposed an increase 74 paise per unit for consumers, and monthly fixed charges of ₹20 per kV for irrigation pump-sets and ₹10 per kV for other category consumers.

Deepak Gala, president of the Hyderabad Karnataka Environment Awareness and Protection Organisation, said that GESCOM is yet to receive ₹2,524.06 crore (including interest of ₹1,458.43 crore) from the State government.

RTI activist Siddaramaiah Hiremath said that GESCOM had failed to conduct consumer interaction meetings regularly and also failed to mention the complaints and grievances in the proceeding.

Criticising GESCOM for allegedly spending ₹32 crore in a year to take up repair works of transformers. Mr. Hiremath sought details of the transformers purchased, installed and their validity, and the company entrusted with the task of maintenance.

Providing photos of linemen attending to complaints without taking any safety measures, Mr. Hiremath accused GESCOM of not taking serious action against such violations. He alleged that GESCOM failed to follow the regulations issued by KERC.

Channabasayya Nandikol said that the industry is facing severe hardships owing to unscheduled power cuts.

He said that power is a basic component of industry structure and requested GESCOM to provide uninterrupted power supply and also demanded that the tariff be relaxed during the day [9 a.m. to 7 p.m.] instead of the night for industries.

Mr. Meena directed GESCOM officials to visit workplaces to check the violation of regulations and to direct private contractors to provide safety equipment to the workers.

The officials should identify the hazardous locations and address them quickly.

The Commission will submit its report to the State government by the end of March.

The Commission members did not respond when asked about the ₹180-crore scam in which the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) had issued notices to 37 senior officials of GESCOM during 2016.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gescoms-demand-to-hike-power-tariff-comes-under-fire/article30830475.ece
132,2020/02/15,Suggestion to name Mysuru airport after Jayachamaraja Wadiyar,"Yaduveer floats idea at birth centenary celebration of last maharaja of Mysuru

The Mysuru airport at Mandakalli may be named after the last Maharaja, Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, whose birth centenary is being celebrated this year.

A suggestion in this regard was made by the titular king Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar at the centenary celebrations of the last maharaja organised by the Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage and the JSS Women’s College in the city on Saturday.

This was in response to Mysuru MP Pratap Simha’s request to Mr. Yaduveer to suggest a name from the family in view of their contribution in various spheres in the socio-economic, cultural and industrial development of the State.

Mr.Yaduveer responded stating that Jayachamarja Wadiyar’s name would be apt in recognition of his contribution to the development of aviation in India.

Delving into history, Mr.Yaduveer said the last maharaja backed the idea of manufacture of planes in India. Though the promoters Walchand Hirachand approached many rulers across India most backed out but Jayachamaraja Wadiyar not only invested in the project but allotted nearly 700 acres for the establishment of the factory.

Mr. Yaduveer pointed out that the airstrip at Mandakalli was completed sometime around 1940-41 where many of the aeroplanes would land during World War II. In addition, his grandfather (JC Wadiyar) had procured one of the planes for personal transportation but it was mostly used by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for his travels, said Mr. Yaduveer.

Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T.Ravi said the contribution of the Wadiyars, whose history spans more than 600 years, has not been nationally acknowledged. Historians tend to be biased and write hagiography and reduce everything to caste, he added.

Though the Wadiyars were monarchs they were democratic in spirit and it was evident in their social welfare programmes all of which helped provide a cushioning effect to the people of the region against the repressive British rule. But in the present times there is dynastic worship and succession despite the country being democratic, he added.

Mr. Simha, in his address, said there was no field to which the Wadiyars had not made their contribution and recalled the establishment of the State Bank of Mysore, HAL, Indian Institute of Science, introducing reservation in jobs, Kannada Sahitya Parishat, Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS), providing power to the cities of Mysuru and Bengaluru, among others.

“We talk of the golden age with reference to the Gupta and the Vijayanagar empire but if at all people continue to benefit from the initiatives of the maharajas even to this day, it is the contribution of the Wadiyars in various fields’’, he added.

In this context Mr. Simha added that there was no person greater than Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV given his contribution to the State and it is his jayanti that should be celebrated with great fanfare by the State. “Yet there are people promoting Tipu Jayanti celebrations’’, said Mr. Simha.

133,2020/02/15,Three Kashmiri students arrested for ‘pro-Pakistan’ slogans in video,"The students were booked for sedition over ‘pro-Pakistan’ slogan

Three Kashmiri students who were studying at an engineering college in Hubballi have been arrested on charges of sedition and attempt to disrupt communal harmony, after a video in which they allegedly raised “Pro-Pakistan” slogans went viral, leading to protests from Hindutva outfits.

Police Commissioner R. Dileep told press persons the three students are: Basit Ashiq Sofi and Talib Majeed, first year students of Civil Engineering, and Aamir Mohiuddin Wani, final year student of Civil Engineering.

“We have registered cases under Section 124 A and Section 153 A and B of IPC (Indian Penal Code) and further investigation is on,” he said.

The Police Commissioner said that as the investigation was underway he would not be able to give further details about the background of the students and he would not want to make “sweeping remarks” against Kashmiri students. “We have framed charges based on prima facie evidence and a complaint by the principal of the college. Further action would be taken after thorough investigation,” he said.

Principal of KLE Institute of Technology, Prof. Basavaraj Anami told press persons that after the video became public and it was brought to his notice, the police were alerted and subsequently the Police took the three students into custody for questioning.

Meanwhile different versions have emerged over how the video became viral. While one version said that the students themselves had set the video in which they raised allegedly Pro Pakistan slogan as WhatsApp status, another version said that one of their classmates uploaded the video on social media platforms.

After the video became viral few other students of the college reportedly questioned the Kashmiri students and were allegedly manhandled. But police intervention prevented any further commotion on the campus, sources said.

In the video, the three students are seen listening to a song and repeating a refrain that goes “Pakistan Zindabad.” The Police have seized the cell phones, laptops and other belongings of the students for investigation.

Meanwhile the college sources have revealed that the parents of the students have been informed about the development and they were likely to reach Hubballi by Monday. The students had got seats at the college under the All India Quota, under which they are not supposed to pay any fee for the course, hostel and food.

Meanwhile speaking to press persons district-in-charge minister Jagadish Shettar and Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs have said that the government would not tolerate any “anti-national activity.”

While Bhajrang Dal activists staged a protest at KLE Institute of Technology seeking action against the college and students in the afternoon, students took out a protest march from BVB College of Engineering and Technology in Hubballi seeking action against the Kashmiri students.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fedeh9/article30834827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200215-WA0028,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/three-kashmiri-students-arrested-in-karnataka-for-pro-pakistan-slogans-in-video/article30829614.ece
134,2020/02/15,Church receives threat calls,"Authorities at the Snanika Arulappanavara Virakta Mutt, a church that follows syncretic traditions in Deshanur village in Belagavi district, have been receiving threats from some right wing organisations, who allege they are indulging in conversions.

In a complaint filed with the Nesargi police station, Menino Gonsalves, popularly known as Menino Swami, the Jesuit priest who runs the church, has said that he got over 100 calls from members of Hindutva organisations who threatened him and his institution with dire consequences.

This followed a call on social media by Rishikumar ‘Kali’ Swami, self-anointed head of a mutt, to boycott the Deshanur mutt. He alleged that the priests at the Deshanur mutt wore saffron robes to attract gullible Hindu youth before converting them. “You cannot be a Christian and perform pooja,’’ he said in his post. Someone else shared the phone number and address of the priest. This led to a large number of activists calling the priest. Some of them abused him, police said. A team of local Bajrang Dal activists visited the church on Friday and spoke to the priests. Kali Swami has said he would visit the church to understand the problem and resolve issues if any. Police said they were monitoring the situation.

The mutt was established 75 years ago by saffron-wearing Jesuist priests. They installed a Shivalinga and idols of Jesus and Mary in the ‘sanctum sanctorum’ of the building. Rituals and ‘arati’ are performed while the faithful chant prayers and songs in the church daily. Hindus outnumber Christians in the rituals. There is not a single Christian family in Deshanur. The church has been running a Kannada medium school, hostels for girls and a free hospital for several decades.

The mutt, or Church of Saint John the Baptist is a stone building in the Banarasi Nagara style. Vachanas of Basavanna adorn the walls of the church, along with sayings from Purandara Dasa, some Hindu saints and lines from the Bible. The church and the school were established by Jesuist priest Armando Alvares or Sri Animananda Swamy in Deshanur in 1950. The priests say they are not involved in conversion.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/church-receives-threat-calls/article30828978.ece

Earlier, Anjali Gaikwad had only seen satellites and rockets either on television or in pictures, but on Friday she saw their models, which were brought by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) here.

As part of its outreach programme on account of the centenary birth anniversary of Vikram Sarabhi, the father of Indian space science, ISRO organised ‘Space of Wheel’ for students.

Nearly, 5,000 students of different schools took part in the programme at BLDE Engineering college.

Arvind Nimbal, a class 10 student, said that students living in metros normally get the chance to visit premier institutions such as ISRO. “But since we don’t get such opportunity, the ISRO has given us a great chance to watch the satellites and rockets models in our city itself,” he said.

Several scientists of ISRO also held an interactive session with the students.

The teachers too said that such events help in improving the knowledge of the students about space science and encourage the students to become scientists.

The scientists said that the event was held with an objective of creating awareness among the students about space sciences and educate them about the achievements of ISRO.

138,2020/02/15,"North Karnataka has immense potential, says Ashok Shettar","Advantages of making investments in the region showcased

Before investments poured in at Invest Karnataka-Hubballi Conference, professionals and successful entrepreneurs from North Karnataka made attempts to impress upon the participating investors to invest in the districts of North Karnataka by giving presentations about the advantages of investing in the districts of the region here on Friday.

In the open session of the event before the formal inauguration, Vice-Chancellor of KLE Technological University Ashok Shettar spoke on the investment potential of the region. “There is a misconception among industrialists that barring traditional industries, there is no scope for mega industries in North Karnataka districts, which is totally wrong. There are immense investment opportunities in the region,” he said.

Prof. Ashok Shettar said that technology firms Sankalp Semiconductors and Navya Biochemicals were already functioning in the region and had clearly highlighted the strength of North Karnataka. Moreover Hubballi-Dharwad and Belagavi had the potential to develop as future mega cities. The region, which had hundreds of educational institutions, produced thousands of engineering graduates every year, he said.

Chairman and CEO of Aequs India Pvt. Ltd. Arvind Melligeri said that there was no dearth of talent in North Karnataka. Establishment of mega industries with long-term investment would attract talented youths and help prevent brain drain.

Elaborating on his own experience while setting up an Aerospace SEZ in 250 acres of barren land in Belagavi, he said that now no aircraft in the world would be ready to fly without auto components from Belagavi. He also spoke on the proposed establishment of a toy cluster in Koppal and the scope for toy industry in the country.

On the advantages in investing in North Karnataka, P.B. Ananda Padmanabh of Shahi Exports said that his company would be setting up units in Gadag, Dharwad, Ballari and Belagavi districts of North Karnataka and planned to create 12,500 jobs in the coming years.

Managing Director of Tata Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd. Sandeep Singh spoke on how the plant of Tata Hitachi in Dharwad had developed and said that it was now contributing to 60 % of the revenue of the company.

CEO of Deshpande Foundation Vivek Pawar elaborated on how the foundation was training youths in different skills and also on the scope for investment in the region in various sectors, including farm products.

Welcoming the gathering, Principal Secretary of Commerce and Industry Gaurav Gupta said that the event had raised new hopes for industrial development among the people of the region.

139,2020/02/15,Mysuru airport living up to its potential,"Air passenger traffic to and from the city soars after UDAN launch

The air passenger traffic to and from Mysuru has registered a significant growth ever since the regional connectivity scheme UDAN was launched by the Centre almost three years ago.

As per the statistics pertaining to passenger traffic released by the authorities, there were 90,398 passenger arrivals and 94,856 departures from Mysuru from September 2017 till January 2020.

Stakeholders said this was only the tip of the iceberg and the potential of Mysuru airport, which was on the path to growth, was yet to be full tapped.

Mysuru Airport director R. Manjunath on Friday said that at present TruJet, Alliance Air, and Indigo offer services from Mysuru to Chennai, Hyderabad, Goa, Bengaluru, and Belagavi while the flight to Kochi had been suspended in view of the runway re-carpeting work at Kochi airport.

There is a growing demand from passengers for providing air connectivity to cities including Mangaluru and Coimbatore, given their commercial importance, and to pilgrimage centres such as Shirdi and Tirupati.

All the routes allocated to Mysuru under UDAN are now operational and the next round of bidding for routes will be floated in due course by the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

It is likely that Mysuru may get a few more flights depending on the interest of the flight operators most of whom are convinced of the passenger movement to and from the city. Apart from the tourist inflow, there is a steady increase in the business and regular passengers seeking to fly to Chennai, Hyderabad, or Belagavi for personal reasons and air travel is gaining popularity given the short duration of the flight. For instance, bus journey to Belagavi takes anywhere up to 10 hours while the flight journey takes 85 minutes.

Mr. Manjunath said the expansion of airport entailing increasing the runway length from the existing 1,740 m to 2,400 m would facilitate the operation of both Boeing and Airbus flights and could help provide direct connectivity from Mysuru to any point across India.

The first phase of the expansion, however, hinges on transfer of 115 acres of land from the State government to the Airports Authority of India. Construction of an underpass (below the runway) will be taken up once the land is handed over to the AAI as the Director–General of Civil Aviation has given the clearance for its construction.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/merrn7/article30824893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGMYSAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-airport-living-up-to-its-potential/article30824894.ece
140,2020/02/15,"Bidar sedition case: What the child said in the play does not amount to even defamation, says Siddaramaiah","Coming down heavily on the police and the State for framing sedition charges against two women and Shaheen School authorities for a student’s dialogues in a play that were allegedly “insulting” the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on Friday held that the words uttered by the child in the play cannot even be construed as defamation.

“It was a satiric drama and whatever was said by that girl in the drama, even if it targeted the Prime Minister or anybody else, cannot be construed as sedition. It does not attract even defamation charges. Pushing two innocent women behind bars is a deliberate and inhuman effort to create fear among people,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said. He met the arrested women — Nazbunnisa, mother of the 11-year-old girl, and Fareeda Begum, headmistress of the school — in Bidar jail on Friday.

Referring to the sedition charges “falsely” framed against innocent people elsewhere in the State, including one on a Mysuru student for displaying a ‘Free Kashmir’ poster, the former Chief Minister said sedition cases were being booked on flimsy grounds to suppress the freedom of expression.

Referring to a play staged by children in a school run by RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, hailing the demolition of Babri Masjid, Mr. Siddaramaiah questioned why sedition charges were not slapped against Mr. Bhat even though the drama in question justified the demolition of the masjid which was termed illegal by the Supreme Court.

Actor and theatre personality Anant Nag on Friday inaugurated the national theatre festival, Bahuroopi-2020, at Rangayana here. This edition’s theme is ‘Gandhi Path’, commemorating Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary celebrations.

Hailing Rangayana and director Addanda C. Cariappa for the theme, he recalled how the Mahatma had inspired him when he grew up in Ananda Ashram.

He also recalled the days when he used to spin the charkha daily for an hour at the ashram. A charkha was also displayed on the stage as a tribute to the Mahatma.

Mr. Nag used the platform to lay emphasis on safeguarding Kannada and saving Kannada schools from closure by reciting one of the dialogues from his film, Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shale Kasaragod.

Mr. Nag said: “We don’t shut down ICUs because there are no patients. Likewise, we shouldn’t close down Kannada schools because there are no children. Give education to the child that dreams in his or her mother tongue”.

Lauding the contributions of Rangayana as the State’s premier repertory, Mr. Nag said B.V Karanth founded the institiution during the tenure of Ramakrishna Hegde as Chief Minister.

“I think this is my third visit to Rangayana as I had come here earlier for opening the Chinnara Mela and another event.” Minister for Kannada and Culture and Tourism C.T. Ravi released a souvenir.

Pratap Simha, MP, described Mr. Nag, who served as Minister in the J.H. Patel Cabinet, as a well-mannered politician and said it was unusual to see such knowledgeable and well-behaved personalities in politics.

In his welcome address, Mr. Cariappa spoke on why the theme was chosen and key features of the festival. “We hope the festival succeeds in spreading Gandhi’s message.”

Rangayana Joint Director Mallikarjunaswamy, Bahuroopi convener Hulagappa Kattimani, Canara Bank’s Vijaykumar, Kannada and Culture Department Assistant Director Basavanna, and others were present.

143,2020/02/15,‘Kannada in crisis owing to State indifference’,"Actor and former chairman of Kannada Development Authority ‘Mukhyamantri’ Chandru on Friday said that Kannada was in a state of crisis because of the continued indifference of the successive governments. Liberalised education policies, resulting in commercialisation of education sector, are also to be blamed for the present state of Kannada and its development, he argued. The former MLC was speaking at a ‘meet-the-press’ here, a day after the State witnessed protests seeking priority for Kannadigas in jobs and the implementation of the Sarojini Mahishi Committee report.

Mr. Chandru said the governments must understand languages are the path to future. It’s better to make Kannada mandatory instead of calling for giving priority to the language. “But, the language is not getting its due and becoming mandatory because of the conspiracy of politicians and bureaucrats,” he alleged.

Recalling how legendary actor Rajkumar brought the entire State together for the sake of Kannada during the Gokak movement, he said the film stars and the film industry must come together for the cause of Kannada.

Mr. Chandru, well-known for his role as Chief Minister in the play Mukhyamantri, said he has been in theatre for the last 45 years and has been playing the CM in the play for the last 40 years.

Coordination between the Women and Child Development Department, the police, and the Child Welfare Committee will aid in preventing child marriages, Chief Executive Officer of the Kalaburagi Zilla Panchayat P. Raja has said.

Speaking at the inauguration of a workshop on ‘Prevention of child marriage and trafficking in Women and Children’, organised by the district administration, the zilla panchayat, and the Women and Child Development Department here on Friday, Dr. Raja said that despite taking all measures for strict implementation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006, the number of child marriages were increasing in Kalaburagi.

Under the Act, those responsible, including parents and guardians, are liable to be fined up to ₹1 lakh and /or imprisoned for up to two years.

According to the 2001 census, nearly 15 lakh girls under the age of 15 had already married.

In most of the cases, parents believe that marriage will protect her from physical or sexual assault. Child marriage leads to violence and puts women and girls at the risk of sexual, physical, and psychological violence throughout their lives, he said. Dr. Raja explained that the under-age marriages often lead to early motherhood and high-risk health problems.

Dr. Raja called upon officials of various government departments to join hands in preventing the practice. He also sought the cooperation of the non-government organizations and the public to stop the practice.

Prakash Rajput, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Yadgir district, said that 270 cases of child marriage were reported and the officials successfully prevented 130 cases.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/officials-coordination-must-to-prevent-child-marriage-raja/article30824710.ece

The State Election Commission (SEC) has decided to approach the Supreme Court against a High Court Division Bench order directing it to use the voters’ list for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections for conducting local body polls in the State.

The commission will file its appeal before the apex court next week, State Election Commissioner V. Bhaskaran said. On Thursday, the Division Bench had quashed an earlier Single Bench decision upholding the commission's plan to utilise the electoral rolls used for the local body elections in 2015 as the basis for updating the voters' list.

The Division Bench verdict came on appeals filed by Congress leader N. Venugopal and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader Soopy Narikkatteri. On its part, the commission had taken the stand that it would be impractical to use the voters’ list prepared by the Election Commission of India for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections for the local body elections. Meanwhile, Minister for Local Self-Government A.C. Moideen backed the State Election Commission’s decision to move the Supreme Court. On its part, the State government will provide all assistance to the commission to avoid delay in holding the local body elections, Mr. Moideen told reporters here.

“The commission has made it clear that the stand taken by it (to use the 2015 voters’ list) is the correct one for casting a flawless list for the elections. In such a context, the SEC has every right to appeal,” Mr. Moideen said.

UDF criticised

Mr. Moideen accused the UDF of attempting to delay the election process by filing appeals against the Single Bench decision. “It gives rise to a suspicion that the UDF is afraid that the elections will be held on time. Does it fear that the front will not win? The government is convinced that the elections can be conducted on time,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/voters-list-sec-to-approach-supreme-court/article30831671.ece
161,2020/02/15,Factionalism the main challenge,"BJP State president designate is leading a faction ridden organisation into two elections

Bharatiya Janata Party State president K.Surendran has a daunting task ahead in helming a faction ridden organisation and a defunct National Democratic Alliance for two elections in the immediate future.

Taking forward the party as a cohesive whole, reviving the NDA and strengthening the organisational apparatus at all levels well ahead of the local body and Assembly elections would be the first challenge Mr. Surendran would have to grapple with on assuming office.

Since incumbent P.S.Sreedharan Pillai demitted office, the organisation had slipped into a dormant state and except in the capital, the party had not responded to any issue of political import.

Mr.Surendran who had been in the forefront of a series of agitations, will have to strain his nerve to reinvigorate the party machinery and make it responsive. That would be a tough challenge.

Aspirants were too many for the president’s post and they are unlikely to bury the hatchet and meekly yield to the leadership of the new president. They may at least raise a banner of revolt as a mark of protest, but unlike his predecessors, Mr.Surendran enjoys the patronage of Union Minister V.Muralidharan and also the national leadership that had been biding their time to gain a foothold in the State. The active presence of Mr.Muralidharan in the State and the change of guard in all districts, mainly Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur and Palakkad, perceived to be BJP strongholds are expected to work to the advantage of the new president. The presidents of all the 11 other districts have different group affiliations .

Reactivating the NDA would not be so easy. For, the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena that had to bear a split of late, will have to firm up its stance in continuing in the alliance.

No significant clout

Except for the Kerala Congress (P.C.Thomas) faction, none of the other allies wield any significant clout in the State.

Mr.Surendran will have to strive hard to improve the BJP tally in the local body and other elections. Whether he would be able to attain such feats within the available time is what remains to be seen.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pk3o0z/article30831638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TVBJPSURENDRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/factionalism-the-main-challenge/article30831624.ece
162,2020/02/15,K.Surendran is State president of BJP,"He will be the youngest leader to head the party in the State

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national leadership has named K. Surendran as State president.

Mr. Surendran’s name was announced by national president J. P. Nadda in Delhi on Saturday. Mr.Surendran who was in the forefront of the Sabarimala agitation will be the youngest leader to head the party in the State.

Following the party decision to appoint P. S. Sreedharan Pillai as Mizoram Governor, the State unit witnessed intense faction feud, but Mr.Surendran’s prominent presence in the agitations, mainly the one against the Supreme Court granting permission for entry of women of child-bearing age to Sabarimala, helped him gain an edge over other contenders.

Mr.Surendran had been officiating as BJP State general secretary for the past 10 years.

Born on March 10, 1970 as the son of Kunhiraman and Kalyani into a family of farmers at Ulliyeri in Kozhikode in1970, he took to politics through the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. He turned a full-time worker of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha in due course and went on to become the Wayanad district president, State general secretary and State president of the youth wing. He gained popularity among the public as well as party workers by heading the Sabarimala agitation and was imprisoned for 22 days. He contested the Lok Sabha elections twice from Kasaragod and to the Assembly twice from Manjeswaram. He lost the last Assembly election by 89 votes.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ksurendran-is-state-president-of-bjp/article30831622.ece
163,2020/02/15,"UDF, LDF lock hornsover CAG report leak","Conspiracy hatched by some centres, says Tourism Minister

The ruling CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) have locked horns over Chief Secretary Tom Jose’s statement alleging leakage of contents of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report before it was tabled in the Assembly.

The Chief Secretary’s statement has created a storm with the two rival fronts sparring over the issue.

The CAG report had put the State Police Chief Loknath Behara in the dock over the alleged diversion of funds and violation of guidelines in implementing various projects in the police force.

The report, which was tabled in the House on February 12, had also found 25 INSAS rifles and over 12,000 cartridges missing from the Special Armed Police battalion .

“Even before it was tabled, there were doubts that some contents of the report had been leaked. In the name of the CAG report, indulging in character assassination was not a good precedent,” the Chief Secretary had said in a statement on Friday. His statement that it was the ‘violation of democratic propriety to put the officer under media trial’ has also invited flak.

Tourism and Cooperation Minister Kadakampally Surendran on Saturday said it was senior Congress legislator P. T. Thomas who raised the points in the House before the CAG report was tabled in the House.

“When the entire issue was analysed, it was suspected that there was a possibility of conspiracy. There is no doubt that a conspiracy was hatched by some centres,” he alleged.

The UDF stepped up its demand for a comprehensive probe into the findings of the CAG report with the Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala saying that Chief Minister, Pinarayi Vijayan was in the know of the corruption.

“The revelations are shocking and it appears that there is a mafia that controls the police and it is dangerous,” Mr. Chennithala told a press conference here.

“Mr. Vijayan is also responsible for the contents of the CAG report, as he is the Home Minister. The Chief Secretary’s statement is also baffling. There is a strong nexus and things have to be probed,” the Leader of the Opposition said. The political affairs committee of the Congress will meet on Tuesday to decide the nature of the protest to be initiated on this front, he said.

BJP view

The BJP also came out against the LDF government with the Union Minister of State for External Affairs, V. Muralidharan stating on Saturday that the Union Finance and Home Ministries had taken a serious view of the matters mentioned in the CAG report.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/udf-ldf-lock-hornsover-cag-report-leak/article30831620.ece
164,2020/02/15,Sriram destroyed evidence: CB,"Dodged blood test in drunk driving case that caused death of journalist

The Crime Branch (CB) told a court here last week that IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman had ""lied"" to evade criminal liability in the controversial drunk driving accident that caused the death of journalist K.M. Basheer last year.

In its charge sheet, which appeared in the public domain on Saturday, the agency said that Mr. Venkitaraman had also deliberately delayed the sampling of his blood to dodge the mandatory blood alcohol test. The CB said Mr. Venkitaraman had tried to mislead police investigation by stating that his co-passenger, Wafa Firoz, was at the wheel and not him.

At the General Hospital, where he was treated initially, Mr. Venkitaraman insisted that he be referred for specialist care. However, the doctors had marked his injuries as minimal and not life-threatening. Still, they agreed to the officer's request and referred him to the Government Medical College Hospital. The charge sheet said Mr. Venkitaraman chose to get himself admitted to a private hospital.

Investigators told the court that he gave various excuses to delay the collection of his blood for forensic testing till the alcohol content abated. The CB concluded that Mr. Venkitaraman was driving the car well above the legal speed limit of 50 km per hour.

Mr. Venkitaraman, as an IAS officer and trained doctor, was drunk at the time of the accident and speeding. He knew rash and negligent driving under the influence of alcohol could imperil the life of others and damage public property, the charge sheet said.

The CB has charged him with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, destruction of evidence, driving under the influence of alcohol and damage of public property. The CB had relied on expert opinion from various quarters to reconstruct the accident.

In the absence of a statutory medical certificate that Mr. Venkitaraman was intoxicated at the time of the crash, investigators said they were constrained to bank on the testimonies of doctors, first responders, police officers, and witnesses to prove their case of culpable homicide against the young bureaucrat.

The government doctor who attended to Mr. Venkitaraman's injuries at the General Hospital (GH) had attested that he had smell of alcohol on the breath of the patient and perceived him to be drunk. Ms. Wafa had stated the same under oath in front of a magistrate. The police officers who responded to the accident are also prime prosecution witnesses.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sriram-destroyed-evidence-cb/article30831152.ece
165,2020/02/15,VACB moves closer to indicting Kunju for graft,"Probe into Palarivattom flyover case

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) on Saturday appeared to have moved one more step closer to indicting former Public Works Minister and IUML legislator V.K. Ebrahim Kunju for graft.

The agency is investigating Mr. Kunju on the charge of using public funds to aid the private firm responsible for the shoddy construction of the now decommissioned flyover at Palarivattom in Kochi.

Mr. Kunju, mobbed by television camera persons, arrived at the VACB facility here at 11 a.m. He spent the next three hours attempting to answer questions posed by anti-corruption investigators. By some official accounts, Mr. Kunju’s answers revolved around the argument that as Minister it was not his responsibility to monitor the quality of the work at the field level.

Onus on officials

Moreover, Mr. Kunju reportedly said PWD officials were principally responsible for finalising the contract, setting the terms of the agreement, monitoring the execution of the work and sanctioning bills presented by the builder.

The VACB interviewed Mr. Kunju as per a rigid format finalised earlier by a panel of investigators.

The agency’s queries to Mr. Kunju reportedly centred around the finding that he had ordered the release of ₹9 crore in advance to the contractor as “mobilisation fund” at a nominal rate of interest much less than that charged by nationalised banks.

The VACB wanted to find out why Mr. Kunju had sanctioned the payment and whether he had acted outside the terms of the government’s agreement with the builder. The advance credit to the contractor on brazenly advantageous terms had cost the public exchequer an estimated loss of ₹60 lakh. Mr. Kunju reportedly sought to defend himself by stating that PWD officials were responsible for the decisions. An official said that Mr. Kunju appeared to be in some measure of legal peril for allowing the State to channel public funds to aid a private entity contracted to execute a civil work.

It is tantamount to according the builder an undue financial advantage. The questioning will continue.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/n2yk7y/article30831646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TVIBRAHIMKUNJU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-moves-closer-to-indicting-kunju-for-graft/article30830787.ece
166,2020/02/15,How Alappuzha bid goodbye to its only dump,"Residents resolve the garbage issue every day in their backyards

Did you know that Alappuzha or Alleppey, a coastal town in Kerala that is known for its backwaters and houseboats, has no landfills? There was just one landfill, and that has been closed.

And naturally, the astounding question to be asked is: “How do they manage their waste?”

“Segregation of waste at source” seems to be encoded in the Alappuzha’s DNA. Residents have bio-composters installed in their backywards, and that takes care of bio-degredable waste. Non-biodegredable is recycled by waste collectors.

The Alappuzha model, in practice for nearly six years now, has received accolades from many environmental groups, and these include heavyweights such as the United Nations Environment Programme.

This decentralised method of waste management seems to be just what cities where dumping grounds are running out of space should adopt without a moment’s hesitation.

This first sign of this unique way of waste management was noticed in 2012, when residents of a particular ward started resisting trucks coming to the dump site near Sarvodayapuram. The resistance was so stiff that the authorities had no choice other than to ask every household to manage their waste on their own.

“We started with one ward where residents were given the choice of using aerobic composting bins or biogas composting to process waste on their own. For those who had no space to compost, the municipality set up aerobic composting facilities at strategic points,” says M. Gopakumar, who co-authored a book with Kerala minister T.M. Thomas Isaac on Alappuzha’s solid waste management journey.

After six months, it was extended to another ward, slowly all the 52 wards with a total population of 1.7 lakh people were covered.

Experts who have been part of this movement say the approach faced many setbacks but it worked over a period of time as people were desperate to find a solution to the garbage problem.

“The push came from the people, they were fed up with the smell emanating from dumping grounds and the pollution it was causing. The biggest success is that the campaigns helped in bringing about a change in the mindset of the people on managing their waste,” says P.V. Joseph, an executive committee member of Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP), a group that campaigned and helped set up biogas plants.

The campaigns ran for nearly two years to bring about a change in people’s mindset. Clubs were set up in schools to ensure the message was taken home. Incentives were given to school students who collected dry waste from their localities.

From households, the programme was extended to commercial complexes and markets. They were penalised if they did not dispose of waste in a scientific manner.

Gopakumar says by being economical and efficient, the decentralised approach contrasted sharply with centralised approach.

“Community biogas plants were set up for five to 10 household to use, but it failed as nobody wanted to take the responsibility of managing it. People found it better to invest in a bio-composter in their backyard,” says Gopakumar. Initially, the government did not offer any subsidy. Later, subsidies were offered to encourage every household to have one.

Today, the municipality has set up 30 aerobic composting units (also known as composting sheds) in various parts of the city. These are used by families who do not have the space to compost bio-degradeable waste in their backyard. More than 1500 household use biogas plants and 10,000 use bio composters. A bio bin unit costs about ₹ 1,800 and after subsidy it comes at a price of ₹180, says a health inspector.

“There are 38 collection points in the municipality for dry waste collection,” says Joseph.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/v81739/article30828986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DCMYPRPIPECOMPOST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/how-alappuzha-bid-goodbye-to-its-only-dump/article30828993.ece

170,2020/02/15,Police launch hunt for gangs attacking air passengers,"Flyers robbed during transit from Karipur to Kozhikode

The police in Malappuram and Kozhikode districts have enhanced vigil and launched a hunt for the kingpins of gangs involved in robbing passengers reaching the Calicut International Airport from the Gulf.

Passengers who reached the airport at night were allegedly robbed of cash and gold in three incidents in recent weeks. The robbery took place during their transit from Karipur to Kozhikode by autorickshaw.

The latest incident was in the early hours of Friday when two passengers from Uduma, Kasaragod, were allegedly abducted and robbed of cash and gold near Ramanattukara. The passengers, Abdul Sattar and Santhosh, were waylaid and abducted in a car while they were travelling in an autorickshaw. A case was registered at the Feroke police station.

The police said a gang took them to an unknown destination and robbed them of cash and seven sovereigns of gold. District Police Chief U. Abdul Kareem said it must have been a case of mistaken identity. The robbers reportedly mistook the passengers for gold carriers. They were beaten up when the gang realised that they were not carriers.

“We have strengthened vigil and have plugged all routes out of Karipur. We have put up special night checks on roads leading out of Karipur,” said Mr. Kareem.

In the second incident on Sunday morning, a passenger from Dakshin Kannada, Abdul Nazar Shamshad, was allegedly abducted and robbed. He was taken to Tanur and was stripped and beaten up.

Mr. Kareem said one person was arrested in connection with the robbery. “We are gathering information about the gangs involved in robbing gold and hawala carriers. We are closing in on the kingpins,” he added.

Meanwhile, the Kottakkal police arrested two men who allegedly attempted to rob hawala cash worth ₹3.25 crore which was being transported in an autorickshaw. The two men chased the vehicle and pushed the driver out and tried to escape with the cash. The vehicle overturned at Valiyaparamba near Kottakkal, and local residents handed over the men to the police.

Black money worth around ₹50 lakh was seized at Vengara on Friday. The police said the smuggling of gold and black money had increased in recent times.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/police-launch-hunt-for-gangs-attacking-air-passengers/article30825538.ece

Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran also targeted the government over the handling of the protest. “Using force in peaceful protests amounts to stirring up a hornet’s nest,” the independent legislator said in a statement.

He wished such incidents did not repeat. The Vaiko-led MDMK adopted a resolution in its district secretaries meeting, slamming the police for allegedly using force against protestors.

BJP leader H. Raja, whose party is an ally of the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu, slammed the violence against police personnel in the protests.

175,2020/02/15,Special-purpose vehicle to raise funds for Amma Unavagams,"Scheme has been hit by a fund crunch over the years.

The Tamil Nadu government will form a ‘not-for-profit’ special-purpose vehicle (SPV) to finance and manage the Amma Unavagam scheme that was launched with much fanfare in 2013 by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.

The largely successful scheme has been hit by funding crunch over the years and the SPV will raise corporate social responsibility contributions from companies and other donations.

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam in his budget said the focus on construction workers, who comprise the largest clientèle at Amma Unavagams, will be enhanced by establishing mobile units to transport food to work sites.

The government will continue providing subsidised foodgrains and grants to the SPV to cover the shortfall between expenditure and revenue, contributions and donations received.

176,2020/02/15,Pledge to eliminate revenue deficit remains on paper,"Former CM Jayalalithaa’s promise to eliminate revenue deficit by 2019-20 remains on paper as the State continues to witness an opposite trend

Three years after then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa promised to eliminate the revenue deficit by 2019-20, the State continues to witness an opposite trend, as the government is poised to run a revenue deficit during 2020-21 — the eighth year in a row.

Revenue deficit denotes the excess of revenue expenditure over receipts. As per Budget estimates, the deficit will be ₹21,618 crore. For 2019-20, the figure has been revised to ₹25,072 crore.

Broadly, revenue expenditure refers to salaries, subsidies and interest payments, whereas revenue receipts pertain to the State’s own revenue and Central transfer.

The targets under the State Fiscal Responsibility Act were revised through an amendment to the law in September 2016. According to the amendment, the ratio of the revenue deficit to receipts should not exceed 5% by 2018-19. It also mandates the elimination of the deficit by 2019-20 and adherence to it thereafter. The government is expected to soon come up with a Bill to amend the law with modified targets. A reason for the prevailing trend was provided by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam during his Budget speech. “The burden imposed on the State’s finances by the takeover of debt and losses of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) under the UDAY (Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana, aimed at the financial and operational turnaround of power distribution companies), the lag effect of the implementation of the 7th Central Pay Commission’s recommendations, and the slower growth in tax revenue, both at the Centre and in the State, have all caused the increased revenue deficit,” he said.

In the last few years, the State government has consistently complained that the 14th Finance Commission had given T.N. a “raw deal”. A senior policy-makersaid the system of targets stipulated under the law had had a “deleterious impact”. State governments, in general, were compelled to “dress up the numbers”, the policy-maker said. K.R. Shanmugam, Director of the Madras School of Economics, said that so long as the revenue deficit remained less than 1% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), there was nothing much to worry about. However, he said the increase in the revenue deficit in the last two years was a “matter of concern”.

“You will have to look at the track record of the State government in meeting its commitments, like debt repayment. Ours is far better than many other States,” said former Additional Chief Secretary R. Kannan, adding that the culture of the State government in managing finances was such that fiscal prudence will be achieved eventually.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e4gb6t/article30825472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/City-TH15Sustained-shortfallcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pledge-to-eliminate-revenue-deficit-remains-on-paper/article30825473.ece
177,2020/02/15,"₹3,299 crore more for health and family welfare","Government to take over Rajah Muthiah Medical College

The budgetary allocation to the Health and Family Welfare Department has increased by ₹3,299 crore this year. The State government has allocated ₹15,863.37 crore for 2020-2021, as against ₹12,563.83 crore last year.

Presenting the Budget on Friday, Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam announced the allocation of ₹1,200 crore for establishing 11 medical colleges, which were approved by the Centre in the last few months.

Among the key announcements for the Department was a government takeover of the Rajah Muthiah Medical College in Cuddalore, which is currently attached to Annamalai University.

After securing the Centre’s nod for the establishment of 9 medical colleges under a centrally-sponsored scheme last year, the Tamil Nadu government had sought the setting up of four more colleges in Ariyalur, Kallakurichi, Kancheepuram and Cuddalore. However, the Centre turned down the proposals pertaining to Kancheepuram and Cuddalore, citing a clause which stated that a district to be covered under the scheme should have no existing government or private medical colleges, official sources said. “Cuddalore already has the Rajah Muthiah Medical College, while Kancheepuram has two or three private medical colleges. So, our proposal was turned down,” an official said. He said the college will be taken over by the government along the lines of the IRT Perundurai Medical College.

Allocations for projects

The government has allocated ₹959.21 crore for the Dr. Muthulakshmi Reddy Maternity Benefit Scheme; ₹260.14 crore for the Tamil Nadu Health Systems Reforms Programme; ₹1,033.29 crore for the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme; and ₹510.15 crore for the Tamil Nadu Urban Health Care Project.

It has announced maintenance grants for persons with debilitating spinal cord injuries and chronic neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. To help hearing- and visually-impaired persons communicate better, the government will provide smartphones with appropriate applications to 10,000 affected people, at a cost of ₹10 crore.

The School Education Department has been provided ₹34,181.73 crore — the highest allocation for any department in this year’s Budget. Last year, it received ₹28,957.62 crore.

In his Budget speech, Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam said the government accorded the highest priority to providing quality education to every child.

The State had topped the Performance Grading Index of the Union Human Resource Development Ministry in terms of providing access to schools. The dropout rate in T.N. has fallen to 0.8%, and the net enrolment rate in primary education has reached 99.88%.

Of the 30,104 children who had dropped out of schools, as many as 29,740 had been re-enrolled, the Deputy CM said.

School supplies

The government has allocated ₹1,018.39 crore for school supplies such as bags, uniforms, footwear, notebooks, textbooks, geometry boxes and colour pencils in the Budget estimates for 2020-21. As much as ₹966.44 crore has been allocated for the laptop scheme for Class XI students of government and aided schools.

Hi-tech laboratories will be set up at government and aided schools at a cost of ₹520 crore. “A total of 76,927 students have been admitted to private schools under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act.

179,2020/02/15,Deputy CM hits out at Centre over GST compensation,"‘There should be no effort to limit the compensation payable to States’

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam once again hit out at the Centre over issues like GST compensation and the settlement of dues to the State.

“In the Union Budget for 2020-21, the Finance Minister has indicated that hereafter, transfers to the GST Compensation Fund will be limited to collection by way of GST compensation cess,” he said in his Budget speech on Friday.

“The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, was enacted to provide compensation to States for loss of revenue on account of implementation of the GST, based on the constitutional obligation of the Government of India to compensate the State for a period of five years under the Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016,” Mr. Panneerselvam pointed out.

Obligation of Centre

Hence, it was the obligation of the Centre to find resources to pay the compensation, and there should be no effort to limit the compensation payable to States, he said and urged the Centre to discuss the issue in the GST council meetings to arrive at an ‘appropriate’ solution.

Mr. Panneerselvam welcomed the increase in the State’s share of vertical devolution of taxes from the Centre from 4.023% to 4.189%, as per the recommendation of the 15th Finance Commission. However, he said it did not make up for past injustices to Tamil Nadu, especially those brought about by the 14th Finance Commission.

The State government will take up the issue of adequate budgetary provision with the Centre to ensure it gets the ₹4,025 crore revenue deficit grant recommended by the 15th Finance Commission in 2020-2021 itself, he said.

Arrears to local bodies

Tamil Nadu is yet to receive arrears of ₹4,345.57 crore as basic grants to local bodies for 2019-20 and ₹2,029.22 crore as performance grant from 2017-18, based on the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the Deputy Chief Minister said.

He pointed out that the local body grants had not been significantly increased by the 15th Finance Commission.

Tamil Nadu has been allocated ₹3,607 crore for rural local bodies and ₹1,737 crore for urban local bodies, thereby getting a total allocation of ₹5,344 crore for 2020-21, against the aggregate of ₹5,178.52 crore recommended by the 14th Finance Commission, according to details given in the Budget speech.

Reduced allocation

“The grants recommended for urban local bodies in Tamil Nadu have been reduced by 31% in 2020-21 when compared to 2019-20 because of the faulty methodology adopted by the Fifteenth Finance Commission. We will urge the Fifteenth Finance Commission to correct this anomaly in their final report,” Mr. Panneerselvam said.

“We are hopeful that the outstanding issues relating to the settlement of ₹4,073 crore in IGST dues to Tamil Nadu from the year 2017-2018 will be settled before the end of the current fiscal year,” he said.

Finance Secretary S. Krishnan pointed out that dues from the Centre stood at ₹12,263 crore, which included grants for local bodies and other Centrally-sponsored schemes.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/deputy-cm-hits-out-at-centre-over-gst-compensation/article30825451.ece
180,2020/02/15,Inter-ministerial team to clear eight agro-processing clusters,"State govt. has tied up with NABARD, plans to seek Central aid

An inter-ministerial team of the Centre will meet on February 26 to clear the State government’s proposals for the setting up of eight agro-processing clusters in various districts.

A senior official of the Agriculture Department said the clusters, estimated to cost ₹218 crore, were expected to come up in Theni, Dindigul, Krishnagiri, Tiruvannamalai, Salem, Cuddalore, Villupuram and Madurai, and will be covered under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY), a reference to which was made in the State Budget.

Besides, another set of food parks will be set up in Dharmapuri, Ariyalur, Perambalur, Karur, Nagapattinam, Ramanathapuram and Tenkasi at a cost of ₹70 crore, for which Central assistance will be sought.

As of now, the Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries has notified the proposed Gangaikondan food park in Tirunelveli as a designated food park in the State. The food park, which will come up on 53.36 acres of land, is estimated to cost ₹77.94 crore. For the purpose of financial assistance, the State government has tied up with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD). “We will be seeking funds from the Centre,” the official said.

Market complexes

Integrated farmers’ market complexes will be established in Tiruvannamalai, Dharmapuri, Madurai, Tiruchi and Tirunelveli on a pilot basis at a cost of ₹50 crore through the NABARD – Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure Fund.

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, in his Budget speech, said that as part of strengthening the extension activities of the Agriculture Department, particularly in the delta, the government would launch a scheme to bring farmers and officials closer through a structured programme of interaction, Uzhavar–Aluvalar Thodarbu Thittam, wherein the latter would provide agriculturists technical advice on farming operations. Considering the fact that sugar mills in the State were under financial stress, the government had come forward to absorb a transport subsidy of up to ₹100 a tonne for the 2019-20 crushing season. The expenditure would be ₹110 crore.

Mr. Panneerselvam announced the second edition of dry land development on a cluster-based approach, under which 25 lakh acres would be covered in three years. In the first year, the plan was to cover 7.5 lakh acres through 3,000 clusters at an outlay of ₹180 crore.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/inter-ministerial-team-to-clear-eight-agro-processing-clusters/article30825435.ece
181,2020/02/15,"Consider creating additional post of Deputy Collector, says judge","The Madras High Court on Friday left it to the State government to explore the possibility of creating an additional post of Deputy Collector to accommodate a meritorious candidate, now serving as a trainee Deputy Superintendent of Police, whose candidature was rejected because he had affixed his signature on the answer scripts at the instance of the invigilator in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) examinations held in October 2017.

Justice N. Anand Venkatesh said he was caught in a very delicate position of not being able to grant a positive relief to writ petitioner A. Babu Prasanth, despite finding him meritorious, because all 29 vacancies of Deputy Collector had already been filled up. “This extreme relief (of creating an additional post) is contemplated taking into account the sheer merit of the petitioner and the marks secured by him,” he said.

“Ultimately, the State must not lose loose the chance of getting the services of a meritorious candidate as a Deputy Collector. The first respondent (government) shall examine the same and pass orders within a period of two weeks from today. If the post can be created, the same shall be intimated to TNPSC... This process shall be completed within a period of four weeks after TNPSC receives instructions from the State government,” he ordered.

The judge pointed out that it had been proven conclusively that it was the invigilator who had forced the writ petitioner to affix his signatures on pages that there struck down by him for having written wrong answers. “Invigilators are supposed to know the instructions thoroughly and they should actually guide the candidates correctly. It is not known as to why the invigilator in this case asked the petitioner to put his short signature in the answer sheet,” the judge wondered.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/consider-creating-additional-post-of-deputy-collector-says-judge/article30825371.ece
182,2020/02/15,Elderly resource centres to be opened based on study of Nobel laureate,"Esther Duflo conducts study and comes up with suggestion

The State government has decided to open elderly resource centres as a pilot project in at least two places in all 37 districts. The initiative, announced in the Budget on Friday, was based on the findings of the research done by a team led by Nobel Prize-winner Esther Duflo.

The study was conducted as part of Tamil Nadu government’s collaboration with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL). Ms. Duflo and her husband Abhijit Banerjee, with whom she shared the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2019, are co-founders of J-PAL.

Sources in the Social Welfare Department, which will be implementing the project, said the intention was to improve the emotional well-being of senior citizens. The resource centres would not be homes for the elderly to stay, but more like day care centres, an official from the department said.

Although the findings of the longitudinal survey done by J-PAL on issues related to the elderly have not been formally released yet, the official said a key finding was that loneliness and the feeling of being not loved or unwanted were common among the elderly even if they were living with their families.

“Because of societal changes, elderly people are not finding avenues for people of their age to meet and interact. We expect the resource centres to serve this purpose, where they can come to read, interact with others or do other such activities,” the official added. Periodic medical check-ups, consultation by dieticians and geriatricians are likely to be conducted in these centres. A total of ₹37 lakh had been allocated to set up these centres in two blocks in each of the 37 districts. Based on the learnings and outcomes of this pilot project, the initiative can be expanded in its scope and reach, sources said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/elderly-resource-centres-to-be-opened-based-on-study-of-nobel-laureate/article30825363.ece
183,2020/02/15,Elections are not athletics to declare joint winners: HC,"Judges uphold Constitutional validity of draw of lot to break a tie to post of village panchayat president

Observing that elections are not athletics or academic pursuits where joint winners can be declared, the Madras High Court has upheld the constitutional validity of two crucial provisions of the Tamil Nadu Panchayats (Elections) Rules of 1995, which provide for draw of lot to declare the winner to the post of village panchayat president if the top two contestants in the election had secured exactly the same number of votes.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad said, that in case of a tie between two candidates, there could be other alternatives such as ordering re-election, allowing both to work on a 50:50 tenure basis or giving one more opportunity to those who had not cast their votes, but it was up to the legislators to deliberate and figure out the best option among them and not for the court to suggest.

The judges dismissed a writ petition filed by K. Devadass who had contested for the post of president of Adaiyur village panchayat in Tiruvannamalai district in December last. The petitioner and his rival candidate M. Kalaivani had secured 905 votes each at the hustings couple with one postal vote each to their credit. Since both of them got 906 votes each resulting in a tie, Ms. Kalaivani was declared elected through draw of lot.

Petitioner’s counsel M. Radhakrishnan questioned the validity of Rule 67(1)(c) of the 1995 Rules on the ground that it violates the right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. He contended that a statutory rule could not encourage a procedure dependent upon luck instead of adopting a rational procedure informed by reason. He also argued that a democratic process could not be converted into a game of chance.

Disagreeing with him, Chief Justice Sahi, at the outset, pointed out that the petitioner would not have challenged the validity of the rule if he had turned successful in the draw of lot. Subsequently, upholding the legal validity of the methodology adopted to declare winners in the case of a tie, he said: “It is a conscious exercise of the legislative will through a law to resolve a tie and is not a game or recreation for gamble or pleasure. “The purpose is to install and give life to an electoral impasse... We should not forget that here that chance is not by way of providence but by man-made law to govern himself. In this context, it would be apt to quote (French philosopher) Voltaire, who said ‘Chance is a word void of sense; nothing can exist without a cause.’ The cause here is the reception of equal number of votes by two candidates under a legally adopted method of casting of votes.”

Stating that draw of lot would be equally advantageous to both the candidates facing a tie, the Bench led by the Chief Justice said: “A decision by draw of lots, therefore, is neither disproportionate nor arbitrary as it gives an equal portion of opportunity to both the candidates through a legally formalized method and which in no way either affects the statutory rights of a candidate or the constitutional rights of either the voters or the candidates.” The judges said the outcome might give rise to a sense of injustice or a feeling of defeat to one candidate in spite of having secured an equal support of the voters, but that could not be a reason to strike down a legal provision.

“The result may be unfavourable to one, but is not hostile to law. The implementation of the Rule, therefore, cannot be abandoned and the law does not lose its dignity if it is interpreted to serve public good,” they concluded.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/l3m6ln/article30825337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FEBMADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/elections-are-not-athletics-to-declare-joint-winners-hc/article30825338.ece

Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam in his Budget speech on Friday said such a centre was necessary the State government accounted for a larger share in the overall public expenditure in the country. Given the growing complexity of the economic environment high quality policy advice from a dedicated institution was required, he explained. “The centre would study the public finance issues in detail from the perspective of the States, and specifically Tamil Nadu.The centre will do research in public finance, provide policy advice to the government and run academic courses,” he said.

Opposition party leaders, including TNCC president K.S. Alagiri and MDMK founder Vaiko, on Friday criticised the AIADMK government for not having a clear outlay in the Budget for providing employment while the ruling party’s allies partly lauded it.

Mr. Alagiri said the Budget lacked vision and innovative announcements. “This Budget is about eyewash announcements,” he said and added that there were no ways to increase revenue, improve livelihood of people and development activities.

Mocking the Budget, Mr. Vaiko said the achievement of the government was only increasing the debt burden to “about ₹5 lakh crore.”

The Rajya Sabha member said except for a few welcome announcements, it was a disappointing Budget.

“There is no word on creating jobs and there is no vision,” Mr. Vaiko said.

IJK funder T.R. Paarivendhar said there was no long-term vision and any plan for employment in the Budget.

A key suspect in the NEET scam, Vedhachalam, 62, a retired government employee, surrendered in a Salem Court on Friday.

Earlier, the Crime Branch CID (CBCID) wrote to authorities about stopping his pension and freezing bank accounts. With special teams seizing his passport and hot on his heels, he surrendered, sources said.

A native of Krishnagiri, he was allegedly in close association with Rashid, the kingpin, and approached affluent parents of NEET candidates. Rashid took ₹25 to 30 lakh each from eight candidates through Vedhachalam.

“We will take Vedhachalam into custody for interrogation,” a CBCID official said.

Three months after the agency wrote to the Director General of Health Services, Board of Governors, National Medical Commission, and Directors of Medical Education of five States, with photographs and biometrics of a dozen proxy NEET writers — mostly medicos — seeking assistance to track the suspects down, there was no response from them.

A native of Kerala settled in Bengaluru, Rashid helped the eight candidates pass NEET and join medical colleges in Tamil Nadu.

Earlier, a huge crowd of anti-CAA protesters, largely comprising Muslims, assembled peacefully in north Chennai. But sections of the crowd turned restive after the police attempted to disperse them. Joint Commissioner of Police Vijayakumari and the Rajamangalam Inspector were injured in the melee. Some protesters were beaten up by the police.

189,2020/02/15,Police to launch IVRS calls for feedback on Dial 100,"New initiative being tested at the State police headquarters

To know the response of citizens after lodging a complaint over Dial 100, Telangana police have decided to take feedback through the Integrated Voice Response System.

The machine-generated call will ask the complainant if they are ‘satisfied’ or ‘dissatisfied’ with the response of the police teams.

The new initiative which is being tested at the State police headquarters will be launched in a few days. “The whole idea behind the project is to know the complainant’s experience with police services, which will help us towards service enhancement,” a senior officer told The Hindu.

Simple feedback

Sharing information on the grounding of this project, the officer said the parameters of feedback were categorised as ‘satisfied’ or ‘dissatisfied’. “If a person is happy with the service, the IVRS will ask to press one on their mobile phones and, if the complainant is not satisfied, the system will ask them to press two which will take him to the next level with a few more questions on why they were not happy with the service,” he said. The unique feature of this initiative is the response of the party over voice recording, where they can register their grievance over the performance of the officer who approached them. The feedback system, which will be linked to TS-COP mobile application will enable the officers to know their performance feedback, the officer said.

With the number of complaints over Dial 100 network increasing by the hour, the State police are finding it difficult to take their feedback. But, soon after the launch, the complainant will receive an IVRS call within an hour of lodging the grievance.

Important feedback

“Everyday, we get at least 6,000 calls on Dial 100 and taking feedback from each one is a difficult task. We might miss some important feedback. But, soon taking feedback will become an easy task,” the officer said. Further, respecting the privacy, the police have decided not to disturb the complainants before 10 a.m. and after 7 p.m. Efforts are also being made to identify ‘easy to remember’ numbers to ensure that these important integrated calls don’t end up as spam calls.

General survey

The police also intend to reach out to over five lakh mobile phone users in the State every six months to take a feedback on the service of the department, and its people-friendly initiatives. “It will be a general survey. Callers will also be asked to share their experience on conviction rate, traffic, and other issues related to the police department,” the officer said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/police-to-launch-ivrs-calls-for-feedback-on-dial-100/article30831426.ece
190,2020/02/15,Irrigation department revamp on cards to boost efficiency,"Exercise to prepare inventory of all irrigation sources, move to strengthen rythu samanvaya samastha

As part of government’s plans to reorganise the Irrigation department including change of its nomenclature as water resources, a hectic exercise has been taken up by the department to prepare an inventory of all irrigation sources – major, medium and minor irrigation projects, lakes and minor irrigation tanks — staff and other assets/properties such as buildings, equipment and machinery.

A couple of meetings for the department’s engineers till Superintending Engineer level have also been organised already as part of the exercise to reorganise the department with an objective to improve its efficiency and optimise the resources. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has been supervising the exercise by holding meetings with senior engineers periodically.

During his recent visit to Kaleshwaram project, the Chief Minister spoke about reorganisation of the department again and was understood to have suggested the authorities to divide it into 11 circles. “Proper and clear division of functional units and responsibilities has become more important in the wake of several major irrigation projects, mostly lifts, coming up in the State including Kaleshwaram, Palamuru-Rangareddy, Pranahitha, Kanthanpally, Devadula and others,” a senior engineers retired recently in the capacity of Chief Engineer said.

“Even after bifurcation of the combined Andhra Pradesh, Irrigation department network is huge with 5 engineers-in-chief, 20 chief engineers, 46 superintending engineers, nearly 200 executive engineers, over 600 deputy executive engineers and over 1,600 assistant executive engineers beside other technical and administrative staff and proper work division is necessary to optimise their efficiency,” another senior engineers working as an executive engineer explained.

It is learnt that all the superintending engineers at circle level have been told to hold meeting with all engineers in their circles on February 17 to prepare an inventory so that they could review the details provided in the prescribed format on February 19. According to officials, a State-level review is likely to be held here on February 20 by Principal Secretary Rajath Kumar.

The exercise for reorganising the department is also undertaking assessment of requirement of assistant executive engineers (civil, mechanical and electrical), work inspector, lashkars, electricians, data entry operators, mechanics for operation and maintenance of canals and pump houses. “Further, there’s a proposal to explore the possibility of mobilising financial resources without burden on farmers — seeking share in market cess since the department is providing irrigation facility,” another senior engineer stated.

Leasing of unused lands of the department near towns and cities for commercial purposes, leasing water bodies to promote water sports and tourism and revision of cess from industrial water supply among other means. Besides, the reorganisation would also include operation and maintenance policy for projects, canals and lifts, dam safety, minor irrigation tanks, improving water use efficiency and amendments to water related laws including proposal to have an alternative to water users associations (WUAs) such as rythu samanvaya samithis.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ylc0wi/article30831984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16ANJANAGIRIRESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/irrigation-dept-revamp-on-cards-to-boost-efficiency/article30831291.ece
191,2020/02/15,Groupism in TRS to fore in Palair constituency,"Rival groups jostle with each other at PACS polling station

Internal squabbles within the Telangana Rashtra Samithi in the Palair constituency came out in the open during the cooperative elections to the Beerolu Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Society (PACSs) in Tirumalayapalem mandal when members of two groups of the ruling party jostled with each other in front of the polling booth on Saturday.

Sources said that tension broke out at the polling booth in the village when members of two rival groups of the TRS allegedly entered into a heated argument after members of one group objected to the presence of a polling agent belonging to another faction at the polling booth.

Mild commotion prevailed in front of the polling booth as the agitated members of the two groups resorted to fisticuffs, sources added.

Police dispersed the members of warring groups and brought the situation under control with great difficulty.

The cooperative polls elsewhere in district, by and large, passed off smoothly.

Election to the PACS of Bhadrachalam in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district had to be postponed for want of quorum, sources said.

As per the reports last came in, the ruling TRS has won a majority of the PACSs in the erstwhile composite Khammam district.

The CPI (M) has put up good show in Bonakal and Nelakondapalli mandals winning a substantial number of director posts of PACSs in both the mandals.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/groupism-in-trs-to-fore-in-palair-constituency/article30831092.ece
192,2020/02/15,TSNPDCL told to pay ₹15.5 lakh compensation,"Three died due to electrocution

The kin of three persons who died due to electrocution in three separate cases were in for a relief after a consumer forum directed the Telangana State Northern Power Distribution Company Limited to pay as ex-gratia and compensation to the tune of ₹15.5 lakh.

The District Consumer Forum, Adilabad was dealing with a complaint filed by surviving family members of Sirigiri Nikhil, Dheeraj Singh and Agarwal Saralabai.

In their complaint, Nikhil’s widow Sirigiri Shivani and parents Sirigiri Ushanna and Sirigiri Premala stated that the victim was aged 23 when he died. In December 2018, he went to check the fuse of a transformer in the agricultural field belonging to Ms Ushanna after the pump of the borewell stopped functioning. As he was in the process of checking, the victim was electrocuted. The family alleged that TSNPDCL negligent which resulted in his death.

Similarly, the family of Dheeraj Singh, then 13 years old, Chaya Kour Dharmendra Singh Tak and Dharmendra Singh Tak, residents of Kaghaznagar, stated that in May 2018, he touched an air cooler in the house and he died on the spot due to electrocution. There was a surge in voltage when this happened, they claimed and alleged the TSNPDCL was negligent.

Sarlabai’s son Pavan Agarwal stated that the victim went to Bokkalaguda in Adilabad. She went to the bathroom but as she was walking she came in contact with an iron cooler and died on the spot. The complainant stated that the TSNPDCL was negligent and there was a deficiency in service as there was high voltage when the incident occurred.

For their part, the TSNPDCL in the case of Nikhil stated that the victim went on his own accord to the transformer and tried to replace the fuse and that he did not have technical knowledge to do so. In the case of Dheeraj, the TSNPDCL placed the blame on faulty internal earthing. Denying claims of a voltage surge, they said that had this been the case, then other consumers in the locality too would have experienced it. In the third case, they stated that the cooler was made of tin sheets. Further, there was a failure of insulation of internal wiring. In all cases, the TSNPDCL rejected any liability.

Taking a view of all evidence and arguments, the forum cited rules of Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission and directed the TSNPDCL to pay ₹5 lakh as ex-gratia and ₹1 lakh as compensation. Similarly, in the case of Dheeraj, ex-gratia of ₹5 lakh and compensation of ₹50,000 was awarded and in the case of Salaralabai, ex-gratia of ₹ 4 lakh was ordered.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tsnpdcl-told-to-pay-155-lakh-compensation/article30830999.ece
193,2020/02/15,Congress leaders vow to protect 4% Muslim reservation,"KCR has cheated the community with his promise of 12% quota, says Uttam

The Congress party on Saturday expressed its resolve to protect the existing 4% Muslim reservation in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh by putting up a strong legal fight in the Supreme Court.

TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy reminded that it was the Congress party under the leadership of the late Y.S. Rajashekara Reddy that provided the reservations, based on which lakhs of poor Muslisms benefitted and occupied respectable positions in society.

Mr. Reddy accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao of cheating the Muslims with the promise of 12% reservation. He reminded that KCR had promised to implement 12% Muslim quota within four months after coming to power in 2014 but the promise remained unfulfilled even after six years and today KCR is not even speaking about it.

Important role

Mr. Reddy, who was addressing the prize distribution ceremony of competitions held on the topic of “15 Years of 4% Muslim Reservation” on the occasion of 64th birthday of former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir, said Mr. Shabbir Ali played a huge role in securing the reservations as a minister in YSR’s tenure.

He said reservations were implemented not only in education and employment but also in local bodies which led to socio-economic, educational and political empowerment of poor Muslims.

Mr. Shabbir Ali gave an overview of the impact of 4% Muslim reservation and claimed that nearly 20 lakh poor Muslims in combined Andhra Pradesh benefitted from 4% reservation and fee reimbursement policies in the last 15 years.

Major gainers

He said according to the All India Survey of Higher Education 2018-19, as many as 130,282 Muslims students were enrolled in Telangana State while it was 58,779 in Andhra Pradesh. Put together, a total of 1,89,061 Muslim students were enrolled in both the Telugu States where the four % reservation is being implemented.

Mr. Shabbir Ali said the share of Muslims in government jobs increased significantly. It was the Congress party that ensured real empowerment of poor, socially and economically backward Muslims, he said.

He also informed that the Supreme Court has resumed hearing on 4% quota this month and all efforts were being made to win the legal battle in favour of reservations for Muslims.

More than 1200 school students participated in the competitions held on February 11 and 12 and the winners of those competitions were given prizes on Saturday. State and district level competitions on importance of Muslim reservation would be held at a massive scale to create awareness among the children and their families.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ubddfj/article30830934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16NUTTAMKUMARREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-leaders-vow-to-protect-4-muslim-reservation/article30830935.ece

195,2020/02/15,TRS leader found dead in a pool of blood,"Political rivals reported to have chased and killed him

Former sarpanch and Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader of Yarkaram village, 20 kms from district headquarters, was found dead in a pool of blood allegedly after a sickle-wielding chase and attack by rivals from Congress here in the wee-hours of Saturday.

Onteddu Venkanna, aged about 40, was found dead with injuries all over the head and face, at around 2 a.m. by the police.

According to Suryapet Rural police, Venkanna, along with other leaders, was going around in the village a little after 1.15 a.m., reportedly ensuring voter and polling preparedness for the primary agriculture cooperative society elections scheduled to begin at 7 a.m.

His rivals belonging to the Congress party attacked him with sickles and sticks, the police said. “It appears to be a pre-planned murder over issues gone bad between both the parties in the past. Venkanna after suffering initial injuries ran into and locked himself up in one Veeraiah’s house, but the attackers broke open the doors and attacked again with sharp-edged weapons and a grinding stone there till he was dead,” a senior official said.

“Vadde Yellaiah and others of the Congress are the prime suspects, they are presently absconding,” the police added.

A few villagers, who claimed to have seen and heard the attack, said the group of people left within minutes after ensuring he was dead. An uneasy calm prevailed in Yarkaram throughout the day with heavy police presence, and later with the body of Venkanna arriving from the hospital after the post-mortem. Leaders of various parties visited the bereaved family to offer condolences.

DSP Nageswara Rao deployed expert teams to collect evidence, and later ensuring peaceful atmosphere he inspected bandobust arrangements in Yarkaram.

197,2020/02/15,‘Hyderabad has lost its sheen as a medical destination in the country’,"Non-implementation of Ayushman Bharat is the reason for this: BJP

BJP national general secretary P Muralidhar Rao has alleged that Hyderabad, which is considered a medical destination in the country, has lost its sheen owing to non-implementation of the Ayushman Bharat health insurance scheme of the Union government.

Patients from neighbouring states were not coming to Hyderabad for treatment owing to non-availability of the health insurance scheme, which provides ₹5 lakh worth medical treatment.

Talking to newsmen here on Saturday, he said that BJP government had allocated huge funds to Telangana in the last five years. The Union government was constructing two crore houses in the country, he said and flayed the TRS government for not constructing any house in the State under the Central government scheme.

Criticising TRS leaders for making false allegations against the BJP government at the Centre on the allocation of funds to the State, he said they were ready to reply to all the queries including the finances, 14th and 15th finance commissions and other allocations. Ridiculing the TRS government claims that the Centre was collecting more taxes from the State and allocating meagre funds, he asked whether the Telangana government was spending all funds collected in Hyderabad only for the GHMC and not spending the same for other parts of the State.

Who was providing security and protecting people of the country by allocating huge funds to the Defence sector, he asked and questioned whether Telangana was not part of the country to contribute its share to the country. He said they would educate people about the CAA and the recent Union budgetary allocations to the farm sector and sops to IT payers.

Reacting to a query on LPG cylinder price hike, he said the hike would not burden the people who were enjoying the subsidy from the Union government.

In a shocking incident, a 17-year-old girl was found dead at Palvancha town late on Thursday night. She allegedly ended her life unable to bear the pressure exerted by her elder brother to marry a close relative.

The incident came to light on Friday and the parents of the girl filed a complaint with the police.

Sources said the girl resorted to the extreme step on being pestered by her brother to give consent to marry a youth belonging to a relative’s family. He reportedly picked up an argument with his sister on Thursday night while their parents were away.

Perturbed over this, the girl allegedly swallowed some poisonous substance and died while being shifted to a hospital.

Palvancha DSP Prasad Rao said a case of abetment to suicide was registered against the girl's brother.

200,2020/02/15,ICRISAT facility to cut seed breeding time,"RapidGen will significantly lower the time and cost of crop varietal development

The International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) unveiled a new facility at its premises on Friday that will revolutionise seed breeding by reducing the time to produce them.

The facility is projected to significantly lower the time and cost of crop varietal development. The state-of-the-art facility is a first for any public sector agricultural research institution.

Called RapidGen, a moniker for Rapid Generation Advancement, the facility will accelerate the plant life cycle in light, temperature and humidity controlled conditions. Presently, breeding a new crop variety takes about a decade or more, with six or seven years spent in seasonal generational advancements to arrive at the elite lines that go for testing and release as varieties. RapidGen will shorten the six-seven year window significantly. When used with the full suite of breeding acceleration techniques, it can reduce the breeding cycle by an estimated 40% in most crops.

“Climate and exponential population growth have to be considered for rapid development of improved food crops. But, we also need to look at what has been achieved to sustain food security and achieve nutrition security,” said Director General of ICRISAT Dr. Peter Carberry.

“With facilities like RapidGen, crop breeders can overcome the limitations of seasons and photo-period to develop the elite generations in fraction of the time and cost it would take if done in fields,” he said.

RapidGen comprises three installations — testbed optimisation chambers, lighting controlled greenhouse bays, and a temperature-regulated light deprivation polyhouse. Depending on the crop and the requirements of breeding programmes, researchers can scale up their activities in either controlled greenhouse bays or in the polyhouse facility after using the testbeds for protocol development.

Largest of the three installations, the polyhouse can be used for over 30,000 crosses in one go. Each of the installations is equipped to finely regulate temperature, light and humidity.

“Every crop is unique in the way it responds to a set of environmental parameters. We have to mimic the right set of conditions within these closed installations to convince a plant to grow faster at high density and reproduce quickly. These set of conditions, which we call ‘recipes’, are crop specific-protocols to hasten the crop cycle while producing healthy and viable seeds,” said the Theme Leader at ICRISAT Pooja Bhatnagar-Mathur.

Deputy Director General - Research, ICRISAT, Dr. Kiran K. Sharma informed that protocols for chickpea, groundnut, pearl millet and sorghum were already in place. “Protocol development is the first step before a breeding programme can take advantage of facilities like RapidGen. With their development, our partners and collaborators, both public and private, can integrate these modern techniques into their breeding programmes,” he explained.

“Through RapidGen, we are attempting to herald a new era of breeding in agriculture research systems across the world. It is a case of many firsts, including a first for CGIAR,” Global Head - Breeding, ICRISAT, Dr. Jan Debaene, said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/qx1iry/article30824842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-ICRISAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/icrisat-facility-to-cut-seed-breeding-time/article30824837.ece
201,2020/02/15,Tiger attacks shepherd,"Officials trying to identify the big cat responsible

In a first of its kind incident a tiger tried to attack a sleeping shepherd in the forest near Brahmanpalli village in Kotapally mandal of Mancherial district on Friday.

The 45-year-old shepherd, Kurma Venkati, resident of Brahmanpalli escaped with minor injuries, a couple of cuts on his leg, and was treated at Chennur hospital.

The tiger which was moving in the area perhaps assumed that the sleeping man was an animal. “It apparently tried to pull him by his leg which caused the injury,” Mancherial District Forest Officer Shivani Dogra hazarded a guess.

“This is a random incident and has never happened before. It is the first time that a tiger in these parts has come into conflict with humans in this manner,” the DFO observed.

On the speculation whether the conflict will recur, Ms. Dogra said nothing can be said as of now. She also said the Forest Department is trying to ascertain the identity of the tiger as quite a few of the big cats are moving in the area.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ylim3f/article30824798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY15TIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tiger-attacks-shepherd/article30824799.ece
202,2020/02/15,When Jesse Owens and Dhyan Chand wowed Hitler,"Historical venue will host Laureus World Sports Awards

As one walked into the Olympiastadion here on Saturday afternoon, one noticed the stadium guide narrating the story of Jesse Owens’ memorable friendship with his German long jump rival Luz Long to a bunch of eager youngsters from Britain.

The Owens-Long story, that lit up the 1936 Berlin Olympics in this stadium, has probably been told a million times over the last 80 years or so but it has not lost even a bit of its charm. The massive stadium is loaded with history and with every step, one could virtually feel the Games coming back to life.

This is the place where Owens won an unprecedented four Olympic golds in front of a stunned Adolf Hitler who organised the Games. And one could almost picture the young, bright-eyed Francina Koen running to Owens to get his autograph shortly after her very forgettable Olympic debut in Berlin. But that moment with Owens in 1936 inspired the Dutch girl who later won four golds herself as Fanny Blankers-Koen in the 1948 London Olympics, the first woman to do so.

In another corner of the Olympia Park is the stadium where Dhyan Chand led India to the hockey gold, thrashing host Germany 8-1 in the final to complete a hat-trick of Olympic golds after triumphs in Amsterdam 1928 and Los Angeles 1932.

The ‘Wizard of Hockey’ mesmerised Hitler and the world with his magical stickwork and fired in three goals in what was his last Olympics. He was so good that there are stories about play being stopped at some venues to check whether Chand had applied glue to his hockey stick or whether there was a magnet inside!

Coming back to Berlin, the Olympic torch relay was in fact invented by Hitler’s Germany though it is made to look like a Greek tradition. The Berlin Olympics was the first time the torch was carried as part of a relay, starting from Olympia, the site of the ancient Olympics in Greece, by 3422 runners to the German city.

Red carpet

Berlin has now rolled out the red carpet for another historic sporting event. The city will host the Laureus World Sports Awards — the Oscars of Sport — which celebrate its 20th anniversary at the Verti Music Hall on Monday.

Some of planet’s biggest stars, present and past, like Eliud Kipchoge, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Sergey Bubka, Michael Johnson, Edwin Moses, Daley Thompson, Boris Becker, Cafu, Nadia Comaneci, Mark Spitz, Dawn Fraser, Chris Hoy and Marvellous Marvin Hagler will light up the night.

Many of them would probably visit the Olympiastadion where every stone has a story to tell. “Without Long’s advice, Owens would have bowed out in the long jump qualification round at the Olympics here. Long lost the Olympic gold to Owens but he gained a friend for life,” repeated the guide guide a few times.

203,2020/02/15,Karnataka Kambala buffalo jockey Srinivas Gowda’s run draws comparison with Usain Bolt,"Mr. Gowda covered 142.5m in 13.62 seconds in a recent event.

A feverish sprint with a pair of buffaloes in tow has catapulted Srinivas Gowda from tiny Ashwathpura in coastal Karnataka to national fame.

On February 1, Mr. Gowda, competing in a kambala event — a traditional race in which the jockey runs along with the buffaloes he is shepherding — covered 142.5 m in 13.62 seconds at the Aikala-Bava kambala near Moodbidri. Converting this into 100m sprint, sports buffs said the kambala runner had clocked 9.55 seconds, just a wee bit ahead of Jamaican Usain Bolt’s world record of 9.58 seconds!

The news spread as fast as Mr. Gowda’s pulse-pounding run, and it soon went viral on Twitter.

Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra suggested that Union Minister of State for Youth Affairs and Sports Kiren Rijiju could provide training facilities for the runner.

The Sports Authority of India (SAI) stepped in and said a suitable course would be devised for Mr. Gowda.

The 28-year-old has been a kambala jockey for more than a decade and trained at the Kambala Academy in Moodbidri in 2011. Founder and convener of the Academy K. Gunapala Kadamba told The Hindu that though his run was electrifying, Mr. Gowda’s feat cannot be compared to an Olympic record as these are diverse events held in varied conditions. While Olympic sprints are judged over seconds, kambala is yet to evolve such a practice.

Mr. Kadamba said while the finishing-time at the kambala was accurately calculated through laser beams and electronic timers, similar technology is yet to be evolved at the starting-point. He, however, added that international organisations are welcome to test the endurance and speed of kambala runners.

Mr. Gowda is the jockey for three pairs of buffaloes that run in different categories. Creating the ‘record’ is a significant achievement as he would have run at least 22 times with three pairs of buffaloes through the course of the entire event, exhibiting sustained endurance.

A construction worker off season, Mr. Gowda said he starts training the buffaloes four weeks before the kambala season. Without any formal physical training, he has exhibited supreme endurance. Sources said jockeys like Mr. Gowda are paid ₹1 lakh-₹2 lakh by owners for a season to train the buffaloes, besides sharing cash prizes they win in kambalas.

For now, before SAI steps in with its offer of formal training, Mr. Gowda’s name is up there in the bright lights with the iconic Bolt, at least in the online space.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/m7ebyb/article30828518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kambala-runnerjfif,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/karnatakas-kambala-buffalo-jockey-srinivas-gowdas-run-draws-comparison-to-usain-bolt/article30828501.ece

205,2020/02/15,"The Centre’s plans to promote Kolkata’s heritage buildings are part of a political game, but promise much cultural gains","But no mention was made of the invaluable collection perishing at Gurusaday Museum

On January 11, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated ‘Ghare-Baire, The World, The Home and Beyond, 18th-20th Century Art in Bengal’ — a dazzling exhibition of original works at the 19th century Currency Building in Kolkata’s BBD Bag. Bengal had hitherto lacked a museum to showcase its art — an inexplicable gap since it is within this matrix that Indian modernism was born. In his inaugural speech, Modi made it clear that by opening this new space, he was assuming the mantle of patron and custodian of Bengal culture. So, was it a charm offensive to win over a recalcitrant State whose people have a weakness for culture with a capital C? Yet, no mention of the invaluable and irreplaceable collection perishing at Gurusaday Museum was ever made.

The exhibition, planned, curated, executed and funded entirely by the Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), was the answer to Kolkata’s prayers. As of now, ‘Ghare-Baire’ is on till March 5.

The Central Public Works Department had demolished the three massive domes fitted with skylights above the courtyard of what was originally known as the Currency Office, a handsome building in the Italian style constructed in 1868. It originally housed the Agra and Masterman’s Bank and served as the currency department till the late 1960s.

Exhibiting heritage

The demolition was stopped during Durga Puja on October 19, 1996, when Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Intach intervened. Much later, after it had been denuded of its Italian marble floors, the building was restored by ASI, which is now its custodian.

At the inauguration, Modi announced that three other heritage structures of Kolkata, which have been restored of late — the Victoria Memorial Hall, Metcalfe Hall, and Belvedere House — would also be used to host exhibitions.

All three sprawling floors of the grand Currency Building and the stairwell have been used to great advantage for ‘Ghare-Baire’, an assemblage of several hundred works in the DAG collection, with only a handful loaned from the National Gallery of Modern Art and the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art. From planning to execution, it took the team two months to mount it. Yet, few in Kolkata, not even the scholars and art historians quoted in various panels, ever got wind of it.

With adequate space for the timeline and background information, the chronological narrative is presented in seven sections: ‘European artists in Bengal’, ‘Early Bengal Indigenous Art’, ‘Realism and Academic Art in Bengal’, ‘Bengal ‘School’’, ‘Santiniketan: Charting Untrodden Courses’, ‘Visualising Bengal’s Man-Made Famine’, and ‘The Liminal Language of Bengal’s Modernists’.

There are also three sub-sections: ‘India’s National Art Treasure Artists’, ‘Devi: Intrinsic to the City’, and ‘Printmaking: Democratising Art’. Modern sculpture in Bengal occupies a good part of the ground floor.

Going through the multiple galleries, I immediately recalled the brilliant, path-breaking exhibition ‘Art of Bengal 1850-1950’, which Ganesh Haloi had single-handedly put together in 1997 at the Calcutta Information Centre. The Tagores had been there in full glory. CIMA galleryheld a similar exhibition titled ‘Art of Bengal’ in 2001. So, there was a certain sense of déjà vu. But it was with great delight that I scanned the Solvyns, Daniells, Henry Salt, Olinto Ghilardi, Captain Robert Smith, Lieutenant-Colonel James George (Chittagong views) and a host of talented academic Bengali artists like Bamapada Banerjee, Kisory Roy, Atul Bose, J.P. Gangooly, Prahlad Chandra Karmakar and Hemendranath Mazumdar (no Sashi Kumar Hesh though), alongside Kalighat pats and oil paintings of Hindu deities that once hung in affluent Kolkata homes. The flickering light was a distraction.

As a reaction to colonial academism and in keeping with the rise of nationalism, Abanindranath Tagore had, at the start of the 20th century, rejuvenated and contemporised ancient Indian art, consequently siring modern Indian art. This departure is well represented through Asit Kumar Haldar, Sunayani Debi, M.A.R. Chughtai and Kshitindranath Majumdar. “The inclusion of this large selection of popular paintings and prints, academic painting and Bengal School paintings produces a new art historical narrative of the Bengal Modern,” says art historian Tapati Guha-Thakurta.

Reduced to absurdity

While this is true, there are major gaps. There is no trace of K.G. Subramanyan, without whom Santiniketan is unthinkable. Hardly any representative works of the Tagores feature. And if this exhibition is about Bengal art, why has the Bengali language been reduced to absurdity? The Bengali text is littered with ludicrous errors. The roomful of Nemai Ghosh photographs of Satyajit Ray needs ruthless stock-taking.

At the Victoria Memorial Hall, all the clutter has been removed, and the grandeur of the domes is revealed soaring above the ground-floor galleries. While the entire gamut of European painters is still there, to these has been added Vassili Verestchagin’s panoramic work — one of the largest oil paintings on a single canvas — depicting the Prince of Wales in a stately procession in Jaipur in 1876. The focus has shifted to Indian public figures, and it is a pleasure to see the simplicity of native flora and fauna in the Company School drawings close to Abanindranath’s resplendent ‘Bharatmata’. A series of photographs documenting the making of the Victoria Memorial from 1910 to 1920 is displayed in the entrance hall, and Indian labourers toiling at the construction site is a revelation. “An effort is on to decolonise the whole display, while retaining a sense of balance,” says Jayanta Sengupta, secretary and curator (director), of the Victoria Memorial Hall.

Belvedere House in Alipore, after serving as the residence of bigwigs of the Raj, was turned into the National Library by Jawaharlal Nehru. After its restoration by the CPWD, it serves as an exhibition space — but shorn of its alcoves and wainscoting, the large hall, once the reading room, has lost its gravitas. In November 2011, the magnificent exhibition ‘Treasures of Ancient China’ opened here. Used for temporary exhibitions now, a “Centre for the Word” was earlier proposed there.

Metcalfe Hall at the crossing of Strand Road and Hare Street was modelled on the Temple of Winds in Athens. Now, it hosts an exhibition titled ‘Ami Kolkata: Its History and Culture’. With its farcical giant topor (the crown that Bengali grooms wear during weddings) and clichés piled upon clichés, it makes a travesty of everything that is held sacred in Bengal, and desecrates this proud colonial structure. Just a reflection of our times.

206,2020/02/15,Brian and Basil’s art,"Beyond the autism spectrum, Brian Varghese Pradeep and Basil Joseph Varghese showcase their art at the ongoing Krithi Literature festival

Amid the noise and activity that the Krithi International Festival of Literature and Knowledge is, sits a bright, cheerful stall whose shelves are lined with vibrant paintings. Birds, animals, still life...it is a kaleidoscope of colours. These are the works of Brian Varghese Pradeep and Basil Joseph Varghese who are autistic.

At the stall are their mothers Anita Pradeep and Sara Joseph, Brian and Basil’s mothers respectively, each wearing a button buddy announcing whose team they are in—Sara’s says ‘Team Basil’ and Anita’s ‘Team Brian’. They take turns at the stall, “the exposure is great and encouraging for the boys,” they say. Being at Krithi is important and not something they expected. “We were not sure if we would get a stall, but we thought we would make enquiries anyway,” says Anita. Sara and Anita are grateful to the Autism Club (Ernakulam) for their support and encouragement.

Sara and she see this as an opportunity to showcase their sons’ talents. Not only did the organisers agree, but also offered the space free of cost. Brian is 26 years-old and Basil is 22, they are students of graphic designing (certificate courses) at Vidya Niketan College; Basil is learning Photoshop while Brian has completed Photoshop and Corel Draw, and is now learning Illustrator. Their works have been part of an outreach programme of the KMB 2018, ‘Outsider Art’, an event for those with autism. They have also been part of shows in Delhi and Bengaluru. The artists have individualistic styles of painting and self expression.

Sara says Basil clicks photographs of something that catches his eye and later draws them— not as replicas but as interpretation of what he has seen. Brian on the other hand is drawn to what he sees around himself — fruits, flowers, and birds. “We have now given him a sketch book so that he can draw other things like the scenery, we want him to explore new things,” Anita says. Brian and Basil share an art teacher Ashil Antony, who teaches them art at their homes.

Ashil is proud of his students, in fact Brian and Basil are his favourites. “They are more sincere and committed than any of my other students.” Ashil, who works at Wallframes as artist, is a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) from the RLV College of Fine Arts, Tripunithura; he has been teaching for the last 10 years. Basil remembers the exact year Ashil started teaching him, “He says 2013. I still remember initially how he used to wait for me. In fact he used to constantly call me asking when I would reach.” His students both are developing their individual styles, palettes and colour schemes. “Basil is very enthusiastic, is now creating his signature style. Brian too is, he is completely silent during the art classes. He doesn’t utter a word until lessons are done, the minute I say classes (twice a week) are over he starts talking,” Ashil says.

207,2020/02/15,Assam group seeks Bodo council’s help,"Eyewitnesses said a man forced him at gunpoint to accompany him apparently for repairing a vehicle far from the market

An umbrella organisation of Bengali people in Assam, alluding to the Bodo Peace Accord signed on January 27, has sought the return of a man abducted by suspected extremists in September 2019.

Pradip Shill, 28, who ran a motorcycle garage at Serfanguri Bazar in western Assam’s Kokrajhar district, has been missing since September 27 last.

Eyewitnesses said a man forced him at gunpoint to accompany him apparently for repairing a vehicle far from the market.

Ransom demand

For almost a week since he was last seen, members of his family received calls from a Bodo dialect-speaking person using a specific number. They had demanded ₹60 lakh for his release.

The Shills live in Tamarhat, a small town about 20 km from Serfanguri in the adjoining Dhubri district.

“We congratulate you for the historic accord and a slew of development it is expected to bring besides lasting peace after extremist groups [factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland] gave up arms. We now look forward to your help in finding Pradip Shill or providing a compensation of ₹25 lakh to his family,” the Sara Asom Bangali Oikyomancha wrote to Hagrama Mahilary, chief of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC).

“Various organisations had protested Mr. Shill’s abduction and the inaction of the police in helping the family. At the time of his abduction, his child was only 24 days old,” Oikyamancha general secretary Amritlal Das told The Hindu.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-group-seeks-bodo-councils-help/article30831106.ece
208,2020/02/15,Raja condemns attack on Kanhaiya Kumar’s convoy,"CPI leader writes to Nitish Kumar

CPI general secretary D. Raja has condemned the repeated attacks on Kanhaiya Kumar during his protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Bihar. In a letter to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, he has demanded the immediate arrests of assailants.

On Friday, the convoy of Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar, a member of the CPI national executive and a former president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union, was stoned by unknown persons in Arrah district.

The CPI said this was the eighth attack on the Jan-Gan-Man Yatra which Mr. Kanhaiya Kumar started at Bapudham,on January 30. “Some forces and miscreants opposed to this campaign are targeting Com. Kanhaiya Kumar and attacking his convoy.

209,2020/02/15,Radio aids revival of dying tribal language,"The Asur tribe has been using mobile radio to transmit local news and songs

Tucked away in the hills of Jharkhand’s Latehar district, Asur, a particularly vulnerable tribal group, may not have access to good road or means of transportation to the outside world, but that has not deterred them from saving their language. Using mobile radio, the Asur community has been spreading the popularity of the language within their geographical limits.

As the voice Dahan-Dahan Turrarr .. Dang T inatang Turrarr.. Noa Hake Asur Akhada Radio Enegabu Degeabu Siringabu Urrarr (Come, sing, dance and talk.. This is Asur Centre Radio) is played out through loud speakers, the bustle at the weekly market at Kotia seizes briefly, as people turn their attention to the sound system that transmits songs and news transmitted in their native language.

Attention of the Asur tribals assembled at the market is immediately diverted to the sound system that transmits songs, news and information about government schemes — all in their native dialect.

“The Asur language figures in the list of UNESCO Interactive Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger. We are trying our best to save our language from vanishing,” said Sushma Asur, who has been at the forefront of community efforts to preserve the language.

The first transmission of a half-an-hour programme was organised near Netarhat on January 19. Since then, the pre-recorded radio programmes have been aired on 16 different occasions, said Ranchi-based A. K. Pankaj, editor of Johar Disum Khabar. Radio programmes are based on incidents happening in different parts of world and also news relating to the community.

As per the 2011 census, the tribe has a population of around 23,000 in Latehar and Gumla districts. “In the community, 50% of population could barely speak in Asur language ... They are not fluent in the language. Only 7,000 to 8,000 Asur tribals are left in the community who are well conversant in the language,” said Vandana Tete, a Ranchi-based poet and tribal right activist.

With help from tribal rights activists, Asur Tribal Wisdom Centre, an organisation involving Asur tribals, was established at Jobhipat village near Netarhat to protect the language and culture of Asur tribals.

About 50 Asur families live in Jobhipat village. The new generation does not speak Asur language, while middle-aged group speak in a broken tongue. Only four to five elderly men and women can speak the language fluently. The Jharkhandi Bhasha Sahitya Sanskriti Akhra, a forum of tribal researchers and activists, which is a unit of Pyara Kerketta Foundation has been working on preserving tribal culture and traditions since 2003. The forum is supporting the community effort. Asur is among the nine PVTGs found in Jharkhand. Of the 32 different tribes recorded in the State, only four to five tribes, including Santhali, Ho and Kuruk, have recorded language scripts.

“The initiative has got a huge response from people. Now, villagers are requesting us to organise events at their places and they are also interested in preparing radio programmes,” said Ms. Tete.

“When we started working on languages, we focused on five tribal and four regional languages. Then we realised that the bigger groups can take care of their own languages, but smaller communities need help,” said Ms .Tete.

While Mr. Pankaj and others helped with technical inputs for the radio programs, younger community members such as Sushma Asur, Melan Asur, Roshni Asur, Manita Asur and Vivekanand have volunteered to work tirelessly to create Asur language-based programmes.

Youth from the community are also being encouraged to write poems in their language and older ones narrate their experience in their own language.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nmu1cd/article30831073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15ASUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/radio-aids-revival-of-dying-tribal-language/article30831074.ece
210,2020/02/15,Ambedkar statue ‘purified’ after Union Minister Giriraj Singh garlands it,"RJD, CPI workers conduct ritual after Giriraj Singh’s visit

Workers of Opposition parties poured water from the Ganga on a statue of B.R. Ambedkar in Begusarai district of Bihar on Saturday in what they called a “purification” act after Union Minister Giriraj Singh garlanded it during a BJP programme.

The BJP MP from Begusarai does politics of hate and by garlanding the statue of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, he defiled the statue and so we purified it today with holy water, said workers of the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Communist Party of India and the Bahujan Kranti Manch. They chanted “Jai Bheem” while pouring water on the statue at the Ambedkar Park on the Ballia block office premises and posted videos of the “purification” on social media.

Local BJP leaders and workers have condemned the “purification” ritual.

“Such acts remind us of pre-Partition time and will not be tolerated… Ambedkar has been an ideal for all sections of society and no one has got monopoly over him,” Begusarai BJP chief Raj Kishore Singh told presspersons.

Mr. Giriraj Singh had undertaken the Bharatvanshi Jagriti Yatra from Sahebpur Kalam to Ballia as part of the BJP’s efforts to create awareness of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. At Ballia, Mr. Singh garlanded the statue.

211,2020/02/15,No NPR till consensus is reached: Maharashtra,"As officials meet on implementation, Minister says further discussions needed on roll out.

The Maharashtra government on Saturday clarified that it will not roll out the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) until a consensus is arrived at among the citizens of the State.

As thousands of people gathered at the Azad Maidan to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), NRC and NPR, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government clarified that further discussions were pending on the decision to roll out the process from May 1 — the deadline set by the Centre for States to implement the twin processes.

Officials’ meet

The clarification came amidst reports that State government officials, including several district collectors and municipal commissioners, had participated in a seminar on the modalities of rolling out the NPR. The meeting with the Director, Census, Rashmi Zagde and Principal Secretary, General Administration Department (GAD), Valsa Nair, was held at the Sahyadri Guest House.

Reacting to the reports, Maharashtra Minister Jitendra Awhad said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had informed him that more discussions were likely on the issue before a final call on implementation is taken.

“Had a discussion with Chief Minister of Maharashtra Mr Uddhav Thackeray and it was decided that a discussion would be held for the benefit of the citizens by discussing all matters related to NPR and NRC. However, nothing [of] such sort of survey will happen in Maharashtra. The Chief Minister has already ensured that there will be no discrimination on the basis of religions, caste and creed in progressive Maharashtra,” he said.

Legal stand unclear

The MVA coalition partners have said the State will not roll out the NPR unless a consensus is arrived at. However, the State has not clarified its legal position on whether it wants to challenge the Centre’s gazette notification.

Earlier, this month Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had informed a delegation of Muslims that his party, the NCP, was taking legal advice on preventing the NPR roll out in the state.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/r0mk23/article30830805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16NRCPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-npr-till-consensus-is-reached-maharashtra/article30830806.ece
212,2020/02/15,Woman accuses cops of raping her in Gorakhpur,"A case under various sections of the IPC including gang rape has been registered

Two unidentified policemen allegedly raped a 20-year-old woman in a hotel room near a railway station here. The incident took place on Thursday after which the woman informed her family members. The FIR was registered in the matter on Friday, police said.

A case under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) including gang rape has been registered against two unidentified police men at the Gorakhnath police station, they said.

No arrests has been made so far in this connection, the police added.

Members of various political parties including Congress, Samajwadi Party, BSP and Purvanchal Sena staged a sit-in demonstration at the office of the district magistrate (DM) demanding suspension of all staff members of the Gorakhnath police station as well as a magisterial probe into the matter.

“The girl is undergoing treatment at the district hospital. She has made serious allegation of rape by two policemen. During investigation we found that the hotel has CCTV footage and also took the statement of guard,” SSP Gorakhpur , Sunil Kumar Gupta said.

“Prima facie, the woman went to the hotel room willingly with some men. However, a probe is underway and culprits won’t be spared,” he said.

The woman told media persons that both the policemen thrashed her and accused her of being involved in flesh trade.

She claimed that she requested them to leave her but they beat her and raped her. Later, they asked her to go home in an autorickshaw.

The survivor also told media persons and investigating policemen that she will be able to identify the hotel room where the crime took place as well as the two policemen who allegedly raped her.

213,2020/02/15,NIA files chargesheet against 2 for financing terrorist activities of Naga insurgent group,"They have been charged with section 120B and 384 of the Indian Penal Code and section 17 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act

The NIA has filed a chargesheet against two persons, including a self-styled major, for their alleged involvement in financing terror activities of Naga insurgent group NSCN(IM).

Luckin Mashangva of Dimapur, Nagaland, and Jaikishan Sharma of Tirap, Arunachal Pradesh, have been named in the charge sheet filed before the special NIA court in Dimapur on Friday, the NIA said.

They have been charged with section 120B and 384 of the Indian Penal Code and section 17 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, it said.

The case, re-registered by the NIA on September 17 last year, relates to the seizure of ₹10,46,100 by a Special Operation Team, Dimapur Police, on August 20 last year from the possession of Mashangva and Sharma, the premier investigation agency said.

Mashangva is a self-styled major of National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) or NSCN(IM) and Sharma is a contractor in Tirap District of Arunachal Pradesh, it said.

The duo, the NIA said, was running an organized racket of extortion from several businessmen and contractors to finance the activities of NSCN(IM).

Sharma managed to secure tenders of government works by threat, coercion and manipulation, and then paid substantial money to the leaders of the NSCN(IM), thus raising funds for terrorist activities of the insurgent group, it said.

Mashangva and Sharma have also been chargesheeted in a case of killing of an Arunachal MLA, the NIA said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nia-files-charge-sheet-against-2-for-financing-terrorist-activities-of-naga-insurgent-group/article30830180.ece

Oinam Jogindro, ‘former’ president of the Manipur People’s Party, an old regional party, and his family members escaped unhurt on Saturday morning as suspected rebels had lobbed a Chinese-made hand grenade at his house at Luxmi market at Wangoi in Imphal west district, said police sources.

The family members noticed the grenade and informed the police. Bomb experts and the police rushed to the spot and took it away for a controlled implosion in a paddy field.

The police said one group of the MPP had “removed him” from the post of president and struck off his name from the membership list. He was charged with misusing party fund and violating the constitution. Mr. Jugindro and his supporters deny the charges of the party central committee of the MPP.

Police personnel are deployed near the MPP office and locked it up to maintain law and order.

215,2020/02/15,Peaceful agitators not traitors: Bomaby High Court,"It grants permission to a few people to sit on an indefinite protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Beed district

Persons holding peaceful protests against a particular law cannot be termed as traitors or anti-nationals, the Bombay High Court said while granting permission to a few people to sit on an indefinite protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Beed district.

The Aurangabad bench of HC on Thursday noted that the petitioner and his companions only want to hold a peaceful agitation to show their protest.

A division bench of Justices T. V. Nalavade and M. G. Sewlikar was hearing a petition filed by one Iftekhar Shaikh challenging a January 31, 2020 order passed by a magistrate and a January 21, 2020 order of the police refusing them permission to sit on an indefinite protest at Old Idgah Maidan in Majalgaon in Beed district against the CAA.

“This court wants to express that such persons cannot be called as traitors, anti-nationals only because they want to oppose one law. It will be act of protest and only against the government for the reason of CAA,” the court said in its order.

The bench noted the orders passed by the magistrate and police were only because the petitioner and his companions wanted to agitate against CAA.

It said, presently, such agitations were going on everywhere and there was no whisper of agitations of other nature in this region.

“We must keep in mind we are a democratic republic country and our Constitution has given us rule of law and not rule of majority. When such act (CAA) is made, some people may be of a particular religion like Muslims may feel that it is against their interest and such act needs to be opposed,” the bench said in its order.

It noted that it is the duty of the government to approach such persons, have talks with them and try to convince them.

“India got freedom due to agitations which were non- violent and this path of non-violence is followed by the people of this country till date. We are fortunate that most people of this country still believe in non-violence,” the bench said.

“In the British period, our ancestors fought for freedom and also for human rights, and due to the philosophy behind the agitations, we created our Constitution.

217,2020/02/15,Four-year-old allegedly raped in school bus by driver,"The child was on her way back from school, say police; search on for accused

The Haryana police have registered a case of an alleged rape of a four-year-old girl by the driver in the school bus while she was on her way back from the school in Himachal Pradesh’s Baddi town.

The police on Saturday said the child studied at a private school in Baddi while residing with her maternal aunt at village Madawala in Panchkula’s Pinjore block.

A case under Section 6 (aggravated sexual assault) of the POCSO (Protection of Child from Sexual Offences) Act and other Sections of the IPC has been registered at Panchkula’s women police station.

“The incident happened in the school bus when the child was returning from the school as per the complaint. On Friday, after returning from her school, the victim narrated to her aunt that the driver had sexually assaulted her on the bus,” Panchkula’s ACP Noopur Bishnoi told The Hindu.

“So far the accused has not been arrested but our teams are out in search of the accused since Friday night. We would nab him soon,” she said.

219,2020/02/15,Four children killed as school van catches fire in Punjab,"Eight students rescued from mini-van; unfit vehicle was fitted with LPG kit

Four children were burnt alive on Saturday while eight others were rescued after the school van of a private school caught fire in Longowal town of Punjab’s Sangrur. The victims included around a three-year-old girl, who was attending her first day at school.

Twelve children were returning from school in the mini-van when the blaze occurred on the Longowal-Sidsamachar road, a senior official said.

“Today, early afternoon, a school van of Simran Public School, Longowal, caught fire while carrying 12 children from school. While eight children were rescued and are safe, four children could not be saved,” Sangrur Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori told The Hindu.

“Preliminary inquiry indicates that the van was in condemned condition and was being run illegally as per the report of District Transport Officer (DTO). If the DTO or any official of his office is found guilty, he will be charge-sheeted,” he said.

Police said the van was an 1990’s model fitted with an LPG kit and was unfit to run on the road. The driver of the van fled the spot after the van caught fire, they said. Punjab Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla, who is also Sangrur MLA, announced an ex-gratia of ₹5 lakh each to the families of the victims and said the school had purchased a “very old van” only on Friday and began operating it the next day.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered a magisterial enquiry into the incident.

On Twitter Capt. Amarinder said, “Very sad to learn of the news from Sangrur ... DC and SSP Sangrur are on the spot and I have ordered a magisterial enquiry. Guilty will be strictly punished.”

AAP MLA and Leader of Opposition in Punjab Assembly Harpal Singh Cheema demanded strict action against the school and civil administration. “My condolence with the families of deceased children. I highly condemn the usage of LPG powered school van that has caused this havoc. Strict action needed against school and civil administration,” he tweeted.

The work will be supplemented with Mahila Shakti Nidhi's efforts to promote self-employment among women.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who met the representatives of CIFF here earlier this week, said a steering committee would be appointed to utilise the international institution's help. “While a number of schemes for girls' education and child nutrition and health services are operative in Rajasthan, the CIFF's technical assistance will strengthen them,” he said.

Mr. Gehlot said the efforts for educating girls, improving nutrition level and providing employment opportunities to women through skill development would make the coming generations healthier and prosperous. The CIFF's assistance would help achieve the targets set by the State government, he added.

CIFF chief executive officer Kate Hampton said the foundation would make investments in the State for overall development of girls, children and women and extend cooperation for ensuring their welfare. Other areas of interest would be power sector reforms, renewable energy and pollution control, she said.

Ms. Hampton praised the State government's efforts for reducing maternal mortality ratio and infant mortality rate as well as successful implementation of 'Rajpusht' project, funded by CIFF, for maternity benefit cash transfer to pregnant women and lactating mothers.

221,2020/02/15,Courts just don’t realise the significance of reservation to SC/ST communities: Chirag Paswan,"“The LJP is coming out with a vision document for the first time. It will lay down the roadmap to improve the condition of Bihar.”

In the light of the recent Supreme Court judgement on reservation and promotions, and the government’s reaction to it, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) President Chirag Paswan has reiterated the need for an Indian Judicial Service sensitive to the needs of the SC/ST and OBC communities.

The government has not yet filed a review petition or issued an ordinance to correct the Supreme Court’s February 8 judgement which said reservation in promotion in public posts can’t be claimed as fundamental right. Isn’t the delay irking you?

I believe in our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. When a similar judgement came last time diluting the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act of 2018, the Parliament session was extended for another day and the status quo was maintained by law. So I believe the government will once again step in. Minister for Social Justice Thawarchand Gehlot has pro-actively placed a statement in Parliament which reflects that the national government is working towards taking a corrective measure.

Isn’t there a systematic flaw if repeatedly such judgements comes and the government is founding wanting in opposing it?

Yes, there is a problem. The bigger problem lies with the judiciary itself. The Lok Janshakti Party has been demanding the setting up of an Indian Judicial Service. Such judgements reflect that the courts don’t relate to problems of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. They just don’t realise the significance of reservation.

There is hardly any representation from these communities in the higher judiciary. An Indian Judicial Service, with reservation for SC/ST, is the only way out. The government, too, should have been more pro-active in intervening when such cases are being heard. I also demand that reservation and laws concerning SC/ST/OBC should be put in Schedule 9 of the Indian Constitution, so that these become non-negotiable.

You have repeatedly demanded an NDA co-ordination committee to keep allies in the loop, but the BJP is not listening to you. How important is such a committee?

A co-ordination committee could make things between the allies more cordial and easier. Mr. Amit Shah was handling two posts, being the National President of BJP and Home Minister; I understand how busy he was. So to coordinate between all members of NDA wasn’t very easy. At times we had communication gap which led to few nuisances.

Now with Mr J.P. Nadda taking over the role of BJP President, we have seen improvement in coordination, like what we saw in Delhi Assembly elections. Things are moving in the right direction.

Will the Delhi results have any impact on Bihar Assembly polls?

Not at all. In fact, I find it very funny the way senior Congress leaders are cheering Aam Aadmi Party while their own party has been wiped out. One regional party, in one particular State defeating the BJP can’t be extrapolated to other States. Bihar will be fought on Bihar’s own issues. And this time I am confident that the NDA alliance will perform very well.

The LJP soon will be coming up with a vision document- “Bihar First, Bihari First”. Can you elaborate on it?

The LJP is coming out with a vision document for the first time. It will lay down the roadmap to improve the condition of Bihar. We will release it well in time for the elections. It has been a matter of concern for me that parties procrastinate and release their manifesto on the eve of elections without giving the voters enough time to study and understand what a certain party stands for. On April 14 we will release the document.

The LJP had supported the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Have you revised your position on it considering widespread protests?

No. It was a well thought-out decision to support the CAA. Opposition is spreading a rumour that it’s anti-Muslim, which is absolutely false. The act doesn't concern any citizen of this country. I agree with the protest against National Register for Citizens (NRC), but our PM has already clarified that it’s not on the table. In fact, it was the Congress who linked the NRC with National Population Register first.

How can you protest in anticipation that NRC will be linked to CAA? As far as NPR is concerned, me and my father Ram Vilas Paswan had met Home Minister Amit Shah and he said categorically that none of the information that NPR form will ask is mandatory. And baseless rumour is floated that if a citizen doesn't furnish details he or she will be put in “doubtful” list.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/knz9v4/article30822848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIRAGPASWAN-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/courts-just-dont-realise-the-significance-of-reservation-to-the-sc-st-says-chirag-paswan/article30822849.ece
222,2020/02/15,AAP threatens stir over power prices in Punjab,"Party warns of disconnecting lines to CM’s residence

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Punjab on Friday has threatened to cut off the electricity connection to Chief Minister Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala, if the Congress government failed to cancel the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) during the upcoming Budget session of the State Assembly. The PPAs had been signed by the previous SAD-BJP government with private power companies.

The decision was taken during a meeting of party MLAs here, chaired by Leader of Opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema.

Mr. Cheema said the remarkable victory of the AAP in Delhi was clearly visible not only in Punjab but across the country and abroad, for it was a vote for ‘performance’ agenda against the communal and divisive forces.

“The stupendous Delhi victory had shown thumbs down to the fascist forces spitting fire during the electioneering and decimated the Congress party to zero, which would be replicated in Punjab as well,” he said.

Mr. Cheema said the ‘Badal's’ of the Akali Dal accused of being hand-in-glove with the mafia raj as also the desecration incidents in the State.

Kejriwal model

Mr. Cheema asserted that the Kejriwal development model on which the elections in Delhi were fought, would be replicated in Punjab when it goes to the polls in 2022.

Mr. Cheema said if the government did not provide relief to the people from the expensive electricity, the AAP would be forced to cut the electricity connection of Captain Amarinder Singh’s residence in Patiala - the ""Moti Mahal"".

223,2020/02/15,Elgaar Parishad case transferred to special NIA court in Mumbai,"All the accused in the case will be produced before NIA court in Mumbai on February 28

A special court dealing with offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) on Friday transferred all records and materials of the Elgaar Parishad case to the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Mumbai.

All accused will be produced before the NIA court in Mumbai on February 28.

Prior to Additional Sessions Judge (special) S.R. Navandar passing the order, the Pune Police submitted that they had no objection to the NIA’s plea seeking transfer of the case materials.

Earlier, Special Public Prosecutor Ujjwala Pawar, representing the Pune Police, had argued against the case being transferred to the NIA court in Mumbai saying it was “legally untenable”.

The Pune court’s order comes as a fait accompli after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government had agreed to transfer the case to the NIA despite protesting the Centre’s decision.

The Centre’s decision to abruptly transfer the case to the NIA last month had come in the wake of reports that MVA government was mulling formation of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the investigation conducted by the Pune police into the Elgaar Parishad case.

The SIT had been mooted by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, who had questioned the Pune police’s investigation and the arrest of eminent activists and lawyers.

A tug-of-war had ensued in recent days between the State and the Centre over transfer of the Elgaar case materials to the NIA team.

While the Pune city police had zealously prosecuted the Elgaar Parishad case and arrested noted intellectuals and activists when the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government was in power in the State, it seemed to be procrastinating in handing the case records to the NIA, given Maharashtra Home Minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh’s reluctance to turn over the probe to the central agency.

Mr. Deshmukh had expressed his dissatisfaction at Mr. Thackeray using his discretionary powers to consent to the transfer of the case.

“I have always maintained that the Centre had not taken the State government into confidence before abruptly announcing that the case be turned over to the NIA. However, it is the Chief Minister’s prerogative to take a call on this case [on whether to hand it over to the NIA or not],” Mr. Deshmukh had said in Mumbai.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c3j9ed/article30366456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SHARADPAWAR-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/elgaar-parishad-case-transferred-to-special-nia-court-in-mumbai/article30825484.ece
224,2020/02/15,MNS has never changed its political stance: Raj,"In veiled dig, MNS chief accuses Shiv Sena of abandoning Hindutva

Contending that the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) had never changed its political stance regarding infiltrators, party chief Raj Thackeray on Friday took potshots at the Shiv Sena, led by his cousin Uddhav Thackeray.

Mr. Thackeray denied being issued any notice by the State Election Commission following complaints by Maratha outfits against the party’s adoption of a saffron flag with Chhatrapati Shivaji’s royal seal or ‘Rajmudra’.

“I have made it clear that the flag incorporating the Rajmudra is meant to serve an inspirational purpose and is not for use during elections. Furthermore, we had already informed the EC that we would be adopting this flag more than three years ago. It was only that we officially displayed it last month,” he said to reporters in Aurangabad.

Taking veiled jibes at the Shiv Sena, the MNS chief said only his party actually undertook drives against illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and Pakistan in Mumbai, as opposed to some “so-called Hindutva parties”. “Why doesn’t anyone ask questions of those so-called Hindutva parties [the Shiv Sena] who have discarded their avowed roles and are now sitting in power? Why is it that when it boils down to action, it is only the MNS which must carry out the actual deeds without support from any other Hindutva adherent?” he asked.

He claimed that it was only due to the actions of MNS workers that the government was able to get taxis and autorickshaws, being allegedly driven illegally by Bangladeshis, off the roads in Mumbai.

The MNS’s change of ideological direction has triggered speculation of the party inching closer to the Bharatiya Janata Party, despite having “unofficially” campaigned for Sharad Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in the general election last year.

However, the MNS chief downplayed his former affinity with the NCP, saying in Maharashtra’s politics, there has always been a tradition of maintaining personal ties despite ideological or political differences. “I had met Mr. Pawar over the issue of EVM tampering. This does not mean that our relations had transformed into any political friendship,” he said.

When questioned about the Elgaar Parishad case being handed over to the National Investigation Agency, Mr. Thackeray said, “It doesn’t matter which agency conducts the inquiry, as long as the probe reaches a conclusion. We see many inquiries being started, but they never seem to end.”

Responding to questions that he was being hailed in banners as a ‘Hindu Jana Nayak’ (defender of the Hindutva ideal), Mr. Thackeray said he had explicitly instructed his supporters not to put up posters with such hyperbolic titles.

Seizing on the Sena’s failure to rename Aurangabad to Sambhajinagar, Mr. Thackeray said, “What harm is there if Aurangabad is changed to Sambhajinagar?”

The Sena, meanwhile, has accused the MNS of hijacking its demand to rename Aurangabad.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/c2reew/article30825481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMRAJTHACKAREY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mns-has-never-changed-its-political-stance-raj/article30825482.ece
225,2020/02/15,195 schools log in to Balbharti’s virtual classroom in Maharashtra,"Scheme to be implemented in 530 more schools in stages, says minister

To boost access and quality of education in Maharashtra’s rural hinterland, Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad on Friday inaugurated the ambitious Virtual Classroom and Studio scheme, which will be implemented in 725 schools across the State.

The scheme is to be implemented under the E-Balbharti project of the Maharashtra State Board of Textbook Production and Curriculum Research (Balbharti). The objective is to enhance the quality of education by using cutting-edge technology that connects students from schools in the State’s backwater areas with a number of subject experts to answer queries and facilitate learning more effectively.

“Our government is committed to equality in education as well as the provision of quality education, which is the fundamental right of every student. We have also come up with audio books in multiple languages with chapters in the syllabus read out by voice artistes to help visually challenged students as part of this project,” Ms. Gaikwad said.

She said 195 schools had ‘logged in’ in the first phase of the scheme, while the remaining 530 schools would be connected in stages.

“Experts from diverse fields — besides regular subjects in the curriculum — including sports, industry and politics will be on hand to impart lessons to children. Our aim is that the benefits being availed by students in schools in developed urban pockets like Pune must be availed by children in rural areas like Latur,” Ms. Gaikwad said.

The minister,who responded to queries from children across a number of schools in rural Maharashtra, said the virtual classroom, with better guidance from experts, will ultimately help in reducing students’ stress prior to examinations.

The project is being implemented by the Valuable Group using its V-SAT based interactive technology. Three Studios have been set-up in the old building that hitherto housed the State Institute of Educational Technology, popularly known as Balchitravani, to establish contact with the schools.

In May 2017, Balchitravani, which was set up by the Maharashtra government to bolster children’s education in the State and remained a fixture in Pune’s educational fabric for more than three decades, shut shop after the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party-led government claimed it lacked funds to support it.

The defunct institute has since been absorbed by the Balbharati as part of its e-learning arm.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nhukim/article30825447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMVirtualClasssroom,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/195-schools-log-in-to-balbhartis-virtual-classroom/article30825448.ece
226,2020/02/15,Congress’s disappearance led to BJP’s defeat in Delhi elections: Javadekar,"Saying that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) always takes lessons from both its victories and defeats, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar on Friday attributed the BJP’s defeat in the Delhi Assembly elections to the complete disappearance of the Congress from the poll arena, which resulted in a direct contest between his party and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

“The BJP’s defeat in the Delhi elections was, in a way, owing to the sudden disappearance of the Congress from the poll scene. As a result, there was a direct fight between us and the AAP. Now, it is another matter whether the people made the Congress disappear, or whether the party melted away on its own or whether their votes got transferred to the AAP,” said Mr. Javadekar, speaking to reporters here.

The AAP won the polls by a landslide, snaring 62 of the 70 seats. While the BJP won eight seats, the Congress failed to open its account in the Union Territory for the second consecutive time. Mr. Javadekar said the BJP always analysed both defeats and victories, and the cause for the débâcle would be studied at the party level.

He said the Congress, which had secured 26% of the votes in the general election last year, could manage to win a mere 4% votes in the Delhi polls. “We had expected 42% votes for us and 48% for the AAP, but we miscalculated by three percentage points in both cases. In the final result, we [the BJP] secured 39% of the votes while the AAP got 51%,” said the minister.

Mr. Javadekar denied having dubbed Mr. Kejriwal a “terrorist”, saying he had never made such a remark. At the height of the poll campaign, Mr. Javadekar had said Mr. Kejriwal had called himself an “anarchist”, and that there was not “much difference between an anarchist and a terrorist.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/congresss-disappearance-led-to-bjps-defeat-in-delhi-elections-javadekar/article30825377.ece
227,2020/02/15,12-km Pune Metro stretch to be operational next month: Javadekar,"Foundation stone for Hinjewadi Line to be laid by March

Expressing confidence that all three lines of the Pune Metro project would be completed by 2022, Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on Friday said a 12-km stretch across both the phases of the Metro will be completed by March.

Speaking after reviewing a number of projects concerning Pune district at a meeting of the district development coordination and monitoring committee (DISHA), Mr. Javadekar said the foundation stone for the Hinjewadi Line will be laid by next month as well.

“The initial process for the Hinjewadi Metro line has been completed while the land transfer process is expected to be done by the end of March,” he said.

In June last year, the Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation (MahaMetro) had announced that it would complete the 12-km stretch — comprising 7 km on Line 1 from Pimpri to Swargate and a 5 km stretch on the Vanaz-Ramwadi Line 2 – by the end of December 2019.

MahaMetro had fast-tracked the completion of this stretch in keeping with the Prime Minister’s wish of seeing the Pune Metro running by the year-end. However, the corporation failed to stick to its deadline.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone for the ₹11,420-crore project in December 2016, just ahead of polls to the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies.

Speaking on other projects concerning Pune, Mr. Javadekar said the Mula Mutha river cleaning project is going to be expedited and that meetings at both Central and State levels have been planned. He reiterated that the loan given by the Japan International Cooperation Agency for the project will be repaid by the Centre, and not by the State government or the Pune Municipal Corporation.

Responding to questions on the air quality in Delhi, he claimed that pollution levels in the national capital had come down significantly.

“We [the Centre] have spent ₹17,000 crore on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway and the Western Peripheral Expressway, which have provided an alternative route to around 60,000 vehicles which used to transit via Delhi. We are continuing to work on several fronts to reduce pollution and combat climate change,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9lsgsi/article30825360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMPUNEMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/12-km-pune-metro-stretch-to-be-operational-next-month-javadekar/article30825361.ece
228,2020/02/15,Coronavirus among reasons for State’s e-bus service delay,"The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in China is one of the factors that has affected the roll-out of electric buses on intercity routes under the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC).

The service, called Shivae, was inaugurated in September 2019 in Mumbai by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. The MSRTC had given a contract to Gurgaon-based Mozev to provide the buses. Mozev has partnered with Prasanna Purple for the operations.

Prasanna Patwardhan, chairman and managing director of Prasanna Purple, said he was told by manufacturers that the virus outbreak has had an impact on the procurement of components for electric buses. “Nearly 95% of the components of electric bus equipment are manufactured in China. We don’t know when the supply side will be restored. It is one of the reasons for the MSRTC’s delay in launching electric buses,” he said, on the sidelines of the inauguration of his company’s maiden electric bus service, which will also have an electric bus provided by Mozev. He said had there not been supply side issues, the MSRTC service would have also launched by this month.

Ankit Singhvi, founder and managing director of Mozev, said it is too early to comment on the impact of the outbreak. “There would be some impact given that supply chains are global in nature. The effect will be clearer in the next two-three weeks,” he said.

He said the depots had been finalised and work was on in full swing to get power supply to the depots. “Our target before the onset of summer is that we are able to deploy at least 10 buses. That’s our first target. By the end of this year, all 50 buses will have been deployed,” Mr. Singhvi said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-among-reasons-for-states-e-bus-service-delay/article30825326.ece
229,2020/02/15,"Phase 1 of Mumbai-Delhi Expressway to be ready by Deepavali, says Gadkari","Minister inaugurates Mumbai-Pune intercity electric bus service, first in country

Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari on Friday said the first phase of the Mumbai-Delhi Expressway, between Delhi and Jaipur, will be completed by Deepavali this year.

“The work on the Mumbai-Delhi Expressway is on in full swing. In Deepavali, we aim to start the first phase between Delhi and Jaipur,” he said in Mumbai. Mr. Gadkari will also visit Sweden to see how e-highways are implemented there.

The minister said the target is to complete the entire project, which will reduce the travel time between the two cities by 12 hours, in three years.

Mr Gadkari was speaking at the inauguration of the first intercity electric bus service in the country — started by by Prasanna Purple between Mumbai and Pune — which will hit the roads on Saturday. Mr. Gadkari said nearly ₹7 lakh crore is spent on importing fuel, and diesel and petrol vehicles also lead to air pollution. “In future, the cost of the ticket will also reduce and the comfort will increase,” he said.

Prasanna Patwardhan, chairman and managing director of Prasanna Purple, said they will start operations on two electric buses from Saturday. “We plan to convert all 20 of our Mumbai-Pune services to electric buses by the end of the year.

230,2020/02/15,"Navlakha, Teltumbde denied anticipatory bail","HC gives them four weeks to approach Supreme Court

Eighteen months after the names of activist Gautam Navlakha and professor Anand Teltumbde were added to the Elgaar Parishad case, the Bombay High Court on Friday rejected their anticipatory bail pleas.

A single Bench of Justice P.D. Naik said that “prima facie there is material against the applicant to show his complicity in the crime. Thus even on the test of prima facie material involving the applicant in the crime, no case is made out for entertaining the application.”

However, the court gave four weeks’ time to Mr. Navlakha and Mr. Teltumbde to appeal against the order in the Supreme Court.

On August 22, 2018, the names of the two activists were added to the original FIR registered by Tushar Ramesh Damugade at Vishrambaug police station in Pune on December 31, 2017. The Unlawful Activities Prevention Act had been added to the FIR in May 2018.

The FIR alleged that members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) were inciting violence by creating communal disharmony. It said members of Kabir Kala Manch, through songs, plays and speeches, spread enmity between different communities. As a result, there were instances of violence, arson and stone pelting at Bhima-Koregaon.

The prosecution claimed that searches at the residences and workplaces of activists Rona Wilson, Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhavale, Harshali Potdar, Sagar Gorkhe, Dipak Dhengale, Ramesh Gaychor and Jyoti Jagtap had yielded incriminating documents from their computers, laptops, pen drives and memory cards.

The lawyers for Mr. Navlakha and Mr. Teltumbde argued that there was no substantial material to link them with the case, and that electronic data that was inadmissible was being presented as evidence.

The court observed in its order that the defence counsels have pointed out that the mention of ‘Comrade Anand’ in any letter is not evidence enough to link Mr. Teltumbde.

But the Bench also noted that the special court in Pune had said in its order that “the court was satisfied that the investigating agency had some material to establish the identity of applicant as Anand or Comrade Anand, as referred to in the documents forming part of charge sheet … The stand that he was in Goa in last week of December 2017 and first week of January 2018, is belied by the material. The investigation was still in progress. Considering the nature and magnitude of the conspiracy, the investigating agency is required to be given sufficient opportunity.”

The Bench also said that according to the special court, the documents seized from the houses of some of the accused revealed a “deep-rooted conspiracy of extremely serious repercussions and the applicant (Navlakha) was a party to the said conspiracy.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fehjrg/article30827341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bmSonamBailAG2F74ARR43jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/navlakha-teltumbde-denied-anticipatory-bail/article30825212.ece
231,2020/02/15,Bhawna Jat qualifies for Olympics in 20km race walk,"The 23-year-old athlete clocked 1 hour 29 minutes and 54 seconds, well inside the Olympic qualification time.

Unheralded Bhawna Jat qualified for the Tokyo Olympics in the 20km race walk event after pulling off a shock win with a national record time at the National Championships in Ranchi on Saturday.

The 23-year-old athlete, who hails from a poor farmer’s family at Kabra village in Rajasthan’s Rajsamand district, clocked 1 hour 29 minutes and 54 seconds, well inside the Olympic qualification time of 1:31:00, to win the gold.

Bhawna’s effort was a massive improvement of more than eight minutes from her personal best of 1:38.30s set in October last year during the National Open Championships here.

She had, however, clocked 1:36:17s in 20,000m race walk event during the All India Inter-Railway Athletics Championships in August last year in Pune, which was competed on track.

Bhawna, who currently trains on her own in Jaipur with her coach Gurmukh Sihag, has not taken part in any international event in junior or senior level. She also has never been in a national camp under the Athletics Federation of India (AFI).

She began her senior career in 2016 during the National Inter-State Championships in Hyderabad where she finished fifth with a time of 1:52:38s. Saturday’s win was just her second such achievement in a national meet after the National Open in Ranchi last year.

“It’s a dream come true. I was doing in the range of 1:27:00s during training and so I knew that if the conditions are all right I would be able to breach this Olympic qualifying mark of 1:31:00s,” Bhawna who is currently a Train Ticket Examiner in Indian Railways, posted in Kolkata, told PTI.

“It was pure hard work in the last few months with my coach that I am being able to come up with this kind of performance,” said Bhawna, who trains on the road around the Sawai Man Singh Satdium in Jaipur.

KT Irfan (men’s 20km race walk), Avinash Sable (men’s 3000m steeplechase), mixed 4x400m relay team and Neeraj Chopra (men’s javelin) have already qualified for the Tokyo Olympics from athletics.

Her coach Gurmukh said that Bhawna has given her dope sample, which means that her national record will be valid.

An AFI offcial also said that dope sample collectors from the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) have taken samples from the athletes.

Bhawna’s next competition will be the Asian Race Walk Championships in Japan on March 15.

Priyanka Goswami narrowly missed the Olympic cut with a timing of 1:31.36s to win the silver in the 17-athlete field.

The earlier national record of 1:31:29s stood in the name of Delhi’s Baby Soumya made during the National Race Walk Championships in New Delhi in 2018.

In the men’s 20km Race Walk event, Sandeep Kumar of Services won the gold with a time of 1 hour 21 minutes and 34 seconds. He narrowly missed the Tokyo Olympics qualification time of 1:21:00s.

“I will try to further improve my timing if selected for the Asian Race Walk Championships next month in Japan and try to qualify for Tokyo Olympics,” he said.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/z38tnn/article30830295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BhawnaJat,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/bhawna-jat-qualifies-for-olympics-in-20km-race-walk/article30829190.ece
232,2020/02/15,Ranji Trophy | Tamil Nadu’s season comes to an end,"Chirag’s day out at Rajkot

Tamil Nadu had travelled all the way here, hoping for an outright win and a miraculous entry into the knockout stage.

However, it had to return home with just a point as Chirag Jani’s defiant unbeaten 124 (292b, 10x4, 2x6) saw Saurashtra gain the first innings lead in their Ranji Trophy Group B match at the SCA Stadium here on Saturday.

Overnight 346 for six, the host required 79 runs to take the lead. The team depended a lot on Arpit Vasavada, who was unbeaten on 126, and Chirag.

Vasavada goes early

But, the former departed after making 132 while trying to steal a single. It was Chirag’s call and Vasavada took off late. Abhinav Mukund, sensing an opportunity, swooped in on the ball from short mid-wicket and broke the stumps to catch Vasavada short.

The Saurashtra camp was left shaken as it wanted Vasavada to play a longer innings.

Dharmendrasinh Jadeja followed soon after, edging pacer K. Vignesh to wicketkeeper R. Kavin, substituting for Jagadeesan, who was nursing an ankle injury suffered during the warm-up session.

The two quick wickets swung the momentum the visitors’ way. Just when Tamil Nadu was looking to clean up the tail, Chirag found an able ally in Jayadev Unadkat (40, 90b, 5x4).

The Saurashtra skipper stood firm, forging a 74-run partnership for the ninth wicket to help the hosts win the first innings race.

Unadkat finally fell leg-before to debutant pacer Sinivas. Chirag’s century was the only interest left in the contest and he reached the coveted mark with a single to mid-wicket off part-time off-spinner Kaushik Gandhi.

Chirag earned a huge round of applause from his teammates for his knock and for shouldering the side’s responsibility.

Saurashtra had reached 481 for nine, shortly before tea, when the captains decided to shake hands.

“It [losing first innings points] was difficult to digest after putting up a huge total on the board. But this venue is known for high-scoring games. However, I think we bowled and controlled the game, but could not pick up wickets,” said B. Aparajith, the Tamil Nadu skipper. He felt that the season was “good” overall.

“It’s disappointing not to be in the knockouts but definitely we will come back stronger, both as individuals and team, next year.

“It’s a process and will take some time. Every match played this year was a learning curve for all of us and these learnings will come in handy next season,” he signed off.

The scores:

Tamil Nadu — 1st innings: 424.

Saurashtra — 1st innings: Harvik Desai c Sai Kishore b Vignesh 12, Kishan Parmar c Sinivas b Sai Kishore 24, Avi Barot c Jagadeesan b Vignesh 82, Vishvarajsinh Jadeja c Sinivas b Siddharth16, Arpit Vasavada run out 132, Samarth Vyas c Kaushik b Mohammed 10, Prerak Mankad lbw b Siddharth 13, Chirag Jani (not out) 124, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja c (sub) b Vignesh 4, Unadkat lbw b Sinivas 40, Kushang Patel (not out) 4; Extras (nb-6, w-3, b-6, lb-5): 20; Total (for nine wkts. in 184 overs): 481.

234,2020/02/15,"NZ vs IND | Ishant passes fitness test, to join Indian team for Test series","Ishant termed the injury phase as a “roller-coaster ride” and thanked NCA physio for helping him during this tough time.

Senior India fast bowler Ishant Sharma on Saturday passed the fitness test at the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru and will now join the team in New Zealand for the two-match Test series starting February 21.

“Ishant cleared his fitness test today and he will be joining the team at the earliest. He is available for selection for the first Test but final call rests with the team management,” a BCCI source told PTI on condition of anonymity.

Ishant is expected to fly to Wellington for the first Test.

Ishant termed the injury phase as a “roller-coaster ride” and thanked NCA physio Ashish Kaushik for helping him during this tough time.

“It was a roller coaster ride for me after the injury on my ankle on the 20th January but with the help of Ashish Kaushik I managed to pull it off! Scans were a little scary, but today I am happy that I am fit ! Thanks Ashish Kaushik! #recoverymode #recovery #postinjury,” the lanky pacer tweeted.

On January 21, Ishant — four short of becoming only the second Indian fast bowler after Kapil Dev to reach the landmark of 100 Tests — twisted his right ankle while playing for Delhi in a Ranji Trophy match against Vidarbha at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi.

An official from the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association, based upon an MRI scan, had said that the pacer had suffered a Grade 3 tear in his ankle, and been advised six weeks of rest and rehabilitation.

A BCCI source later said that Ishant will again do his MRI to ascertain the degree of tear and decide on his rehabilitation.

Ishant was named in the New Zealand Test squad on February 4 subject to fitness clearance.

236,2020/02/15,MP exposes Mumbai’s shortcomings,"Ekes out a draw with a show of dogged batting

The shortage of ability and variety in Mumbai’s bowling stood exposed by Madhya Pradesh in their concluding Ranji Trophy league game here on Saturday. The home team’s second innings declaration at 238, cushioned by a first innings lead of 169 was not enough to force victory. Aditya Shrivastava (130 n.o. off 287 balls, 13x4, 2x6) played the anchor in the second innings as the visitor’s dogged batting earned it a morale-boosting draw. MP was 314 for six when play was called off at the Wankhede stadium with one mandatory over left.

Though Mumbai went home with three points thanks to its first innings lead, it was a frustrating end to its Ranji season. Five regular bowlers were unable to bowl out MP on the fourth and final day as skipper Aditya Tare turned to batting mainstay Sarfaraz Khan, later named Man-of-the-Match, in a futile effort to break partnerships.

Defiant tone

Venkatesh Iyer had set the defiant tone (59 off 125 balls) before Shrivastava slipped into the grafter role for a ton off 208 balls. He shielded partner Mihir Hirwani in the mandatory overs when pacer Royston Dias intimidated batsmen in the hunt for wickets. MP chose to play out time after losing five wickets and succeeded.

Shrivastava used the opportunity to score a First Class hundred at an iconic venue against established opponents. He showed no nervousness in the nineties, slamming two fours and six in one Shams Mulani over to cross the three-figure mark.

Deepak Shetty infused a flicker of excitement into the game with two wickets in one over. New ball partner Dias also bagged two wickets, while Mulani and Ankush Jaiswal claimed a wicket each. But Mumbai’s attack lacked the punch or wile to break a stand of 132 between Shrivastava and Hirwani.

The passive tactics in the first two sessions on the fourth day was strange thinking, urgency set in late and by then, the gritty MP batsmen had gained in confidence to hang on for a deserving draw.

The scores: Mumbai — 1st innings: 427.

Madhya Pradesh — 1st innings: 258.

237,2020/02/15,Hyderabad relegated from the Elite Group,"Sarvate completes a splendid seven-wicket haul as Vidarbha thwarts the home team’s valiant bid

Two-time champion Vidarbha thwarted a valiant bid by Hyderabad to record an outright win to stay in the Elite Group of the Ranji Trophy at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Saturday.

Hyderabad badly needed a victory on the final day to avoid the ignominy of being relegated to Group-C. It resumed at 139 for seven, having conceded a first innings lead of 61 runs. Eventually, it had to settle for a draw and one point to be out of the Elite Group.

The morning session clearly belonged to the home team.

First, tailender Mohd. Siraj played a cameo (46, 27b, 2x4, 6x6) and wicketkeeper-batsman K. Sumanth continued his impressive run with the bat this season to remain unbeaten on 65 (123b, 6x4, 1x6). Left-arm spinner Aditya Sarvate completed a splendid seven-wicket haul for Vidarbha, claiming all the three wickets to fall in the morning.

The heroics of Siraj and Sumanth ensured that Hyderabad finished on 244 and set a victory target of 184 for Vidarbha.

The home team had every reason to hope for an improbable win when pacer Siraj forced first-innings centurion and Vidarbha captain Faiz Fazal to snick an away-going delivery straight to the slips.

Then, Ravi Kiran cleaned up Aniruddha Choudhari with a beauty to leave the visitor in serious trouble at 12 for two.

Ganesh Satish, the leading run-getter for Vidarbha, joined Akshay Kholkar and put on a crucial 45-run stand for the third wicket before he was trapped leg before by left-arm pacer Chama Milind.

Stubborn pair

At 52 for three, Hyderabad was still nursing hopes of a comeback win but it ran into the stubborn duo of the Satish and Siddesh Wath, who put an unbroken 64 for the fourth wicket.

Vidarbha opted to call off play with the score reading 116 for three, eight overs after tea, when everyone thought it would go for an outright win with two well-set batsmen at the crease.

With this drawn, Hyderabad was relegated again from the Elite Group after seven years. It finished the league at the bottom with seven points from eight games including one win, one draw and six losses.

Vidarbha finished seventh with 21 points from eight games including two wins, two losses and four draws, but failed to make it to the knock-out phase.

238,2020/02/15,"ICC Women’s T20 World Cup | India’s middle-order can definitely improve, says Mandhana","India’s middle-order has been unpredictable and its repeated failures have hurt them.

In-form opener Smriti Mandhana believes India’s top four need to bat long to protect the inconsistent middle-order during the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup beginning in Australia on February 21.

India’s middle-order has been unpredictable and its repeated failures have hurt them.

In the 2017 World Cup final, India had lost seven wickets for 28 runs to go down to England by nine runs, while in the recent tri-series final against Australia, they collapsed to 144 all out after being 115 for three at one stage while chasing 155.

“The middle order could definitely improve,” said Mandhana, who became the third Indian to reach 1,000 T20I runs at the 2018 Women’s T20 World Cup and was also the leading run-scorer in the recent tri-series in Australia.

“There are some things we still have to figure out with our batting and we are trying hard to do that. The best way to support the middle order is for the top order to bat 20 overs. I think we need to try and bat long as a top four.

“We must try not to get out in the 16th or 17th over and the problem will be sorted if we can stay until the 20th over,” added the 23-year-old, who rose to number four in the ICC rankings on Friday.

India will begin their T20 World Cup campaign with a clash against four-time champions Australia on February 21.

While India lost to the Australia in the tri-series final, they had also defeated the hosts in a crucial league game, in which Mandhana scored 55 and young Shafali Verma blasted 49 from 28 balls to help the team chase down 177 losing just three wickets.

Australia head coach Matthew Mott believes India have the most feared batting line-up at the T20 World Cup and Mandhana agrees that they have a balanced batting order.

“We can be very unpredictable on our day, but I’d like to agree (with Mott),” she said.

“We have some great batters and our order is very balanced. The top four or five are quite settled. We’ve had the same top five for the last year and that’s been a good thing for us,” Mandhana was quoted as saying by the ICC.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cxh7hd/article30828830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SMRITIMANDHANA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup-indias-middle-order-can-definitely-improve-says-mandhana/article30828831.ece
239,2020/02/15,"How can people start questioning Bumrah’s ability after couple of games, asks Shami","Bumrah went wicketless in all three of India’s defeats against New Zealand with questions being raised over his performance.

“How can people forget Jasprit Bumrah’s numerous match-winning performances just after a couple of indifferent ODI games?” asked a miffed Mohammed Shami on Saturday to counter the criticism levelled at his new ball partner.

Bumrah went wicketless in all three of India’s defeats against New Zealand with questions being raised over his performance.

“I can understand we are discussing on a topic (after a certain length of time) not just after 2-4 games. Just because he hasn’t performed in two games, you can’t just ignore his ability to win matches,” said Shami after the second day’s play in the warm-up game against New Zealand XI.

“What Bumrah has achieved for India, how can you even forget that or for that matter ignore it? So if you think positively, then it’s good for the player and his confidence also,” Bumrah’s senior partner said after taking an impressive 3 for 18 against New Zealand XI.

The veteran pacer didn’t forget to take a dig at critics who he feels have a job to comment, forgetting that Bumrah is coming back from a stress fracture on his lower back.

“As a sportsman, it’s very different. From outside, it is very easy to nitpick as some have a job to comment and earn money. Every sportsman can get injured and one should try and look at the positives rather than harp on negatives. I also got injured in 2015 (knee surgery) but then bounced back,” Shami said

What baffles Shami is how people’s perception changes if a player goes through a sudden slump in form.

“People tend to think very differently and when you do not do well for a few games, their view point about you changes. So on our part, we shouldn’t over-think.”

Easily the most versatile bowler in the current line-up, Shami enjoys the mantle of an elder statesman who is ready to mentor the likes of Navdeep Saini.

Asked about what kind of role experience plays, the Bengal speedster replied: “Experience matters as you then don’t panic easily. You have faced different situations and know what to do. That is valuable.

“So when an experienced player is around and you bring a youngster, he matures quickly. So in our team, we guide our youngsters, joke and laugh with them, make them feel comfortable so that they don’t feel that there is a distance between seniors and juniors.”

He was all praise for Saini, who has been a find for India in white-ball cricket.

“He is young, he has got talent, pace and height. So there are benefits. But yes, someone has to guide him and take him along the way. He needs support. He is bowling well but no one possesses experience straightaway. It comes with passage of time.

“Hopefully, it will come soon and we seniors are there to help him.”

Having been the best Indian bowler on view during the second day of the warm-up game, Shami seemed happy with kind of track that was on offer.

“It was a bit green and the wicket was damp on the first day compared to the second day. Yesterday (First Day) morning, it was challenging and we wanted to take up that challenge. Today it was drier compared to yesterday, with cloud cover, the conditions became helpful.

“There was good bounce and carry, so felt good bowling on a track. These kind of tracks are a rarity and since we have pacers of that calibre, we reaped its benefits.”

For someone with an enviable quality of hitting the seam with ease, Shami said that it was an art that he learnt through sheer hardwork and passion.

240,2020/02/15,"NZ vs IND warm-up | Bumrah, Shami make the ball talk","With pitch easing out, Indian openers Prithvi Shaw and Mayank Agarwal put up a good show.

Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami gave an exhibition of high quality fast bowling on day two of India’s warm-up encounter against New Zealand XI, sending a warning signal for the home team ahead of first Test in Wellington.

For the record, New Zealand were bowled out for 235 in 74.2 overs but Bumrah (2/18 in 11 overs) and Shami (3/17 in 10 overs) used the conditions well and in the process added miles to their legs ahead of the two World Test Championship games.

Umesh Yadav (2/49 in 13 overs) and Navdeep Saini (2/58 in 15 overs) bowled more overs but weren’t half as good as the two premier pacers who troubled the batsmen in all their spells.

With the pitch easing out, Prithvi Shaw (29 batting off 19 balls) unleashed a series of cover drives including a six off a ramp shot while Mayank Agarwal (23 batting off 17 balls) got a maximum with a Nataraja Shot to finish the day at 53 for no loss.

For head coach Ravi Shastri, the basic idea was to check out how his pacers got into the groove and Bumrah and Shami hit the straps straightaway in overcast conditions.

While Umesh and Saini in their first spells bowled too full, Bumrah pitched deliveries on back of length generating disconcerting bounce. He bowled in three short spells while Shami bowled two spells.

The crafty Shami, after getting a hang that ball wasn’t jagging around too much despite cloud cover, concentrated on getting the ball to seam both ways.

Bumrah got Will Young (2) with an angular delivery that straightened after pitching to get a nick that landed in Rishabh Pant’s gloves.

The delivery that got right-hander Finn Allen (20) was one that pitched on back of length and the batsman played for the bounce, deciding to shoulder arms. However the ball nipped back and clipped the off-bail much to his dismay.

The second spell that Shami bowled post lunch was the one that troubled the New Zealand batsmen including senior international Jimmy Neesham, who was unable to counter the seam movement and extra bounce.

Before that he removed the set Henry Cooper (40 off 68 balls) with a fullish delivery that the batsman wanted to drive.

Once the they had bowled enough overs, the duo didn’t come out in the final session as they had done their job for the day.

The final half an hour was entertaining as Scott Kuggeliejn and Blair Tickner got some serious pasting from both Shaw and Agarwal, who used the pace to get some easy runs.

It did help that the Seddon Park track had eased out considerably making stroke-play easier than expected.

With India sticking to the Shaw-Agarwal opening combination for the second successive day, Shubman Gill may just have to wait for his Test debut.

241,2020/02/15,U-19 World Cup star Yashavi Jaiswal reveals reason behind his success in South Africa,"Jaiswal, who is seen as the next young gun to make it big, said during the tournament he also learnt how to bat under pressure.

Player of the U-19 World Cup, Yashasvi Jaiswal, says practising on astro-turf pitches before the tournament helped him excel on the bouncy tracks in South Africa.

Jaiswal was also the highest run-getter in the tournament with 400 runs in six innings, including an unbeaten hundred against Pakistan in the semifinal.

“(His mentor) Jwala Sir had told me that you have to go and bag the player of the series award. We practiced a lot on how to play on bouncy tracks. We practiced on how to play short-balls and that helped me,” Jaiswal told PTI on Saturday.

“I was either playing or leaving short-balls. There is bounce on astro-turf wickets like how it is there, so I batted on astro-turf wickets and that worked,” said the 18-year-old, who dedicated his player of the series award to Jwala.

Jaiswal, who is seen as the next young gun to make it big, said during the tournament he also learnt how to bat under pressure.

“It was a very good experience, to play in a different country, where the wickets were also different. And I enjoyed batting as I was batting for longer duration in the games as well as in the nets.

“I learnt a lot while playing and also learnt on how to deal with pressure, as pressure was there during most of the games,” the left-handed opener said.

Jaiswal’s scores in the tournament were 59 (versus Sri Lanka), 29 not out (versus Japan), 57 not out (versus New Zealand), 62 (versus Australia), 105 not out (versus Pakistan) and 88 (versus Bangladesh). India, however, lost the final to Bangladesh.

Jaiswal said his century against Pakistan was “an important 100” of his life.

Both Jaiswal and his opening partner Divyansh Saxena gave India good starts during the event and he acknowledged the role played by his “Dadar Union” teammate.

“Whenever I was in a hurry or went for a big shot, we spoke to each other. At such times, Diyvansh used to tell me ‘keep playing, a lot of time is left in the game, we will score runs’,” he said.

Jaiswal, who sold paani puris and lived in a tent in his early playing days in Mumbai, also expressed his gratitude for junior chief selector Ashish Kapoor who suggested that he could open the innings for India U-19.

“All the U-19 selectors helped me a lot. It was because of Ashish Kapoor sir that I was able to open. I would like to thank all the selectors and coaches,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/h6gknd/article30828699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAISWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u-19-world-cup-star-yashavi-jaiswal-reveals-reason-behind-his-success-in-south-africa/article30828700.ece
242,2020/02/15,England win last-ball thriller to level T20 series against South Africa,"The highest previous successful T20 international run chase on the ground was 158

England's Tom Curran took two wickets with the last two balls of the match as they beat South Africa by two runs in an amazing T20 international that produced over 400 runs on Friday as the tourists levelled the series at 1-1 with one game to play.

South Africa needed three off the last two balls but Curran, who had just been smashed for 12 runs in three by Dwaine Pretorius, got him lbw then had Bjorn Fortuin caught off the final ball to cap off a day of almost unrelenting excitement and set up a thrilling decider in Centurion on Sunday.

“The performance and level of intensity was improved,” said England captain Eoin Morgan. “The standout for us today was Moeen Ali. To come in and strike the ball like that was such a match-winning innings. Chris Jordan was outstanding. He leads the attack, has a cool, calm head and delivers when it matters. He's a guy you want in your side.”

Man of the match Moeen added: “It was nice to go out and middle a few to get going and then I went on instinct to put pressure on the bowlers.”

England got off to a great start through Jason Roy (40) and Johnny Bairstow (35) but were then bogged down somewhat before Ben Stokes, who finished on 47 not out, and Moeen took charge as the latter hammered 39 off 11 balls to help reach 204-7.

Fantastic atmosphere

The highest previous successful T20 international run chase on the ground was 158 but South Africa, roared on in a fantastic atmosphere, were always in the mix after Quinton de Kock smashed eight sixes as they reached 92 without loss in the seventh over.

When he was caught by Stokes off Mark Wood the game seemed to swing Englands way and after Chris Jordan took two wickets in two balls it looked all over.

But South Africa stuck to their task and a spirited late flurry by Rassie van der Dussen (43 not out) left the hosts, who won the first match by one run, needing 15 off the final over.

Pretorius brought that down to three from the last two balls — the same equation England failed with in the first game — but Curran kept his nerve to trap him lbw with a yorker. Fortuin ambitiously tried to ramp the final ball for four but was caught by Adil Rashid as South Africa finished on 202-7.

Even as England celebrated, the drama was not over as the umpires checked that Rashid had not wandered outside the fielding circle before the batsman played the ball. They eventually ruled it a fair catch and the teams march on to a decider.

“It is great cricket,” said De Kock. “Both teams are playing really good cricket. They came out and fought right to the end and unfortunately we didn't come across the line. “They bowled really well at the death. We can get better.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/zi5k5f/article30827565.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1206302940,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/england-win-last-ball-thriller-to-level-t20-series-against-south-africa/article30827566.ece
243,2020/02/15,Vasavada to Saurashtra’s rescue,"A tough day for the TN bowlers, desperate to win the first innings race

Arpit Vasavada worked his way to a pleasing century (126 not out, 267b, 13x4, 1x6) as Saurashtra finished the day at 346 for six against Tamil Nadu on the third day of their Group B Ranji Trophy clash at the SCA Stadium here on Friday.

Resuming at 107 for three, the host batsmen Vasavada and Avi Barot were circumspect for most part of the morning session. The Tamil Nadu bowlers, desperate for wickets, went flat out. Pacemen K. Vignesh and M. Mohammed bowled with a lot of fire, both of them hitting the deck time and again in a bid to unsettle the left-right combo of Vasavada and Barot, but the two stood firm.

The first hour saw runs come at a trickle, with the batsmen scoring at only two runs an over and knowing that they had a lot of time on their hands in pursuit of Tamil Nadu’s 424. Barot (82, 206b, 10x4, 1x6) and Vasavada took the hosts to 194 for three at lunch, their fourth-wicket partnership stretching to 108.

Vignesh strikes

Vignesh, who had bent his back and extracted extra pace and bounce on a featherbed, found the crucial breakthrough. He removed the in-form Barot, the batsman’s attempt to glide the ball down the leg-side landing in wicketkeeper N. Jagadeesan's gloves.

Soon after, Mohammed welcomed Samarth Vyas with a short-pitched delivery. Samarth went for the pull and offered the simplest of catches to Kaushik Gandhi at square-leg. Left-arm spinner M. Siddharth soon trapped Prerak Mankad in front.

Rising to the challenge

The three quick wickets put the visitors on a high and Saurashtra on the backfoot. But Vasavada rose to the challenge, taking control of the innings and also reaching the coveted three-figure. In Chirag Jani (47 batting), he found an able partner who was willing to battle it out.

The two forged an unbeaten 104-run stand for the unbroken seventh wicket, their association threatening to take the game away from Tamil Nadu in the race for first innings honours.

The scores:

Tamil Nadu — 1st innings: 424.

Saurashtra — 1st innings: Harvik Desai c Sai Kishore b Vignesh 12, Kishan Parmar c Sinivas b Sai Kishore 24, Avi Barot c Jagadeesan b Vignesh 82, Vishvaraj Jadeja c Sinivas b Siddharth 16, Arpit Vasavada (batting) 126, Samarth Vyas c Kaushik b Mohammed 10, Prerak Mankad lbw b Siddharth 13, Chirag Jani (batting) 47; Extras (nb-6, w-1, b-6, lb-3): 16; Total (for six wkts. in 126 overs): 346.

244,2020/02/15,Forest Dept. monitoring carnivore movement at Gymkhana Club,"Club members, managers said they had spotted a tiger near the golf course

The Forest Department is closely monitoring the movement of a tiger that was spotted by a few golfers at the Gymkhana Club in Udhagamandalam around a week ago. According to officials, the tigers was spotted by the members of the club and its manager, who informed the forest department of it.

Notices have also been issued to club members by the management. A copy of the notice reads thus: “Tiger has been spotted near the 16th fairway and the 14th tee box today by a few golfers, their caddies and the manager of the club. Golfers are requested to be precautious [sic] and warned not to venture into the course till such time there is clearance from the club office.”

D. Guruswamy, District Forest Officer, Nilgiris division, said that based on eyewitness account, a tiger seemed to be prowling the area. “We have posted forest department staff to confirm its presence, either via direct sighting or through the identification of pug marks and other indicators,” said Mr. Guruswamy. “The area is known to already have a population of leopards, and there have been sightings before of tigers,” a Forest Department official said, adding that the department was in touch with the club to share information about the presence of any wildlife in the golf course.

The department also plans to set up camera traps in the area where the tiger was last spotted, to confirm its presence. Officials said that with tiger populations on the increase in the Nilgiris, animals are being routinely spotted in areas surrounding major towns. “There is nothing to be worried about, as the carnivore is not a menace and has not attacked any cattle. It seems probable that the animal was using the area to move between different reserve forests and does not pose a threat to humans,” the DFO said.

K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said that was a welcome move as the flyover on Avinashi Road was one of the awaited projects and would be “highly useful” for the city. At least, a beginning had been made for the project. The government should start the construction work at the earliest.

249,2020/02/15,"State budget: manufacturing units welcome higher allocation, micro industries disappointed","No announcement on separate industrial estate for micro units, a long-pending demand

While the manufacturing units in Coimbatore have welcomed higher allocation for the industries in the State budget on Friday, the micro industries have expressed disappointment over lack of announcements on industrial estates for the sector.

C. Sivakumar, president of Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association, said in a release that higher allocation for MSMEs, increase in investment limit for subsidy and allocations to encourage entrepreneurship and skill development were also welcome measures. However, most of the micro units worked in residential areas and faced several challenges. Their long-pending demand was a separate industrial estate.

According to J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, new entrepreneurs, who invest upto ₹50 lakh, will get subsidy. The earlier limit was ₹30 lakh. There is higher allocation for MSMEs. Now, the industry is facing crisis and this allocation will not be adequate. There is no announcement for micro units that are facing several challenges and this budget also does not address the need for a separate industrial estate for micro units here.

Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association president K. Maniraj said the association welcomed the announcements in the State budget to increase the interest subsidy given to MSMEs for capital investment to 5 % from 3 % , to esablish more industrial parks, higher subsidy for solar pumpsets, and ₹607 crore allocation for MSMEs.

However, there was no special announcement for the industrial district of Coimbatore.

The Association had been asking for the last 10 years that the government should give priority to micro and small-scale units for purchase of pumpsets by its departments. There was no announcement in this regard.

President of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association R. Ramamoorthy said the budget announcements would revive industries in the State. There was higher allocation for various segments in the manufacturing sector. The MSMEs were spread across the State and these units would benefit from the steps taken by the State Government in the recent days.

V. Lakshminarayanasamy, president of Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, hailed the allocation of ₹ 500 crore for Athikadavu-Avinashi irrigation scheme for which Environmental Clearance had been obtained. Allocation of ₹ 11,894.48 crore for Agriculture Department would boost the agricultural activities and support the farmers. Proposal for establishment of Agro Processing Clusters in eight districts under Prime Minister Kisan Programme during 2020-21 was also a welcome move.

The long-felt need of Coimbatore was the implementation of Metro Rail Project for which no funds had been allotted. “We also expect allocation of funds for acquiring lands for Coimbatore Airport expansion projects which is long pending and very essential for the development of Coimbatore.

251,2020/02/15,IOB to have MSME focused branches,"Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) has identified 250 branches that will focus on the Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs).

Karnam Sekar, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the bank, told presspersons here on Friday IOB would be an MSME focused bank in a couple of years.

Total advances

Its total advances to the MSME sector stood at ₹31,000 crore.

“Our immediate goal is to take it to ₹50,000 crore.” The period to achieve this would be decided.

The bank was conducting outreach programmes for MSMEs and had organised meetings in Pune, Hyderabad, Tiruchi, and Coimbatore so far.

“We will go to more clusters,” he said. The inputs from these meetings would be discussed and from April 1 steps would be taken towards larger focus on the MSMEs.

The bank had trained 700 of its staff since October and they were posted in the “MSME intensive” branches. They would be able to understand the requirements of the sector. The untapped potential was high in this sector.

The Reserve Bank of India had announced an one-time loan restructuring scheme for the MSMEs and ₹3000 crore to ₹4000 crore had been restructured so far.

By the end of this month, more accounts that were in need of restructuring would also be covered. “Restructuring is a win-win proposal for the bank and the client,” he said.

Recovery measures

IOB’s major NPAs were in the Corporate sector. The bank had taken several measures for recovery.

These include one-time settlement schemes and recovering through securities. As the realisations from recovery increased, the bank was confident of making profits from the current quarter.

253,2020/02/15,Coimbatore Corporation’s hockey ground project runs aground,"Unable to give satisfactory answer to TUFIDCO, civic body shelves the project

Coimbatore will not have a hockey ground. Coimbatore Corporation that wanted to implement the project under the Smart Cities Mission will not pursue the project.

It was off the table, said an officer commenting on the ₹ 19.50 crore project.

The Corporation had proposed to build a hockey stadium with turf of international standards at its school on West Arokiasamy Road, R.S. Puram. The Coimbatore Smart Cities Limited had approved of the project in July 2019.

Thereafter, the Tamil Nadu Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TUFIDCO), which was associated with the approval process, had posed around 20 questions to the Corporation, most of which the latter could not satisfactorily answer.

The officer said the questions were regarding easy movement of vehicles to and from the hockey ground, position of gates proposed and suggestions were on exploring the possibility of creating infrastructure for other games such as basketball, table tennis, badminton, etc. so as to make it a multi-sports arena.

The reason that the TUFIDCO proffered was that by constructing the facility to be an only-hockey ground, there would be under utilisation of the investment and doing it a multi-sport arena would give way for round-the-year utilisation.

Unable to accept and accommodate the questions and suggestions, the Corporation had decided to give up the project.

This puts a question mark over the ₹ 75 lakh investment that the Corporation had made in the school ground – it had built a compound wall and constructed a part of the play area. But most of the money it spent went waste as the shock pad it had spread on the play area was damaged.

But all was not lost as the Corporation could salvage something, said P. Senthil Rajkumar, Secretary, Coimbatore District Hockey Association.

By investing another ₹ 50 lakh the Corporation could at least provide players a synthetic turf, which they would use for practice to compete in state and national events. Such participation would fetch the players certificates that they could use for admission against sports quota seats in engineering and arts science colleges in the city.

In the absence of training facility, Coimbatore’s players lose out to their counter parts from other districts and that means a loss of 100 – 150 seats a year.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/7nt4hp/article30824717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB15HOCKEYGROUND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporations-hockey-ground-project-runs-aground/article30824718.ece

Regarding apparel exports, Mr. Sakthivel said that in EU, Bangladesh exports entered mostly duty free as it was a less developed country. Vietnam and Cambodia also attracted zero tariff.

But, Indian apparel exports attracted 9.1 % duty. Further, European Union recently extended special status to Sri Lanka as a preferential country. Garment exporters had appealed to the Centre to expedite free trade agreements, especially with Europe.

257,2020/02/15,Coimbatore city to get 32 new water tanks,"Suez India to execute the project in the next 12 months

Suez India Pvt. Ltd., which is revamping water distribution system in 60 wards, will build 32 new overhead water tanks in the city in the next 12 months. The Coimbatore Corporation has asked the private company to do so at a review meeting held on Thursday.

Slow progress

According to sources, as the Corporation felt that there was slow progress in execution, it decided to ask the company to first construct the tanks.

The reason was that construction of the tanks would not involve digging roads or diversion of traffic and as the work would be confined to a small place the company could, therefore, take it up without difficulty.

The company had originally planned to take up construction of only three tanks and revamp distribution system in 12 areas in 2020. But after the Corporation’s suggestion, it would at once take up the construction of the 32 tanks. The tanks’ capacity varied from 6.50 lakh litre to 42.20 lakh litre. The sources also said that the Corporation and the company were yet to decide on the areas to be taken up for revamping the distribution system. The company had proposed 12 areas but the Corporation had some reservations about it.

In some of the chosen areas, the company would have to take the permission of either the National Highways or State Highways or work with other government agencies before starting work. As this would take time, the Corporation had asked the company to start the work on tanks. And, while doing so, it could secure the permissions to start the work, the sources explained.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-city-to-get-32-new-water-tanks/article30824643.ece

A Delhi court on Saturday imposed a cost of ₹5,000 on Congress leader Shashi Tharoor for not appearing in hearing on a criminal defamation complaint filed against him for his alleged “scorpion” remark against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja imposed the cost on the Lok Sabha member from Thiruvananthapuram noting that he had failed to appear before him despite the court’s earlier direction.

The court was hearing the complaint filed by Delhi BJP leader Rajeev Babbar, who claimed that his religious sentiments were hurt.

“I am a devotee of Lord Shiva... However, the accused (Tharoor) completely disregarded the sentiments of crores of Shiva devotees, made the statement which hurt the sentiments of all the Lord Shiva devotees, both in India and outside the country,” the complaint said.

“The complainant’s religious sentiments were hurt and accused deliberately did this malicious act, intending to outrage religious feeling of Lord Shiva devotees by insulting their religious believes,” it said.

The complaint, filed through advocate Neeraj, termed the statement as an “intolerable abuse” and “absolute vilification” of the faith of millions of people.

The complaint was filed under sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code relating to defamation.

The Delhi High Court on Friday sent Sanjeev Chawla, alleged bookie and key accused in one of cricket’s biggest match-fixing scandals that involved former South African captain Hansie Cronje, to Tihar jail till further orders.

The High Court’s order came a day after a trial court here had sent him to 12-day police custody.

The court also issued notice to the Centre on Chawla’s plea and listed the case for hearing on February 19.

Chawla, who acquired British citizenship, has challenged the trial court order sending him to 12-day police custody. He contended that during his extradition, diplomatic assurances were given by the Government of India to the Government of U.K. that he will be kept in Tihar jail.

“The said assurances in unambiguous terms stated that the petitioner [Chawla], during his detention in pre-trial and post-conviction will be kept in Tihar Jail,” the plea said, adding “it was categorically stated that extradition of petitioner is sought only to face trial”.

“In complete contravention to the above assurances, the petitioner was brought to India on February 13, 2020 at around 11 a.m. and instead of producing the petitioner before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate concerned, the respondent no. 2 (Union of India) illegally and wrongfully confined him in their custody,” the plea said.

The Indian Youth Congress on Friday organised a protest march against the rising price of LPG cylinders outside the Petroleum Ministry at Shastri Bhawan. The protesters carried gas cylinders and stoves to portray how the price revision had impacted the majority of population struggling to cope with the rising prices of essential commodities.

“State-owned oil marketing companies increased the price of non-subsidised LPG cylinders to the tune of ₹149 per cylinder from February 12 . On one hand there is unprecedented crisis of unemployment and inflation in the country and on the other hand, Modi government by increasing the price of LPG cylinders have pinched the pocket of the people,” IYC said in a statement.

It added that the price hike was effected immediately after the declaration of Delhi Assembly election results and alleged that the hike was unleashed as a revenge against BJP’s crushing defeat in the Assembly elections.

IYC national president Srinivas B.V. said: “BJP is trying to take revenge for the defeat in the Delhi Assembly polls. Just because people did not vote in BJP’s favour, they are punishing them by increasing the LPG price. This decision is cruel and harsh against poor and also shows the anti-poor mindset of Prime Minister Modi.”

A day ahead of the last day for interested stakeholders to sign up for 10 of the sectors under the DDA’s Land Pooling Policy, the agency on Friday said that over 6,400 hectares have been accumulated under the scheme.

DDA officials said that applications for the 10 sectors, which are nearing the eligibility criteria, will be closed on February 15 so that the urban body “can take stock” of things and “test the policy”.

A senior DDA official involved in the project said, “The portal for the 10 sectors will be closed as the policy needs to be tested. It is for the first time that such a project is being undertaken and there are a lot of factors such as what all are required for the development needs to be taken into account.”

“It is also important to consider who will be paying the Extra Developmental Charges as the DDA is only a facilitator and not the developer. Through the test run, the hindrances can be ironed out,” the official added.

Apart from two sectors in the N-Zone, sectors near Alipur are likely to meet the eligibility criteria next, officials added.

The urban body said that it had received around 6,113 applications which were being scrutinised “to assess the eligibility of the sectors” and will be verified by the Delhi government.

The JNU Teachers’ Association on Friday organised a day-long hartal to express their “deep anguish” over Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar being allowed to continue in the post despite his alleged “mis-governance”.

The teachers wrote to Amit Khare, Secretary, Higher Education saying that 40 days have passed since the horrific violence on the JNU campus shocked the entire nation and the world. The removal of VC was a necessary condition for any impartial investigation into the incidents, but no action had been taken.

“The VC, who himself has absolutely no moral authority to be in office, is mounting an open and direct assault on the JNUTA and the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental right to the association using a completely imaginary case of impropriety as a pretext,” the teachers alleged.

Facilities deprived

They said that the administration was depriving the faculty of use of dining hall at the faculty centre, the complex which also houses the JNUTA office, and the faculty club where a creche also functions.

“The VC is asking the 284th meeting of the Executive Council, scheduled for February 18, to consider a proposal to withdraw from the JNUTA facilities like office space and collection of membership fees, etc. This is a naked attempt to de facto ban the JNUTA, and therefore an assault on the right to form associations or unions, which is part of the fundamental right to freedom in the Constitution,” JNUTA said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnuta-expresses-anguish-over-vcs-continuance/article30825548.ece

“Technology is the driving force of our growth engine. Our ways of governance shall be transparent and corruption-free,” said Mr. Lal while addressing the House.

Stating that his government’s current focus is transformation, he said that real transformation cannot take place without greater participation of people in the process of governance. “My government’s new initiatives like ‘5T’ and ‘Mo Sarkar’ are formulated and vigorously being implemented keeping this in mind,” he added.

Highlighting the government’s achievements in various sectors, Mr. Lal termed the government’s step to transform the infrastructure facilities around the Lord Jagannath Temple in Puri “historic”.

In the aftermath of the BJP’s defeat in the Delhi Assembly polls, rumbling have started in the West Bengal unit of the party on what is going to be its political line for the run-up to the 2021 Assembly polls.

The remarks made by State BJP president Dilip Ghosh last month, justifying the killing of people by the police in U.P., Assam and Karnataka during the recent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, had drawn criticism from within the party too. BJP ideologue and Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta said that the party will have to come up with alternative set of policies for the 2021 polls.

We will also have to tell people what alternatives we have for them,” Mr. Dasgupta said. He was among the leaders who had expressed his disagreement to the remarks made by Mr. Ghosh, a month ago.

Bengal BJP vice-president Chandra Kumar Bose expressed his support to Mr. Dasgupta and said on social media, “BJP4India must have a BengalCentric strategy for WB.A roadmap stating development schemes must be projected [sic].”

“Bengal strategy to reach out to the people with development projects. @BJP4Bengal would bring about a change in the political scenario & encourage positive politics [sic],” the grand nephew of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose also said.

271,2020/02/15,AAP invites Prime Minister to Kejriwal’s oath-taking ceremony,"Around 3,000 security personnel will be stationed across the city for event tomorrow

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the oath-taking ceremony of party national convener Arvind Kejriwal and his Cabinet on Sunday at Ramlila Maidan. “It is official protocol and the invitation has been sent from the Delhi government,” an AAP leader said. Invitations have also been sent to the eight BJP MPs and other Delhi leaders.

On Thursday, AAP had said it will not invite Chief Ministers or political leaders from other States for the ceremony. The party had said they would invite the President, Prime Minister and political parties in Delhi.

Mr. Kejriwal and senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia had invited all Delhiites to the ceremony, urging them to give their blessing to the AAP chief.

For the event, the Delhi Police has made elaborate security arrangements and issued a traffic advisory, said officials on Friday.

Around 2,000-3,000 security personnel will be stationed in the city, an official said, adding that the ceremony is scheduled to take place at 10 a.m.

“Traffic regulations will be in place from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.,” the official said. Multi-level security arrangements will be in place with CCTV surveillance of all the routes leading to the venue.

Doorframe metal detectors and baggage scanners will also be installed in and around the ground.

On Sunday, cars will have to be parked at the Civic Centre and behind it while buses will be parked on Mata Sundri Road, Power House Road, Velodrome Road, Rajghat parking, Shanti Van parking and service roads in Rajghat and Samta Sthal as per requirements, the advisory said.

Circular to teachers

Meanwhile, Delhi’s Directorate of Education (DoE) has issued a circular to its officials, teachers and principals of government schools to attend the ceremony. The circular also says attendance will be compiled at the entry gates of the Ramlila Maidan.

In a tweet, Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said: “The Aam Aadmi Party, which has won elections by making announcement of freebies, has enough MLAs but not public support. With the fear of people not attending the swearing-in ceremony, the government has issued a diktat to 30,000 teachers to mandatorily attend it.”

Delhi Congress’s chief spokesperson Mukesh Sharma tweeted: “It is clear that power is being misused to gather a crowd for the swearing-in ceremony.”

274,2020/02/15,Delhi hospital keeping two suspected COVID-19 cases in isolation,"Healthcare institutions have been asked to stock-up on medicines and other equipment, says Union Health Minister

Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital here, the nodal hospital for management/treatment of COVID-19 cases, has reported two suspected cases of the virus. The patients are being kept in isolation, said officials. The hospital has, so far, seen 40 suspected cases but has discharged 38 patients after they tested negative for the virus.

“The hospital currently has two suspected cases who have been kept under isolation,” confirmed hospital authorities.

The hospitals here, including All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Safdarjung Hospital, have been on red alert — to take-in, isolate and if infected treat COVID-19 — for nearly a month now.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called COVID-19 “public enemy number one”, which could create significant political, economic and social upheaval.

Regional director WHO (South-East Asia) Poonam Khetrapal Singh explained that the emergence of any new pathogen with the potential to cause severe illness and death is of grave concern and must be taken with utmost seriousness.

She said so far the vast majority of cases have been reported in China and that most of these in other countries have direct links to Wuhan or other parts of China.

She added that the risk for the region, as globally, is high in view of the region’s proximity to and connectivity with China and the epicentre of the outbreak — Wuhan.

Task force in place

While the virus has now spread to at least 24 countries, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan noted that the Ministry has put in place a task force to monitor the situation with representatives from the Ministries of Health, Home, Civil Aviation and Women and Child Development among others. “The situation is being monitored round-the-clock and we are holding review meetings daily. Also, all hospitals across the country are on high alert and have been told to stock up on medicines and other personal protection equipment,” he added.

The Delhi government has also issued a public health advisory on the virus.

“The advisory prescribed do’s and dont’s for the public to ward off any infection. The government has also set-up a 24x7 control room for the citizens for any query related to virus. A round-the-clock control room has also been set up at the Directorate General of Health Services’ headquarters to address queries related to the virus,” said a health official.

Dr. Singh noted that as per current information, the virus can cause mild, flu-like symptoms as well as more severe disease. Patients infected with the disease are presenting with a wide range of symptoms, she said, adding that most of them seem to have mild disease and about 20% appear to progress to severe disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and in some cases death.

2% people died

“Chinese authorities said about 2% of people with the disease have died although the exact case-fatality ratio is still difficult to assess as the denominator [or number of infections] remains unknown. However, this is a new disease and our understanding is changing rapidly,” Dr. Singh said.

She also said WHO is continuing to analyse information on both current and any new cases as this is critical to enhancing our understanding of the severity of the illness. “Based on the information received so far and on our experience with coronaviruses such as MERS and SARS, it seems that COVID-19 appears to spread mostly by close person-to-person contact, through respiratory routes, in this case, droplets [for instance produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes or during certain health care procedures] and contaminated surfaces [when one infected person and another one are sharing a cup for instance]. This is why we recommend maintaining proper hand and respiratory hygiene,” she said.

She added that the actual source of the virus remains unknown “but it is likely that a zoonotic spillover event/events likely to have occurred for the virus to transmit from a potential animal source to humans and for the human to human transmission to happen”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qmwakf/article30825239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14CORONA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-hospital-keeping-two-suspected-covid-19-cases-in-isolation/article30825240.ece

276,2020/02/15,A Valentine’s Day appeal to save Aravalis,"DU students send card made out of recycled paper to Haryana Chief Minister

This year’s Valentine’s Day was a special one for Aravalli Bachao citizens’ campaign – a movement against the Punjab Land Preservation (Amendment) Bill 2019 that was passed by the Haryana government last year amidst protests.

In a unique form of silent protest on Friday, Delhi University students along with a few people from Gurugram went to the Haryana Bhawan at Copernicus Marg in New Delhi with a Valentine’s Day card and a petition letter addressed to Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal.

Green heart

The students presented the card, made out of recycled newspaper in the shape of a green heart with a few leaves and twigs pasted inside to represent the Aravali forests, to the officiating Resident Commissioner.

The card read: “Respected Chief Minister, A Very Happy Last Green Valentine’s Day! This is a plea from an unborn child, a pregnant woman, little children, teenagers, adults and ailing people. Please don’t destroy our Aravalis. The future of your family as well as ours is in grave danger. We don’t need development at the cost of our trees. Please save our Aravali forests!”

Petition submitted

The formal petition letter signed by all the students and other people was submitted to the Chief Minister’s desk. A file number to track the same was given to the students with the receiving note. Simran, a student from the College of Vocational Studies in Delhi who had made the card, said: “We wanted to convey to Haryana CM that our future is at stake. We love our Aravalis and will not allow our forests to be destroyed in the name of development. Aravali forests cover is less than 10% of Gurugram and South Haryana and less than 2% of the entire State. We have written to Mr. Lal that the Aravalis must be protected as a home for wildlife and for the other critical environmental benefits these forests provide in terms of being the green lungs of NCR, water recharge zone and our shield against desertification.”

Ayush, a student from the Delhi School of Social Work who went inside the Haryana Bhavan to hand the card and the petition, said: “By this unique protest on Valentine’s Day, we wanted to tell the Haryana CM that in this time of climate crisis when India is the 5th most vulnerable country to climate change, the youth is very saddened by this PLPAAmendment Bill which seeks to open 74,000 acres of our pristine forest areas in the Aravali range around Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad in South Haryana and Shivalik hills near Chandigarh when Haryana already has the lowest forest cover in India, just 3.59%, which is way below the national average of 20% forest cover.”

Out of a total of 2.15 lakh registrations and 995 completed applications for ownership rights over properties in 1,731 unauthorised colonies in Delhi, 151 applicants have been handed over conveyance deeds by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), Union Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri said on Friday.

The first batch of 20 applicants who had completed the process were given their conveyance deeds on January 4, after which the DDA carried on handing over the documents while the Assembly elections campaign was on, the Minister said.

On Friday, Mr. Puri handed over the conveyance deeds to another 34 applicants — taking the total to 151.

Stating that the scheme had “nothing to do with the Delhi elections”, which concluded with results being announced on Tuesday, Mr. Puri said the whole process should be completed in six months. “The control norms for the size of roads, social infrastructure etc. will be finalised by the end of the month, after which the layout plans for the colonies will be made,” he said at a press conference.

Asked whether the scheme as well as the government’s proposed in-situ rehabilitation of slums had not worked in favour of the BJP in the Delhi elections, which were swept by the Aam Aadmi Party, Mr. Puri said the schemes had worked in favour of the party.

On the in-situ redevelopment plan for slums, a DDA official said surveys had been conducted at 32 slums and the remaining 160 would be covered soon.

280,2020/02/15,Workers say construction ban should have been lifted earlier,"‘Govt. should pay minimum wages for the period the labourers were out of work’

Reacting to the Supreme Court lifting the ban on construction activities from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in Delhi-NCR, workers’ associations as well as builders said that they were “heavily” affected by the ban “which should have been lifted much earlier”, and demanded compensation in lieu of wages lost.

“Many labourers went back to their villages after the ban as they were unable to meet their expenses here without a job. Many of the major labour chowks were about 70% empty after the ban,” said Abhishek, general secretary of AICCTU (Delhi).

“This time, the ban on construction activities was unusually long and it was a huge set back for the sector. The air quality had improved last month and the ban should have been lifted earlier,” said Rajiv Goel, chairman (Delhi) of the Builders Association of India.

Officials of the Delhi government’s Environment Department, however, said that pollution is due to multiple factors, including construction dust, and they work on every front to control it.

On November 4, the top court had imposed a complete ban on construction and demolition activities in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) due to severe pollution prevailing during that period. On December 9, the Supreme Court allowed construction activities in the Delhi-NCR to take place between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. following recommendation of the Central Pollution Control Board.

‘Suffered the most’

Mr. Abhishek said that they had protested outside the Chief Minister’s residence last year after the ban.

“The government should pay minimum wages to the workers during the period of the ban or give them alternative work. These are people who do not cause pollution by driving cars or running ACs. But they bear the brunt of the pollution by working on the ground and when there is a ban they suffer the most. There is no end to their suffering,” he added.

Mr. Goel said that labourers who leave a construction site do not come back easily and most of the equipment is taken on rent and they have to keep paying the rent, despite construction not happening. “Pollution is mainly due to stubble burning and weather conditions. If it is due to construction, then why is air quality not improving after stopping construction?” he asked.

Experts, meanwhile, said that now was the right time to lift the ban but the government should make sure that contractors follow dust control measures.

“Dust control measures should be implemented despite the fact that there is a ban or not. Right now the compliance to dust control measures is less and government should be more active in checking violations,” said Vivek Chattopadhyaya, a senior programme manager of ‘Clean Air Programme’ at Centre for Science and Environment.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rnhdrv/article30825039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15DEDUST-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/workers-say-construction-ban-should-have-been-lifted-earlier/article30825037.ece
281,2020/02/15,House Surgeonship,"The issue of House Surgeons’ allegedly not meeting attendance criteria shot back to focus after Civil Assistant Surgeon Dr G Vasanth Kuamr alleged that some House Surgeons were absent to duties.

As part of MBBS course, medical students have to work in different departments of hospitals for a year, such a General Medicine, Anaesthesia, Orthopaedics. They serve for 15-days or more in each department. Professor concerned have to sign in a ‘Log Book’ after end of the work period.

They are issued Rs 19500 per month as stipend during the internship. It is superintendent of hospitals who have final say in clearing the attendance and issuing certificate. A committee too goes through the Log Book.

“A few House Surgeons skipped duties to get trained for entrance examinations to Post Graduation course or other exams,” said an official on condition of anonymity.

However, after it was pointed out that some House Surgeons managed to get the internship certificates without attending duties, or other lapses, some steps were taken by superintendents of Osmania General Hospital (OGH), Gandhi Hospital and others.

The OGH’s administration did not issue the certificate to those who did not meet the attendance criteria. Their internship period was extended to get required attendance. Biometric system was introduced to record their presence.

----Health Minister--

After Dr Kumar levelled the allegations, the issue is back in focus. Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said that superintendents will no more have authority to give relaxation in attendance of House Surgeons.

After end of review meeting held on Tuesday, he said that the reason behind internship is to help medical students gain practical knowledge.

“When house surgeons who are issued stipend of Rs 195000 is monitored by scanning thumb and iris, attendance of faculty who are issued more money in terms salaries should be monitored too. If heads of departments are punctual, others will fall in line,” said Dr P Vijayender, former president of Telangana Junior Doctors Association.

282,2020/02/15,"PIL plea in HC over CAA, NPR","‘No mention of where the data collected would be stored’

A public interest litigation (PIL) plea seeking to declare Section 14A of the Citizenship Act-1955, which empowers Central government to register its citizens and issue them national identity cards, as invalid was filed in Telangana High Court.

Two citizens (a social activist and a lawyer), who filed the plea, also requested the HC to quash the notification issued by the Centre to prepare and update National Population Register (NPR). The petitioners contended that the Citizenship Act-1955 originally did not mention anything about NPR.

There are no provisions relating to the National Register of Indian Citizens in the Citizenship Act at the time of passing the 2003 Citizenship Rules. It was only after incorporating Section 14A in the Citizenship Act through an amendment on December 3, 2004, the Central government was empowered to issue national identity cards and National Register of Indian Citizens, the petitioners stated.

According to them, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs on January 7 instructed all census officers to ask questions like main source of drinking water of a house/family and predominant material of floor, wall and roof of the house. The petitioners contended that such questions were different from those asked while updating NPR.

The details of Aadhaar card, mobile phone number and driving licence number being sought during the NPR are connected to the privacy of a citizen. But the NPR manual or the Citizenship Rules 2003 did not guarantee of a system that would protect the data relating to privacy of citizens. There was no mention anywhere of where the data collected would be stored, the PIL petition said.

The petitioners said that enumeration of citizens is different from identification of citizens. The power of identification of citizens cannot be left to the subjective satisfaction of administrative officers, the petitioners stated.

According to them, no procedure or mechanism to be followed for verification or scrutiny of details presented by people was suggested. There is no accountability of the enumerators in case if they enter wrong information, the petition said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pil-plea-in-hc-over-caa-npr/article30831381.ece

284,2020/02/15,Gold smugglers giving tough time to enforcement agencies,"‘We suspect goldsmiths are purchasing the yellow metal in grey market’

Surging gold prices in the international markets are keeping officials of various security and enforcement agencies on their toes, not only at airports but also at railway and bus stations in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

With bootleggers taking to innovative methods to smuggle the contraband, sources said that Hyderabad had become a hot spot in the smuggling of gold and foreign currencies owing to increase of takers in the grey market, especially in the districts.

In the past few weeks, officials of the Customs, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and even Central Industrial Security Force have nabbed several persons coming from Dubai, Jeddah and Middle East countries with smuggled yellow metal.

Among other practices adopted by the carriers, concealment of the metal in the rectum and electrical home appliances seems to be the preferred mode.

In the last seven days alone, enforcement agencies deployed at the RGIA detained several Indian-origin passengers who tried to smuggle the gold or its paste

On Friday, a passenger who arrived from Jeddah at the city airport was detained by Customs for smuggling 1.2 kg foreign-origin gold worth ₹48 lakh. A day before he was arrested, another air passenger who tried to smuggle 986 grams of gold paste by concealing it in his rectum was nabbed by the agency. He arrived from Bangkok

In three cases, DRI officials detained eight persons carrying 2.5 kg foreign-origin gold worth ₹1 crore at Hyderabad and Mumbai airports.

On February 9, four female passengers who arrived from Jeddah at the city airport were detained by the Air Intelligence Unit of Customs department and 2.5 kg foreign-origin gold was seized from their possession.

“Over the past few months, there has been an abnormal increase in the smuggling of gold, not only from the airport but also via trains and buses. And, surprisingly, people who were purchasing the yellow metal were not only from Hyderabad but aslo from other districts of Telangana,” a top official said.

He said in February first week, the DRI seized a whopping 31.5 kg smuggled gold worth ₹13.3 crore from 12 persons in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The contraband was being smuggled to Warangal and Hyderabad from Chennai in trains and buses and the accused were intercepted by DRI officials of Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Nellore zones.

“We suspect goldsmiths in the districts are ganging up and sending their workers to Chennai to purchase the yellow metal in the grey market.

Addressing the students and parents at the learning programme, former vice-chairman of the Cantonment Board Jampana Pratap said teachers had the responsibility of moulding students to shine in their selected fields. He suggested that parents take care of learning by their children as they too had the same responsibility as teachers.

Stating that the State government was taking several measures for better future of children studying in government schools, Mr. Pratap said there were innumerable examples of students who studied in government schools and made it big in life.

Keerthi Varma of IGNIS Foundation said they were trying to improve learning of English and life skills through activity-based learning for students in government schools. This time, they were giving English-Telugu dictionaries to all students in the school and would also help them learn English, she said.

286,2020/02/15,Smuggler slips through Customs check,"A man from Tamil Nadu who arrived at the Hyderabad airport from Singapore was nabbed by personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force for trying to smuggle 1.1 kg gold paste.

After his arrival, the accused passenger, Senthil Kumar of Pudukkottai, managed to escape from the Customs check and was moving suspiciously at the arrival gate.

Around 1.10 a.m. intelligence constable of CISF L.Ramesh questioned Kumar and suspected something unusual, upon which he, along another constable K.V.Ramarao, frisked the passenger and found four packets of gold paste concealed in socks and undergarment.

“Two packets of gold paste, each weighing 200 grams, was concealed in his socks, while another two packets with 350 grams each were found in his underwear,” an officer said.

Kumar, along with his belongings, was handed over to the Air Intelligence Unit of Customs department at RGI Airport for further action.

Several questions were raised on how the passenger managed to sneak through the ‘red’ zone of the Customs department.

A senior Customs official said they were inquiring into how Kumar managed to escape the check and came out of the terminal. “We are suspecting the role of an insider in helping the passenger to skip the mandatory check,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/smuggler-slips-through-customs-check/article30830661.ece

289,2020/02/15,"Fake visa racket busted by Cyberabad police, seven arrested","Some members of the human trafficking gang busted by the Cyberabad police had spread tentacles in Sri Lanka to get revenue stamps of Kuwait for preparing ‘fake’ visas of that country in Hyderabad. The gang has sent 21 women from East Godavari and West Godavari districts to Kuwait.

Seven persons, including kingpin Rellu Kubender Rao (32) from Katedan in Rajendranagar, were arrested and 16 Indian Passports, 13 fake visa documents, 25 rubber stamps of various officials, and other documents were seized from their possession.

Rao, who returned to India after working in Singapore and South Africa for several years, started booking flight tickets for people through NBS Travels in Kumbakonam of Tamil Nadu, said Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V. C. Sajjanar.

“The agents will send the women to Dubai on valid visit visas and from there to Kuwait on a fake visa, which they manipulate here. The entire process is to avoid paying the security deposit amount to the Protector of Emigrants,” he said.

He said that another accused Shaik Basheer Ahmed (60) from Kumbakonam would go to Sri Lanka every month to get the revenue stamps of Kuwait from Kumar, who somehow managed to procure them “The stamps were used to prepare the duplicate visas,” the officer said.

Asked if the victims were aware of the cheating, Mr. Sajjanar said the accused were running the business ‘successfully’ as the majority of the women who were desperate to earn Kuwaiti dinars approached the gang for duplicate visas.

“Once they reach Dubai airport, they tear off the Dubai visa documents, and board another flight to Kuwait with fake documents by avoiding immigration clearance. There the immigration officers don’t have a system of checking the visas online,” an officer said.

In Kuwait, Rao’s agents Laxmi, Sharada, Srinu and Sara would provide employment to the women.

291,2020/02/15,"Soon, MV Act may press the ‘accelerator’ in State","Govt. may be forced to implement law with Centre’s advisory

Months after pussyfooting implementation of the amended Motor Vehicle Act (2019), the Telangana government may be forced to implement the tough law.

This follows the Union Law Ministry’s advisory to states for implementing the law without tweaking the penal fee.

“Amendments will ensure concurrence of the State governments while formulating the National Transport Policy and making schemes for national, multi-modal and inter-state transportation of goods and passengers by the Central government,” says a note issued by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways last month.

Telangana is among the few states that have not implemented the Central MV Act that became law on August 9, 2019.

Some states like Gujarat implemented the law by reducing the penal fees after an outcry by vehicle owners. The stiff penalties under the MV Act begin at ₹1,000.

Most states have baulked at implementing the amended Act citing high penalties and tough norms.

In the immediate aftermath of implementing the new law in Delhi and a few other states, there were viral videos of motorists abandoning vehicles after being caught and penalised hefty amounts.

The older MV Act 1988, which is still in force in Telangana, has a lower penal amount of ₹100. Adjusted for inflation, using Consumer Price Index data, the ₹100 of 1988 works out to be about ₹910.

For a few days during the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation strike, the State government invoked the MV Act as it gave leeway to states for improving urban transport and last mile connectivity. But after the RTC strike ended, there has been no word about the implementation of the new law. In September, the State government has issued a GO - 632 that enhanced penalties between ₹25,000 and ₹1 lakh and confiscation of heavy vehicles for transporting construction and building debris for multiple violations.

A few days before the new law was to be rolled out, the Telangana Police put up billboards advising motorists to save money by following the law. Later, the signages were quietly taken down.

“We will implement the penalties once they are notified. It is all automated we don’t have to know how much has it been enhanced or other such details,” said a traffic police official.

Officials from Road Transport Authority were unavailable for comment.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/soon-mv-act-may-press-the-accelerator-in-state/article30824850.ece
292,2020/02/15,Is TS-RERA serving its purpose?,"‘Instead of being a regulatory and facilitating body, it has turned into another bureaucratic maze’

There sure have been lot of cheer among real estate developers over the proposed single window clearance for building permissions by the Telangana government on the lines of TS-iPASS.

While it will come as a shot in the arm for builders as it takes six to 10 months to get permissions from the sanctioned municipal authority, most see TS-RERA as a stumbling block.

Telangana State - Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TS-RERA) came into being in August 2018 and continues to function on an ad-hoc basis without a full-fledged body.

But, realtors complain that instead of being a “regulatory and facilitating body”, it has turned into another “bureaucratic maze”.

“It is a nightmare for organised players because it is taking two months or more to get applications vetted in different levels. Until the final signature comes, we are not supposed to go public about the project. Imagine the loss if we are to wait up to a year to get permissions,” points out a prominent builder pleading anonymity.

Real estate developers charge that despite providing various documents to municipal authorities concerned for getting building permissions, the TS-RERA seeks re-submission of documents and other details at periodic intervals of time during scrutiny.

“Either they are outsourced employees without sufficient technical know-how or are deputed from the Town and Country Planning wing already busy with other works. The pressure is on developers volunteering to register with no punitive action on unorganised players merrily doing layouts and projects without RERA registrations,” says another developer, also refusing to be identified.

They may not be way off the mark considering TS-RERA website that shows about 1,634 properties registered for citizens to verify various projects and not a single technical person. Senior officials had stated earlier that 80% profiles of 5,600 properties within the capital were available, scrutiny of 2,500 properties done and notices issued to 500 of them about ‘shortcomings’ in their applications.

“If TS-RERA had acted tough even in a few cases, it would have sent a strong message to unscrupulous players advertising openly on various fora. The authority has not even publicised their work,” rues another builder.

Top officials like special chief secretary Rajeshwar Tiwari and (now) chief secretary Somesh Kumar have been functioning as TS-RERA chairman and secretary is Director of Town & Country Planning K. Vidyadhar with no regular authority established. Members for finance, legal, technical, IT or administration as enunciated in RERA Act too have not been appointed.

A RERA Appellate Tribunal too has not yet put in place instead the TS State Value Added Tax Appellete Tribunal has been tasked to manage the affairs. An online citizen grievance mechanism too is missing, it is pointed out. Rough estimate by the industry is that about 60 projects with potential investment running to hundreds of crores of rupees are awaiting final clearance.

August 2018 in TS

TS-RERA came into existence in August 2018 where projects in plots of above 500 sq. metres or having more than eight apartments approved on or after January 1, 2017, come under its ambit needing online registrations. It has increased the penal fee for late registrations to ₹3 lakh in June last year after repeated reminders from November 2018 onwards. There have been no such notifications in recent times.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/e7i9i/article30824822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-REALTY-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/is-ts-rera-serving-its-purpose/article30824821.ece
293,2020/02/15,Two unique listeners: the delightful elderly gent and the peaceful sleeping child,"That your notes wash over a child, bypassing their cognitive centres and entering the soul, is a most rewarding feeling, say musicians

This column has talked about the kinds of audience members at music recitals — from the raptly listening and appreciative to the distracted and fidgety. Two more categories can be added to the list.

The first is a rather interesting audience member — cannot yet call him a type or category, because the individual in question is rather unique. There may be more like him in other towns and cities, but I haven’t met them yet. This is a delightful elderly gent, who merges with the crowd and has no distinguishing markings of any kind. He does not wear self-conscious silk kurtas with gold buttons and stoles; he is not up there in the front, swaying a lot. He merges with the crowd in his ordinary ‘pant-shirt’.

At the end of the programme, as people begin to leave, he chooses someone to gift a teeny-tiny bottle of attar to, and tells the person why he or she caught his eye. It appears that he carries a fistful of these bottles of khus (vetiver) or mogra (jasmine). He never approaches the main performer — it is fellow audience members or perhaps a young organiser or volunteer he gifts the perfume to.

Some months ago, I had an eight-year-old sitting with me — it was the first time she had asked to come along and promised to sit quietly through it, which she did. The man in the audience had spotted her, and when the performance ended, as we filed down the rickety stairs of the old hall, he gave her the bottle, much to her surprise and shy joy. He told us that it was heart-warming to see someone so young sit still and pay attention to classical vocal music.

He turns up here and there, this unobtrusive gent, and the last time I saw him, he was handing over another such tiny vial to a teenager. This time he was dispensing gilahi-mitti (petrichor). The youngster had caught his attention, not just for attending, but for sitting on the floor cross-legged and not opting for the chair, he said, and for not once checking his mobile phone throughout the performance.

After spotting him yet another time, offering his little gift to a volunteer among the organisers, I had to speak to him.

Gone with the rain

No, he was not a perfumer. He was a retired person, is all he said. No pontificating about ‘our musical heritage’ and ‘encouraging young listeners’ and such. He just smiled awkwardly, when I tried to joke with him about what would qualify me to receive one of his attar bottles. And then he said, with the slightest of smiles: “Giving attar to ladies can be misread, so you will not qualify.” He mentioned the name of the small perfume shop from where he gets these taufas (presents) — since I had shown particular interest in the wet-earth perfume. And then he was gone, throwing open his umbrella and vanishing into the unseasonal rain. Will I ask him his name the next time I encounter him? Probably not. The anonymity of his gesture is part of its charm.

The second category of audience member who is mention-worthy is the sleeping child. No, not babies who may wake up and wail. These are children aged between 6 and 10 or so, who come to classical Indian music programmes. Many a time, they sit still, listening, but then the sheer mesmeric drone of the tanpura, and perhaps the abstract nature of the music, makes them sleepy and they begin to doze. If it is night time, sometimes they will simply fold up, and the adult they are with will let them lie down in a sort of foetal position next to them.

At one time, I would anxiously wonder if this would be construed as insulting or would be a little disconcerting to the performer. However, in recent times, I have met a musician or two who have said that they are not at all affronted by a sleeping child in their audience. The fact that your music put someone to sleep is not in any way indicative that it is boring. Soothing is more like it. That the notes wash over a child, bypassing his or her cognitive centres and entering the soul, is a most rewarding feeling, they say. Many of us have had the fortune to experience that in childhood — the notes settling on us like a soft blanket.

295,2020/02/15,Padmanabhan differs with storytelling that reveals it all,"‘Those who divulge everything through writing are actually out to mint money’

Short fiction writer T. Padmanabhan on Friday made it clear that he does not agree with the style of storytelling that reveals everything.

Talking about his life and writing at the ongoing Krithi International Book Festival at Marine Drive, he said several stories had left him feeling as if he had taken a blow on his head. “Those who say they don’t see writing as a means of making money, but are just revealing everything through their writing are actually out to mint money. Publishers queue up before these writers. I’m ashamed of talking about some stories. They are that distasteful,” Mr. Padmanabhan said.

He said he had not written a single line that could be called obscene. Love was always a theme for a writer. But he always tried to keep it without losing its warmth. Mr. Padmanabhan also registered his strong disagreement with Valentine’s Day being observed by the youth. “It’s the new media that has created such days. The day is a product of the new tendency to commercialise everything. But I don’t question the sincerity of purpose of observing the day,” he said. As a writer, he never made friends based on the colour of their flags, he added.

Writer N.S. Madhavan said whenever democracy suffered setbacks globally, at the hands of fascism, artists and art had gone silent. Just a poet got arrested in Kerala during the Emergency. Stories and poetry were weak. “For it to have some impact on people, something should be done when fascism is imminent. Once it has arrived, art and literature cannot do anything,” he said.

Novelist M. Mukundan said it was not easy to write when attempts were being made to eliminate those who produced literature of resistance.

Meanwhile, writer Vaisakhan, who is also president of the Kerala Sahithya Akademi, said India had never seen democracy. “What has happened here is a mimicry of democracy. While there’s a global tendency to tilt towards right wing politics, it’s been delayed in India thanks to Jawaharlal Nehru,” he said.

Krithi crosses milestone

Krithi has crossed a milestone with books worth ₹1.27 crore sold to school students in the nine days of the event. With two more days to go, the target would be to reach ₹1.5 crore in this category.

The biographies of V.K. Krishna Menon, V.P. Menon, and the Hortus Malabaricus have takers at the fest.

Former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh has written the book on former Defence Minister Krishna Menon, while great granddaughter Narayani Basu has written on former civil servant V.P. Menon, who played a key role in India’s political integration.

The book on V.P. Menon has generated much interest nationally with Eeternal Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar locking horns with historian Ramachandra Guha and Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Shashi Tharoor over its content. Nehru had described Patel as the “strongest pillar” of his cabinet, they pointed out, citing his letters, to repudiate Mr. Jaishankar’s argument that Nehru had thought of leaving out Patel from his Cabinet.

CM to open session

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate a session on the challenges faced by Indian democracy at the Krithi International Book Festival at 3 p.m. on Saturday. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran will preside over the function, and writers Sunil P.

297,2020/02/15,Living conditions of migrants to undergo major makeover,"Primary health care to be made accessible to workers

Aiming for a major makeover of the living conditions of migrant labourers who are here to stay, the district administration in association with the Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KELSA) and Health and Labour departments has embarked on a mission that is likely to change the outlook of the workforce.

Migrants form the majority of workforce at construction sites, restaurants, street food joints, and tailoring centres. They are also employed in the domestic help sector.

The Health Department is in the process of effecting comprehensive changes to rules to make primary healthcare (PHC) facilities accessible to workers from the unorganised sector.

Migrant workers are part of the State’s population, and it is important that their basic health standards get a boost, said Akhil Xavier Manuel, District Migrant Nodal Medical Officer, National Health Mission. Interventions are made at three levels—screening, improving migrants’ living conditions, and naming of migrant link workers.

A major hurdle faced by migrant workers is communication barrier.

Hence, migrant link workers, to be named under an incentive-based scheme, will connect the labourers to service providers in health, education and social service sectors.

Medical camps

The Health Department has been conducting medical camps for the migrant population for over a year now, and the workers are screened for dengue, malaria, TB, hepatitis, VDRL, leprosy, and HIV. Filariasis will be added to the list of diseases to be screened.

Several migrants suffer from dermatitis because of the appalling living conditions, while some face occupational hazards like vertigo, owing to sound pollution in industries like rice mill. Data on problems facing migrants is being prepared, and it will cover their immunisation status too, said Dr. Xavier. The screening of 20,000 workers has already been completed.

Preliminary inspections will be conducted at the PHC level with the help of Health, Local Self Government and Labour departments. Living quarters will be graded in accordance with the facilities available.

Owners of buildings where migrants are accommodated will be told to provide better facilities.

The district team led by the nodal officer, two junior health inspectors, and a co-ordinator will conduct monthly inspections, Dr. Xavier said.

Institutions like the World Health Organisation have acknowledged the programme, Dr. Xavier added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/living-conditions-of-migrants-to-undergo-major-makeover/article30825077.ece
298,2020/02/15,Fate of 178 families living close to Konthuruthy Canal uncertain,"Corporation, district administration clueless about their rehabilitation

The Kochi Corporation and the district administration remain clueless about the rehabilitation of 178 families living on the banks of Konthuruthy Canal.

Sources at the district administration said that their houses were likely to be razed within 90 days. “Temporary arrangements will have to be made by the Corporation, while an apartment complex can be built for rehabilitated families,” they said. The district administration remains unsure about where the temporary arrangements would be made or the flat built, along with who would foot the expenses.

Of the 178 families, 42 with possession records for their land had been included in the list of beneficiaries under the LIFE mission’s housing scheme, a revenue official said.

“The possession record only allows the residents to live temporarily on poromboke land and seek electricity and water connections. Title deeds could later be issued based on possession records, but with this case going to court, it is unlikely that even those with the records can ever be given title deeds,” the official said.

The river was originally 650-m long and 48-m wide, the revenue official said.

“The canal, where it meets the Thevara-Perandoor canal near Konthuruthy, is only around three-metre wide now,” said Elizabeth Teacher, councillor representing Thevara. “A local resident had filed a petition in 2012 seeking the removal of encroachments and the restoration of the canal to its original width. But the Corporation has not taken the issue seriously,” she said.

Based on a High Court directive from November last year, the Corporation had submitted an action plan before the court, which involved maintaining a canal width of 16 m rather than 48 m, a move that could salvage a few houses.

The action plan also suggested tearing down a section of Konthuruthy Road that was built over the canal and constructing a bridge in its place to allow for the flow of water.

The Corporation was waiting for the court’s final order in the matter to take a decision, Mayor Soumini Jain said last week at the council meeting .

“The State government’s assistance would be required for rehabilitation since the Corporation does not have sufficient land and acquisition is expensive. The construction of a flat could be considered,” she said.

“A rehabilitation package is necessary before the families are evicted, since residents are wary of a Moolampilly-like situation where they might have to wait for years for a home,” said C.K. Peter, councillor from Konthuruthy.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/p5iyvf/article30824998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15-KI-KONTHURUTHY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fate-of-178-families-living-close-to-konthuruthy-canal-uncertain/article30824999.ece
299,2020/02/15,Fear of sudden eviction rattles Konthuruthy residents,"Thankamma Sankara, nearly 80 years old, is worried that she will have to move home and hearth, 43 years after she raised a small house on the banks of the Konthuruthy Canal.

She was among the first to move to the area with her three children after her husband’s death, desperate for a roof over their head.

“Ours may have been the third house here. The others jumped into the water after us,” she said, pointing out that the land where their houses now stood had once been water.

Thankamma’s family, along with over 170 others, is likely to be evicted from the area around the Konthuruthy Canal to widen it to its original width of 48 m.

While officials at the district administration and the Corporation see the widening of the waterbody as the panacea for the city’s persistent waterlogging problems, residents fear a sudden and quick eviction could leave them by the wayside.

“The district administration had informed us that the canal will be widened before the monsoon sets in. But where will we move to?” asked Mintu T. A., a teacher who lives in the area. She pegged the number of people who would have to move at nearly 900.

Demanding a rehabilitation package if they must be evicted, residents have been protesting since February 1 – a step that has proved costly for the group mostly comprising daily wage workers.

“If the authorities relented a little and allowed the width to be increased by a few metres rather than sticking to the original 48 m, most of us would still be able to live here,” said Byju V.S., who works as a painter. With an ailing father who requires regular treatment, Mr. Byju is worried about being put up temporarily in a hotel while permanent rehabilitation measures are worked out.

Mary Charlie, who along with her husband, was asked to move for the widening of the Thevara-Perandoor canal nearby over 10 years ago, stands with the protesters.

“We were more than 30 families back then. For years, we were put up in a hotel near the north railway station, after which 12 of us were allotted flats and the rest were given a sum of ₹5 lakh.

300,2020/02/15,Vahan to put the brakes on reckless driving by youth,"MVD to make available details of traffic offences online under RTI Act

Youngsters caught for reckless and helmetless driving have something to worry about.

The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), Ernakulam, will soon start uploading their offences on the web-based Vahan software, which has automated various operations under the Regional Transport Office.

“A prospective employer who wish to ascertain whether his candidate is free of any motor vehicle offences can write to us seeking details. We can collect the details by logging on to the Vahan software without much hassles. The offence will remain online forever,” MVD officials said.

Unlike the previous manual system where such an exercise was a laborious process, the web-based platform offers instant information.

“You can seek the details under the provisions of the Right to Information Act. It will have information on accidents involving motor vehicles and actions taken, including suspension and termination of licence, under motor vehicles rules,” said officials.

The Motor Vehicles Department hopes that the availability of data online will act as a deterrent against the increasing cases of motor vehicle rule violations involving youth. They should realise that repeated offences will remain like a black mark on the Vahan software.

301,2020/02/15,‘Third eye’ wakes up from slumber,"The ‘Third Eye’ is open again after remaining in sleep mode for sometime.

The Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), Ernakulam, has registered 12 cases in the past two weeks under the project after offenders were caught on camera.

The project involves using mobile phones to click photographs of motorists flouting traffic rules.

The project had hit a roadblock after facing technical hurdles. Officials of the department were finding it difficult to open the photographs sent through WhatsApp on their office computers. With the government stating that the project will be revived, MVD officials have now started keeping their camera eyes open to nab violators.

“We are now focussing on school and college campuses in the city. The cases registered include offences under reckless and helmetless driving, triple riding, and modification of bikes in violation of rules,” said K. Manoj, Joint RTO, Ernakulam.

MVD officials in mufti and uniform are involved in clicking photographs of traffic offenders. They also get the support of autorickshaw drivers and residents near educational institutions.

Youths riding super bikes without holding on to handlebar and riding in zig-zag manner were caught on camera. Action was taken against those found overtaking through the left side.

The ‘Third Eye’ had helped reduce traffic violations considerably when it was launched. The MVD had encouraged the public to join the project. However, the initial enthusiasm had waned after officials of the department faced technical problems, besides facing staff shortage to take follow-up action.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/third-eye-wakes-up-from-slumber/article30824960.ece
302,2020/02/15,"Clear all projects of Operation Breakthrough, orders HC","High-Level Monitoring Committee to meet today

Administrative sanction for all the works planned under Operation Breakthrough for clearing waterlogging in the city should be given immediately, ordered the Kerala High Court. Of the 211 works envisioned under the project, permission was issued to just 33, it was submitted in the court.

It was on a writ petition seeking directions to restore the water flow in Thevara-Perandoor canal and to free the city of waterlogging that the court issued the order.

The High-Level Monitoring Committee formed for the purpose should meet within two days and take stock of the situation, the court directed when the petitioners pointed out that the committee had not met since its formation.

The court said that it would monitor the progress of the work on a daily basis.

The city could not be freed of waterlogging unless the culvert that ran through the holding of the railway was cleared. The railways needed to be involved in the project. All the projects should be completed for making the city free of waterlogging, the court said.

The case will be considered on February 19 again.

Meanwhile, a communication issued by the District Collector said a meeting of the Committee would be held on Saturday at the office of Kochi Metro Rail Limited at 5 p.m. Chief Secretary Tom Jose will preside.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/clear-all-projects-of-operation-breakthrough-orders-hc/article30824951.ece
303,2020/02/15,Clash: law college to be closed till Feb. 24,"Valentine’s Day celebrations in Ernakulam college turn violent; students injured

The Government Law College, Ernakulam, will remain closed till February 24 following a clash between Students Federation of India (SFI) and Kerala Students Union (KSU) activists on the campus allegedly over Valentine’s Day celebrations on Friday.

The organisations blamed each other for the melee while students from both sides were admitted to hospitals claiming to have been injured in the clash.

Both the organisations lodged petitions with the Central police.

Arjun Babu, area secretary, SFI, accused KSU activists of ‘provocations’ to sabotage the cultural programme organised by the SFI-led union on the campus for Valentine’s Day.

“The programme was under way when KSU activists turned up with an ‘eating competition’ at the same time. The event was being organised in a small space outside the Principal’s room and there was no room for simultaneous programmes. Though this led to some heated exchanges, the issue was resolved and they backed out,” he said.

However, Mr. Babu alleged, unruly Youth Congress activists from outside entered the campus and beat up SFI members following which a union councillor suffered head injury and the nature club secretary ended up with broken nose and hand. “Three of our activists were admitted to hospital,” he said.

K.M. Anas, district general secretary, KSU, said it was the SFI activists who beat up their members.

“We had organised the eating competition to remember the martyrs of Pulwama terrorist attack after the programme organised by the SFI. But then SFI created a ruckus stating that only one programme needed to be held. Five of our activists are in hospital,” he said.

However, Mr. Babu said the martyrs remembrance programme was never held as the clash had broken out by then.

Inquiry committee

College Principal T.G. Ajitha said that an internal inquiry committee had been constituted to probe the incident and that action would be taken based on its findings. “The fracas was over a non-issue reportedly in connection with the Valentine’s Day. Initially, there was a skirmish, which was resolved after faculty members, including me, promptly intervened. By the time we knew about the second incident, it was all over,” she said.

Prof. Ajitha said that though there were reports of outsiders entering the campus, she was not aware about the specifics.

The Central police said that cases would be registered against both the parties.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/clash-law-college-to-be-closed-till-feb-24/article30824946.ece

306,2020/02/15,Local body plans to woo sand mining workers to operate river trips,"Many workers are struggling to find jobs with restrictions imposed on mining

The district panchayat’s decision to enlist the participation of sand mining workers and their families in its upcoming river tourism promotion projects has kindled fresh hopes among hundreds of jobless labourers. Many of them have been struggling to find alternative jobs with the restrictions imposed on river sand mining by the local bodies in view of environmental issues.

The plan of the district panchayat is to encourage the entry of such workers into the domestic tourism sector and explore the scope of operating sightseeing trips using their boats through the Chaliyar and Iruvazhinji rivers. Many boats earlier used for sand collection now remain idle on the river banks, which can be used for tourism purpose after getting approval from the government departments concerned.

There is also a proposal to use the houses of interested labourers as homestays for tourists. Many of such houses have amazing views of the river and are set amid scenic surroundings, which will attract national or international sightseers.

As of now, only a few private entrepreneurs are exploring the scope of such homestay services along the rivers.

District panchayat president Babu Parassery, who recently conducted a boat trip along with other panchayat members for assessing the development potential, said that about 20-km distance of the Chaliyar and Iruvazhinji rivers could be explored for tourism purposes if the sand mining labourers were willing to cooperate with the proposal. They could even serve homemade delicacies to tourists as a means of generating additional revenue along with the boat trips, he added.

According to Mr. Babu, the local bodies, Tourism Department and local investors could do a lot to support the project in their own way and come up with more attractive ventures. It could even be linked to other eco-tourism projects in Kozhikode district and generate good income for local entrepreneurs, he added.

The entry of sand mining labourers to the tourism sector is also expected to create a safer environment for those who wish to go for river trips. The labourers have several years of experience in manoeuvring boats and are well aware of risky stretches in the river. They are also experts in rescue operations.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/local-body-plans-to-woo-sand-mining-workers-to-operate-river-trips/article30831849.ece
307,2020/02/15,Shelter for transwomen yet to be full-fledged,"Six of seven staff positions lying vacant

The short stay home for transwomen that opened in Kozhikode two months ago is yet to get its full staff strength even as the accommodation has been popular among transwomen who come to the city.

‘Snehakkoodu’, the home set up by the Department of Social Justice at Kovoor, can house around 25 people at a time and has seven staff positions including those of a manager, two caretakers, a counsellor, a security guard, cook and cleaner. However, six staff members are yet to assume charge.

The home is run by the Punarjani Cultural Society, a community-based organisation that has been entrusted with the day-to-day activities of the home by the Department. Sisily George, the president of the society and the manager of the home, said the Department had not been cooperative.

“The officials of the department have delayed the appointment of the staff. We had to schedule an interview thrice. Once the candidates werer selected, the officials were reluctant to forward it to the Social Justice Directorate for approval,” she said.

With at least four or five transwomen staying at the home on a daily basis and the count exceeding twenty at times, Ms. George said she had been struggling to manage the home single-handedly.

Social Justice Officer Sheeba Mumtaz, however, said approval from the Directorate was being awaited. “The final interview was held on February 6. We have forwarded the list to the directorate. It will be approved in a week or two,” she said.

Fund allotment

Ms. Sisily said the State government had sanctioned ₹25 lakh for the home. The Society had received ₹5 lakh as advance payment to set it up. With no sign of the remaining fund being allotted, the Society was unable to pay the rent of the building, which amounted to ₹40,000 per month, she added.

The home was set up to shelter transwomen who were facing a crisis or recuperating after sex re-assignment surgery.

308,2020/02/15,Caution urged as mercury levels rise,"Health staff on alert against sunstroke

The Health and Labour Departments in Kozhikode district have issued guidelines to address the possibility of sunstroke and other complications against the backdrop of rising day temperatures in the past few days.

According to weather scientists, the maximum temperature in at least some districts in the State is three degree Celsius above normal and this could lead to health issues if those venturing out into the open do not take precautions. The maximum temperature recorded in Kozhikode city on Saturday was 34.8 degrees Celsius, 2.2 above normal, and the minimum temperature was 25.4 degrees Celsius, 1.5 above normal.

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said public health staff had been directed to be on alert against sunstroke cases. Anyone affected by sunstroke has been asked to seek immediate medical help.

“They should be given enough water to avoid dehydration and taken away from direct exposure to sunlight. Treatment should be provided if there are burns,” she added.

With model exams going on in government and aided schools and the board exams under the Central Board of Secondary Education beginning on Saturday, school authorities too are learnt to be on alert. However, Education Department sources said they were yet to get any official direction.

Working hours

Meanwhile, the Labour Department has rescheduled working hours for labourers till April 30. Kozhikode District Labour Officer (Enforcement) P.P. Santhosh Kumar said in a release that those who work in day shifts need to take a break between 12 p.m. and 3 p.m. Their work timings have been fixed for eight hours between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. This is under Rules 24 and 25 of the Kerala Minimum Wages Rules.

309,2020/02/15,Focus on traffic safety lessons for students,"Seminar organised by MVD calls for better road sense and training of youngsters

A seminar on road sense organised by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) here on Saturday stressed the need to incorporate basic traffic safety lessons in school curriculum and to train students in healthy road habits as it would help mitigate road accident rates.

M.K. Raghavan, MP, who opened the seminar, said the biggest threat to road safety in Kerala was the wrong attitude of some drivers who paid little attention to the safety of fellow riders. “The MVD should take initiatives and hold discussions with the State government to make traffic literacy a compulsory part of the syllabus,” he said.

Mr. Raghavan, who narrated the experience of witnessing a road accident recently, said the culture of escaping from the accident spot for evading penal action should come to an end through better awareness programmes.

“How to act properly and save victims at the time of accidents should be part of driving tests and the licence should be granted only to such individuals,” he said.

Writer Subhash Chandran, who delivered the keynote address, said road culture would witness an improvement only with the emergence of a sensible crowd.

More people are being excluded from home quarantine for suspected novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Kozhikode district, even as the Health Department is likely to be on alert for at least another month. There is a drop in the number of those being put under observation as well.

Until Saturday, 183 people were removed from the list of people under observation after they completed 28 days in surveillance of the Health Department. As many as 154 were excluded on Thursday, 11 on Friday and 18 on Saturday. Only three were added on Thursday, one on Friday and two on Saturday. Two persons undergoing treatment at the isolation ward attached to the Government General Hospital were discharged on Saturday. One more person was admitted there as well. Right now only two persons are undergoing treatment at the isolation wards – one at the general hospital and another at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

District Medical Officer V. Jayasree said that if those removed from the home quarantine develop any other symptoms, they would have to approach the health activists.

315,2020/02/15,Parallel taxi service: bus operators complain of loss,"Police, MVD squads accused of not taking serious action

Despite intensified action by the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) squad and the police, illegal service by local taxi operators on bus routes has resurfaced as a major concern for private bus operators in the rural areas of Kozhikode district. The indefinite strike recently called by a section of bus operators on the Vadakara-Thottilpalam route too has made little impact as the taxi operators seem reluctant to comply with the rules.

Bus operators in the Kozhikode rural area say their daily collection is on the decline and the police and MVD squads are yet to take serious action. Many a time, illegal taxi trips have provoked bus crew and led to street scuffles in many locations, they point out.

According to the Bus Operators Association leaders in Vadakara, private taxi cab owners are operating the illegal trips in the suburbs of Vadakara, Kuttiyadi and Nadapuram, claiming that it helps stranded passengers in rural areas. In reality, the taxi operators conduct trips during peak hours and cause huge loss to bus operators, they allege.

E. Babu, a leader of the Bus Employees Union, says there were even attempts to label such parallel trips as private journeys operated on request from passengers’ groups. “Such baseless claims are made to escape legal action and fight bus operators by mobilising local support,” he adds.

Some trade union leaders have also come up against the parallel service operators by accusing them of charging exorbitant rates from passengers. As of now, there is no effective checking mechanism to stop exploitation in the sector, they say.

Meanwhile, the Vadakara police say the complaints recently made by a section of bus operators in the area have been taken seriously and patrol squads deployed to keep an eye on such illegal trip operators. The permit of such taxi operators will be recommended for immediate suspension, they add.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/parallel-taxi-service-bus-operators-complain-of-loss/article30825207.ece

317,2020/02/15,Tenders invited for sewerage system work in Kozhikode,"Project in two zones under Centre’s Amrut scheme

After several delays, the Kozhikode Corporation has finally set in motion the process for the construction of a sewerage system at two zones in the city under the Centre’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Rural Transformation (Amrut) project.

The civic body has called for competitive tenders for the pending project, involving ₹59.76 crore for Zone A and ₹56.37 crore for Zone B in the city. The tendering of the sewerage component has been hanging fire despite the Centre and the State governments sanctioning funds for the project more than a year ago. A total of ₹116.50 crore has been allotted for the sewerage component.

The tenders will be closed by March 16, enabling the civic body to complete the tendering process this fiscal. With this, the procedures for 50 projects under five components (water supply, storm water drainage, urban transport, parks and sewerage) of Amrut would have either been initiated or completed.

The reasons for the delay were many. Awarding the Kozhikode-based Ram Biologicals the contract for preparing a detailed project report for a sewage treatment plant (STP) at the Government Medical College Hospital had resulted in a controversy. Tenders for the construction of the STP at the medical college with septage treatment (1 MLD and 2 MLD plants) were opened last August with four participants getting qualified. The financial bid was opened later, but none qualified.

Likewise, no bids were received for the construction of sewerage system in Zone A, Package B (7 MLD sewage treatment plant) and construction of sewerage system in Zone A, Package A (6 MLD sewage treatment plant).

Nine projects completed

As of February 14, only nine projects have been completed, all in the category of water supply. The completed works included replacing old pipes, valves and interconnecting them with existing lines in two phases, executed under the Kerala Water Authority.

The contribution of the Kozhikode Corporation is 20% while the State government shares 30%. The Centre contributes the remaining funds.

Administrative sanction was accorded for ₹284.64 crore for all five components, though initially the cost for all 50 projects was pegged at ₹274.76 crore.

The cost escalation of nearly ₹10 crore was on account on implementing projects under the sewerage component.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/b0cj6d/article30825169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14KIDRAINAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/tenders-invited-for-sewerage-system-work-in-kozhikode/article30825170.ece

“It is important to also work towards the growth of others around us while we are blossoming. When we get power, it is important to uncover and discover ourselves,” she said.

She added that a woman’s dynamism is the presence of an articulate internal working intelligence.

WE members from Salem, Chennai, Coimbatore, Tirunelveli, Madurai and Erode enjoyed speeches, award ceremonies, music performances and a stand-up comedy show by Alexander Babu, a comedian.

324,2020/02/15,"In Madurai, volunteers read textbooks to visually impaired students","The reading sessions were part of a ‘Read Fest’ organised by an NGO, Lit the Light

For M. Shankar Pranav, a software engineer, a day spent at the Indian Association for the Blind (IAB) in Sundarajanpatti on Saturday was different from his usual weekend routine. Mr. Pranav, along with other volunteers read out portions of textbooks to 120 visually challenged students as part of the ‘Read Fest 2020’ organised by Chennai-based Lit the Light, a non-governmental organisation.

The Read Fest, which was organised for the first time in Madurai, was an event where the students had a one-to-one reading session with the volunteers.

Founder of Lit the Light S.N. Barath said that visually impaired students usually study in Braille until class 8. Later, they would require the help of others to read and write during examinations. “However, there is usually a shortage in the number of volunteers. Sometimes, a well-prepared student would not be able to write the examination due to the absence of a scribe,” he said. “By sparing a few hours every week, one can help in creating drastic differences in the lives of the visually impaired,” he said.

Speaking during the session, District Employment Officer V. Senthilnathan, said that volunteering at the right moment will help the visually impaired to a great extent.

The response to the event on Saturday was overwhelming, said the co-Founder of Lit the Light, C. Ramkumar. “While we had initially expected around 150 volunteers, more than 180 participated in the session. The additional volunteers were used for recording audio books which will be later used by the visually impaired students,” he said.

M. Durga Priyadarshini, a student from Lady Doak College said that she had always wanted to help, but did not know how to. “By reading out to the visually impaired students, I got a chance to understand their needs. Also, it was an opportunity to make new friends,” she said.

M. Sneha, a Class 10 visually impaired student, said that a volunteer is always the best option during preparation for examinations. “When we listen to audio books, there is no scope to clarify out doubts. But, a volunteer will help in better understanding of concepts,” she said.

The organisers also announced that regular reading sessions will be held in Madurai at different venues.

325,2020/02/15,Bicycle track planned on Udupi-Manipal Road,"‘Intention is to develop it from Kadiyali to MIT Junction’

The district administration is planning to develop a 5km bicycle track on the Udupi-Manipal stretch of National Highway 169A here.

Presently, the work on the widening (four-laning) of this stretch is on. The construction of drains on either shoulders of this highway road is under progress.

As per the initial discussions on this matter held about a couple of months ago, the plan is to develop the track between the drainage (on which the footpath will be constructed) and the end of the road by installing interlocking tiles. “The intention is to develop the cycle track from Kadiyali to MIT Junction,” B. Sadashiva Prabhu, Additional Deputy Commissioner, said.

To develop this track, the administration is hinging its bets on Udupi being included under the ‘Smart City’ project. Even if Udupi is not included under it, the administration plans to arrange for funds from other schemes.

“The bicycle track project is still in its preliminary stages. It will take at least a couple of months for the construction of drains and installation of interlocking tiles on the shoulders of the stretch to be completed after which the project can be given a final shape,” he said.

An officer in the National Highways Division of Public Works Department, which is implementing the widening work of NH 169A, said that there was no provision for the track in the original plan.

“As the width of the shoulder by side of highway varies from two metres to seven metres on the stretch, the administration can develop a bicycle track on it,” he said.

The intention behind the proposed bicycle track is to encourage people to take up cycling. “It is an eco-friendly move and will save fossil fuel. It will motivate people to take up cycling. But the authorities should ensure that there are no obstacles on the bicycle track,” said Balakrishna Madodi, environmentalist and professor at Manipal Institute of Technology.

P.V. Bhandary, psychiatrist, said that it was a good initiative and the administration should pursue it rigourously. “If a good cycle track is developed, students will definitely take to it. Cycling has health benefits also. But the track should be safe enough to cycle,” he added.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ln1dss/article30831231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BG-CYCLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bicycle-track-planned-on-udupi-manipal-road/article30831232.ece
326,2020/02/15,Glory of govt. schools will be brought back: Suresh Kumar,"‘This will help middle-class and lower middle-class students get quality education’

Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar said on Saturday that the government is making all efforts to bring back the lost glory of government schools in the State.

Speaking to reporters at Harekala on the outskirts of the city, where he visited the government school promoted by Padma Shri Harekala Hajabba, Mr. Suresh Kumar said that if the government schools are empowered, students of middle-class and lower middle-class families would get quality education.

The Minister said that now even a daily wager sends his or her children to private schools to get quality education. It would take away about 40% of the family earnings to foot the high cost of education in private schools, he said.

The government will announce certain steps in the State Budget to strengthen the quality of education. It should help the middle-class and lower middle-class sections and also restore the glory of government schools.

He said that about 24,000 school teachers will retire in the State in the next three years. Hence the government has begun the process of recruiting 10,650 teachers now. In addition, about 10,000 teachers will be recruited next year.

The Minister said that the government will make all arrangements to help students with disabilities to write the Class 10 examination this year. Those who have writing disability will be provided with helpers and such students will be given more time to answer the questions. A teacher at the government school in Harekala said that it recorded 92% pass percentage in the 2019 SSLC examination. One of its students, Rahin Toushia, of the same batch who scored 95%, stood third in Mangaluru taluk. This year 23 students, with 10 boys and remaining girls, will appear for the SSLC examination.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/y4k44w/article30831221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BG-SURESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/glory-of-govt-schools-will-be-brought-back-suresh-kumar/article30831222.ece

328,2020/02/15,Annual Chinnara Santharpanescheme inaugurated,"Meal scheme covers aided and unaided schools

K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA, said on Friday that the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple was rendering social service by providing midday meals and uniforms to students in aided and unaided schools in Udupi district.

He was speaking after inaugurating the annual Chinnara Santharpane midday meal scheme of the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple at Rajangana here.

Mr. Bhat said that the Chinnara Santharpane midday meal scheme was launched by Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Palimar Mutt during his previous Paryaya period (2002-04) for schools in the district and it had been continued by the seers of the Ashta Mutts during their Paryaya periods for the last 16 years.

This midday meal programme had impressed the then Chief Minister S.M. Krishna so much that he launched the Akshara Dasoha midday meal scheme for government schools in the State based on the Chinnara Santharpane scheme.

Since the government schools were covered by the Akshara Dasoha scheme, the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple started providing the necessary foodgrains and other material for the midday meals for aided and unaided schools in the district. This scheme was most beneficial to students in rural areas of the district, he said.

Mr. Bhat said that Vishwapriya Tirtha Swami of Admar Mutt during his second Paryaya (2004-06) had got toilets constructed for schools in rural areas. He had also helped several poor patients by providing them with financial aid.

The Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple was also helping in training about 1,500 interested students in the art form of Yakshagana in schools through the Yaksha Shikshana Trust. This helped these students to appreciate and understand the nuances of the art form.

“All these programmes go to show the social service which the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple is rendering without resorting to publicity,” Mr. Bhat said.

Ishapriya Tirtha Swami, junior seer of Paryaya Admar Mutt, who presided over the programme, said that it was essential that students got quality meals as it would help them concentrate on their studies.

With poor response to the online “Ease of Living Index 2019 Mangaluru Citizens Perception Survey”, which was launched on February 1, Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) and Mangaluru City Corporation on Friday appealed to citizens to give their feedback in large numbers.

Addressing a joint press conference, Mohammed Nazir, Managing Director, MSCL, and Shanady Ajith Kumar Hegde, Commissioner, city corporation, said that the city’s population stood at 5.50 lakh.

Of this, only 2,200 persons have given their feedback by participating in the survey hosted by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. The last date for giving feedback, available only online, is February 29. People should log on to http://eol2019.org/citizen- feedback to answer 24 questions.

Mr. Hegde said that it would not take more than 10 minutes to give feedback as there are multiple choices to answer. The literacy rate is the highest in Mangaluru. Hence, citizens should speak up.

Mr. Nazir said that the corporation and MSCL expects at least 10,000 people to participate in the survey. Answering identified questions online would help the city improve its ranking in the “Ease of Living” index.

Some of the questions cover affordability of education, quality of healthcare, affordability of house rent, cleanliness of the city, water-logging, safe commuting, city as a safe and secure place to live in, emergency services, drinking water supply and safety of women in public places.

He said that the survey would also help the city administration move towards outcome-based planning from the present input-based approach.

With this, the Ministry has sought to facilitate smart cities and other million-plus population cities in assessment of outcomes that would lead to better planning and management. Besides the online survey, residents can participate in the survey through social media — on Facebook (@SmartCitiesMission) and Twitter (@easeofliving2019), he said.

Industries going for artificial intelligence will take away employment from thousands of people, journalist P. Sainath said here on Friday.

Major companies were laying off employees just to create more profits for the investors, he said.

Mr. Sainath was speaking on ‘Indian democracy at the post liberalisation and post truth era’ on the inaugural day of two-day ‘Media Manthan 2020’, an inter-collegiate media festival organised by the Postgraduate Department of Journalism and Mass Communication at St. Aloysius College. He said that the agrarian crisis was no longer about the loss of productivity, employment or about farmer suicides. It was a societal crisis.

Ban on cow slaughter

Commenting on the lopsided policies such as ban on cow slaughter, he explained how cow slaughter ban had adversely affected many industries owing to their inter-dependency.

“While Muslims who slaughtered cows were rendered helpless, the cattle traders who are mostly from other backward castes lost their earnings as the cattle prices crashed. An important industry like the Kolhapur sandals industry in Maharashtra went bankrupt as a result of the cow slaughter ban in Maharashtra. The policy makers had no idea how the rural industries are interconnected,” he said.

Mr. Sainath said that the many policies adopted in the 90s led to India becoming unusually unequal.

Referring to the speech Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had made at the Constituent Assembly while handing over the draft of the Constitution, Mr Sainath said: “Ambedkar had warned about the weakness of Indian democracy that liberty without equality allows the supremacy of a few over the multitude. Liberty, equality, and fraternity must be kept together as we cannot have one without the other.”

He said that the country is facing crisis in many areas like agriculture, education, economy and job creation.

334,2020/02/15,‘BJP taking the country towards anarchy’,"He demands immediate sacking of Minister for Forest, Environment and Ecology Anand Singh

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson V.S. Ugrappa on Friday charged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with taking the country towards anarchy through its whimsical style of administration in scant disregard for the Constitution.

Citing the example of allocating the Forest, Ecology and Environment portfolio to Anand Singh, Mr. Ugrappa told reporters here that the BJP, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, and State president Nalin Kumar Kateel owe an explanation to Karnataka, but unfortunately both have little knowledge of the Constitution.

A person accused of committing forest offences being made the Minister of the very same department was unheard of, Mr. Ugrappa said, and demanded Mr. Singh’s immediate removal.

Training his guns against the Union government, Mr. Ugrappa said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, instead of exhibiting statesmanship is behaving like a petty politician. He is “Aadhunika Bhasmasura,” Mr. Ugrappa said.

He regretted the BJP was taking Pakistan’s name for every now and then. If the government was ready to reclaim Pakistan occupied Kashmir, the Congress would support the government.

Having failed to bring back black money allegedly stashed in Switzerland, and failing to curb corruption and terrorism and create jobs, the party resorted to the abrogation of Article 370, triple talaq abolition, Ram Janmabhoomi, and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Mr. Ugrappa said.

He noted Article 5 to 10 of the Constitution speak about citizenship while Article 11 provides for legislation to offer citizenship by the Parliament. The Act was amended six times, including 2019. Any amendment should be in conformity with Article 14, equality before law. No country in the world has provision to offer citizenship on the grounds of religion, he said.

On a SC verdict on reservation in promotions, Mr. Ugrappa said the government, if necessary, should bring an amendment to the Constitution to ensure reservation in appointment and promotion to SCs and STs. Otherwise, Congress would launch nationwide peaceful agitation, he warned.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/qm43r4/article30824743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGUGRAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bjp-taking-the-country-towards-anarchy/article30824744.ece

336,2020/02/15,"Credit growth momentum picking up; no possible spike in inflation, says Shaktikanta Das","The meeting, which was also addressed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, discussed various Budget proposals.

Amid concerns over economic slowdown, RBI chief Shaktikanta Das on Saturday said credit growth momentum is picking up and ruled out any possible spike in inflation due to Budget proposals as the government is maintaining “fiscal prudence”.

After the first meeting of the RBI board post 2020-21 Budget presentation, Mr. Das also expressed hope that transmission of rate cuts would improve further.

The meeting, which was also addressed by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, discussed various Budget proposals.

“The direct inflationary impact of any budget is fiscal deficit number, when borrowing goes up, but the government has adhered to the principle of fiscal prudence.

“The ‘escape clause’ under FRBM Act, the deficit number in the current year as well as the next year are very much within the parameters set as per FRBM committee recommendations,” Mr. Das said.

Facing revenue shortage, the government raised the fiscal deficit target to 3.8% of the GDP for 2019-20 in the budget, from the 3.3% pegged earlier.

The government has utilised ‘escape clause’ under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, which allows the Centre to breach its fiscal deficit target by 0.5 percentage points at times of severe stress in the economy.

Meanwhile, the finance minister said the government is monitoring farm credit given by banks in rural areas, adding that she expects to meet the increased target of ₹15 lakh crore for the next fiscal.

“Credit limit has been expanded. I am sure it is based on local ground level requirement...we expect the demand to grow and credit requirements to also meet up with it. I am actually closely monitoring banks and their extension of credit facility particularly to rural areas. So I think we’ll be able to meet that,” Sitharaman said.

The farm credit target for the current fiscal has been set at ₹13.5 lakh crore.

Speaking on the inflationary impact of the Budget proposals, Mr. Das said, “The good part of the government borrowing is also budgeted to come from small savings. Therefore, I don’t see much of an inflationary impact.”

“Declining crude prices has definitely positive impact on inflation...The main reason for spike in inflation is because of food inflation, mostly milk, fish, and various protein related items. Core inflation has slightly edged up because of revision of telecom tariffs,” he added.

Retail inflation based on consumer price index (CPI) soared to a near six-year high of 7.59% in January, surpassing the Reserve Bank of India’s comfort range primarily on account of rising vegetable and food prices.

Similarly, wholesale prices-based inflation accelerated to a 10-month high of 3.10% in January, mainly due to costlier food articles, particularly onion and potato.

Economic growth has been slowing in recent months and the RBI has pegged GDP expansion at 5% for the current fiscal ending March 31.

About the Supreme Court order regarding Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues to be paid by telecom companies, Mr. Das said the central bank would have internal discussions in case there are any issues arising out of it.

The court threatened contempt proceedings against top executives of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom firms for failing to comply with its directive to pay an estimated ₹1.47 lakh crore in past dues.

The decision might have ramifications on banks in terms of their exposure to the financially-stressed telecom companies.

On moderating credit growth, Mr. Das said there are signs of uptick and the momentum is gathering pace. “Credit flow is slowly and steadily reviving... we do hope and we do expect the credit flow to improve in the coming months,” he added.

Credit flow from all sources -- banks, domestic market and external commercial borrowing — has improved to ₹7.5 lakh crore, he said, adding nearly ₹6 lakh crore flow has happened between October and January to the commercial sector.

“Within that, if you look at bank credit to the commercial sector, it was actually a negative growth at the end of September by about ₹1.3 lakh crore or so. Now it is plus ₹2.7 lakh crore, the latest number we have at the end of January. So this is within the total number I mentioned,” Mr. Das said.

On February 6, the six member-Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) headed by Mr. Das, for the second meeting in a row, kept repo rate unchanged at 5.15% but maintained the accommodative policy stance which implies it was biased in favour of cutting rate to boost growth.

Prior to going for status quo on rates in December, the central bank had slashed rates five consecutive times that resulted in a cumulative 1.35% decline in repo rate.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/owa9vh/article30829351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAKTIKANTADASa,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/credit-growth-momentum-picking-up-no-possible-spike-in-inflation-says-shaktikanta-das/article30829352.ece
337,2020/02/15,"Banks will pay a price if a telco files for bankruptcy, says SBI","‘Onus of ensuring compliance with SC order lies with DoT’

SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday said banks will ‘have to pay the price’ in case any telecom firm files for bankruptcy, a day after the Supreme Court made it clear that telecom companies will have to pay the ₹1.47 lakh crore in past dues.

The chief of the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) said it is in the ‘wait-and-watch mode’ and the onus of ensuring telecom companies’ compliance with the Supreme Court order lies with the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) under the government. “If there is a negative impact on any enterprise, it impacts a larger ecosystem, whether it is banks, whether it is employees, whether they are vendors, consumers, so everybody gets impacted. So, that impact, when it comes, we will have to pay the price,” Mr. Kumar said, when asked about the impact on banks if telcos move towards bankruptcy.

He added that the closure of any corporate impacts the country’s economy and, therefore, the endeavour is to prevent the shutting down of any enterprise.

Asked if any telco account is currently classified as non-performing asset (NPA), he said there were two accounts — Aircel and RCom — that went into bankruptcy. Besides, he said SBI will not pass on the burden of the hike in premium of deposit insurance to its customers.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/t1fuof/article30831398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THBURAJNISH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/banks-will-pay-a-price-if-a-telco-files-for-bankruptcy-says-sbi/article30831399.ece
338,2020/02/15,Liquidation remains high in NCLT cases,"Out of 1,351 closed cases, only 190 cases were resolved; average haircut was 57%

More than half of the cases admitted to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) are been liquidated as recovery through resolution continues to elude creditors, latest data released by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) showed.

A total of 3,312 cases were admitted in the insolvency courts till the end of the third quarter of the financial year, of which 561 were during the Oct-Dec period. This was the second highest number of cases admitted in a quarter after the July-September period of the current financial year when 565 cases were admitted.

Out of a total of 1,351 closed cases, 780 or 58% were closed through liquidation and only 190 cases or 14% were resolved with an average haircut of 57% on admitted claims.

For the third quarter, haircuts for cases resolved were high, around 88%.

“Barring a few cases, almost all resolutions in 3QFY20 had a haircut of over 60%,” Kotak Securities said in a note to its clients.

“A high number of liquidated cases and duration of resolution remain primary concerns,” the note said.

The number of cases admitted in the NCLT has been increasing, with 561 cases admitted during the October-December period. Out of the total number of cases admitted, 50% were filed by financial creditors.

“This reflects the increasing pivotal role played by this body in resolution of stressed assets despite the introduction of a new circular from RBI in June 2019 which removed the clause that made it mandatory for cases to be admitted to IBC,” Kotak Securities said.

Of the 182 cases which were closed in the third quarter, 30 cases were resolved while 134 cases faced liquidation.

The note also pointed out that the average duration of resolution was over 350 days for all resolved cases till December, while more than 30% of cases have crossed 270 days.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/gc9vr9/article30831337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Corporatesbw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/liquidation-remains-high-in-nclt-cases/article30831341.ece
339,2020/02/15,Vodafone Idea says it will pay AGR dues to DoT,"Cash-strapped telco hopes for reprieve from the Supreme Court.

Beleaguered telecom firm Vodafone Idea on February 15 said it proposed to clear its Adjusted Gross Revenue-related dues in the next few days. But it warned that the company’s ability to continue as a going concern would depend on a favourable outcome of its modification plea in the Supreme Court.

The statement comes a day after the court asked the managing directors of telecom firms, including Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, to show cause why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for failing to pay even a “single penny” to the government despite an October 2019 judgment.

Following the court order, after U.P. (West) and Rajasthan, the Department of Telecomunication’s (DoT) field offices in circles of Gujarat, U.P. (East), West Bengal and other zones have directed telcos to pay outstanding dues “immediately”, failing which action would be initiated based on the licence agreement.

Responding to the apex court order, Bharti Airtel on February 14 evening committed to deposit a part payment of ₹10,000 crore as part of its AGR dues by February 20, while promising that remaining dues will be cleared “well before” March 17 —the next date for court hearing on the issue.

Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), however, asserted that the government has “vast powers and options” to address the sector’s issues, even in light of the Supreme Court order on payment of statutory dues.

Citing COAI’s position that the industry has to move quickly to a ₹300 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) level to maintain its financial health, director-general of COAI Rajan S. Mathews said the Supreme Court order only makes this imperative “more urgent”.

In a filing to the stock exchanges, Vodafone-Idea said that after the February 14 hearing, the company had “received letters from the Department of Telecommunications directing immediate payment”.

Stating that the company was currently assessing the amount that it will be able to pay to DoT towards the dues calculated based on AGR, it said, “the company proposes to pay the amount so assessed in the next few days”.

“As disclosed in the Company’s financial statements for quarter ending December 31, 2019, the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is essentially dependent on a positive outcome of the application for modification of the Supplementary Order,” it added.

The dues of Vodafone Idea, which has been the worst hit by the October 24 Supreme Court order on definition of AGR in favour of the government, are estimated to be over ₹53,000 crore, including ₹24,729 crore for spectrum usage charge and ₹28,309 crore in licence fee.

Vodafone Idea earlier this week reported a net loss of ₹6,439 crore for the October-December 2019 quarter. This was preceded by a ₹50,922 crore loss in the September quarter — highest ever by any Indian corporate, due to provisions made for statutory dues following the Supreme Court’s order.

Given the financial position of Vodafone Idea, analysts have raised concerns over India becoming a two private player market with Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio. COAI Director General, Rajan Mathews added, “...duopoly is not in the best interest of the nation, customers or even the industry”.

340,2020/02/15,ANMI to mobilise one crore investors for LIC’s IPO,"‘Move will unlock the true potential of the country’s crown jewel, akin to the Saudi Aramco’

Association of stock brokers ANMI on Saturday said it will mobilise one crore investors for the initial public offering of insurance behemoth LIC in order to unlock the true potential of the country’s crown jewel, akin to the Saudi Aramco.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her budget speech announced that the government proposes to sell a part of its holding in LIC through IPO.

The proposed listing will help the government in achieving its disinvestment target of ₹2.1 lakh crore for 2020-21.

“It would be our endeavour to mobilise one crore investors for LIC’s IPO and unlock the true potential of India’s crown jewel, akin the Saudi Aramco in the Middle East and Apple’s listing in the U.S.,” Association of National Exchanges Members of India (ANMI) President Vijay Bhushan said.

LIC’s initial share-sale will be the IPO of the decade and ANMI will support the government in its effort to mobilise investments, including the landamark initial offer of the insurance behemoth, he added.

Currently, the government owns the entire 100% stake in LIC and according to market experts, the company can be valued at around ₹8-10 lakh crore.

Saudi Aramco, which is currently valued at $117.82 billion, was listed on Saudi Stock Exchange in December last year.

341,2020/02/15,"A tale of outbreaks, both in China","Unlike the SARS crisis, Beijing has handled the coronavirus epidemic better; but its secretive attitude still causes concern

The title of the third chapter of my China memoir, Smoke and Mirrors, was ‘Coronavirus’. This was not an act of precognition, but merely an account of having lived in Beijing during the 2003 SARS epidemic, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which was also caused by a coronavirus.

There are obvious parallels between the epidemics of 2002-2003 and 2019-2020. Both began in winter and featured cover-ups and whistle-blowers. The origins of both were traced to China’s unregulated wet markets and the sale of wildlife. Both resulted in quarantines, empty streets and considerable panic. They featured the jaw-dropping feats of entire hospitals being constructed within a few days’ time. And both demonstrated the pros and cons of China’s authoritarian political system: the ability to implement drastic measures to contain a crisis, but only after the unnecessary escalation of the crisis resulting from a repressive culture of censorship.

But there are also differences. SARS was far deadlier, with a mortality rate of about 10%. The mortality rate for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is yet to be established, but appears to be about 2%. However, it is much more infectious. More than 1,300 people have died from the new virus, a number that is already greater than SARS’ final death toll of 774. It took eight months for SARS to spread to more than 8,000 people. The COVID-19 has infected over 63,000 people in about six weeks.

Coronavirus outbreak: the view from China | In Focus podcast

More openness this time

There are also differences in the government’s handling of the epidemics. With SARS, the cover up went on for far longer than it did in the present instance. Although the SARS virus first began appearing in November 2002, China’s then Heath Minister, Zhang Wenkang, gave a televised press conference as late as April 3, 2003, assuring the world that Beijing had only a handful of infections. Then suddenly on April 20, it was announced that the capital in fact had 339 confirmed cases, 10 times more than the 37 infections made public until then. Three days later, on April 23, the official number of cases in Beijing was doubled, to 693.

With regard to the current epidemic, the first instances of COVID-19 appeared in early December. By the end of the month, China had already alerted the World Health Organization (WHO) to several cases of A SARS-like pneumonia in the city of Wuhan. By the second week of January, China had genetically sequenced the virus and shared it with WHO. On January 23, Wuhan suspended all public transportation; all outbound trains and flights were halted. In the days that followed, travel restrictions were applied to neighbouring cities as well, eventually affecting well over 50 million people. Despite the inconvenience and the huge economic costs, China’s New Year holiday period was extended. Factories lay idle while people were urged to voluntarily quarantine themselves at home.

How other nations reacted

But despite these almost-draconian measures and the improved speed with which the Chinese authorities have responded to the ongoing epidemic, the global response has been more fearful and arguably more xenophobic than during SARS. The restrictions on travel to and from China are more punitive, even as there is a resurgence of racist tropes portraying Chinese food habits and other customs as unsafe and unsavoury.

The U.S. (with some exceptions) and Australia have banned entry to all foreign nationals who have been to China in recent weeks. Other countries, including India, Malaysia, Russia, Vietnam and Italy, have temporarily stopped issuing certain classes of visas to travellers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is situated, or China altogether. A large number of airlines have suspended their China operations. Meanwhile there have been increasing reports of restaurants, hotels and shops in countries, ranging from Japan to Vietnam turning away Chinese customers.

What accounts for this larger, arguably “excessive” reaction? Social media certainly plays into it. SARS occurred in the pre-Facebook/WhatsApp/Twitter era, although text messaging was already well established then. Also, far greater numbers of Chinese are travelling abroad today.

There are certainly genuine concerns about public and personal health, but these have meshed with the discomfiture that many around the world feel towards China, a country that has exponentially grown in economic and military heft, even as other, traditionally ascendant, nations have lost some of their former geopolitical sheen. The widespread mistrust of China’s political system and anxieties about its geostrategic intentions are mingling with an ugly schadenfreude as China is exposed to censure. It is perhaps unavoidable. China’s new status as a major world power means that its handling of crises will inevitably be subject to global scrutiny.

And although compared to SARS, this handling has shown improvements, it nonetheless throws the deficiencies, even fragility, of China’s political system, into sharp relief. The severity and extent of the disease in Wuhan was underestimated for weeks. Information was not adequately shared. Worse, those like Dr. Li Wenliang (the whistle-blower who subsequently contracted the virus and died) who tried to voice their concerns were muzzled by the police. The egregious consequence of the weeks-long official silence was that it facilitated the movement of some five million people in the days before Wuhan was quarantined, enabling the spread of the virus all over the country and overseas.

In some way, it would seem that the more things have changed in China, the more they have remained the same. The larger context of the Chinese political system, in particular its overly controlling attitude towards information, has proved persistent. Local government incompetence is hardly confined to China, but in less restrictive societies, whistle-blowers such as Dr. Li would likely have found the means to get their message out. Under China’s President Xi Jinping, state control over the media has only deepened, which, together with his unabated emphasis on maintaining social order, means China remains vulnerable to crises despite surface strength.

342,2020/02/15,Troubling data: On falling industrial output,"Growth is not held back by high finance cost, but by poor consumer demand

Earlier this week in Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke about green shoots in the economy. One of the variables she laid faith in was the industrial output data which showed a 1.8% growth in November after contracting from August to October. This faith in a growth recovery proved misplaced as the December industrial output data, out on Wednesday, shows a contraction of 0.3%. This is curious because the core sector, accounting for 40% of the index of industrial production, showed a 1.3% growth in December. The villain seems to be manufacturing, which contracted by 1.2%, with consumer durables and non-durables in sharp decline. This does not square up with anecdotal evidence from consumer durable manufacturers — of seeing a recovery. Be that as it may, what is clear is that the growth impulses are unstable yet and certainly not uniform across sectors. And as luck would have it, even this tentative recovery is under threat due to the coronavirus outbreak in China. The shutdown of factories in China due to this is likely to affect supply chain networks for products from mobile phones to automobiles. Manufacturers in India are reporting slim inventories for critical items of production and if factories do not begin to hum in China soon — the chances of that happening are remote given signs of an intensifying outbreak — it could spell trouble for India.

Meanwhile, inflation continued to hold sway with the January prints showing a rise in both consumer price inflation and wholesale price inflation. CPI accelerated to 7.59% in January, the second successive month of above 7% print, while wholesale price inflation broke the 3% barrier in January (3.1%) moving up from 2.59% in December. The surge in both numbers is largely due to rise in food prices, including of proteins and pulses but core inflation has also moved up to 4.1%. While food inflation may calm down this month following the retreat in vegetable prices, the rise in core inflation is cause for worry. With cooking gas prices rising by a huge ₹144 a cylinder the inflation expectations of households may also go up. Inflation is likely to remain well above the RBI’s median of 4% at least for the next two quarters. The central bank has already paused on its rate cut cycle and going by the latest data it appears that the next rate cut — the last in the cycle — will not happen until later this calendar year. Interest rates are being driven down through other measures and again, it is not as if growth is being held back by high finance costs. Far from it. Banks are reporting poor credit growth because businesses are unwilling to invest. And this in turn, is due to lack of demand. The key to a turnaround is, therefore, in the hands of the consumer.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/troubling-data-the-hindu-editorial-on-falling-industrial-output/article30823760.ece
343,2020/02/15,Choice and candidacy: On crime and politics,"De-criminalisation of politics cannot be achieved by judicial fiat alone

The idea of removing the taint of criminality from electoral politics has been engaging the country for decades. Yet, whatever progress made in this regard has been through the initiative of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission. Political parties which ought to be cleansing the system with legislation and internal organisational reforms have done precious little, and their reluctance to avoid fielding those with criminal antecedents is quite obvious. The Court, in September 2018, sought to enforce greater disclosure norms about electoral candidates. On noting the “alarming increase” of those with a criminal background in the last four general elections, the top court has now come up with an additional requirement while hearing a contempt of court petition. Now, parties have been asked to explain candidate choice and why those with criminal cases pending against them were preferred over those with no such record. The Court has asked national and regional parties to disclose the reason for their selection “with reference to qualifications, achievements and merit of the candidates concerned”, and barred them from merely citing “winnability” as a reason. In addition to full disclosure of the cases pending against them on their official websites and social media accounts, the parties are also required to publish these details in a local regional language paper and a national newspaper. This is a forward movement from the present situation in which the burden of disclosure is on candidates through mandatory affidavits filed along with their nomination papers.

The latest order is in line with a series of judgments aimed at preserving the purity of the election process: directions to ensure the asset disclosure and criminal records of candidates, the incorporation of the ‘none of the above’ option in the voting machine, and the invalidation of a clause that protected sitting legislators from immediate disqualification after conviction. In addition, the Court has directed the establishment of special courts in all States for the quick disposal of cases involving elected representatives. However, it must be underscored that de-criminalisation of politics cannot be achieved by judicial fiat alone. The political class has to respond to the challenge. Parties would probably justify their choice of candidates by pointing out that the law now bars only those convicted and not those facing charges, however serious they may be. Besides, they are apt to dismiss all pending cases as “politically motivated”. A legislative option is to amend the law to bar from contest those against whom charges have been framed. A more meaningful option would be for parties to refrain from giving ticket to such candidates. Beyond this debate, a larger question looms: what good will more information on the background of candidates do, if voters back a particular leader or party without reference to the record of the candidates fielded?",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/choice-and-candidacy-the-hindu-editorial-on-supreme-court-ordering-political-parties-to-publish-criminal-records-of-candidates/article30823755.ece
344,2020/02/15,"‘If Basavanna was alive, he would have said kagaz nahi dhikhayenge’","Independent MLA Jignesh Mevani accused BJP of dividing people between ‘mandir and masjid’

Jignesh Mevani, independent MLA from Vadgam, Gujarat, who was in the city on Saturday, urged citizens to stand up against ‘communal politics’ and criticised the BJP for dividing people between ‘mandir and masjid’. The Dalit leader met residents of slums in Kariyamanna Agrahara and Thubarahalli, who have been living with the threat of eviction, and also addressed a public meeting near Freedom Park.

He was highly critical of the impact of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the government’s attempt to divide people along religious lines. “Those who believe in the ideas and ideals of Godse are building detention centres while those who have faith in the Constitution of India were building Bilal Baghs, Shaheen Bhags, Sabzi Baghs across the country to save the Constitution,” he said.

More often than not, marginalised communities are being targeted. “The Modi-Shah duo have a dream to be in the textbooks of the future. However, school children tomorrow will read about Shaheen Bagh (Delhi), Bilal Bagh (Bengaluru) and Sabzi Bagh (Patna) that have sprung up across the country,” he said.

Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the event, Mr. Mevani said that the divisive initiatives of the Union government, like CAA, NRC and NPR, were also tactics to divert the attention of the people from burning issues like unemployment, price rise, privatisation of health and education sectors.

“This is the land of Basavanna. If Basavanna was alive, he would definitely have said kagaz nahi dhikhayenge.”

S. Varalakshmi, president of Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers' Association, said that doublespeak by the Prime Minister and Home Minister on nationwide implementation of NRC was to confuse people. “The NRC exercise in Assam has been disastrous. It is not only unconstitutional but also unnecessary expenditure. The government that is ready to spend thousands of crores on this is not ready to pay pourakarmikas or anganwadi workers,” she added.

Ready for jail: H.S. Doreswamy

Freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy, who has been spearheading protests in Bengaluru, cited the Delhi election result as an example of how people are voting against politics of hate.

“We are all ready for a jail baro movement. In fact, lakhs and lakhs of people across the country are ready to go to jail. Let us see what the government can do,” said Mr. Doreswamy, who was at the public meeting with MLA Jignesh Mevani.

“We should ensure that there are more and more people on the streets in the future. We should not rest till Modi-Shah are voted out in 2024,” he added. “Police and the Election Commission have become ineffective and inefficient in guarding the rights of the people,” he said.

345,2020/02/15,Medical toppers praise practical classes,"264 students receive MBBS degrees at convocation of Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute

On Saturday, Arpit Shantagiri graduated and fulfilled his childhood dream of becoming a doctor. “It was a momentous occasion. From the time I was three, I would grab my father’s stethoscope and pretend to be a doctor,” he said. His parents – who are both doctors – were thrilled to see him receive the highest number of gold medals at the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMRCI) convocation ceremony on Saturday.

As many as 264 students received their MBBS degrees.

Arpit received eight gold medals – six from the college and two from the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS). Determination is his mantra for success.

“If you put your mind to something, you will definitely be able to do it,” he said. He plans to do his MD in medicine but is apprehensive of the rural service component. “In many places, the right facilities are not provided to doctors in rural areas. The right facilities and infrastructure will go a long way in helping patients from rural areas,” he said.

Many toppers at the convocation ceremony said that they learnt a lot from the practical classes, which helped them grasp concepts better.

Meghana Devakki, who bagged a gold medal in paediatrics, said, “A large part of my learning took place when I was with patients. This is more essential than merely reading textbooks. The practicals helped me understand my subjects much better,” she said. The daughter of government school teachers, Meghana aspires to get a MD seat in OBG.

Anikethan B. Kichadi, who bagged two gold medals, attributed his success to clinical postings. He batted for rural service and said that it is necessary as there is a scarcity of doctors.

The downturn in the Indian automobile sector has affected not just the existing workforce but also students hoping to get placements this year. Engineering students who have specialised in the mechanical stream are finding it difficult to get jobs in automobile companies.

College managements, however, said they are initiating several measures to “cushion the impact” and are helping students find jobs in other streams this placement season, which is under way.

B.M. Rajaprakash, placement officer at University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering, stated that to date, 46% of their mechanical engineering students have been placed. He admitted that it is lower than their overall placement of 54% so far. “We are asking students in this stream to expand their knowledge in other areas and take up courses in geometric dimensioning, data analytics, and so on. We are also teaching them coding techniques during the placement training so that they can get jobs in the software industry,” he said.

Students from the civil engineering stream too have recorded low placements.

Pradeepa S., placement officer of BMS College of Engineering, said that construction companies do not usually come to campuses for recruitment, but their prospects are still good. “While 65% of the students eligible for placements have so far got jobs, for the civil stream, it is between 30 to 40 % so far.”

However, the dip is not across all streams: Colleges have observed an increased demand in other streams.

“Placements in other sectors were in fact better than in the previous year and the economic slowdown does not appear to have an impact on campus placements,” Mr. Rajaprakash added.

Demand for students from IT and circuit branches, for instance, remains high.

According to Ms. Pradeepa S., hiring trends are changing, and an increasing number of companies prefer to pick students from across streams even if their specialisation is different from the job requirement. “They tend to pick students who have done multidisciplinary projects and have knowledge of different streams, and not just the one they are enrolled in,” she said.

K.S. Sridhar, Dean (placements) of PES University, acknowledged that there has been a lull in the number of automotive companies that are coming for campus placements. He said that the overall outlook is promising as over 85% of their students already have job offers. In the mechanical engineering stream, however, around 52% of students have been placed so far.

“At our university, students have to pick a minor stream besides the one that is the area of specialisation. So many of the mechanical students have got jobs in IT and data analytics companies,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/q3rotb/article30831386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGAUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mechanical-engineering-graduates-hit-by-automobile-industry-slowdown/article30831387.ece
347,2020/02/15,No speaking in Kannada rule: School may lose affiliation,"Order came from Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar

A private unaided school located in Horamavu in Bengaluru is likely to face disaffiliation after the management decided to penalise children who were speaking in Kannada within the premises.

In January, the school sent a circular to parents saying that their children would be fined ₹50 if they were caught speaking in Kannada. If they were caught again, the fine would be ₹100.

When the Kannada Development Authority (KDA) took it up, the principal apologised.

Based on the KDA’s recommendation, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar has ordered for SLS International Gurukul in Horamavu to be disaffiliated.

Although the school authorities had admitted that it was an error on their part and the circular was withdrawn, the department has decided to go ahead and initiate action. A senior official of the department said, “They withdrew the order after the KDA intervened and visited the school. We want to initiate action against this school to send a message to all managements that discriminating against Kannada, which is the local language, will cost them dearly.”

However, the official said that they would have to first ensure that the interests of students enrolled in the school are protected. The jurisdictional Block Education Officer will have to identify schools in the neighbourhood where the students could be shifted.

“We will initiate action only after the end of the current academic year,” the official added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-speaking-in-kannada-rule-school-may-lose-affiliation/article30831182.ece
348,2020/02/15,Five honoured with ability awards,"Overcoming odds, recipients invented themselves in different fields

Five people from across India were recognised and honoured for breaking stereotypes and challenging the mindset of society towards disability at the 18th CavinKare Ability Awards.

“This award is a testimony for their perseverance, courage and desire to achieve great heights by overcoming barriers steadily,” said C.K.Ranganathan, Chairman and Managing Director of CavinKare.

This year, the CavinKare Ability Special Recognition Award was given to Anindya Bhattacharyya, who played a major role in the passage of the United States’ 21 st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act.

Someone born in a small village in West Bengal and left completely deaf-blind early on in his childhood, Anindya overcame numerous trials and challenges. He runs a digital online store, Bapin Group, and is the CEO of the company. He holds a full-time and consequential job as coordinator of the National Outreach Technology Development and Training Program at the Helen Keller National Center, NY.

Swarnalatha J., the founder of Swarga Charitable Trust from Coimbatore, bagged the CavinKare Ability Award for Eminence for creating accessible toilets on every platform of Indian Railways at Coimbatore Junction and 10 Government schools, making nine schools in Coimbatore wheelchair-friendly and setting up Tamil Nadu’s first wheelchair accessible transportation service. At 29, Swarnalatha was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. She then learnt to cope with the pain and reinvented herself to take on the world.

Two records

Adil Mohammed Nazir Ansari, who has two Limca records — one for the longest bike ride (300km) by a quadriplegic and another for driving on the Golden Quadrilateral on a modified car — won the CavinKare Ability Mastery Award.

Adil battled a spinal cord injury that left him paralysed neck down, with multiple infections and a bad bed sore, but he emerged a top sportsman and a world record holder. He has won the National Archery Championship title thrice and has represented India in para archery tournaments in China, the Czech Republic, Dubai and Netherlands.

Rakshitha Raju from Bengaluru, who received the CavinKare Ability Mastery Award, was the first Indian woman with blindness to have won gold medals in the track events at the Asian games 2018. She went on to win a Gold in the 1500m event at the Para Athletics Grand Prix in Paris (2018) and the Junior World Championship in Switzerland (2019). This trailblazing para athlete has qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Paralympics.

Tinkesh, who set a record when he bungee jumped from a height of 160m in Nepal, was given the CavinKare Ability Mastery Award. An electrical accident in his childhood and lack of good medical care left him a triple amputee with 90% disability — with no legs and just one arm. He is an athlete, swimmer, para cyclist, marathoner and a fitness and wellness coach for persons with and without disabilities.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/j12kll/article30830971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THCAVINKARE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/five-honoured-with-ability-awards/article30830973.ece

350,2020/02/15,Volunteering Victory,"What was once a barren land, today resembles of a mini forest thanks to the efforts taken by Nizhal, a trust to promote care and concern for trees in the city, members of public and volunteers of Chitlapakkam Eri Neer Vanam to transform the area abutting the eastern side bunds of the lake.

K. Bargavi, one of the volunteers of Chitlapakkam Eri Neer Vanam, says, “ The area was a barren land and nothing short of a trash yard. With the guidance from Shobha Menon and T. D. Babu, founding members of Nizhal, and support from the volunteers, we were able to do it.”

“The journey wasn’t an easy one. We had to face several challenges including damage of saplings, and fences by stray cattles and littering of trash by anti-social elements.”

After obtaining the necessary permission from the Public Works Department, Shobha and Babu came and met us and detailed about the greening project and urged to be part of the project. The work started in February 2016.

“ The forest is home to more than 250 plants including rare and indigenous species - Venn Purasu, Neer Nochi, Sarakonnai, Aavaram, Neer Marudhu, Aglaia, Kalyana Murungai, Mandharai, Punnai and Vennagu. The cultivated greenery is a fine example of community volunteering,” Harish, a volunteer

The forest has been divided into five sections - A to E for the volunteers to assemble easily and earmark volunteers for works as part of greening efforts.

Every Sunday, around five to six volunteers used to come regularly and take part in Shramdaan - cleaning the forest of trash, pruning overgrown branches, watering and taking care of the saplings and forming basins around the saplings for the water to percolate.

During summer, the volunteers used to come every alternate day and took care of the saplings. The volunteers come from Alandur, Chromepet, Guindy and Pallavaram.

Besides, we have a couple of composting points in the forest area. We convert the collected dry leaves into manure at these pits. The manure is used for these plants. In addition, we use ‘Amirtha Karaisal’, a solution like ‘Panchakaviyam’.

Apart from volunteers, college students and working professionals, as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) came and took part in the caring sessions.

Besides, we have conducted tree walks for school students and members of public and have explained the benefits of cultiving a forest in a urban area and the importance of conserving the water-bodies.

The forest is like Agaramthen Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest. The native trees in the forest can withstand the dry and wet conditions for an extended period of time. Since the trees are well-adapted to the local climate, they play a major role in prevention of soil erosion, home to birds and insects and recharge the ground water, Karthick, a volunteer

The success - survival rate is due to community volunteering efforts amidst the damages by human beings and stray cattles. We will be needing more volunteers.

Speaking, T. D. Babu, says, “During one of my visits to a school in the neighbourhood, I happened to study the conditions in and around the lake. The lake bund was dumped with leftovers from the nearby eateries. The bund was used an open toilet. Though, the quality of water was not good, there was water in the lake. I asked myself why not create a bio-shield surrounding the lake?. Creating a bio-shield will prevent land abuse, protect the water -body and provide a green and enviroment. Our members, Bhuvana and Bhuvana Raj helped a lot in speaking to the authorities concerned from the Chtlapakkam Selection Grade Town Panchayat. Besides, Chitlapakkam C. Rajendran, the then Member of Parliament, South Chennai, supported us a lot The members also played a pivotal role in arranging a meeting with the residents. “

Though, we availed the permission in the year 2012, it was only in the year February 2016, the work began. Financial crunches and misguidance delayed the project for 4 years. Before the work began, we mapped the area and decided where to plant the trees in four sections. In section A, we implemented cluster planting and section B sufficient space was earmarked.

The success - survival rate is more than 90 percent due to community efforts. The aim of Neer Vanam (Water Forest) is to strengthen the bunds, restore bio-diversity, and enhance the quality of water and the ecosystems.

This activity also prevented sewage tankers drivers from entering into the lake who used to discharge raw sewage into the lake. Besides, a police booth was set up which prevented vandalism, land abuse was prevented. As part of restoration efforts, the bund of the lake was raised, in the process, the plants got damaged, Yet the volunteers were not detered and worked in Full spirit,

We request the authorities concerned to issue a directive to the field staff to be careful when the restoration works are carried out. Besides, the bunds on the lake is going to be green. Hope they continue the project with the help from the volunteers, who have sacrificed their personal lives.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vo5zls/article30829646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16dctbrmNeerVanam4png,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/volunteering-victory/article30829647.ece
351,2020/02/15,Raising a mini forest,"Sustained volunteering efforts have converted a neglected section along the Chitlapakkam lake into a green patch

A mini forest is sprouting along the eastern-side bunds of Chitlapakkam lake. It is indeed heart-warming to note how this once-barren section is now putting a variety of flora on grand display.

The tree conservation NGO Nizhal has been in the forefront of this volunteering effort, which has received abundant support from Chitlapakkam Eri Neer Vanam, residents, students and working professionals.

Although the idea came up in 2012, the work started only in 2016. Financial crunch and lack of guidance delayed the project for four years, say members.

Before the work began, volunteers mapped the area and decided on four sections to plant saplings.

S. Bargavi, a volunteer of Chitlapakkam Eri Neer Vanam, says, “Before we started the work, the area was a trash yard. With the guidance of Shobha Menon and T. D. Babu, we took baby steps in giving the area a facelift.”

“During a visit to a school in the neighbourhood, I happened to see the condition of the lake. The bund was overerun with leftovers from nearby eateries. Though the quality of water was not good, there was water in the lake. That’s when I thought, ‘Why not create a bio-shield surrounding the lake to prevent further abuse and protect the water-body?’,” says T.D. Babu, trustee of Nizhal.

The journey however wasn’t easy. “We had to face several challenges including damage to saplings and fences by stray cattle and littering by anti-social elements,” says Bargavi.

Nizhal members Bhuvana and Raj reached out to the authorities from the Chtlapakkam Selection Grade Town Panchayat and volunteers.

This greening drive also prevented sewage tanker drivers from entering the lake.

A police booth was set up to keep an eye on mischief mongers.

The forest has been divided into five sections — A to E — for volunteers to assemble easily.

Weekend volunteers

Every Sunday, around five to six volunteers take part in shramdaan where trash is cleared, overgrown branches are pruned and plants watered. The volunteers are from Alandur, Chromepet, Guindy and Pallavaram.

A couple of composting points have been created where dry leaves are converted into compost.

Today, the forest is home to more than 250 plant species.

“You will find Venn Purasu, Neer Nochi, Sarakonnai, Aavaram, Neer Marudhu, Aglaia, Kalyana Murungai, Mandharai, Punnai and Vennagu. The cultivated greenery is a fine example of community volunteering,” says A. Harish, another volunteer.

They call it a Neer Vanam as the mini-forest is located along the waterbody.

Get involved

The volunteers have also been conducting tree walks for school students and members of the public to create a sense of ownership about this green space.

“If this greenery has to thrive we need more people to keep an eye on it; this is not just by volunteering but by also coming for walks to make the place more happening,” says Harish.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/raising-a-mini-forest/article30829637.ece

They have made a request to the Water Resources Department to desilt and deepen the sprawling waterbody located off Mudichur Road.

Under the Kudi Maramathu Scheme, the State government allocated an amount of ₹ five lakh to desilt and deepen the eri and construct a canal (to bring excess rainwater from Mudichur Periya Eri) and ‘Kalangal’ (surplus weir through which excess water is let out).

According to residents, the surplus weir was constructed at a low height. As a result, during rains, the excess water from Mudichur Periya Eri did not get stored. The excess water from Mudichur Periya Eri drained from the lake into the Adyar river during the north-east monsoon, residents complained.

Due to improper execution of the works, we are worried that we may have to face water scarcity this year too despite the district receiving copious rains during the north east monsoon.

Residents of Kovilambakkam and S. Kolathur, neighbourhoods located along Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam 200-Feet Radial Road, find that Metropolitan Transport Corporation services plying through this stretch are poor. At present only a few services are operated on this road. They include 91 (Thiruvanmiyur and Tambaram); 91V (Thiruvanmiyur and Vandalur) and 91 A (Thiruvanmiyur and Hasthinapuram).

Residents point out that services R21(Thiruvanmiyur and Perungalathur); V21 (Guduvanchery and Thiruvanmiyur); 51F (Sunnambu Kolathur and T. Nagar); V151 (East Tambaram and T. Nagar) were plying through the radial road until a few years ago. Now, the routes of V151 and 51F skip the radial road are they are diverted through Velachery and Madipakkam.

356,2020/02/15,"Garbage makes an exit, sewage continues to flow in","Residents’ groups focussed on protecting Sembakkam lake gear up for the second phase of the struggle

Desolation can be disconcerting. In rare contexts, it can be comforting. The erstwhile site of a dump that had been offensively plonked in the Sembakkam lake area, is now stalked by desolation.

A bovine somnolence is hanging in the air — literally, as cows can be found grazing on the site that was cleared of huge mound of “legacy waste” by a bio-mining exercise carried out nearly two years ago.

The mounds of garbage may have gone, but sewage inflows into the lake continue to mar the picture.

Sri Sarvamangala Nagar Residents Association in Chitlapakkam had filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal, drawing attention to the scourge of sewage being clandestinely let into the lake.

“There are 22 inlets through which sewage is being let into Sembakkam lake. In what is a shot in the arm for the campaign to protect the lake, on February 7 this year, the southern bench of the National Green Tribunal issued a directive that a joint committee comprising the district collector and representatives of related departments, which would include the Public Works Department and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, be formed. It also directed that the local bodies around the Sembakkam lake should also be represented in this joint committee, which should find out how sewage is being let into the lake and initiate action that will put an end to the problem,” says K. Ramakrishna, committee member, Sri Sarvamangala Nagar Residents Association.

Ravi, secretary, Sri Sarvamangala Nagar Residents Association , says, “The fact that UGD work is yet to be fully completed in a section of the Pallavarm bordering the Sembakkam lake may be contributing to the problem.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hkl6zt/article30829299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dtquote4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/garbage-makes-an-exit-sewage-continues-to-flow-in/article30829300.ece
357,2020/02/15,Know the birds in your backyard,"After participating in a bird count in his neck of the woods, a resident of IIT-M campus now encourages the other residents of Chennai to tune in to the chirps in their neighbourhoods

On an unusually cold mid-February morning in Chennai, I arrived at IIT Madras’s main gate to count birds. My ride was short as I was travelling from inside the campus. A group of birders had assembled at the venue at 6 a.m.

As we started walking into the woods, we were training our ears to birdcalls. “Did you hear that call?” Susy Varughese, a professor at IIT-M and an avid birdwatcher, asked the group. Before I could check my phone to see if it was ringing, she replied, “that’s the Indian Pitta whistling!”

She is part of Prakriti, the Wildlife club of IIT Madras, that was launched to recognise and to protect biodiversity on the campus. IIT Madras was carved out of a natural forest that formed part of the Guindy National Park. This birdwatching session is part of the Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC), now in its 23rd year. It is organised every year in mid-February to nudge citizens to head outdoor and know about the birds in their community.

Looking in another direction, Varughese added, that one is an Asian Koel “calling out.” Then, it was a Magpie Robin’s turn to lend its voice to the growing symphony of birds chirping and tweeting on the campus.

“Please note the call and the time,” Varughese told a volunteer, as we were walking along the trail spotting a White Breasted Water Hen.

The undergrowth in the woods sustain small migratory birds that come to Chennai during October, and fly away as far as the Himalayas in March. The Blue-throated Blue Flycatcher is one of those small birds, about 13-15 cm in size, including its tail, that flies over a thousand kilometres every year from the Himalayas in the North to the coastal towns in the south.

Varughese called our attention to the call of Coppersmith Barbet. Its call was similar to a coppersmith striking a metal with hammer. Unfortunately, we couldn’t spot the bird. But the volunteer showed our group the bird’s picture from the Book of Indian Birds. It’s a book Varughese strongly recommends for birding enthusiasts and amateurs. It helps one to know about the birds in the country and their ecosystem.

As we walked along, Varughese explained how the Mynas, Woodpeckers and Parakeets make their nests on top of dead palm trees. She said that after palm trees come to the end of their life span, small birds make use of them by building their nests on top of the stumps.

Talking about nests, the campus is home to the Tailor Bird, a song bird that weaves leaves together to make nests for its young ones. These tiny birds can sit easily in the palm of your hands.

Our trail led us to a pristine lake in the campus, where we spotted Pelicans, Indian Cormorants, Spot-billed ducks and many more that I’m still trying to remember.

These are the birds in my backyard, now what’s in yours?

Head out, spot them and list them in the eBird application.

358,2020/02/15,Imagine there are no dump sites,"An environment scientist and a waste-management activist on what it takes to be free of landfills

When we start romanticising a solution that had been engineered under desperate conditions to solve a stubborn problem, there is always the dangerous possibility that may take our eyes off the problem, as also the factors that caused it (the problem) in the first place. This would be a particularly unfortunate situation to have, if the problem was largely avoidable in the first place.

It doesn’t matter that the solution had been commendably administered, and can be recommended for similar situations. If this problem could have been avoided, the larger focus should be on how we boxed ourselves into a corner where we had to spend heavily on implementing an elaborate solution. Only then should we allow ourselves to celebrate this solution.

The cost element

There may be a lot in the bio-capping of the Gorai dump site in Mumbai that can be celebrated. It may particularly appeal to residents of Chennai, as the Gorai dump site is situated in a bio-diversity hotspot, which includes the Gorai Creek with its mangroves. In Chennai, there is a landfill parked in a marsh.

Beyond the obvious aesthetic appeal of the exercise – a green mop-top of vegetation adorning the capped dump site – there are those extremely significant benefits to be counted, which include reduced methane gas generation. It is also said that the mangroves in the Gorai creek have improved following the bio-capping exercise, carried out between 2007 and 2009.

Kurian Joseph, professor, Centre of Environmental Studies, Anna University, points out that there is a huge cost element attached to dealing with “legacy waste”, waste that has accumulated over decades.

“There are two ways to deal with the problem. One, bio-capping. The dump site would be scientifically sealed, and the waste would remain there; but environmental hazard would be minimised. The other one is bio-mining. The waste at the dump site is first stabilised, if it is not already stabilised. And then through an engineering process, the waste is separated. There are three fractions to the waste: A fine fraction of the waste is what is called bio-earth: It will be like compost. A major fraction constitutes refuse-derived fuel (plastics, clothes and rubber tyres) that will be sent to cement factories. And another fraction is made up of coarse soil which can be used for filling low-lying areas, or in the same place. There is a huge cost attached to these processes. Bio-capping is carried out at large dump sites whose size and quantum of waste may pose a challenge to any bio-mining exercise. Bio-capping can appear like an ideal solution, especially because the dump site now resembles a mammoth hill capped with greenery. But bio-capped dump sites have to be monitored for decades. There is usually a huge operational cost involved in it,” explains Prof. Joseph.

In the decades to come, the Gorai dump site will have to be monitored – and there is no telling how many.

So, the solution offered by those engaged in dump site re-engineering and waste-management planning is this: “If you don’t want to see land fills stop creating them, deal with waste on an everyday basis when it is just a manageable molehill.”

Towards this end, Prof. Joseph recommends promoting the philosophy of micro-composting among residents.

“By establishing a micro-composting unit on every street, an opportunity is being provided to residents to be more acquainted with waste management processes. It would also send out a signal to residents that they have to take greater responsibility of the waste they are generating. MCUs divides the waste that may otherwise go to a dump site and turns them into manageable bits. The benefits are many. The cost in transporting the waste is reduced. It creates livelihood for people, if those engaged in the work get to take the compost in addition to a compensation,” says Prof. Joseph.

The same logic applies to material recovery facilities, which deal with dry waste and recyclables.

“Residents’ cooperation is required. It begins with the establishment of a micro-composting unit. Residents should not object to a micro-composting unit being set up in their neighbourhood/ road. And they should also be willing to pay for waste management,” says Prof. Joseph.

Focussing on the other side of the spectrum, he points out that institutional mechanisms should be in place.

“Local bodies are often plagued by manpower shortage and lack of technical expertise. A municipal engineer is usually doing a raft of things, and waste management will be one of them. At least in big corporations and municipalities, there should a dedicated and educated team of personnel who would exclusively focus on waste management,” says Prof. Joseph adding that there is scope for capacity building. “Composting is as much as a craft as it is a science, and those engaged in it should bring a passion to it, as to any other profession,” he adds.

A cyclical process?

Shibu Nair, India coordinator for Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, cautions against an inertia that would allow dump sites to grow to monstrous proportions and then waking up to the danger and dealing with it.

“The issue of dealing with legacy waste is essentially about facing the reality that resources have been mismanaged. We have to first begin with this realisation. There is no fool-proof way to deal with mixed waste at a dump site. It is a toxic cocktail. Most of the time, measures to deal with legacy waste signify a huge compromise. To give an example, selectively taking care of bio-degradable waste aerobic composting technique in a closed landfill will only be less-than-perfect. The dump will be rearranged to ensure aeration. What is obtained is taken for compost, but it is actually not the kind of compost we would want to use in our garden. It will contain toxic elements, and comes with the risk of bio-magnification. However, as a waste manager, I may even settle for a similar method, and deal with a dump site as a one-off exercise, provided I would know that people would mend their ways and work towards not creating dump sites in the first place. If people are going to repeat the same mistakes, the exercise doesn’t serve any purpose. One would be going through it ad infinitum – it would be meaningless,” explains Shibu. That is certainly something to ponder over.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ffxbxv/article30829220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16dcSembakkamBiomining1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/imagine-there-are-no-dump-sites/article30829224.ece
359,2020/02/15,Residents of Kannadapalayam can now heave a sigh of relief,"For more than two decades, those residing around the sprawling Puthu Thangal Eri in West Tambaram had to put up with a foul stench emanating from a dump site adjacent to the waterbody. During rains, the stench would be pungent. There have also been cases of spontaneous first outbreaks in the dump site, say residents.

There are signs that these things will soon be a thing of the past, as the Tambaram Municipality has started the bio-mining project at Kannadapalayam landfill located near West Tambaram. In the past, the bio-mining project at Kannadapalayam landfill had missed many deadlines — it was supposed to start in 2017.

The Tambaram Municipality had proposed the bio-mining project in 2017, after years of protests by local residents and after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) pulled up the Municipality and imposed a fine of ₹ 5 lakh on it for not taking any efforts to clear the garbage from the dumping ground.

“Continual dumping of trash has contaminated the groundwater. As a result, for cooking and drinking purposes, residents buy water cans. For other purposes, we have no other option but to use the contaminated water,” says a resident on conditions of anonymity.

The Zigma Global Environ Solutions Private Limited has been entrusted with the bio-mining exercise at the Kannadapalayam landfill.

It is said that the dump site has one lakh tonnes of waste.

Till date, around 30,000 tonnes of wastes have been cleared. The Tambaram Municipality is extending all co-operation and support to carry out the exercise, Zigma officials added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/o40g8c/article30829184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DCTBRMBIO-MININGCOMMONPAGEKANNADAPALAYAMpng,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-of-kannadapalayam-can-now-heave-a-sigh-of-relief/article30829185.ece
360,2020/02/15,GCC raising a Miyawaki forest in Royola Nagar,"There are plans to carry out a similar exercise at Nolambur

After Kotturpuram, the Greater Chennai Corporation, is raising a “dense forest” at its open space reservation (OSR) land on Second Street in Royala Nagar (Ward 155) in Ramapuram (Zone 11-Valasarawakkam). It is being nurtured by the Miyawaki method of afforestation.

Last week, the Minister of Rural Industries, P. Benjamin, inaugurated the green initiative in the presence of the Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner, G. Prakash; Regional Deputy Commissioner (South), Alby John Varghese; and S. Sasikala, Zonal Officer, Zone 11.

Of the 10,000 sq.ft. OSR land, 6,000 sq.ft. is dedicated for the Miyawaki forest. Close to 750 saplings have been planted. This includes 500 trees and the remaining are plants. Here, indigenous species such as punnai, pungai, vembu, nelli, and a few others have been planted. The soil is nourished by manure made with decomposable waste collected by the Greater Chennai Corporation.

In this regard, S. Sasikala, Zonal Officer, says, “The Corporation has plans to have a raise similar “forest” in Nolambur and towards this end, we have initiatied the process of identifying an open space reservation land.”

On the occasion, office-bearers of Ramapuram Social Welfare Federation, a residents’ forum, requested the authorities to remove the dairy outlet of Aavin that is located within the OSR land where the forest is being raised.

“Most of the days, we find the Aavin booth shut. So, if it is not operational we would like to see it removed and the space can be put to better use,” says Kishore, an active member of the Federation.

The Federation also requested the Minister and GCC officials to develop the open-space reservation land at Second Cross Street in Royola Nagar into a playground exclusively for women.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/s9v907/article30829156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DCTNGRRAMAPURAMAAVIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gcc-raising-a-miyawaki-forest-in-royola-nagar/article30829159.ece

For the second time in less than a year, Rajamannar Salai, off Arcot Road, in Virugambakkam, has been dug up again. This time, Tangedco (Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Corporation) has dug up the road to lay its cables to prevent power fluctuations in the neighbourhood. Interestingly, the 60-ft-stretch was dug up early last year by the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) to lay its water pipes. CMWSSB completed its work in mid-2019 but till today, the dug-up section has not been properly relaid with bitumen coating by the Greater Chennai Corporation. Instead, the stretch has been roughly levelled with sand and construction debris. Now, Tangedco has dug up the road which is opposite the portion dug up by CMWSSB. It was this space that was spared for the public to use. “Rajamannar Salai is a narrow road; therefore we want the Chennai Corporation to relay the section dug up by CMWSSB at the earliest,” says K. Prasanna, a resident of K.K. Nagar.

Residents also pointed out that they find driving on the stretch at night quite unsafe as overgrown avenue trees block the light from street lamps.

West Sivan Koil Street and South Sivan Koil Street which are parallel to Vijaya Road have one-way traffic flow.

Therefore, drivers of auto-rickshaws and cars try to use the narrow Vijaya Road. Walkers find this road unsafe at night as it does not have adequate street lights.

363,2020/02/15,‘Legacy waste’ at Athipet dumping ground being cleared,"A bio-mining exercise is going on for around five months now

There is huge machinery, with its various components linked together. Next to a garbage-hill, it looks dwarfed, like a caterpillar. But this caterpillar is quietly “chewing away” at the garbage mound, segregating it into reusable categories of waste.

Welcome to the dumping ground in Athipet that is undergoing a bio-mining exercise.

Athipet is a small industrial area off the Chennai–Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road in Zone 7 of Great Chennai Corporation. To the wider world, Athipet is often unfortunately identified with its dumping ground. Reportedly, the Athipet dumping ground was created three decades ago when the neighbourhood of Ambattur was a village panchayat under the Villivakkam Panchayat Union in Tiruvallur district.

In October 2019, a bio-mining exercise was started at the Athipet dumping ground. It has been a welcome news for residents of Athipet and surrounding areas, as the dumping ground is a health hazard. It also have the infamous reputation of being the biggest dumping ground in the western part of Chennai. Besides, the Athipet dumping ground is located near Ambattur lake.

“Following a detailed study carried out by the Anna University, we started bio-mining work in 2019, with a deadline of two years to clear the entire garbage lying in the dumping ground,” says G. Tamilselvan, Zonal Officer, Zone - 7, Greater Chennai Corporation.

At present, the Athipet dump site has decades-old waste of 86,000 cubic metres (one cubic metre is equal to 1,000 kgs) that will be biomined. Between October 2019 and January this year, 10,428 cubic metres of old garbage have been bio-mined.

Corporation officials point out that the bio-mining exercise will clear only the decades-old garbage at the dumping ground. For fresh waste. Athipet is used as the transit point for garbage, before it is dumped in the Kodungaiyur dumping ground. There are no alternative plans yet, the officials point out.

Every day, on an average, around 320 MT (metric tonnes) of garbage is generated in the Ambattur zone.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tjpb7u/article30829113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16dcathipetJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/legacy-waste-at-athipet-dumping-ground-being-cleared/article30829114.ece
364,2020/02/15,Highways fences open space along service lane near Nazarathpet,"Residents of nearby localities seek frequent police patrolling and better lighting

A week ago, the State Highways Department fenced the open space along the service lane below the bridge bordering Nazarathpet and Poonamallee (near Poonamalle High Road) after clearing the garbage there. This measure has also prevented heavy-vehicles such as lorries from being parked there. The open space was being misused as a spor for giving such vehicles a wash. These were factors hindering free flow of traffic on the service lane.

“Mounds of garbage were inviting stray dogs and cattle, which would take motorists by surprise. Hence, fencing of the open space was essential. Next, LED street lights and reflectors need to be installed. At present, the lane receives illumination from street lights on the bridge which is not sufficient,” says says B. Selvam, a resident from Porur.Residents of near-by localities suggest that police should patrol the service lane as well. Most of the traffic police personnel are deployed in front of Saveetha Medical College on Poonamallee High Road. But the service lane remains neglected. In fact, police stations in Mangadu and Thiruverukadu have received complaints of chain snatching and lifting of cell phones. As patrolling is poor on the service lane, some people tend to drive on the wrong side of the road, especially motorcyclists.

365,2020/02/15,A covered walkway will soon link Metro station with Chintadripet MRTS station,"The walkway will help commuters who want to switch from MRTS to the Metro or vice versa, officials said

In a bid to help passengers walk effortlessly from Chintadripet MRTS station to Government Estate Metro Rail station, Chennai Metro Rail has begun building a covered walkway.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), this will help commuters who want to switch from MRTS to Chennai Metro or vice versa.

The walkway will start from one of the entry/exit points of the station and go all the way till the entry of May Day Park and Chintadripet station. The work is likely to be finished in a few weeks.

“There are many who now walk from Government Estate Metro Rail station to the MRTS station. And it is quite difficult to walk through now, as the footpath is not in great shape. This walkway will ensure people can easily move from one mode to another,” an official said.

Government Estate Metro Rail station currently handles nearly 1,500-2,000 passengers a day. Now, CMRL has been in the process of connecting the subways near the station too, so that commuters can easily walk from one end to another in this stretch of Anna Salai, avoiding the heavy traffic on the stretch and the haphazard parking on the roadside.

Officials said the work on linking the subways with the stations is almost over and is likely to be opened within a weeks’ time. “We are taking steps to provide all kinds of connectivity and improve the facilities to help people walk to our station without any hassles. This way, we hope more commuters use the Metro rail,” another official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/c22964/article30828888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15FEBTH--GOVTESTATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-covered-walkway-will-soon-link-metro-station-with-chintadripet-mrts-station/article30828889.ece
366,2020/02/15,New centralised kitchen soon for Chennai’s school breakfast scheme,"The new kitchen will have the capacity to feed 12,000 children

Nurturing children is equivalent to nurturing the future of our nation, and healthy children develop better learning and understanding abilities, said Governor of Tamil Nadu Banwarilal Purohit on Saturday.

The Governor was speaking at the bhoomi puja of Akshaya Patra Foundation’s new centralised kitchen at Mackey’s garden,Greams Road for the Kaalai Unnavu Thittam. Under the scheme, Akshaya Patra Foundation and the Greater Chennai Corporation have joined hands to provide free, nutritious breakfast for students in corporation schools in the city.

“The first meal of the day is crucial in meeting the nutritional requirements of the students and children who consume a healthy breakfast show signs of improved cognitive and academic outcomes. We have always believed in serving underprivileged children in Tamil Nadu and using this opportunity, the Raj Bhavan has sanctioned ₹5 crore and signed an MoU with the Foundation to expand the breakfast scheme for students,” Mr Purohit said.

The Kalai Unavu Thittam scheme was inaugurated last year and nearly 5,000 children from Corporation schools are currently being provided with free breakfast prepared at the first centralised kitchen in Thiruvanmiyur.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said that the government was keen on expanding the scheme to cover more schools across the city. “To ensure that more students in Corporation schools are benefited, the Corporation has leased land for two kitchens at Greams Road and Perambur Barracks Road. We thank the Governor for granting funds for the same,” he said.

The kitchen at Greams Road will have the capacity to prepare meals for 12,000 children and the kitchen at Perambur Barracks will have the capacity to feed 15,000 children.

Madhu Pandit Dasa, chairman, Akshaya Patra, said they were working towards ensuring children had access to nutritious and tasty food. “Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and this initiative will play a crucial role in our campaign against classroom hunger.

367,2020/02/15,Chennai Metro decides to step up frisking of passengers at stations,"Baggage too, will be scanned more thoroughly, especially at Chennai Central and Chennai Airport stations, officials have decided

After a high-level review meeting held recently, Chennai Metro Rail has decided to improve frisking of passengers and baggage checking at all stations.

Sources said a few officials at the meeting had raised concerns that frisking of passengers has to be thorough and no one should be missed. “A key point in the discussion was that some of the passengers are left out without being checked in some stations. Also, there attention has to be given while scanning baggage too, especially at Chennai Central and Chennai airport Metro Rail stations,” a source said.

A few passengers have taken to Twitter to express their concern. Pawan Kumar, a commuter posted: “@cmrlofficial you have major security issue at airport metro where a passenger can simply buy a token and enter the metro train without going through the security check That too on republic day. I don’t find it right or safe at all.”

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the security and frisking of passengers has been very diligent and there are no lapses. “We don’t leave any passenger without frisking or checking. We are thorough with scanning of baggage too and the security personnel employed monitor everything without fail. If passengers have any problem, they can always reach out to the station controller or call the customer care,” an official said.

368,2020/02/15,Residents of Madhavaram demand Thanikachalam Nagar drain be restored as a flood water carrier,"For five years now, residents living along Thanikachalam Nagar drain, Madhavaram, have not opened windows in their houses, because of a stench of sewage and the menace of mosquitoes. Residents complain that the surplus course from Retteri lake has turned into a sewage carrier over the past few years.

The two-km long canal was formed about two decades ago to mitigate flooding in Kolathur, Thanikachalam Nagar and neighbouring areas. It carries excess water from Retteri, travels through United India Colony, Kolathur and 18 colonies in Thanikachalam Nagar, including Balaji Nagar and Kumaran Nagar before joining Captain Cotton Canal near Moolakadai.

Members of the Federation of Thanikachalam Nagar Residents’ Welfare Associations recalled that nearly 17 feet of space was acquired from the 40-ft road to form the canal two decades ago. Residents had signed for the project as it would reduce flooding. But now, the canal is more of a sewage carrier as raw sewage is being pumped into the canal from Anjugam Nagar, Kolathur.

Residents complained that Chennai Metrowater released sewage into the canal twice a day citing insufficient capacity that caused bursts in pipelines. Direct discharge of sewage is evident in many locations of the canal, the residents said.

M. Damodaran, former president of Swami Ramalinga Colony Residents’ Welfare Association, said the canal runs along the compound wall of many houses. “We don't have space for parking vehicles and have to cross a small path to reach our house from the road. Relatives avoid visiting our houses fearing health hazards and stench. We agreed for the construction of the canal as it was to convey flood water during monsoon. Several complaints have been made to arrest sewage discharge into the canal,” he said.

Officials of the Water Resources Department said improvement works of Thanikachalam Nagar drain, which carries flood water from Retteri lake and Kolathur, have been included in the ₹3,000 crore proposal for permanent flood mitigation. Besides repairing retaining wall and desilting the canal, work would be taken up to arrest sewage.

Metrowater has also started work to improve capacity of sewer network and the release into the canal would be stopped soon, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ql6tg8/article30828399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15FEBTH-RETTERI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-of-madhavaram-demand-thanikachalam-nagar-drain-be-restored-as-a-flood-water-carrier/article30828400.ece

Even as private tanker operators carrying milk from and to various Aavin dairies in the State continued their strike, demanding a hike in the rates for transportation of milk, Aavin, the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation, said that arrangements were in place to ensure milk supplies to Chennai and elsewhere.

“We already have enough milk to ensure supply till Monday morning. A total of 150 tankers are required to bring the city’s 12 lakh litres a day from the dairies and carry the remaining 18 lakh litres to other dairies. Aavin has its own fleet of 60 tankers. we have mobilised another 120 from the neighbouring States and from contractors supplying to private brands,” said Aavin managing director M. Vallalar.

Operators’ demand

On the increase in transportation rates sought by private tanker operators, he said that it was for Aavin’s board-level tender committee to fix the rates. “Negotiations are on to ensure a fair price. As it is, our margins are very slim,” he explained.

S.A. Sengottuvelu and M.G. Rajendran, of the Tamil Nadu Milk Producers’ Welfare Association, in a statement urged the Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to blacklist one particular contractor, who had formed a syndicate, had bent tender rules to be able to participate in it and was holding Aavin, the consumers, and the government to ransom.

The transport contract ended in December 2018, and after that, operators have been operating on extensions. Following talks on Saturday, R. Subramanian, president of the Aavin Contract Lorry Owners’ Association, said, “The talks are continuing and there hasn’t been any significant progress. We are continuing the strike. We stopped operating our trucks since we could not continue operating at the present rates. There are about 315 trucks under the association,” he said.

Tamil Nadu Milk Dealers’ Employees’ Welfare Association president S.A. Ponnusamy said Aavin should ensure that consumers are not affected due to the strike.

Informed sources said that the old rates were ₹20.50 a km for tankers with 9-KL capacity and ₹24.50/km for tankers with a capacity of 15 KL. The new rates proposed by Aavin are ₹26/km for the 9-KL tankers and ₹34.50/km for 15-KL tankers.

After a while, 60 families from the community sit around the same lamp post and have dinner — this is the plight of the Irular families who were relocated from the adjacent Thadur village in Tiruttani six months ago since they were living near a waterbody.

“Till date, we have been living in huts without water, power, transport or medical facilities. All families have dinner under the lamp post,” said B. Sekhar, ward member of the Thadur panchayat, who is part of the community.

V. Anthony, CPI(M) member, who is working with the community, said the relocation had affected the livelihood of the families. “Most of them are agricultural labourers. Their Aadhar cards, voter IDs, ration cards and other documents have addresses of their previous dwelling units. All families desire to return to Thadur village,” he said.

Mr. Anthony said that houses were being built for nine families. “Construction has begun, and the remaining are living in huts,” he said.

C. Khader Basha, Veeraganallur panchayat president, said that since there were no buses, the children from the Irular community were forced to walk to school. “Other villagers also face the same problem. We even passed a gram sabha resolution to improve bus service. We also a need a primary health centre. Now we have to travel 10 km to Tiruttani for quality treatment,” he said.

Mr. Basha added that they had made arrangements for water for the Irular settlement. “We have dug a borewell and the 60 families will not face any water problems,” he said.

A local administration official said that power supply would be provided in the coming days.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5kjqf5/article30825148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THIRULAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/irular-community-in-tiruttani-struggles-for-basic-facilities/article30825149.ece
375,2020/02/15,"PSBB, Petit Seminaire win The Hindu Young World Quiz","Puducherry school wins in seniors category and city institution in juniors

Did you know Mahatma Gandhi walked 24 days from Sabarmati to Dandi for the Salt Satyagraha? Are you aware that Anaimudi is the highest peak outside the Himalayan mountain ranges?

These are some of the questions that were posed in the finals of the 20th edition of The Hindu Young World Quiz that took place at A.M. Jain School in the city on Friday evening.

While a team from PSBB, K.K. Nagar, comprising M. Prateek and Shiv Nirmal won the juniors category, Eswar Balaji K. and Sanjai S. from Petit Seminaire Higher Secondary School, Puducherry, won the seniors category.

The runners-up in the juniors category were S. Arnav and Niranjan Shyam from PSBB, T. Nagar, and H. Sanjana Bhat and Krishangh from the same school came second in the seniors category.

The winners walked away with electric cycles, trophies and certificates.

The hall in the school was abuzz when the quiz started in the morning with students from the audience jumping in excitement to answer questions that participants could not. Quiz master V.V. Ramanan shot questions ranging from science and mythology to sports at the participants.

Mr. Ramanan used a numbered grid in the final round of the senior category. The teams also had to identify the personality, whose picture was hidden behind the grid. The picture was that of bollywood actor Sharukh Khan and five out of six teams identified him.

The title sponsor of the event was LIC and the other sponsors were Canara Bank, FIITJEE, Amrita School of Engineering, CK Motors Private Ltd and Eveready Industries, A.M.

376,2020/02/15,"Now, take your cycle on Metro","Move will encourage people to use sustainable transport

In a first, commuters taking the Chennai Metro can carry their own bicycles on trains.

The move, aimed at encouraging people to use sustainable and eco-friendly transportation, comes in the wake of several requests from passengers. But the bicycles have to be small and handy.

According to Chennai Metro Rail Limited officials, numerous passengers have asked if they could take their bicycles inside the trains. This was however not permitted due to multiple reasons.

“We have been mulling the idea for sometime, and have decided to let commuters take their bicycles in, as this will help many. Though we have provided cycles at several stations, some don’t use them because they have their own bicycles or due to other reasons. Now they can just board from one station, get off at another, and cycle to their destination,” an official said.

Sources said commuters who take their cycles would have to ensure that their vehicles don’t occupy a lot of space or be a hindrance to the others.

“Our request to commuters is to carry really compact bicycles or foldable ones and bring them safely, without causing any inconvenience to the other passengers,” an official said.

Commuters were happy about the decision.

Swetha V, a resident of Alwarpet, said she took an auto to the Teynampet station, to head to Anna Nagar for work.

“Every day, I spend nearly ₹50 on auto. I already own a cycle, and now I might as well cycle to the station,” she added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1tyq9s/article30825115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THMETRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/now-take-your-cycle-on-metro/article30825116.ece
377,2020/02/15,A billion dollar project for sustainable growth of Chennai,"Plan comprises urban mobility, water resilience, urban governance and finance

The State government will launch ‘Chennai City Partnership’, a unique model of development co-operation with the World Bank, to ensure continued sustainable growth of Metropolitan Chennai, said Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam.

Presenting the Budget on Friday, he said that the project comprises three major pillars — urban mobility, water resilience and urban governance and finance. “The World Bank assistance indicated for the Chennai City Partnership is $1 billion. Approvals will be obtained for specific programmes and projects during the year 2020-21,” said Mr. Panneerselvam.

A provision of ₹350 crore has been made in the Budget estimates for 2020-21 “in anticipation of early approval” for the ‘Integrated Storm Water Drain Network’ covering a distance of 765 km in the extended areas of Chennai in the Kosasthalaiyar river basin at a total cost of ₹2,518 crore. “The Greater Chennai Corporation has prepared a project and sent it to the Asian Development Bank for assistance,” he said.

River eco-restoration

“The work on eco-restoration of the Cooum river is nearing completion and that of the Adyar river is in progress. In the next stage, the government will take up the ecorestoration of the Buckingham Canal and its drains and all the drains of the Cooum and Adyar at a total cost of ₹5,439.76 crore,” he said.

In the first phase, the government has already sanctioned an amount of ₹1,001 crore for sewage mitigation schemes. The overall outlay includes a sum of ₹3,339.90 crore for construction of dwelling units by the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board.

The Finance Minister said in this financial year, so far, the State did not face any major disaster. The government has utilised the period of lull to effectively prepare against future disasters. A total of 4,399 vulnerable areas have been identified and interdepartmental zonal teams have been formed for immediate response.

The Chennai Coastal Flood Warning System (C-FLOWS) has been developed for issuing multi-hazard early warning in the Greater Chennai Corporation areas in association with the National Centre for Coastal Research.

The government has proposed the Comprehensive Flood Mitigation Project for Greater Chennai to the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank at a total cost of ₹3,000 crore as a follow-on project to the Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project, which will be coming to a successful completion.

In the Budget estimates for 2020-21, a sum of ₹1,360.11 crore is provided for disaster management,” he said.

Desalination plants

Metrowater has taken up the construction of a 150-MLD seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) desalination plant at Nemmeli with KfW assistance at a cost of ₹1,259 crore. In the Budget, ₹500 crore has been provided. The government has accorded administrative sanction for the implementation of 400-MLD SWRO plant at Perur near Chennai at a project cost of ₹6,078.40 crore, with funding assistance of ₹4,267.70 crore from the Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA). A consultant for detailed design has been appointed and works on the project will commence shortly, he said.

“There is an urgent necessity to improve the water supply system in the city to minimise water losses. The underground sewerage system needs to be extended to 14 more added areas of Chennai city. Tertiary treatment facility will be established to treat 260 MLD of secondary treated sewage. To fulfil the requirements, Metrowater has prepared the Climate Resilient Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project at a cost of ₹4,500 crore and posted it to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for financing,” Mr. Panneerselvam said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/d89q8a/article30827194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-chen-gr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-billion-dollar-project-for-sustainable-growth-of-the-city/article30825109.ece
378,2020/02/15,Coins and stamps exhibition in Vellore that takes you back in time,"The display will be open till 7 p.m. on February 16

The annual Numismatics and Philately Exhibition organised by the Numismatic and Philatelic Association of Vellore Fort is on at Town Hall here.

The three day exhibition was inaugurated by Vellore District Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram in the presence of P. Komal Kumar, Superintendent of Post Offices, Vellore Division, and T. Rajendiran of Laxmi Garden and Springdays School, on Friday. The exhibition will be open till 7 p.m. on Sunday.

Nearly 500 coins are displayed by C. Thamizhvanan, president of the organising association. He has displayed some of his prized collections such as the bend bar coins of Taxila (now a region in Pakistan), Sakya Janapadha (600-500 B.C., Buddha’s dynasty), and Asmaka Janapadha (600-500 B.C.).

A rare coin issued in commemoration of the victory of King Rajendra Chola over the Ganges region and coins on the Arcot rulers including Khan Sahib (also known as ‘Marudhanayagam’) are part of the display.

Every coin in his possession has a story behind it. He explained how some coins of the Arcot rulers have Tamil script on them, perhaps implying the integration of the languages. “Coins come in various materials, textures and shapes,” he said, pointing to the square, octagonal and circlar coins.

Some other coins on display are from Gandhara, the Pandya, Maurya and Vijayanagara dynasty, Chera period and those that belonged to ruler Ashoka and the Nizam of Hyderabad.

The exhibition also includes some commemorative coins such as the 150th year celebrations of the Indian Railways (2003), the platinum jubilee celebrations of the Dhandi March (2005) and the 100-rupee and 5-rupee commemorative coins released on the occasion of the birth centenary of Kamaraj (2004).

379,2020/02/15,"One Asia, two perspectives","The Asian economic story has moved from pessimism to optimism — a subject for two economists, over 50 years apart

In 1968, Gunnar Myrdal, distinguished Swedish economist and later a Nobel Laureate, published his three-volume Asian Drama. Its subtitle, An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations, reflecting Adam Smith’s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, was meant to convey that it should be seen as a modern epic.

That the economies of Asian countries, perhaps mainland Asian countries excluding Japan, were in dire poverty in the early part of the 20th century was widely accepted. But in the middle of the century they became independent countries and UN members that called for necessary changes in diplomatic parlance. The poor countries became “underdeveloped” (and rich countries “developed”) and development became the central idea in official and scholarly discourse. And soon the crux of the problem was identified too. The underdeveloped economies were caught in a “low-level equilibrium trap” — low incomes, low savings, low investment — and thus a built-in inability to grow. The remedy, of course, was foreign aid accompanied by labour-intensive technologies.

Myrdal refused to fall in line. It is hazardous to summarise what took Myrdal 2,000 pages to analyse Asian countries and then to arrive at his own pessimistic conclusion about the continent’s prospect. As an economist, he used the standard concepts of the profession, but what he put forward as the “social system” had additional features: attitude towards life and work and institutions in general. Expounding these special features of Asia took the major part of Asian Drama.

Value comparison

Myrdal made a comparison of “Western values” and “Asia Values”. Among the latter he included survival mindedness; irresponsiveness to opportunities for betterment; scorn for manual labour; unwillingness to work for others; superstitious beliefs and irrational outlook; submission to authority and exploitation; low aptitude for cooperation. Combine these with what Myrdal considered to be institutions specific to Asia — underdeveloped institutions for enterprise, employment and credit; imperfections in the authority of government agencies; low standards of efficiency and integrity in public administration. Add to these the caste system and the joint or extended family, and Asia emerges substantially different from western nations. He was willing to concede that radical policy measures could bring about change in Asian countries, but thought that social, cultural and religious attitudes made it virtually impossible to realise changes via that route. Asian countries, therefore, were caught in a poverty trap, he felt.

While working on Asian Drama, Myrdal was possibly not aware that another scholar was working on Asian economic development in historical perspective. Angus Maddison in several of his historical studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, especially The World Economy in the Twentieth Century (1989) pointed out that in 1820, just two centuries ago, Asia accounted for almost two thirds of the world population and three fifths of the world’s income. China and India put together accounted for half the world population and world income. That is, Asia (China and India in particular) was not always at the bottom of the pit and poverty was not its characteristic feature.

Another recent study on Asia is Resurgent Asia: Diversity in Development by Deepak Nayyar (Oxford, 2019). Some readers may remember that he was one-time Chief Economic Adviser, Government of India as also Vice-Chancellor, Delhi University. In the book, he recalls that when Asian Drama came out in 1968, he was a graduate student in Oxford University and that the pessimistic outlook about Asia was widely prevalent in academic circles. Nearly 50 years later (and after holding academic positions in different parts of globe and authoring many books), he decided to take a closer look at Asia, by now noted for its diversity in development.

Nayyar saw that the two Asian giants, China and India, contributed close to 60% of the global manufacturing production and an even larger proportion of manufactured exports until around 1750. However, over the next two centuries, the Industrial Revolution in Britain brought about a radical transformation of the situation that changed the profile completely, except for the outlier, Japan. During the second half of the 20th century, the situation has changed again as is widely known. It began with the East Asian tigers, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Soon others joined, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia; then, of course, China and India. The economic profile of Asia has completely changed.

A diverse Asia

These changes indicated too that Asia cannot be and should not be treated as a single unit; social, cultural and economic conditions are significantly different among Asian countries, much more than in other continents, Europe for instance. Initially, the author considers four sub-regions, East Asia, South East Asia, South Asia and West Asia, and then 14 states. The states are China, South Korea and Taiwan in the East; Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam in Southeast, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka in the South and Turkey in the West.

The colonial era witnessed a precipitous decline in Asia’s economic position. By 1962, Asia’s share in the world population diminished to 50%, while its share in global income fell sharply to 15%. And by 1965-70, Asia was the poorest continent. For China and India taken together these shares plunged to 35% and 8%, respectively. The share of China and India in world manufacturing production collapsed from 47% in 1830 to 5% in 1963. By the second decade of the present century, things had changed drastically, but also differentially in the subregions and countries. East Asia was the leader and South Asia was the laggard with South East Asia in the middle.

Taking the Asia-14 together, the author describes the economic growth of the past 50 years as “stunning” with China being the star performer. In all instances where growth was impressive, high levels of investment and savings were the main drivers which must have come as a bit of a shock to all who in an earlier period considered the Asian “poor” countries of being incapable of generating high savings. The pattern in many countries including China was rapid investment growth coinciding with increasing exports. Education too contributed towards raising growth rates. Many countries have been experiencing lower levels of growth in the 21st century.

Moving to services

Nayyar then turns to the structural transformation of economies which goes with economic growth. What is considered as the standard pattern is for labour force to move from agriculture (A) to manufacturing and industry (M) and then to services (S) and this pattern is seen in the case of South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. In India and several other countries in South East, there was an exit from A, not much into M, but significantly into S.

The move into the S sector was partially into productive activity, but more so into transactions of different kinds, including stock market activities. It also manifests as unemployment and under-employments of various shades.

Of equal importance is the fact that the big economies of Asia, notably China and India which began their development strategies as closed economies opened up to international trade and capital movements subsequently, and have become notable players in what since the turn of the 21st century at least has come to be referred to as “the global economy”.

Nayyar also notes that the growth of the Asia economies has considerably reduced the percentage of their population considered to be below the poverty line. But that has been accompanied by sharp increases in inequalities of income and more so of wealth in democratic India and even communist China which also raises questions about the future. Obviously the transformation of Asia during the past 50 years has been phenomenal, and there can be little doubt that in the next 50 years, Asia’s multifaceted economic performance will continue and by the beginning of the next century, if not earlier, China will overtake the United States as the largest economy. Indeed, three other economies to claim top positions will most likely be from Asia — India, Indonesia and Japan and many other Asian countries may also do well, a far cry from the pessimism that was the cardinal note of Myrdal’s Asian Drama. And yet there will be problems too. Absolute poverty may be minimal by 2030, but the poverty-inequality-unemployment nexus may continue. There are also the challenges of technology and environmental consequences. But these are global issues and will affect other economies also. Nayyar’s concluding words are optimistic. “There can be little doubt that, circa 2050,... Asia will account for more than one-half of world income, and will be home for more than one-half the people on earth. It will, thus, have an economic and political significance in the world that would have been difficult to imagine fifty years ago....”

382,2020/02/15,Invisibilising poverty,"The walling off of roadside slums in Ahmedabad, so that their existence is made invisible to U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has come in for a lot of flak, and rightly so. It has illustrated that the BJP-led governments at the Centre and in Gujarat suffer from a certain complex that refuses to accept the nation as it is.

It is ‘cultural bankruptcy’ and negates what Mahatma Gandhi’s loincloth symbolised — identification with the poor. It simply does not match BJP’s big talk on ‘patriotism’ and its espousal of the cause of the country’s impoverished. It manifests the BJP’s make-up, mindset and worldview.

This was apparently done to shield Trump’s convoy from the sight of slums on the assumption that the visiting Americans could not but see them as ‘eyesores’. The slum-dwellers are human and sentient like the rest of the population. They are the ineluctable victims of an unjust and inequitable social and economic order. They are ‘human flotsam and jetsam’, to borrow one of Edward Said’s eloquent phrases. It is inhuman to subject them to humiliation in this manner. No political party says that it doesn’t need the votes of the slum-dwellers.

It is reasonable to ask why the money spent on the ‘beautification drive’ should not have been better spent on improving the living conditions of the slum-dwellers. Nobody is against Ahmedabad and adjacent places being given a facelift, but it should not be at the cost of insulting poverty. Half of the population in our country is living at or below the poverty line.

Penury is not as much a crime as rapacity. The veneer of prosperity created to impress a world leader cannot make the dehumanising poverty suffered by millions of Indians non-existent. The poverty-stricken slum-dwellers are unlikely to be represented at the high-profile Kem Chho (Howdy Trump) event.

Rabindranath Tagore prayed: Give me the strength never to disown the poor or bend my knees before the insolent might. That’s a prayer the rulers should do well to learn and live by.

386,2020/02/15,Crime and politics,"The Supreme Court judgment ordering political parties to publish the “entire criminal history” of their candidates for the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections and the reasons for their selection is one more step in the judiciary’s endeavour to make politics free of criminals (Front page, “Publish criminal history of candidates, SC orders parties,” Feb. 14). But this verdict may not actually prevent parties from fielding candidates with criminal cases, as they can escape by telling that the candidate in question has ‘since been reformed’ or has been ‘striving hard to help the poor people in society’ or giving some such concocted reason. Further, given the fact that people have been electing candidates with criminal cases with huge margins for a long time, knowing fully well their criminal history, the publication of the same in the media may not make much of a difference. There are a large number of factors such as caste, money, liquor, local leaders’ influence, material inducements, traditional party affiliations, promises of all kinds by parties, etc. influencing the voters at the time of elections. Amidst the charged atmosphere of elections, the criminal history of the candidate disappears into the background. As such, the Supreme Court should have taken a more proactive stand on the issue and framed concrete guidelines to be followed by the Election Commission to prevent persons with criminal cases from contesting elections.

Kosaraju Chandramouli,

Hyderabad

The Supreme Court’s directive to parties reveal the criminal antecedents of candidates may not have a telling bearing on the outcome of future elections but is, to some extent, a step in the right direction. True, this may discourage the fielding of tainted candidates and some of the present politicians may not be in the fray. But, their close aides may get a chance to contest and win elections, only to act at their behest. There is another dimension to India’s electoral scenario due to which unethical practices cannot be totally ruled out. A majority of the Indian voters have been conditioned to expect something in return for casting their votes and this has, of late, become a norm. Once leaders get elected, this modus operandi makes corruption in their functioning unavoidable. In such cases, the desirability of candidates becomes secondary, if not irrelevant when voters make their choice. Unless the voters realise the value of their votes, nothing much can be done. Self-realisation is the only way in which the system can be cleansed.

V. Lakshmanan,

Tirupur, Tamil Nadu

It may seem uncharitable to naysay a well-meant judicial nudge to make politics free of criminals, but the harsh reality is the Supreme Court’s order that political parties should publicise the criminal antecedents of candidates and justify their nomination may not cause sleepless nights to parties and tainted politicians. Public shaming can only work if it evokes opprobrium. Neither are criminal candidates apologetic about their background, nor are voters unduly bothered about it. The candidate’s caste and wealth override criminality’s stigma, if any. Caste and money amplify the criminal's intimidatory and coercive potential, imparting a cumulative boost to their electability.

It is most likely that parties will comply with the judicial order in letter perfunctorily rather than respect its spirit by refusing to nominate candidates with criminal backgrounds. Justifying the candidature of criminals will not tax the ingenuity of parties. For instance, ‘a love for public service’ can ostensibly justify the nomination of tainted candidates.

The judiciary, which seeks to crack the whip on criminality, is also part of the problem because of its inability and unwillingness to wrap up criminal cases in a time-bound manner. In the absence of sentencing, a chargesheet is not proof of culpability. The dynamics of electoral politics seem impervious to the diktats of judicial wrath and moral censure.

V.N. Mukundarajan,

Thiruvananthapuram

The Supreme Court decision has not come a day too soon. It is alarming that the percentage of MPs with criminal cases pending against them rose to 43 in 2019 from 24 in 2014. The undeniable fact is that every party is ‘fond’ of fielding candidates with criminal history as long as they bring in ‘winnability’ as an additional factor or protective cover. The Central government’s failure to enact laws to ban those involved in serious crimes from contesting elections and becoming party officials despite the September 2018 Supreme Court order is baffling and disquieting. The onus is on the electorate to be more alert and watchful and summarily reject candidates having criminal antecedents. After all, “in a democracy, people get the government they deserve and they deserve what they get”.

387,2020/02/15,"Warmer days, nights in Mumbai signal summer may be here soon, say experts","Maximum temperature rises to 35.1°C on Friday

Daytime temperatures have been steadily climbing in the city, with maximum temperature reaching 35.1 degrees Celsius on Friday, four degrees above normal.

Even the nights have been warmer, with minimum temperature staying above 20 degrees Celsius. Though the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has not officially declared it, weather experts believe these to be signs of the onset of summer.

Rising trend

On Thursday, maximum temperature was 35.7 degrees Celsius, a sharp rise from Wednesday’s 34.5 degrees. The trend continued with Friday’s 35.1 degrees. The minimum temperature on Friday, too, was 21.6 degrees Celsius, also four degrees above normal.

The IMD has forecast more or less similar temperature for the rest of the week. The all-time highest maximum temperature for the month is 39.6 degrees Celsius, recorded on February 25, 1966.

Marginal dip

While weather experts have forecast a slight, but not significant, drop in temperature later this month.

Mahesh Palawat, vice president of meteorology at private forecaster Skymet Weather, said, “This was an unusually short winter and temperatures will only rise now. The next 48 hours may see a drop of 1 or 2 degrees, following which there will be a gradual rise. The northerly-northeasterly winds were limited up to Rajasthan this year, owing to which Konkan and Mumbai did not see much cold. And now, the western disturbance has weakened. You can call this the onset of summer as daytime temperature will now be in mid 30s and nights will be pleasant. Temperatures will only rise now.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/warmer-days-nights-in-mumbai-signal-summer-may-be-here-soon-say-experts/article30825502.ece

He is being given rank of Cabinet Minister. This was announced late on Friday night by the Chief Minister’s Office.

The decision to appoint such a committee was taken before the Union Budget last month at a meeting called by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray of all MPs from Maharashtra.

At the meeting, all MPs had voiced the need for a coordinated effort to push projects from Maharashtra in Delhi to ensure speedy delivery.

389,2020/02/15,"Gloves, caps to be mandatory for street food vendors soon","FDA to also crackdown on adulteration of milk and edible oil

Every roadside food stall owner serving any type of food, especially snacks such pani-puri, bhel, vada-paav, will have to wear gloves and a cap. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne has given directions to the department to issue a circular and increase vigilance to ensure that the order is being followed.

“There are numerous stalls on roads and it has been observed that standards of sanitation and cleanliness are not followed. Despite various directions and circulars the standards remain pathetic. We have been directed to issue a circular making it mandatory for the stall owners to wear caps and gloves while serving food on road,” said an official from the FDA. The circular is likely to be issued by next week.

In addition, days after launching a drive against gutkha and roping in police officers to enforce it, the FDA has turned its attention to milk and edible oil adulteration.

On February 12, Mr. Shingne asked the FDA commissioner to submit the action taken report after conducting raids on places which are known as centres for adulteration of milk and edible oil. Mr. Shingne has asked the commissioner to ensure that the provisions under Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 are followed thoroughly..

“The directions are to target the source, which may include big dairies, oil companies, or packaging centres. As per the rules, repackaging of oil in reused tins is not allowed. There have been instances where such practice has been followed. In addition, milk adulteration remains a big problem in the State,” said the officer.

The drive against gutkha, launched by the government two weeks ago has resulted in seizure of gutkha worth ₹5 crore from Bhiwandi alone. “The department is struggling with shortage of Food Inspection Officers. We have only 265 sanctioned posts of which 40 are vacant. We will be filling up the posts soon,” he said, adding that the FDA can be contacted at 1800222365 or 26592361 to 65, in case of any complaints.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/l6v6mj/article30825468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMCHAATSTALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gloves-caps-to-be-mandatory-for-street-food-vendors-soon/article30825469.ece
390,2020/02/15,Mumbai Bagh: activists appear before police,"Next hearing on February 18

Activists Feroze Mithiborwala and Ali Bhojani on Friday appeared before Assistant Commissioner of Police (Tardeo division) Vinay Gadgil in connection with the notices served to them over the Mumbai Bagh protest in Mumbai Central.

The protest, which began on the night of January 26, entered its 19th day on Friday, with women continuing the sit-in on a relay basis under tight bandobast by the Nagpada police.

An offence had been registered against the protesters earlier this month.

Mr. Mithiborwala said they were served notices under Sections 107 and 111 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and asked to appear before Mr. Gadgil at 4 p.m. “The notices were served because the police thought we were the organisers of the sit-in on Morland Road. The protest is by the women of the city and we are only volunteers,” he said.

Chetan Mali, Mr. Mithiborwala’s lawyer, said, “We will be filing a reply to the notices. We had a dialogue with Mr. Gadgil and it went smoothly. The next hearing in the matter is scheduled for February 18.”

Mr. Gadgil said both the activists had appeared for the hearing, but declined to give more details.

391,2020/02/15,Hafiz Saeed must be hanged: Raza Academy,"Irrespective of what faith a terrorist believes in, he is a terrorist no matter, says Raza Academy chief

Members of the city-based Raza Academy on Friday demanded the death penalty for 26/11 Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed.

A Lahore-based Anti Terrorism Court on Thursday announced a 11-year jail term for Saeed in two terror financing cases. The verdict comes days before Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has to decide if Pakistan will stay in the ‘grey list’ for failure to curb money laundering to terror groups. If not removed off the list, Pakistan could face severe economic sanctions.

Alhaj Mohammad Syed Noori, chairperson of Raza Academy said only a death penalty will help spread awareness among youth to shun the path that leads to pain and suffering in others lives. “Irrespective of what faith a terrorist believes in, he is a terrorist no matter,” Mr. Noori said.

Some protesters also said that it is due to Pakistan’s lethargy that it took so long to come up with a verdict and that they are only acting on international pressure.

The protest was held after the afternoon prayer outside Bilal Masjid where protesters chanted slogans like Hindustan Zindabad, ‘Why only 11 years jail, Saeed must be hanged’, and ‘We believe in the Constitution of India.’

Mohammad Abbas, another protester said that unless Saeed was hanged he was sure that Muslims in India, especially members of Raza Academy will keep on protesting.

“Saeed who has attacked our nation and killed millions of innocent lives deserves the death sentence,” Mr. Abbas said.

Maulana Moin Miya, member of the Raza Academy said, “Terrorists need to be hanged and the 11 years sentence is very less for someone who is a betrayer of human rights. This is the appeal of our academy.”

Raees Ahmed Razvi, said that if Saeed is not hanged in Pakistan, the International Court of Justice should take matters into its hands.

Razvi Saleem Shehzad, said Saeed was an enemy of everyone, including Pakistan. “Saeed also helps in funding terrorists inside Pakistan and creating unrest there and it’s neighbouring countries. No innocent man will commit their life to recruiting terrorists and giving them lessons. There is no scope for change in the culprit even after 11 years,” Mr. Shehzaad said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3huajm/article30825431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMRAZAACADEMYPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hafiz-saeed-must-be-hanged/article30825433.ece

393,2020/02/15,More Air India flights from Mumbai to London,"By February 20, there will be 13 weekly flights between both cities

Air India on Friday launched the first of its 11 special flights between Mumbai and London Heathrow. These flights will operate in February and March.

The tri-weekly London-Heathrow flight will be followed up with another between Mumbai and London Stansted from February 20 taking the total frequency of flights between Mumbai and London to 13 per week, outgoing Air India chairman-managing-director Ashwani Lohani said adding that the first flight to Heathrow at 11.12 a.m. on Friday was full.

“On passenger demand, Air India is introducing 11 special flights from Mumbai to London Heathrow. This service will operate on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. We are in discussion with Heathrow to continue this service on a full-year basis and are hopeful our request will be accepted,” an airline spokesperson said.

Officials said Air India had been allotted ad hoc slots, which will not gain any historic precedence for future seasons. These are slots that other carriers have cancelled for various reasons. In January, Air India began flying its Boeing 777 jets on the Delhi-London sector, replacing the smaller 787 Dreamliner, which is now used on the Washington DC route. The national carrier already operates a 777 on the Mumbai-London route.

Air India has also suspended its operations to Hong Kong in view of the SARS-CoV-2 breakout from February 7 from Delhi to Hong Kong.

Air India has also cancelled some flights to Shanghai.

394,2020/02/15,Evening OPDs in 15 civic-run dispensaries from next week,"Service will be extended to 35 more centres in phase two

Starting next week, the outpatient department (OPD) in 15 dispensaries run by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will be open from 4 p.m. to 11 p.m.

The OPDs will function in the evenings to mainly cater to office-goers who cannot find time during the regular OPD hours from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The OPDs will be run on a public private partnership model in collaboration with Ruby Ailcare.

The BMC in its budget for 2020-2021 had allocated ₹1.28 crore to open evening OPDs. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We will run 15 OPDs in the first phase and gradually expand the service as more people learn about it and use it.” In the second phase of the project, the service will be extended to 35 more dispensaries.

The BMC has a three-tier health system with dispensaries and health posts at the primary level, peripheral hospitals at the secondary level and superspeciality hospitals at the tertiary level. There are 175 dispensaries spread across the city where local residents are encouraged to seek treatment for basic ailments.

“We are in the process of working out the final details with Ruby Ailcare with regard to coordination and training,” said Dr. Padmaja Keskar, BMC’s executive health officer. Dr. Keskar said while the BMC will provide infrastructure for the service, the private party will rope in doctors and paramedical staff.

Last month, KEM Hospital started the first evening OPD in the city from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. The hospital’s dean, Dr. Hemant Deshmukh, said the evening OPD witnesses a daily footfall of 60 patients.

Dr. Deshmukh said, “We run it from Monday to Saturday with two preventive and social medicine doctors, and one doctor each from medicine and surgery.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/v3ixji/article30825367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bmdispensaryrevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/evening-opds-in-15-civic-run-dispensaries-from-next-week/article30825368.ece

According to the police, Ashok Namdev Ghodekar, a resident of Hanuman Nagar in Turbhe Naka, lured his neighbour’s daughter to his house and molested her at 9.30 p.m. on May 27, 2016. “The girl ran home and narrated the incident to her mother,” police inspector Praveen Shedge, who investigated the case, said. The same night the girl’s parents filed a complaint with the Turbhe MIDC police. Mr. Shedge said, “We immediately arrested the accused who was a labourer at APMC market.

396,2020/02/15,A slice of Kolkata in Mumbai,"Two-day Eastbound Music Festival will be anchored by tabla maestro Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri

For the first time in Mumbai, a two-day music festival will feature performances by musicians from Kolkata who have a distinctive musical lineage and artistic personality.

Conceived and produced by First Edition Arts, the Eastbound Music Festival aims to encourage the propagation and preservation of Indian classical music in the country’s two major centres: Mumbai and Kolkata. Eastbound festival will take place at BN Vaidya Sabhagraha in Dadar this weekend.

Devina Dutt, the curator of the festival, believes that the folklore and anecdotes around Indian music has been the binding factor between the two cities. “Musicians travelling from one city to another help in widening the listening culture and taste of music lovers,” said Ms. Dutt, co-founder of First Edition Arts.

She added, “Exchanges between cities which promote a wider selection of musicians are a great way of making our cities and their art ecosystems open and vibrant.”

The festival will be anchored by legendary tabla maestro Padma Shri Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri, who will perform on both days, including a concluding tabla solo.

Ms. Dutt said, “[He will be accompanied] by Dilshad Khan on sarangi at the concluding session of the festival.”

The first day of the festival on Saturday will feature Agra gharana maestro Waseem Ahmed Khan, the great grandson of Ustad Atta Hussain Khan. Ahmed Khan is the 17th musician in the unbroken lineage of the gharana. Though music runs in his family, he believes that riyaaz (practise) is the key to becoming a successful musician. “I have always believed in presenting such ragas to the audience which are heard rarely,” said Ahmed Khan, adding that he will perform some of the ragas which are special to him and his gharana like Jaijaiwanti.

In the time when most people lack the patience to sit still, Ahmed Khan believes that the true depth of an artiste can only be witnessed when he has the talent and skill to perform a particular raga for more than an hour. “We used to have musical baithaks for around three hours in the olden days,” said Ahmed Khan, who is currently a guru at ITC Sangeet Research Academy, Kolkata.

Soulful: The first day of the festival will feature Waseem Ahmed Khan of Agra gharana (top), followed by a performance by sarod maestro Prattyush Banerjee.

Ahmed Khan’s session will be followed by sarod maestro Prattyush Banerjee, who has trained under Pandit Buddhadev Dasgupta. Though Banerjee belongs to the Senia- Shahjhanpur gharana, his style of playing is highly individualistic with traces of several other genres. He has taken lessons in Western music and is also a piano player. He will be accompanied by tabla virtuoso and Padma Shri awardee Swapan Chaudhari, who belongs to the Lucknow gharana.

The second day of the festival on Sunday will see Omkar Dadarkar performing at a morning session. Dadarkar has trained under Pandit Ulhas Kashalkar and Vidushee Girija Devi at ITC Sangeet Research Academy. Dadarkar hails from a family of Marathi Natyasangeet ( musical dramas) exponents and received his initial training from noted vocalist Manik Verma.

Ms. Dutt said she plans a similar music festival in Kolkata. “I will bring together artistes from Mumbai for the music lovers of Kolkata,” she said, emphasising that this festival is very personal for the First Edition Arts team who are from Kolkata. “They now consider Mumbai as their home and workplace as they have been here for the past three decades,” she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hhicg9/article30825269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Swapan-Chaudhuri02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-slice-of-kolkata-in-mumbai/article30825271.ece
397,2020/02/15,Kidnapping to woo lost love goes awry on Valentine’s Day,"Woman gets arrested for plotting abduction of one-year-old in Sion Koliwada

Willing to go to any lengths to win back her husband, a 38-year-old woman first lied to him about giving birth to their son and then tried to kidnap a one-year-old boy to sell her lie. The abduction went awry and the woman, along with an accomplice, was arrested on Friday.

The Wadala TT police said residents of New MHADA Colony in Sion Koliwada reported catching two kidnappers red-handed while they tried to abduct a boy from their locality in a tempo. Even before the police team reached the spot, reports of a “new child kidnapping ring which uses a tempo” operating in the city started doing the rounds on WhatsApp.

The police sped to the scene and found that the residents had vandalised the tempo and assaulted the two suspects, identified as Manoj Mishra (33) and Shaheen Shaikh (38), for allegedly trying to kidnap Aheel, the son of Sher Ali and Mumtaz Lohar. The residents told the police that the duo had barged into the Lohar residence and tried to flee with Aheel. However, Ms. Lohar started screaming for help and guests attending a social function in the building rushed to her aid.

Estranged husband

The police then took the suspects into custody, treated them for their injuries and initiated inquiries into the case. Soon, the police unravelled a tale of love, betrayal and desperation.

Assistant police inspector Pradeep Gite, Wadala TT police station, said, “Ms. Shaikh lived in the same locality earlier, but eloped with 22-year-old Roshan Tiwari, who lived in the neighbourhood. The duo got married and started living in Mira Road. However, a few years later, Mr. Tiwari left her and went to stay in his native place. A few months ago, Ms. Shaikh told Mr. Tiwari that she was pregnant with his child. Later, she informed him that she had given birth to a boy.”

Mr. Gite said Mr. Tiwari returned to Mira Road recently and started enquiring about the child. Then Ms. Shaikh’s sister, who lived near the Lohars in Sion Koliwada, told her about Aheel. Ms. Shaikh told Mr. Tiwari that her sister was looking after their son. Mr. Tiwari then told his brother-in-law, Mr. Mishra, to accompany Ms. Shaikh to bring back the boy.

Mr. Gite said, “The duo reached the locality in a tempo as Ms. Shaikh claimed that she wanted to collect some belongings from her sister’s house. Mr. Mishra went to the Lohar residence, with Ms. Shaikh following close behind, to pick up the child, but were caught and thrashed by the locals.”

The duo was then arrested and charged with kidnapping under the Indian Penal Code. They will be produced in court on Saturday, according to the police.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cy31ye/article30825189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMKidnapping,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kidnapping-to-woo-lost-love-goes-awry-on-valentines-day/article30825190.ece
398,2020/02/15,Modify YouTube video on Parachute oil: HC,"Court stays single Bench’s order

The Bombay High Court on Friday stayed the order of a single Bench directing Abhijeet Bhansali, a social media influencer, to pull down his controversial YouTube video ‘Is Parachute Coconut Oil 100% Pure?’.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Bharati Dangre was hearing a commercial appeal filed by Mr. Bhansali through his advocate, Abhinav Chandrachud, against the single Bench’s order passed on January 15.

In its 24-page order, the Bench said, prima facie, the single judge wrongly held that the appellant compared the respondent’s (Marico) product with an unknown product, which was a virgin coconut oil. The court said, “The learned single judge has overlooked the fact that even the respondent had claimed its oil to be a virgin coconut oil. Thus, prima facie, the four instances of falsehood in the judgment which we have extracted are found to be incorrect.”

The order said the appellant’s only error was to refer to the oil as an organic coconut oil. The court said this was a trivial error and did not mislead viewers.

The Bench said, “The signature tune of the presentation is that Parachute oil is not extracted from fresh coconuts and expeller pressed process is used to extract oil from copra. Due to this reason, the oil gets heated and loses its nutrients, rendering it money ill spent for external application on the body or garnishing. It is value for money for cooking only, but if coconut oil at a lesser price is available for cooking purposes, why pay more?”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/modify-youtube-video-on-parachute-oil-hc/article30825130.ece
399,2020/02/15,An ode to the common broad bean,"The wafting aroma of these winter beans was an annual ritual in our kitchen

I used to look forward to winter as a child growing up in Hyderabad, waiting to escape the city’s unrelenting heat through the year. Winter meant stories of seasonal food, mostly of avarakkai (Hyacinth beans/ broad beans), not available in Hyderabad around the year.

The meals at home, in our nuclear family, were always simple, fuss-free, vegetarian fare. My mother focused on eating local and seasonal — a guiding principle at home. As I write this, I wonder how this is the exact food concept that has taken over the world right now — of eating seasonal foods from the region.

Family affair

Come winter, the seasonal avarakkai would make its much-awaited appearance. My mom would regale us with stories of how shelling the beans and then removing the outer skin was once a family affair. She also spoke of how the best beans were the ones that had the characteristic sogadu — aroma of the beans harvested at the right time — and how the bean made its way into almost everything from idli, dosa, upma, rice, rasam and sambhar.

One winter my father returned from Bangalore with a bag full of avarakkai. The distinctive smell of the beans in a cloth bag is something I can never forget. Excited, my parents, sister and I sat together to shell the beans; I kept looking at my fingers change colour from the oily texture of the bean pod. My mother explained that sogadu is also when the bean is at its best size and flavour and is usually harvested after a spell of rainfall. The next few days were all about avarakkai — from avarakkai saaru (rasam), a recipe that she learnt from her mother, to avarakkai uppitu (upma) and akki roti (rice rotis).

However, my favourite was the hittaku avarebele huli (sambhar made with peeled beans). When I first tasted it, I knew it was unlike the regular sambhar we had at home. This one was made using the beans cooked in ground masala and not the traditional dal.

Sweet and fried

Years later when we shifted to Bengaluru, winters meant easy access to the much-loved avarakkai as well as seeing it in many other forms including in a halwa and as a fried savoury snack. At my first newspaper job in Bengaluru, the office canteen served it with poori and it tasted exactly like what we used to eat at home.

Winter is also when the avarakkai mela takes place at Bengaluru’s Sajjan Rao Circle, an annual affair that sees crowds throng to sample myriad interpretations of the bean. After visiting several editions of the festival, I can say that there is something new to look forward to every year.

The bean can make its appearance even in your pani puri and gulab jamun. The versatility of this bean and the way it blends into so many dishes is really like no other. People also believe that the name of the city was inspired by the bean as it was called Bendakala Ooru (the city of baked beans) that eventually became Bengaluru. Avarakkai, for me, is a food memory that I cherish and hold close to my heart.

400,2020/02/15,The British jhaal muri seller who popularised the snack in London,"Angus Denoon was back on the streets of Kolkata on Valentine’s Day, doing what he does best

It may not be uncommon for a British tourist to try jhaal muri on the streets of Kolkata, but it is quite rare when a British hawker deftly prepares the popular Bengali snack for the people of Kolkata.

On Valentine’s Day, Angus Denoon stationed himself outside a restaurant called Ekdalia Rd in south Kolkata, attracting customers throughout the evening. Many of them were already familiar with him: widely-shared YouTube videos showing him selling jhaal muri on the streets of London have already earned him minor celebrity status.

He set up the shop, even though only for an evening, on the invitation of restaurant owner Surojit Rout, who met Mr. Denoon in London back in 2015 and had remained in touch with him ever since. This is the first time that the Briton sold his wares in India, even though it was in India where it all began for him.

“I came to Kolkata by chance, in 2004, on a stopover from Australia. The cheapest flight had a stopover in Kolkata. I came in the morning and left in the evening, when I took a train to Darjeeling. It was the last day of Durga Puja and I saw people drumming (playing the dhaak) outside the Sealdah station — that cast a spell on me,” recalled Mr. Denoon, now 59.

The next year, Mr. Denoon, who had been a chef until that time, returned to the subcontinent to learn massage therapy in Nepal, and once he was done with his course, found himself staring at two choices. One was to return to Britain as a healer, the other was to return to Kolkata to make a documentary on life on its streets. It didn’t take him long to decide: Kolkata had already cast a spell on him.

Armed with a camera he bought in Nepal, he arrived in the city and stayed on for about three months, shooting the bustle on its streets. Back in London, he showed the footages to friends who were film-makers. One of them happened to be making a film on street food, and she decided to shoot Mr. Denoon demonstrating the preparation of jhaal muri.

“I went to the Indian market there and bought the rough ingredients. What I prepared that day was the very basic version of what I make now, but the shoot was happening in the middle of the Friday market, and I actually had people coming and buying the stuff,” he recalled. And thus, from playing a jhaal muri seller, he became a real jhaal muri seller.

Tough life

Life, however, remained harder for him than it is for a jhaal muri seller in India: he had no home and lived practically on the road. What helped was that he had no family. Whatever little he earned was spent on funding his trips to Kolkata — he returned every year until 2014 — to make the documentary.

The turning point came in 2010, when he was invited to set up a stall at News International’s Christmas party in London. The very next year, he was handing out jhaal muri to celebrity guests at the wedding of singer Lily Allen.

Today, he has a home, “but I continue to live simply.” The documentary he had set out to make in 2005 is yet to be completed. “I am writing a book at the moment — about my experiences. I will release the documentary along with the book,” Mr. Denoon said.

The jhaal muri, according to him, is one of the healthiest snacks in the world. “It’s spicy, yes, but spicy doesn’t necessarily mean hot,” he said.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/279ti/article30828288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG4183,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-british-jhaal-muri-seller-who-popularised-the-snack-in-london/article30828289.ece
401,2020/02/15,Splendour in stone,"The bi-annual exhibition hosted by the Federation of Indian Granite and Stone Industry displayed a wide range of pieces with stunning natural grain formations, colours, textures and finishes. By Nandhini Sundar

STONA 2020 opened its doors last week in Bengaluru to reveal a mind-boggling variety of natural stones, finishes and sculptural extravaganza. The four-day exhibition hosting over 550 stalls displayed an array of natural stones from different parts of the country and across the world, each coming with its stunning natural grain formations, colours, textures and finishes, giving a hard time for the customers to exercise their choice.

A carving of Buddha against a stone wall

The bi-annual exhibition on natural stone hosted by the Federation of Indian Granite and Stone Industry (FIGSI) is part of the exercise to promote the natural stone industry. The natural stones reveal different patterns and shades based on the fusion of metals and minerals, the grains and colours revealing this combination. Each segment of the stone is thus unique, with greater presence of minerals infusing more exotic patterns and shades.

Music in stone

Black specks and washes of white and blackish greys against a greenish yellow background; golden water flow patterns on a black stone; grains and colours miming the setting sun against the earth; and a splash of modern art in olive green against a white background, are a few of the highlights in the arresting range of natural stones exhibited.

Equally stunning was the array of semi-precious stones such as aquamarine, African amethyst, agate in a range of colours, rose quartz, blue amazonite, onyx in multiple colours, white abalone, garnet, red tiger eye, and mother of pearl. “Some of the rare varieties such as malachite are found under the sea in exclusive belts, while lapis lazuli is found under a lake in Afghanistan”, said Abhijeet Karwa from Beyond Rocks. While these stones are essentially used in jewellery, they can also be embedded in natural stone such as marble to create art, can be used for back lighting, as artwork on table tops, and as artefacts.

Buddha in meditation

An equally magnificent range of designs prevailed for use in the interiors, for cladding of walls or as highlight pieces. Sandstone shaped as bamboo poles, as broken icebergs, random wood pieces stacked together, slate stone with random patterns, granite designed to mime the falls of a fabric, gem art of peacocks on marble, to mention a few, found their due place in this international exhibit.

Exotic tombstones

Tombstones in exotic shapes, designs and variety of natural stones sourced from within and outside the country, vied for space amongst the exhibits. Lincoln stone sourced from the US, blue fusion from Brazil, thudre black grey from Russia, and tropical green from Kerala, were a few amongst the range displayed.

Divine formation

Equally arresting were the designs opted for the tombstone, with one revealing a finely crafted iron red ball. “The ball is carved from ‘fusion fire’ sourced from Brazil which is an extremely hard stone as it is very rich in iron content”, explains Arjun Asaithambi, Vice-President, Corporate Affairs, Gem Granites.

Sculptural extravaganza

The exhibition was not limited to merely raw stones, their exotic grains and finishes. It extended to include an incredible display of finely crafted sculptural extravaganza, each piece of sculpture leaving the viewer stunned, the artwork a testimony to the intense skills and craftsmanship of the sculptors. Displayed in the stall of State Institute Development of Arts and Crafts, Odisha, the sculptures proved to be a literal stone feast for the eyes.

Intricately carved Ganesha in pink stone with five craftsmen working on it for over six months; Lord Vishnu resting on a tortoise in Anantashayana pose with the incidences from Ramayana carved on its sides and Brahma rising from the navel; exquisitely carved Nataraja in pink stone, wrapped in 85 snakes and relating the entire Shiv Purana; Buddha; Radha Krishna; the Konark temple and its wheel; stone lanterns; and stone veena were amongst the many displayed, pinning the visitor to the stall.

A the entrance to the exhibition was a massive Vishnu in Vishwaroopa darshan sculpted in raw onyx, relaying the teachings of the Gita. The intricately carved sculpture revealing superb craftsmanship took National Awardee sculptor Rakesh Kumar Maharana 18 months to complete. Yet another work of his depicting infant Ganesha, also sculpted in raw onyx with complex carvings and craftsmanship, was displayed inside the stalls.

The Shilpagram stall hosting the works of sculptors from across the country was equally interesting, with some of the sculptors working on fresh pieces.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/56k01y/article30851182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bgp-nandy-p08,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/splendour-in-stone/article30829519.ece
402,2020/02/15,Budding artists show their skills at painting competition,"Of 2,200 paintings received from across schools in the city, 500 entries were selected

SBOA School and Junior College was transformed into a platform for young artists to show off their artistic skills on Saturday.

Of the 2,200 paintings received from across schools in the city, 500 entries were selected (250 from the junior and senior categories).

The topics for juniors included ‘Tree plantation in my school’, ‘Waste segregation in my house’, and ‘Park with gym in my area’, while topics for seniors included ‘Roof gardening in my house’ and ‘Plogging and home composting’.

M. Mani, art teacher from Vedanta Academy, Vanagaram and P. Veeravasanth, a self-taught artist, judged the event. “Today's generation gives immense importance to art, and it is heartening to see their enthusiasm. Though young, the children are extremely concept-oriented and have a clear understanding of colour mixing. This is an age where kids are barely able to handle a brush. Yet, the youngsters here seemed to be at ease with it,” said Mr. Mani.

Mr. Veeravasanth added, “It is to the children’s credit that they have a strong grasp of the concepts given and have expressed themselves colourfully. Their vivid imagination, coupled with their knowledge of colouring, is remarkable.”

The chief guests were Ebinizer, branch manager, Club Oxygen Resorts, and Jinesh, brand manager, Amrutanjan. Officials from the Avadi Corporation represented Avadi Corporation Commisioner N. Ravichandran.

In the juniors’ category, K. Kavyashree, of class 6 from SBOA School and Junior College bagged the first place, followed by S.V. Janani, also of class 6, from Sri Vimala Vidyalaya, and D. Amal, a class 4 student of MMH School.

In the seniors’ category, P.L Dhanalakshmi of class 8 from Springfield Matriculation Higher Secondary School stood first.

Haridev R. of class 9 from KVS,AFS, Avadi, bagged the second prize, followed by M. Ragul of class 8 from Dr. Vimala Convent Matriculation Higher Secondary School. Seven consolation prizes each were awarded to students from both the categories

Concerted effort is needed on the part of people’s representatives and people from all walks of life to ensure that farmers do not abandon the sector, the Minister said. Development in the farm sector is an indicator of the progress made by the State. For the sustainable development of agriculture, it is essential to ensure a steady income to the youngsters who are drawn by farming, Mr. Sunil Kumar said. Local self government institutions can make constructive interventions in the farm sector, he said. He also urged farmers to make use of the agro service centres for recultivating fallow lands.

406,2020/02/15,Women should get rights over dowry: SWC,"Panel calls for financial security for women after issues crop up in marriage

Legislation should be so made that women get rights over the dowry as well the wedding gifts, the chairperson of the State Women’s Commission (SWC), M. C. Josephine said.

Women should also be aware that they have a right over the money and gifts that their parents are providing at the time of marriage. Even though dowry is prohibited by law, society continues to keep it alive, albeit in various other names.

The Women’s Commission will organise awareness campaigns against this, Ms. Josephine said.

She was talking to media persons here on Friday after the mega adalat.

She said that one of the most common complaints regarding dowry issues before the SWC seems to be that the husband’s family is taking possession of the money and gold ornaments given to the bride by her parents. This is most often then used for other requirements in the husband’s family.

When marital issues crop up, these women find that they have no financial security at all, Ms. Josephine pointed out.

Legislative measures

Which is why legislative measures should be adopted to enable women to have rights over the monetary gifts and gold she receives at the time of her wedding, she added.

Member of the Commission, M. S. Thara, said that many parents of the new generation children seem to be either indirectly encouraging or covering up their children’s wrongdoings.

Of the 210 cases which were considered in the adalat, 47 were settled and 10 set aside for counselling/reports and the rest set aside for the next adalat.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/women-should-get-rights-over-dowry-swc/article30824973.ece
407,2020/02/15,LIFE nearing 2 lakh milestone,"City Corporation has top position with 27,287 houses completed

The State government is expected to announce the completion of two lakh houses under its Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing scheme at the end of this month. As on Wednesday, a total of 1.86 lakh houses have been completed under the two phases of the LIFE scheme and the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY)-LIFE project.

Among the local bodies, the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has the top position in the number of houses completed with 27,287 houses. The first phase of the LIFE project was meant for houses which have remained incomplete from previous housing schemes. Among the 54,173 such beneficiaries, 52,033 have already completed their houses.

In the second phase, to construct houses for those who own land, out of the 1,00,460 chosen beneficiaries, 92,213 inked agreements with various local bodies. A total of 71,815 beneficiaries out of this have completed their houses now, with the rest expected to complete within a month.

In the PMAY-LIFE scheme for urban areas, 46,605 out of the 79,520 beneficiaries have completed their houses, while in the PMAY-LIFE for rural areas, 16,531 out of the 17,475 beneficiaries have completed their houses.

Along with the announcement of the 2 lakh milestone, the third phase of the LIFE project, in which landless families will be accommodated in flat complexes, will also be formally launched. A total of 1,06,925 beneficiaries have already been identified.

Work on flats have begun in 10 districts, while issues with identifying appropriate land has delayed work in other districts.

The work on around 85 flat complexes are proposed to begin this year, out of which 14 will be under the co-operative department's care home project.

According to an official, many beneficiaries have come forward with a wish to construct houses, after purchasing land.

The government also sees this as a better model than flats in panchayats where the number of beneficiaries is not big enough for a flat project.

This is more economic too, as the unit cost for each family in an apartment would come to ₹13-14 lakh.

Reduced rates

As some beneficiaries have been found to be struggling to complete houses with ₹4 lakh, the LIFE mission has joined hands with various brands to provide electrical fittings, wiring, paint, sanitary fittings, cement and water tanks at 20-60% reduced rates. Cement and other materials will be provided at 15% discount from the Nirmithi Kendra's ‘Kalavara’ centre.

The civic body has requested the autorickshaw drivers plying in the city to get the ID card from the Corporation by producing driving license, copy of the license card and their permit card.

The process of checking the documents and issuing Id cards will begin from 12 noon on February 19. The Id cards have to be displayed in such a way that the passengers can read the details. Facilities will also be provided for the customers to lodge complaints, if any. The Corporation will take steps to address these with the help of the city traffic police.

As part of the second phase of Killi River clean up mission in the upper reaches of the river in the rural areas of the district, cleaning up activities were held at various points on Friday.

The cleaning activities were carried out along the 22 km route from its origin Karinchathimoola till Vazhayila, and the 31 smaller canals draining into it.

Around 30,000 people, including Ministers, MLAs, volunteers, MGNREGS and Kudumbashree workers, students and the larger public were part of the cleaning programme.

410,2020/02/15,VAR denies Wolves,"Atletico held at Valencia; Haaland’s scoring run continues

Nuno Espirito Santo claimed football is in danger of becoming robotic after Wolves were controversially denied by VAR and Leicester’s Hamza Choudhury was sent off in a stormy 0-0 draw at Molineux on Friday.

Santo’s side thought it had taken the lead when Willy Boly headed home in the first half, but VAR stepped in to chalk off the goal for the tightest of offside calls against Diogo Jota.

Atletico Madrid was twice pegged back in Friday’s 2-2 draw at Valencia to keep Diego Simeone’s side in fourth in La Liga ahead of Liverpool’s visit next week.

Norwegian teen striker Erling Braut Haaland took his tally to nine goals in six games for Borussia Dortmund after netting again in Friday’s 4-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.

411,2020/02/15,Indian Super League | Ogbeche stars for Kerala Blasters,"Bengaluru FC suffered a 2-1 defeat to Kerala Blasters after Bartholomew Ogbeche turned up with a brace (45’ and 72’) to come back from a goal down at the JN Stadium, in Kochi, on Saturday. A strike from Jamaican striker Deshorn Brown had given the Blues the lead before the Nigerian fired home a free-kick and a penalty to turn the tide in favour of the Blasters.

With Juanan Gonzalez missing the fixture owing to a suspension, Carles Cuadrat chose to start with what looked like five at the back where Erik Paartalu stood at the heart of the defence. Spaniard Nili Perdomo was handed his first start in the League, playing on the left in attack while Udanta Singh and Deshorn Brown completed the trio ahead.

And it was Brown – hat-trick hero from the AFC Cup game on Wednesday - who handed Bengaluru the lead in the 16th minute when he brought down a pass from Suresh Wangjam that dragged ’Bilal Khan out, before slotting calmly into an empty net.

Bengaluru squandered a big chance to add to the goal just before half-time when Perdomo slipped Udanta on goal. With only Khan to beat in goal, Udanta delayed taking his shot and was stolen off possession by the retreating Kerala defence. Minutes later the Blues would be left to rue the missed opportunity after Ogbeche levelled things for the hosts with what was the last action of the half. Armed with a freekick just yards outside the Bengaluru box, Ogbeche hit his take low and hard – one that Gurpreet Singh Sandhu should have done better to save, as the ball rolled from under the Bengaluru ’keeper to make it 1-1.

Cuadrat made the first change of the game, bringing on Ashique Kuruniyan on the wings for Udanta, as Bengaluru looked to shuffle things in attack early in the second half. On the hour mark, the Spaniard then threw in Semboi Haokip for Brown.

But it was the hosts who shot into the lead soon after when Ogbeche scored his second on the night, this time from a penalty in the 72nd minute. In looking to defend a ball played into the Bengaluru box, Albert Serran tugged down Raphael Bouli prompting referee Ajit Meitei to point to the spot. The striker sent Gurpreet the wrong way to make it 2-1.

Bengaluru pressed forward in search of the equalizer, as Cuadrat brought on new signing Kevaughn Frater for the final quarter of an hour, replacing Nili Perdomo. But it simply wasn’t to be as the hosts ran the clock down to claim their first victory over the Blues in six attempts.

412,2020/02/15,ATK hosts Chennaiyin in an interesting duel,"Former is targetting topping the league, while the latter is aiming for the play-offs

ATK will look to complete its concluding home assignment of ISL’s sixth season when it takes on a resurgent Chennaiyin FC at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Sunday.

The clash of two of the most successful sides of the tournament — with each winning twice — is likely to offer an exciting contest as both need a win to realise their individual objectives. ATK needs a win to join FC Goa at the top of the standings and keep its Asian Champions League qualification dream intact while Chennaiyin needs a favourable result to keep its play-off chances alive.

Both sides have scored four wins in their last five outings and have established themselves as two of the best attacking outfits in the current season. While ATK has maintained a better level of consistency — winning 10 matches in 16 appearances (33 points) so far — Chennaiyin has made a spectacular turnaround after making a mediocre start and has six wins in 15 outings (22 points).

Peak performance

“At the moment the performance level is absolutely at its peak for us, but we have to keep on playing that way. It is going to be a good match as both Chennaiyin and ATK play very good football. Our target is to keep on winning the next match every day,” ATK’s Spanish head coach, Antonio Lopez Habas, said.

Chennaiyin FC’s Scottish head coach, Owen Coyle, also predicted a close contest considering the targets the opponents have set for themselves. Coyle, who set Chennaiyin on a recovery path since taking over from outgoing coach John Gregory early in December, said his boys are eager to finish the job.

“ATK and Chennaiyin are two-time champions for a reason. We have to take our chances to get to the top-four position. It is remarkable what we have done to be where we are now. We have to try and finish our job,” said Colye while stressing how his team recovered from the bottom of the table to emerge as one of the contenders for a play-off berth.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/atk-hosts-chennaiyin-in-an-interesting-duel/article30830682.ece
413,2020/02/15,UEFA bans Man City from Champions League for 2 seasons,"The Abu Dhabi-owned team was also fined 30 million euros ($33 million) after an investigation

English Premier League champions Manchester City were banned from the Champions League for two seasons by UEFA on Friday for “serious breaches” of spending rules and failing to cooperate with investigators in a seismic ruling against one of world football’s wealthiest clubs.

The Abu Dhabi-owned team was also fined 30 million euros ($33 million) after an investigation that was sparked by leaked internal correspondence showing City overstated sponsorship revenue and masked the source of revenue from deals to tied to the Gulf nation in a bid to comply with Financial Fair Play regulations.

The punishment prevents City from playing in any European competition, including the Europa League, until the 2022-23 season. It could have a significant impact on the club’s ability to sign players and retain manager Pep Guardiola, whose contract expires after next season.

The verdict was delivered on Friday to City following a hearing of UEFA’s club financial control body on Jan. 22.

“The adjudicatory chamber, having considered all the evidence, has found that Manchester City Football Club committed serious breaches of the UEFA club licensing and financial fair play regulations by overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and in the break-even information submitted to UEFA between 2012 and 2016,” UEFA said in a statement.

“The adjudicatory chamber has also found that in breach of the regulations the club failed to cooperate in the investigation of this case.”

The ban has no impact on the women’s team participating in the Champions League.

City’s men play Real Madrid in the Champions League round of 16 this month but would not get to defend the title if they lift the European Cup for the first time.

In a statement claiming UEFA’s investigation was “flawed” and “left little doubt in the result,” City announced plans to appeal.

“This is a case initiated by UEFA, prosecuted by UEFA and judged by UEFA,” the club said. “With this prejudicial process now over, the club will pursue an impartial judgment as quickly as possible and will therefore, in the first instance, commence proceedings with the Court of Arbitration for Sport at the earliest opportunity.”

Among football leaders calling for City to be punished was the head of the Spanish league who has been critical of how “funding by state-aid distorts European competitions.”

“UEFA is finally taking decisive action,” La Liga President Javier Tebas said on Friday. “Enforcing the rules of financial fair play and punishing financial doping is essential for the future of football.”

City could yet face additional punishment in England where its financial dealings are still being investigated by the Premier League.

City has been transformed into a leading team in world football since being bought in 2008 by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, a deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and a member of Abu Dhabi’s royal family, winning the Premier League four times since 2012. City has endured a problematic title defense on the field this time, sitting second in the Premier League 22 points behind Liverpool.

The City Football Group, of which City is the key component, was valued at $4.8 billion in November after U.S. private equity firm Silver Lake bought a stake of around 10% for $500 million. Silver Lake became the second major partner in the group, with a Chinese consortium owning 12% of the equity. There are partner clubs in New York, Melbourne and Yokohama, among others.

City has never disputed the authenticity of the information contained in internal emails that were published by German media outlet Der Spiegel in November 2018 and shows alleged schemes by the club to allegedly cover up the true source of income in a bid to comply with FFP.

The UEFA statement on Friday did not reference any specifics of the evidence that led to the punishment

In 2015, Der Spiegel said emails were being sent internally at City showing the manipulation of sponsorship revue from Etihad Airways, the state-owned airline from Abu Dhabi, which is the naming rights sponsor of City’s stadium and training campus as well as appearing on jerseys.

The sponsorship was said to generate 67.5 million pounds (about $85 million) annually for City. But City’s holding company - the state-backed Abu Dhabi United Group - channeled 59.9 million pounds back to Etihad, according to Jorge Chumillas, the club’s chief financial officer, in an internal email to club director Simon Pearce.

The leaks showed how City allegedly tried to artificially raise its revenue, in one case by 30 million euros, according to emails from 2013 reported by Der Spiegel. Abu Dhabi United Group was alleged to be sending cash to a shell vehicle which was created to supposedly buy the right to use players’ images in marketing campaigns.

There were further examples that Sheikh Mansour could have been the source of sponsorship revenue for Abu Dhabi state-owned companies like investment firm Aabar. Der Spiegel cited a 2010 email to Aabar from Pearce, the City director who also works for Abu Dhabi’s Executive Affairs Authority.

“As we discussed, the annual direct obligation for Aabar is GBP 3 million,” Pearce wrote. “The remaining 12 million GBP requirement will come from alternative sources provided by His Highness.”

City has already been punished by UEFA for violating FFP, striking an agreement in 2014 that saw the team fined rather than banned from the Champions League for inflated sponsorship deals with companies linked to the club or its ownership.

A leaked 2014 email from City lawyer Simon Cliff to a colleague showed the death of UEFA’s lead FFP investigator being celebrated- “1 down, 6 to go.”

Since July 2011, UEFA has monitored the accounts of all clubs entering its two club competitions in a bid to curb unfettered spending on players regardless of the owners’ wealth.

The first period UEFA assessed clubs for compliance with FFP was 2011-13, when owners were allowed to cover losses up to 45 million euros.

Questions have been raised about how the leaks were obtained that now cast a shadow on the reputation of City.

A Portuguese man, Rui Pinto, has been implicated in the obtaining of damaging information about European football. Pinto’s lawyer, Francisco Teixeira da Mota, said his client has been helping law enforcement in other European countries with investigations into their clubs’ finances.

Pinto was extradited last year to Portugal from Hungary, where he had lived since 2015, after Portuguese police investigations concluded he hacked into computers in his home country. He has been held in detention in Portugal since March.

A Portuguese judge ruled last month that prosecutors have enough evidence incriminating Pinto for him to stand trial. Pinto is accused of attempted extortion and hacking into secret information held by Sporting Lisbon and the Portuguese soccer federation, including financial dealings.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/a4y27d/article30830055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-CHAMPIONS-MANCHESTERCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/uefa-bans-man-city-from-champions-league-for-2-seasons/article30830056.ece
414,2020/02/15,Three things on new Chelsea signing Hakim Ziyech,"Moroccan international Hakim Ziyech became Chelsea manager Frank Lampard's first signing on Thursday when he joined the Londoners on a 40 million-euro deal from Dutch side Ajax.

Here are three things about the 26-year-old who overcame a troubled youth to become an integral part of an outstanding Ajax team:

Tragedy forced him off the rails

Ziyech was born in the Netherlands, the youngest of eight children of Moroccan parents. He was close to his metal worker father Mohamed who died when he was just 10. Although he found solace in football, the shock of that early loss had an impact on him later. The family's hopes of one of the children succeeding in football lay with him after two of his elder brothers Faouzi and Hicham saw their careers peter out after being convicted of burglary. They were sacked by their respective clubs' academies. “Our last hope in the family was Hakim,” said Faouzi.

Snapped up by Heerenveen academy largely due to his mentor Aziz Doufikar — the first Moroccan to play professional football in Holland — he failed to settle with his Armenian foster family and instead fell in with the wrong crowd leading to run-ins with the law.

As Ziyech's career threatened to spiral out of control, Doufikar and his agent Mustapha Nakhli took him in hand with the latter renting an apartment in Amsterdam in 2012 and sharing it with his then 18-year-old client.

“As a little kid I didn't realise what it was like to have no father,” said Ziyech. “I was 14 or 15 when I got really grumpy. I was really on the verge. I closed myself off to the outside world.”

Ziyech's heart lies with Morocco

Ziyech was much coveted after his talent shone under first Marco van Basten at Heerenveen and then after he moved to Twente. Elevation to the Dutch national side, then coached by Danny Blind, beckoned — he had already played for the U-19, U-20 and U-21 Dutch national sides — but he opted to play for Morocco making his senior debut in 2015.

“Danny Blind can put as much pressure on me as he wants,” Ziyech explained to the website of his then club Twente in November 2016.

“I will not play for the Netherlands. Choosing one's national team is not done with the brain but with the heart. In my case without hesitation it was Morocco. I have always felt Moroccan even though I was born in Holland. Lots of people will never understand this feeling.”

His former club manager van Basten had been one of those, lambasting both him and fellow Dutch-Moroccan Oussama Tannane for choosing Morocco.

“Hakim Ziyech and Oussama Tannane are idiots,” stormed the former Dutch playing icon to De Telegraaf in March 2016. “How can you be so stupid to choose Morocco if the Dutch national side are clearly interested in you.”

Chelsea's gain, Arsenal's loss

The change in his behaviour off the pitch reaped benefits on the field for Ajax.

He shone last season in which he scored 21 goals and provided 24 assists as Ajax won a domestic double and came within sight of the Champions League final only to be denied by Tottenham's extraordinary late second leg comeback.

Indeed Ajax director of football Marc Overmars recommended Ziyech to his former club Arsenal last summer seeing him as a viable alternative to the inconsistent Mesut Ozil.

“I believe Hakim Ziyech is better than Mesut Ozil,” Overmars told AD. “I would advise Arsenal to sell Ozil and buy Ziyech for half of the money, but they didn't listen to me.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/gp4y60/article30827525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-ENGLAND-CHETHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/three-things-on-new-chelsea-signing-hakim-ziyech/article30827526.ece
415,2020/02/15,Atletico Madrid held 2-2 at Valencia in La Liga thriller,"“I don't know if the draw is fair, we had a great game against a tough opponent but we had the chances to win,” said Valencia coach Albert Celades.

Atletico Madrid's disappointing season continued as they shared the spoils with Valencia in a thrilling 2-2 draw in La Liga at Mestalla on February 14.

Marcos Llorente put Atletico ahead after 15 minutes when he stabbed home from close range, with Gabriel Paulista equalising five minutes before the break.

Atletico went back in front three minutes later when Thomas Partey smashed home a low drive from distance but Valencia's Geoffrey Kondogbia bundled the ball past goalkeeper Jan Oblak in the 59th minute to level the scores again.

Kevin Gameiro should have put Valencia ahead but lashed a golden chance over the bar after the electric Ferran Torres's brilliant run and cross.

Sixth-placed Valencia finished by far the stronger, with the draw putting them on 38 points. Atletico, in fourth, have 40 but are 12 adrift of leaders Real Madrid having played a game more.

The hosts were thrashed 3-0 at Getafe last weekend but bounced back strongly with an energetic display against Diego Simeone's side to satisfy their demanding fans.

“I don't know if the draw is fair, we had a great game against a tough opponent but we had the chances to win,” said Valencia coach Albert Celades.

“We had a great second half and made the chances to win but it was a draw. Everyone wants to move forward, everyone wants to win, we put in good performances at home.”

Atletico, who host Liverpool in the Champions League last 16 on Tuesday, were able to bring on striker Alvaro Morata in the second half for his comeback from a muscle injury.

The Spaniard almost snatched a goal for the visitors but Jaume Domenech made a good save to keep out his header.

“We understand in the world of football when you're on a bad run, doubts appear, questions appear, when you win three or four in a row it all disappears,” said Llorente.

Simeone, who insists this is a transition season for his team, was pleased with the draw.

“Valencia are very strong at home, haven't lost all season and tonight came back twice. I leave with very good feelings, we made a great effort,” said the coach.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/vv4i13/article30826409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ATLETICO-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/atletico-madrid-held-2-2-at-valencia-in-la-liga-thriller/article30826410.ece

Manchester City have been banned from European competition for the next two seasons and fined 30 million euros ($32.53 million) by European soccer’s governing body UEFA after an investigation into alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play Rules.

UEFA said City had committed “serious breaches” of the rules while the Premier League club said they would appeal the decision to the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration.

City said in a statement they were “disappointed but not surprised” by the outcome of a “prejudicial process” and would now seek an “impartial judgment” by commencing CAS proceedings at “the earliest opportunity”.

418,2020/02/15,We have created a political culture that feeds off hate: Revati Laul,"Revati Laul talks about ‘The Anatomy of Hate’, the perpetrators of the Gujarat riots, and why their story needed to be told

Do we know what it feels like to be part of a mob? Revati Laul’s The Anatomy of Hate, shortlisted for The Hindu Prize for Non-Fiction, answers this question and raises several others about society’s propensity to hate. An excerpt from a short interview:

What made you want to tell the story of the perpetrators of the 2002 carnage?

I was based in Gujarat, reporting for NDTV the year after the 2002 pogrom against Muslims. And everywhere I went, Hindus would say — ‘You won’t understand why we took part in or supported the violence’. I thought to myself that I didn’t understand where the impetus for this kind of hatred of the other, the Muslim, came from. But then I went a step further and asked myself another question: wasn’t it important to find out why? We know academically the history of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, of the Hindu right wing etc., but do we know what it feels like to be part of a mob? The more I looked inside this space, the more I realised how crucial it was to tell the story of the perpetrators of violence. My favourite political scientist, Mahmood Mamdani, wrote, while telling the story of the Rwandan genocide, that we need to realise that it is the ‘popularity’ of the genocide that is its uniquely troubling aspect. This got me started.

What is it about hate-induced violence that should worry us the most?

The politics of mass hate has engulfed us today. It is powerful and addictive because it pulls out our basest instincts and gives them oxygen. In fanning the flames, we have created a political culture that feeds off hate. Being civilised is very hard. Letting loose the mob unleashes something we all have within us but social and political institutions help us curb it. When these institutions turn into curators of hate, it’s like a deep vault opening up and the bloodletting consumes the institutions whole. We are left without a democratic fabric.

You write about the aftermath of the riots through three people — Pranav, Dungar and Suresh Langdo. Why them?

The three people were picked randomly from hundreds I spoke with, because these three were people I had access to and could track for three years at length. Pranav is upper caste, middle class, English speaking and educated, and was an outlier in the mob in 2002. Dungar is tribal, aspirational, middle class and part of the BJP and VHP. Suresh is serving a 31-year jail sentence for raping and killing Muslim women and men in 2002. Each of these people had very different backgrounds, different ways of entering the space of violence and decidedly different trajectories after. For me, writing about them was a way of telling the story inside out and also to leave people with the idea that violence is also varied and diverse and ever-changing. And complex. Everything and its opposite are true at the same time.

What are the lessons we must learn from a book like ‘The Anatomy of Hate’?

If we want to move away from the politics of violence, we need first to be able to understand it. Look at the personal and political circumstances that lead to it in order to learn from it and build alternatives. The first thing I learned while writing this book is that hate is not constant, it is shifting. If we continue to look at it as fixed, we are guilty of fixing it and now allowing it to escape from its box and change. The second thing I learned is that we have to look at the perpetrators of violence — their uncertainty, their fear of fear, of each other, of belonging. When we understand that, we can work on rebuilding their identities in ways that are more secure than what the politics of hate can offer. The people who are filled with hate are in a sense victims of circumstance, and we need to change those circumstances.

419,2020/02/15,The anxiety of incompleteness: An extract from Sanjib Baruah’s ‘In the Name of the Nation: India and Its Northeast’,"With anti-CAA protests taking on dramatically different dimensions in the Northeast, Sanjib Baruah’s new book, ‘In the Name of the Nation: India and Its Northeast’, is a timely entry. This extract from the book looks at the fallout of Partition in the region and the ongoing solidification of porous borders

India’s Partition was not the inevitable culmination of struggles by generations of anticolonialists. Nor was it a conclusive one-time event. The decision to formally and constitutionally divide British-ruled India was made only ten weeks before the actual transfer of power on August 15, 1947. What it would mean for ordinary people, as historian Gyanendra Pandey notes, could only be worked out “step-by-step in 1947-48 and afterwards.” When violence between Hindus and Muslims forced people to move across the new international border, “it was not always obvious to them or to the new states that they would not go back.” A person displaced by Partition told an interviewer many years later that she, like many others, did not expect the division of territories to be forever.... Seen from this perspective, it was perhaps inevitable that despite the insertion of an international border and the introduction of an illegality regime, the flow of people crossing into India would continue well beyond the immediate years of Partition. That Partition generated a massive new flow of Hindus into India is well known. What is less well-known — and contrary to the expectations of the architects of Partition — is that it did not stop an old pattern of migration from densely populated deltaic eastern Bengal into relatively sparsely populated Northeast India: that of poor Muslim peasants in search of land and livelihoods.

The legal status of migrants from across the border remains a controversial issue in India... Hindu Partition refugees do not generally occupy a minoritized space in most parts of India. It is relatively easy for them to integrate into local society... But in Northeast India, the challenge has played out very differently for two reasons. First, both migration from eastern Bengal and opposition to it in this settlement frontier began well before 1947. Second, there is the “forgotten story of India’s Partition” — that of the district of Sylhet. This region — a part of Bangladesh today — was a district of the province of Assam before it became a part of East Pakistan in 1947. The status of this Bengali-speaking region was a controversial issue in the politics of colonial Assam. Assamese Hindu political leaders of the Indian National Congress advocated its separation from Assam well before Partition. In some Sylheti Hindu Partition refugee narratives, they bear more responsibility for Sylhet becoming a part of Pakistan than even Muslim League politicians that fought for a separate Pakistan. A significant segment of Northeast India’s population bears the burden of the intergenerational trauma and memories of the partitioned geography of Sylhet. Not surprisingly, there is among them a very different view of this history — and its implications for post-Partition India — from that in the rest of Northeast India.

***

Since India’s “identification revolution” — the greatly enhanced ability of the modern state “to individually designate its own nationals so as to legally differentiate between citizens and aliens present on its territory” — remains a work in progress; estimating the number of irregular migrants crossing the Partition border into Assam is a highly fraught exercise... All available estimates are extrapolations from census figures and electoral rolls, and they are intensely contested.

***

The steps to put India’s identification revolution on a fast track, to harden the Indo-Bangladesh border, and to securitise immigration and border control may or may not achieve their avowed goals. But their effects are likely to be significant and far-reaching... The efforts to toughen the illegality regime governing the Partition border along with the trends toward a majoritarian bias in Indian citizenship laws do not bode well for the future. One reason why their effects can be especially pernicious in this frontier region is that many settlers and their descendants... live in and cultivate “forest lands,” “grazing lands,” and various kinds of public lands. These land-use designations are no more than legal fictions in many parts of Assam. To assume that they are solid facts on the ground can further dispossess some of the world’s most disenfranchised people.

***

India’s Border Security Force has proposed “Wagah-like shows” to promote “border tourism” in Northeast India. Wagah is a town on the India-Pakistan border where Indian and Pakistani soldiers participate in a flag-lowering ceremony, where they ritually enact their hostility toward each other. The performance underscores — and exaggerates — the lines drawn by Partition. There are no Wagah-like performances on the Partition’s eastern border partly because the two borders are not alike. The more or less complete “exchange of population” that occurred in Punjab during Partition — and the extraordinary brutality that went with it — has no exact parallel in the East. Decisions on whether or not to move to the other side were not all made in 1947. The process has been open-ended. But the situation is now changing. The Border Security Force is not alone in seeking a rigorously policed Indo-Bangladesh border. Many in India would like to see the post-Partition Indian state become a “normal sovereign state” with normal borders and mandatory state-issued identity documents being required for entering the country and for exercising voting rights. After all, the “wish for well-defined, fixed boundaries” that comes out of the 19th idea of “exclusive and uncontested territorial state power” remains part of the dominant global political imaginary: the national order of things. Ernest Gellner had famously compared it with Amedeo Modigliani’s paintings, where “neat flat surfaces are clearly separated from each other” and “there is little if any ambiguity or overlap.” He contrasted it with the “riot of diverse points of colour” in the impressionist canvases of Oskar Kokoschka: his metaphor for the world before nations... If there is a desire to see a Kokoschka to Modigliani type of transformation of the Partition’s eastern border, the managers of the Indian state can hardly afford to ignore it. But whether they can gratify it is another matter.

The nation-state walls and fences being built today and the greater policing of international borders all across the world are symptoms of the crisis of the nation-state system. These “mundane arrangements, most of them unknown two hundred or even one hundred years ago,” as political theorist Timothy Mitchell reminds us, “help manufacture an almost transcendental entity, the nation state.” The Indo-Bangladesh border fence, after all, is not meant to stand as a fortification against an invading army — India and Bangladesh are friendly countries — but to protect against nonstate transnational actors: cross-border migrants and “Jihadi terrorists”. The capacity of states to control the flow of goods and people across borders is eroding worldwide. In many parts of the world, states had never fully developed that capacity. If at least in some parts of the world the nation-state had once monopolized loyalty, “transnational mobile practices” now point to the significant erosion of that capacity. And postcolonial states like India can only strive for that kind of monopoly; they have never actually enjoyed it — as reflected, among other things, in the lateness of the identification revolution fitfully taking place now. The impossible desire for walled sovereignty in the world today reflects the desire to become a “normal state” or to remain one. Dealing with this increasing “anxiety of incompleteness” will be a major challenge for India in coming years.

421,2020/02/15,Poverty of ideas and a crisis in learning,"Why has Indian education failed to imbibe the teachings of Gandhi and Tagore and lead students towards a path of inquiry?

Shashikala Srinivasan attempts to articulate what Tagore seems to have learnt from folk traditions and Gandhi from his practice of crafts, especially spinning. Together, they stand as tall and exceptional figures in the history of ideas about education. Their special contribution lies in critiquing colonial education. There were other critics too, but Gandhi and Tagore went deeper in realising why colonial ideas about educating Indians were going to prove a long-term liability.

This book looks at the present-day crisis of higher education by, first, probing colonialism philosophically and, then, listening to the deeper voices of Gandhi and Tagore, to seek answers for the future. As one might imagine, these answers are of a radical nature. In fact, this book is not about solutions at all. It helps us to understand how lost we are as a society, in terms of our idea of knowledge and its authentic pursuit in colleges and universities.

Colonial rupture

Srinivasan starts her complex critique of India’s higher education by tracing the evolution of liberal education in Europe. She explains its socio-cultural and political roots that permitted it to blossom under the conditions created by industrial growth.

The European model of education offered to the young student a route to development of the self by inquiry into the natural and social worlds. Theory-building and personal verification played important roles in the student’s growth. It is common knowledge that Indian education fails to develop these habits of mind and capacities in a vast proportion of students. The question why this is so is mostly answered with reference to poor management of higher education, paucity of funds, political interference, and so on. All these surmises may be true, but Srinivasan’s approach takes us to a different plane of questioning.

She persuades us to recognise the rupture that occurred in our collective mind and ethos about two centuries ago when the colonial (or modern) system of education got established. Older institutions faced ridicule and destruction.

Srinivasan’s sharp analysis of historical documents from early 19th century reveals that colonial observers could not fully grasp the nature of education imparted by indigenous institutions. The external gaze missed certain key characteristics of the older system, especially its conception of knowledge and the practice of learning. Without being emotional, Srinivasan tells us why the colonial rupture had such crippling effect that we still cannot reflect and converse at leisure about the crisis our universities and colleges face today.

Srinivasan devotes a substantial part of her book to Gandhi. She helps us to recognise the deeper epistemology of crafts like spinning that Gandhi practised as a matter of personal culture and promoted as a symbol of struggle against colonial rule. Crafts provide a reflective space for the growth of self-discipline as a necessary ingredient of social ethics. This kind of practical learning helps us conceive education without compartmentalising it into hierarchies of various kinds.

Healing art

Srinivasan’s analysis of Tagore points out that he too was aware of the problem of treating the isolated individual self as the learner. Art, he thought, will heal the injury colonial rule had inflicted on the Indian psyche, especially on its capacity to think freely and with confidence.

As one might imagine, Srinivasan has no solutions to offer. She hopes that by drawing on different traditions of thought, we can “create a richer milieu of discussion about education, enlarging our notion of what it means to lead a life of learning today.” That is the last sentence of this incisive book, which must be read — and re-read — by people who are concerned about India’s educational institutions. It is an exceptional contribution to a field currently wading through a long bog of trivialities.

422,2020/02/15,‘Spotted Goddesses – Dalit Women’s Agency-Narratives on Caste and Gender Violence’ review: Streaming Dalit consciousness,"Through ethnographic notes, a writer chronicles the fragile, vulnerable and personal experiences of women who, on occasion, know how to celebrate life too

I had a good chance to host the book talk of Roja Singh’s Spotted Goddesses in June 2018 at the Ambedkar Lecture Series I ran at Harvard. The book was then in a German publisher edition. Roja Singh’s ancestors converted to Christianity for the very reason that many Dalits went to the liturgy of white wo/man’s church — for economic viability and status and dignity.

Born into a family of educators, father a professor and mother teacher, Singh had a privileged childhood, where the “c” word seldom featured. Singh thus grew up with a non-caste (upper caste) sensibility. Upon realising her caste at the age of 26 she felt enraged for two reasons: her parents not exposing her to caste, and the lowness that her caste was kept into. Singh eventually overcame the trauma and “learned to love her Dalit identity more” in the thatched roof huts and among humble yet resolved Dalit women who own their identity with more pride.

It is through this lens of middle-class, Dalit Christian women that we witness the beat of a Dalit woman: her life, her story, talent, generosity and compassion in dealing with violence and subverting it to celebrate which the author foregrounds as earthy humanness, in the melodious notes of Dalit women of rural Tamil Nadu.

Earthy humanness centres on the degendered person — the human who is grounded in the ethics of dignity and wellbeing while devouring care in the songs of paraparesis of Indian caste society.

Singh dives into the colonial ethnographic methodology to reclaim herself and the method itself. Oral narratives are hardly caricatured as novel mediums if written from an intra-community perspective.

The musical storytelling does not have processed thought as a condition for building a discourse. They are fragile, vulnerable, private and extremely sensitive. Deciphering them as a mode of knowledge for the wider community’s consumption, Singh argues that these oral narratives comprise “multi-textured dimensions of Dalit culture along with Dalit female agency” thereby becoming “resistance to victimization”. Bama notes Dalit culture is a repository of Dalit women’s wisdom.

The book meticulously weaves ethnographic notes — stories and songs — by carefully presenting a narrative that makes one shudder and tatter into pieces.

The stories are incredibly disturbing and yet Dalit people find occasions to celebrate their life too. It is the genius of the author who has managed to bring out such personal experiences.

Formidable ride

Singh has delivered a work of immense breadth. Sharp yet limited, this book has caricatured Dalit women’s style, voice, rage, courage, disruption, wail, anger, innocence, morality, dare, subversion, protest, submission, etc. to the phenomenal life of sassiness and attractive pedagogy of Dalit community as a whole. The author couldn’t remove herself from the text as it lives in her. She is passionate about the work and the stories and songs that have inspired her. This book is an academic story of two powerful Dalit women leaders, activists, justice seekers Kalai and Rani, among other formidable women in Tamil Nadu, who preface gallant by embodying the spirits of ancestors to subvert their submission. The author places Dalit women’s body as a site of exiled self wherefrom the process of de-colonisation should begin.

Although the stories presented are of rural Tamil Nadu, they easily speak to the rest of India. It has brought forth the plight of Dalit wo/men who are pushed into the unforgiving dark chambers of suffering and epidemic violence.

Good primer

The book is the story of charming sheroes that Dalits in contemporary times need to inspire. It serves as a good primer packed with nuanced commentary on India’s caste condition. One can argue the problem of women in India and Dalit women in extension comes from the epics which condition the thought process of identifying characteristics, virtues, beauties and norms of moral high from the scriptural anecdotes such as Ramayana and Mahabharata in real life. A Dalit girl has to “transgress” to feel beautiful.

In addition to the book’s many strengths in data gathering, it misses the socio-historical density. The Dalit history month was already experimented by the creative genius of Kanshi Ram through “Ambedkar Mela on Wheels” in 1980. The question of queerness and sexuality would have been an important mediation for the readers to grasp on the entirety of Dalit women experience. Nonetheless, the book elucidates the importance of allyship and how it has helped the subjects of her study to continue their fight. However, in the cacophonous tit-for-tat type of clickbait politics it seems to be an impossible option.

It is a tome that offers an affectionate look at the previous season and by delaying the latest edition, seventh to be precise, its editor Suresh Menon has managed to capture both the World Cup and the Indian Premier League.

The prose, as is the case with previous versions, sticks to elegance, nostalgia and an affectionate nod to the willow game. The gaze is both specific to India while also casting a bird’s eye view across the cricketing globe. The writers range from veterans like Ayaz Memon, R. Kaushik, Sandeep Dwivedi and Gideon Haigh to the latest torch-bearers of marrying the right word with the exact shot — Bharat Sundaresan and Sidharth Monga. Yet, it isn’t exactly a cosy boys club steeped in cricket writing and Menon draws in fresh voices be it a Rajdeep Sardesai, Shishir Hattangadi or Unmukt Chand.

‘Wristy grace’

As starters go there is a Mike Brearley piece high on spice as he wryly points out India’s reflexive opposition to change and the subsequent belated embrace be it Twenty20s or Decision Review System. Smriti Mandhana, Jasprit Bumrah, Mayank Agarwal, Fakhar Zaman, Dimuth Karunaratne and Rashid Khan, named Cricketers of the Year, get quaint tributes enriched with insights. And entering the Hall of Fame are Lala Amarnath and Gundappa Viswanath, and about the latter Menon writes: “All wristy grace and mischief, eastern magic and unattainability.”

The World Cup’s nerve busting final that ended in multiple ties before a quirky rule about number of boundaries serving as a tie-breaker at Lord’s, gets its retrospective praise from Lawrence Booth. While referring to champion England and second-placed New Zealand, he pens: “To the victors, the spoils. And, for once, to the losers too.”

Baring of the heart

The book is also about the baring of the heart and in this Unmukt scores big. Once toasted as the next big star, the former India under-19 captain lost his form, slipped into self-pity and then hauled himself up for the good fight.

Towards the end of his candid article, you can actually hear him whisper these words: “You chose this bat and ball and you chose it for a reason. Close your eyes and remember the first time you held it. It was simple then, and it should be simple now.”

And there is pathos too. Sidhanta Patnaik, an editor with the almanack since its inception, passed away into the mists of time, succumbing to cancer. His colleague and co-author of the book on Indian women’s cricket The Fire Burns Blue, Karunya Keshav wistfully remembers him: “As a writer, Patnaik was prolific and emotive. As a reporter, he was dogged and a trove of stats and abstruse facts.” The almanack serves as a fair mirror to cricket and you cannot ask for more from a book.

424,2020/02/15,Language and other maladies: Review of Sumana Roy’s ‘My Mother’s Lover and Other Stories’,"The enactment of literary discourse in fiction might be an interesting exercise, but Roy is not quite able to pull it off

Sumana Roy’s penultimate work was a volume of poetry, Out of Syllabus, which, as the title suggests, hit out, not in so many words, of course, at the limitations of pedagogy — the bell might toll the end of a lesson in a particular subject in the classroom and the start of another, but outside the classroom all subjects overlap and watertight academic ‘streams’ merge into an ocean of knowledge. Roy is a professor — she speaks from experience.

Ironically, reading her latest collection of short stories, I felt I was locked up in a classroom and was being pelted with literary theory dressed up as fiction, because the teacher seemed to have decided that a story is the best way to make lesser mortals like her students grasp complex theory.

It’s not an unexciting exercise per se — Oxford professor Iris Murdoch habitually pumped philosophy into her novels and the result was dizzying most often — but Roy, unfortunately, is neither here nor there.

A little lifeless

The stories barely touch you because the characters are diligently acting out some existential/ linguistic conundrum — they flop like lifeless puppets once the laboured performance is over. The endings are Roy’s concession to the conventional story, which must head somewhere. Roy’s subject matters — mostly unstructured cogitations of given characters — hardly warrant the kind of neat closures she gives them.

As to theory, a quote from Barthes — “I have a disease; I see language” — is the epigraph to the book and you know where this is headed. Only, it is much more rewarding to read Barthes than plod through Roy’s stories pointing out the linguistic structures that underlie all that we think, see or feel.

In ‘The New Provincials’, an ambitious English professor from small-town Bengal realises, as he commutes to work on a public bus, that his surrounding linguistic reality better supports his middle-class mother reading Lakshmi’s panchali every Thursday than George Eliot’s Dorothea Brooke discovering that her provincial life in Middlemarch makes a mockery of her bookish idealism; in ‘Literature and Other Ailments’, the narrator cribs, “Literature turned me into a complainant, and it took away the joy of surprise and unexpectedness from my life”, only to find out that lived life is far less dramatic than literature would have us believe.

Roy’s Eng-lit students might find the pieces rewarding — if only because they will resonate with what they have been taught by her in the classroom — but for the rest, the stories might sound just pretentious. Yes, there is humour, as in the death certificate that reads: “Unnatural death caused by trying to avoid natural death” (‘Untouchability’); some stories, notably ‘The Mountain Disease’, with its subtle dismantling of the parochialism afflicting even so-called educated groups, are insightful. But they are hardly enough to keep you going.

Roy is a poet, as is the mother from the titular story. The mother here was a famous poet in Hindi — her poetry in translation (presented with apologies for what must have been lost in the process) speaks for Roy, I suppose. It might give you a few hiccups: “They are sending guards, I know,/ To prove that I stole the wombs you’d lent to the papaya tree...” As might some of her sentences: “It has begun to seem slightly artificial — this time, this borrowed time, like time borrowed from life for living a vicarious life inside a cinema hall, that is not like living inside a painting, chained by the frame” (‘The Seventh Day’).

Editor missing

Andrew Marvell’s oft-quoted lines to his coy mistress: “But at my back I always hear/ Times wingèd chariot hurrying near” is attributed to Shakespeare in the same story. All of which makes one wonder: did this book go to press without an editor ever having looked at it?

Book blurbs are infamous for being hyperbolic. But this one’s is plain misleading: “These are stories that will make you hide your tears and reach out for someone’s hand as you read them, or phone a loved one to share the delicious humour, or underline sentences that you’d like to return to.” Was it meant for some other book?

425,2020/02/15,The questions of Malinda: Review of Shehan Karunatilaka’s ‘Chats with the Dead’,"Amid its dark comedy, Karunatilaka’s second novel, set in Sri Lanka in 1989, also asks profound questions about death

Chats with the Dead, Shehan Karunatilaka’s follow-up to his acclaimed debut Chinaman, bills itself as a murder mystery with a twist. Malinda ‘Maali’ Albert Kabalana — self-proclaimed gambler, photographer and slut — finds that he has died and is now a ghost in the Colombo of 1989. To solve his own murder, Maali must now wade through fellow ghosts with contradictory advice and questionable motives, the memories of the life he lived flooding back, and a country in permanent turmoil. All the while, he must contend with the debris of debts, infidelities and highwire political wagers he has left behind that have ongoing repercussions, especially for Jaki and DD, his official girlfriend and unofficial boyfriend. The ensuing novel is an impressive accomplishment that manages to be a tighter expression of his distinctive prose and an even more glaring mirror of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka is once again Karunatilaka’s setting and subject, this time much more directly. The Sri Lanka of 1989, moreover, is a special kind of anarchy. The government is officially at war with the Tamil Tigers, but the Indian Peace Keeping Force, in the country to help with the fight, is on a murderous rampage across the north, so much so that both the government and the Tigers are conspiring to have it gone. Meanwhile, the second youth-led neo-Marxist JVP insurrection in the south is being viciously put down by the government and its death squads. Assorted foreign mercenaries run amok as massacres, bombs, secret torture sites and mass burials have become frighteningly commonplace.

Maali’s backstory as a fixer and photographer for nearly all these players allows Karunatilaka to impressively paint the whole picture in quick strokes. There is a definite risk in such an exercise where the moralities of all the actors at play, and at war, could be collapsed into one. It could make it seem as if everyone is equally culpable, but Karunatilaka lucidly makes the relative moral positions of everyone involved clear. A number of cinematic sequences wrestle intricately with such calculations.

Dark absurdity

The weight of these matters is balanced by Karunatilaka’s prose, which is sardonic and knowingly vulgar, trading moments of both dark absurdity and lowbrow yet self-aware humour. This especially comes through in the keen observations of Colombo and Sri Lankan culture the book throws up, as well as in the sordid thrills Maali pursues as a closeted gay man in the country. There are also some charming nods to Chinaman, suggesting a shared universe.

Chats With The Dead turns out to be a leaner and more concentrated affair than that book, however; less disposed to drunken backtracking and more relentlessly focused on plot movement. Karunatilaka’s device of ghosts stuck in the in-between and the particulars of its worldbuilding, including the ghosts being able to ‘ride’ winds and go to where their names are uttered, allows the novel to quite literally breeze ahead at breakneck speed. The success of this more than offsets some other niggling concerns, such as the book’s living characters being more compelling than its ghosts; the somewhat piecemeal depiction of certain real life figures by name and others by allusion; and its imagery which at times may border on being gratuitously nihilistic.

The plot and the tone lend themselves to descriptions of the book being a “dark comedy” and while this isn’t inaccurate, it’s certainly not merely a comedy. There is a real heft to it, especially as more and more of Maali’s memories return and the horrors he has witnessed and has been party to come to light, all underpinning rather complex ethical reflections. At its deepest, Chats with the Dead grapples with the value of a life in the aftermath of death. Karunatilaka increasingly raises questions of what you’re remembered as you die; what your love meant for those you left behind; and if it was all worth it in the end, to frequently moving effect. Maali’s hard-wrangled love for Jaki and DD, built up progressively over drunken parties, quiet coffees and lost photos, displays this to moving effect.

Caustic queries

In the context of the flaming vortex that is Sri Lanka, these questions about the after-death are even more caustic — could you really say you had done any good in your life when the very notion of that is so horribly compromised on the island? This is not because what is right is not clear, but because no one who claims to do good has, or can have, their hands clean. That feels as true of the Sri Lanka of 1989 as it does of the Sri Lanka of 2020, making the book acutely contemporary in a sense.

These questions Karunatilaka raises on death, too, appear as adjuncts to the book’s frenzied velocity — not meditated upon for too long, before being consumed by the next bout of violence and terror. This, too, is fitting in its own way; we go through life in a blur, rarely pausing to take stock, before it all ends. Chats with the Dead zooms in on that very end, with stellar precision.

The writer is a researcher based in Colombo, Sri Lanka.

426,2020/02/15,Organic farming: The food forest of Nayagarh,"Among this year’s Padma Shri awardees are a father and daughter who turned a barren wasteland into a riot of trees and crops

Furrowed with deep gullies, its topsoil all but gone, this degraded patch of land near Odagaon in Odisha’s Nayagarh district was once a dense forest. Whenever nature tried to reclaim it, the little shoots would be nibbled away by goats and sheep. The villagers who owned the land had lost all hope of ever growing crops here. But for Sabarmatee and her father Radhamohan — founders of Sambhav, a non-profit organisation that works on gender and environment — this was precisely what they were looking for: the challenge of rejuvenating land that had been written off.

The duo bought 70 acres with the help of donations and set to work. First, they created a bio-fence by planting bamboo on the edges: unlike a compound wall that takes money to create, the bamboo fence becomes a source of income. Within two years, sprigs of grass appeared in the sunken patches. Then began their project to grow rice, fruits and vegetables. That was three decades ago. Today, Sabarmatee and Radhamohan, recipients of this year’s Padma Shri, gaze upon a ‘food forest’ where there was once an expanse of fissured earth. Here, 500 varieties of rice, 100 types of vegetables and 40 different fruits now grow. The duo has also began documenting yields and preserving seeds.

Waiting for ants

When they started out in the late 80s there was general mistrust for traditional practices, they recall. “Policymakers and academics expressed doubt about traditional agriculture practices, saying theycannot produce enough food to meet the needs of our growing population,” says Radhamohan, who was Odisha’s first information commissioner. His connections with policymakers and bureaucrats helped shape up the idea. And Sabarmatee gave up a successful career to join him.

When they began scouting for land, the government first identified a plot near River Brahmani in Dhenkanal district for them to create a resource centre for organic farming. “But we realised that creating a green cover on fertile land would not impress farmers. We needed a more challenging spot to drive home the point that traditional agriculture can be taken up in inhospitable conditions,” says Radhamohan. That’s how they picked this place.

To control erosion, they started growing legumes, which spread rapidly. They spread cut grass on the earth and waited for white ants to bore tunnels under the layer. This allowed aeration and water infiltration. Trees began to spring up on their own as bird droppings dispersed seeds.

Upland, low land

The year 1990-91 was exceptional in terms of rainfall, and they started planting mango trees. Low-lying areas were used for horticulture — lemon, jackfruit, lychee and coconut — while 2.5 acres were dedicated to paddy. Sambhav grows 500 varieties of rice today. Uplands were, however, left untouched to help the forest grow. Seed balls were dispersed around other land patches. The efforts paid off: the campus, now spread over 90 acres, has over 1,000 species of plants.

“Creating topsoil was the real challenge. We stacked leaves and crop waste and allowed that to decay. Gradually, it became top soil that was cultivable,” says Sabarmatee. Bamboo and grasses were planted to harness the topsoil, and water harvesting structures were created.

“Plants don’t live in isolation,” says Sabarmatee. “There is also a huge diversity of insects, aquatic life, amphibians, birds and mammals here.”

Seeding ideas

Sabarmatee also began collecting traditional varieties of rice, vegetable and fruits to grow on campus. This helped build a seed bank. Now, Sambhav’s seed bank has 700 indigenous varieties of seeds. Their ‘Adopt a Seed’ initiative gives region-specific varieties to farmers for free on the condition that they popularise them. Many of these are well suited to arid environments and water-logged areas.

Sambhav should not be identified as a museum of seeds, cautions Sabarmatee. “Seeds have life. They have to be cultivated regularly,” she says. Funds come from the sale of agricultural produce and donations.

Radhamohan, who embarked on a padayatra for forest protection in the 1990s, says it was never their intention “to create an oasis in the rain shadow area,” but as they distributed saplings the forests regenerated on their own across thousands of acres. Traditional farming sans fertilizer and pesticide can do wonders. Much remains to be done, however: “We need to strengthen marketing for organic agricultural products through a separate procurement system,” says Radhamohan. “And we need to reorient our scientific community and bring changes to agricultural education so as to sharpen the focus on organic produce.”",agriculture,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/8yw351/article30819214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16SM1BARIK17,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/organic-farming-the-food-forest-of-nayagarh/article30819220.ece
427,2020/02/15,The Bengal slow loris: Cuddly with a chance of venom,"Slow lorises may look cute but will bite anyone stupid or ignorant enough to try touching them

The focus of Swapna Nelaballi’s research was a cute tailless creature, the size of a well-fed house cat, called the Bengal slow loris. None of the eight species of slow lorises reciprocates affectionate human cuddling and will bite anyone stupid or ignorant enough to try, not even sparing celebrities such as Lady Gaga. Their sharp teeth spill blood but also infect the wound with venom. Besides the platypus, slow lorises are the only venomous mammals.

The stinky oily secretion from glands on the inner surface of loris elbows is harmless but becomes toxic when mixed with its saliva. Smearing this nasty concoction on itself and its young puts off nocturnal mammal predators and even insect parasites. The venom, similar to allergy-causing proteins in cat dander, can cause a severe allergic reaction in humans.

Nelaballi, however, had no reason to worry about being bitten during her study at Trishna Wildlife Sanctuary, Tripura. She was content to gaze up at the forest canopy by the light of a headlamp that made the loris’ large round eyes reflect bright, fiery red. “You cannot confuse them with anything else,” she says.

Liquid diet

Despite the potency of the venom that can kill its rivals, the Bengal slow loris does not use it to overcome prey as it lives on an almost entirely liquid diet. It snacks on fruits, insects and bird eggs occasionally, but unlike the south Indian and Sri Lankan slender loris, its staple is plant sap and gum. It rouses itself from sleep after nightfall and climbs down head first from the forest canopy. With its closely spaced lower incisors and canines that biologists call ‘toothcomb’, it gouges deep holes in the trunks of trees and lianas.

Not any tree will do. The primate favours particular species such as belliric myrobalan, climbing wattle, and elephant rope tree, and it selects specific specimens of those species much as we choose the best fruits in the market. Some trunks sport more than a hundred ‘taps’ while others are barely marked. Nelaballi watched a loris tear a new cavity for over 30 minutes. “It’s rare to see one start afresh,” she says. When it goes to work, it holds its posture stock-still for several minutes without suffering cramps because of its unique blood circulation.

Most often, instead of ripping fresh holes every night, the slow loris remembers the location of existing ones, visiting them as frequently as twice a night. With its long pointed tongue, the primate drinks up sap that drips from these injuries. Viscous gum collects slowly, which it scrapes and chews. While the watery liquid is easy to digest, the enlarged cecum in its gut processes the carbohydrate-rich gums.

Stickler for routine

Late in the dry season, when the wild guava (unrelated to the common edible fruit) blooms at night, the slow loris abandons its habitual diet and favourite trees to bury its face in the pom-pom-like flowers to sip the sweet nectar. Nelaballi knew before the study to expect the creature to live off plant secretions, but she was surprised by how much time it spent at it.

The Bengal slow loris is a stickler for routine, always using the same routes to reach the same dining trees, a boon to the researcher during her fieldwork. If she arrived late, she knew where to find her subject.

The night after a heavy storm, she noticed a thin branch used by a loris had snapped. The animal paced back and forth, distressed by this unexpected obstacle on its highway. Reluctant to find an alternative route, it climbed on to the broken limb only to have it crash to the ground. The primate landed on all fours like a cat and stood stunned for a moment before shinning up the tree and walking along another branch to reach its dinner. And a new routine was born.

428,2020/02/15,Scientists radio-tag Indian pangolin,"Will help understand its habits: experts

Scientists have, for the first time, radio-tagged the Indian pangolin, an endangered animal, that is rarely sighted in forests here.

The Indian pangolin, which resembles an ant-eater but dons a thick scaly skin, is hunted for meat and use in traditional Chinese medicine. Researchers say tagging the animal will help understand the habits of the reclusive, nocturnal animal.

Radio-tagging involves attaching a transmitter to an animal to monitor its movements. Several wild animals — tigers, leopards and migratory birds — have been tagged over decades.

“The Special Task Force of the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department has been actively working to curb wildlife poaching in the State. In recent years, we have successfully busted pangolin-smuggling syndicates that involved poachers and smugglers from more than nine States,” said Rajesh Shrivastav, Chief Wildlife Warden of Madhya Pradesh.

Pangolins are among the most trafficked wildlife species in the world. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature says these toothless animals have seen a rapid reduction in population. The projected population declines range from 50% to 80 % across the genus.

Out of the eight species of pangolin, the Indian Pangolin and the Chinese Pangolin are found in India. Both these species are listed under Schedule I Part I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. “In anti-poaching operations, during which pangolin scales are recovered, those animals are already dead. Where live pangolins are involved, globally there is about 50% death rate among released pangolins. Given that several pangolins are rescued in the central Indian landscape, this new initiative by the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department and the Wildlife Conservation Trust (WCT) is to ensure better survival rates of these released individuals in the wild, and thus have a positive impact on the population of this endangered species,” said Aditya Joshi, wildlife biologist with the WCT, who is overseeing this project.

World Pangolin Day, celebrated on the third Saturday in February, is an international attempt to raise awareness of pangolins and bring together stakeholders to help protect these unique species from extinction.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/5jk2ks/article30823692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14PANGOLIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/scientists-radio-tag-indian-pangolin/article30823693.ece
429,2020/02/15,This recently concluded dog show was an educative treat for all,"Love at fur sight: From strapping Kombais to Labrador that just wouldn’t stop wagging their tails, the 33rd and 34th All Breed Championship Dog Show by the Madurai Canine Club featured an all-star cast

The 200-plus dogs at Gandhi Museum grounds were a treat to watch: their gait, temperament, and bow-bows warmed hearts. Their owners, beaming with pride, shared grooming tips to inspire more people to adopt dogs.

There were 60 native Indian breeds including the Rajapalayam or the Mudhol hound, Kanni, Kombai, Chippiparai, kithari, sambal and the caravan hound that registered for the show. The foreign breeds evoked curiosity, but it was the Indian ones that stole the show that was held last Sunday. Ten Manthais showed off their strengths in a parade: tall, energetic and intelligent, the dogs also have a keen sense of smell and sight, making them able guard dogs.

P Krishnan from Ramanathapuram, whose family has been rearing the native breed for almost a century, brought his pair. Resting them after the walk, he explained that native dogs adapt well to any condition and are unfussy. “They have a lifespan of up to 15 years. In the past, they were given as gifts to grooms during marriages in villages in southern Tamil Nadu as they were used to guard agricultural fields and also taken for hunting,” he said, adding, “There are many dog sculptures in temple architecture in Ramanathapuram district, as proof to this practice.” He hoped that the annual show encouraged people to adopt dogs as pets and created awareness on the different breeds.

The other native breeds also seemed to socialise well with everyone. They displayed their characteristic fighter spirit and developed an instant rapport with the crowd that kept cheering. S Ramanathan, the secretary of the Madurai Canine Club affiliated to the Kennel Club of India, said he was happy with the increasing number of participants each year. The club was established in 1998 and this was their 21st consecutive show. Like many previous years, dogs were paraded in two arenas and judged separately by judges Robert L T Dawson from Korea and Jonathan Mesach from Indonesia. They judged the dogs in three rounds on the basis of the standard breed size, their agility and obedience.

“Two separate score sheets help fetch more prizes and increase the probability of winning,” said Ramanathan. What was also encouraging, was the presence of 40 dogs of unknown pedigree that were brought for enrolment from various parts of the State. “With the certification process initiated, they would be ready to participate in dog shows by next year,” he added. Ramanathan said that he was the first to introduce a Rottweiler in the 1998 show. But he refrains from bringing his pets to the events he organises now.

For dog lovers gathered there, the show proved to be educative as well. R Priya came from Bengaluru with her three pets Nike, a Rottweiler; Diva, a Shih Tzu and; Ajra, a Golden Retriever. She said she spends almost ₹One lakh on their maintenance per month and takes them to every dog show possible. At the show, her Ajra was the star, winning the championship for the third year in a row.

Priya runs a pet salon in Bengaluru with her husband. “Dogs require proper care. They have to be groomed well. It does well to pamper them with massages and hair cuts too,” she explained.

Robert, one of the judges, said, “We use the Kennel Club of India’s standards as a benchmark to judge such shows. Over the years, awareness about native breeds has grown manifold. It is a welcome sign, though it is reported that native breeds are declining in numbers.”

S Ramesh, a first-timer at the event, was astonished by the variety he saw. A Great Dane that was 82 cm tall, weighing 90 kilogram, a Chihuahua that would fit in a handbag, a miniature Daschund, a sober Pug, an English Mastiff, German Shepherd, Labrador, Beagle, Pomerian, St Bernard, Doberman, French Bull and Miniature Pinscher, they were all there looking their cutest best. “I am glad I came here.

430,2020/02/15,Zydus Cadila launches research programme to develop vaccine for COVID-19,"Multiple teams from India and Europe are working on it

Pharmaceutical major Zydus Cadila on Saturday said it has initiated an accelerated research programme with multiple teams in India and Europe for developing a vaccine for coronavirus.

The first approach deals with development of a DNA vaccine against the major viral membrane protein responsible for the cell entry of the SARS-CoV virus, now called COVID-19, the company said in a statement.

The plasm id DNA would be introduced into the host cells, where it would be translated into the viral protein and elicit a strong immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system, which play a vital role in protection from disease as well as viral clearance.

The second approach deals with development of a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vectored vaccine against COVID-19. The recombinant measles virus (rMV) produced by reverse genetics would express codon-optimised proteins of the novel coronavirus and will induce long-term specific neutralizing antibodies, which will provide protection from the infection.

“There is an urgent and pressing need to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine that can prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Our researchers are working to bring a speedy solution to this most devastating outbreak in recent times,” Zydus Group Chairman Pankaj R Patel said.

While the government’s efforts are commendable, it’s too soon to rejoice, warn health experts. C. Maya reports on a State on tenterhooks

On January 30, Swaraj Round in the heart of Thrissur town was bustling as usual. Shops were open, and vehicles crowded the streets. Around 2 p.m., however, suddenly all hell broke loose. The very calm yet grave-looking Health Minister of the State, K.K. Shailaja, had just made a formal announcement on television. The first imported case of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in India had been confirmed in Kerala, she said. The patient was being monitored in Thrissur town at the General Hospital located on Swaraj Round. The patient was a female student who had returned home from Wuhan, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak in China.

As the news spread, panic-stricken people formed queues outside pharmacies to buy face masks. Others covered their faces with dupattas and hurried home. Patients from the General Hospital quickly got themselves discharged. Breathless coverage unfolded on news channels.

The girl was one of the hundreds of Malayali medical students studying in Wuhan University in Hubei Province. She had come home for the Lunar New Year holidays. She had reached Thrissur on January 24 via Kolkata and Kochi. Seeing an alert about the virus, she had gone to the nearest primary health centre at Mathilakam to inform the health officials about her travel. As she did not have any symptoms then, the officials gave her the number of the District Surveillance Officer and asked her to dial the official in case she came down with a flu. When she developed a sore throat three days later, she promptly contacted the officer and was rushed to the hospital. She was placed in the isolation ward and her blood/throat swab samples were collected and sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for testing. Thrissur was anxious and afraid, but Kerala was prepared.

Surveillance strategy

Late in December, when news about the mystery Chinese virus trickled in, Kerala, like the rest of the world, watched the evolving situation, concerned. Days later, as the number of patients with COVID-19 steadily grew, China began to initiate extraordinary measures. It temporarily shut down public transport and locked down entire cities. Immediately, in distant Kerala too, surveillance and emergency preparedness measures began to be launched.

As soon as the World Health Organization (WHO) sent out a notification on the disease on January 18, all those who are part of the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme and the district surveillance teams were alerted. They were told that increased surveillance of all SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and influenza-like illnesses was required. WHO guidelines and clinical protocols were circulated to all the districts. Kerala was especially at risk as hundreds of Malayali students, who were pursuing undergraduate medical courses or nursing courses in China, were on their way home. Seventy-two of them were from Wuhan.

“The airport-based surveillance was launched on January 23,” says Amar Fettle, State Nodal Officer for Public Health Emergencies. “We were taken aback by the large number of people we had to place under surveillance from day one. On average, we received a daily list of 100-150 persons with a recent travel history to China. Anyone with mild symptoms of flu was directly sent to the isolation wards of selected hospitals in districts. They were taken in special ambulance services that had been arranged at all the airports. Those without any symptoms were sent home with instructions that they strictly quarantine themselves at home.”

It soon became evident that all the COVID-19 cases imported to other nations were linked to Wuhan. On February 1, WHO reported that in China, 60.5% of all cases since the start of the outbreak had been reported from Hubei province. Seeing this, officials decided to change their surveillance strategy a little and observe mainly the people coming to Kerala from Wuhan. All those returning from Wuhan, whether they showed symptoms of the disease or not, were placed in isolation. And those coming to the State from other parts of China were sent home and told to remain in quarantine if they did not have any of the symptoms.

Every district was instructed to have tertiary care facilities, including an intensive care unit and ventilator support, in at least two public sector hospitals and one major private sector hospital. The State Control Cell for COVID-19 was set up at the Directorate of Health Services in the capital. Multidisciplinary teams were set up for monitoring field surveillance, hospital admissions, logistics, etc. Expert teams prepared guidelines for surveillance, lab testing and clinical management, and disseminated them to all the districts. The Health Department’s 24X7 helpline, Disha, was publicised as the first point of contact for the public to clarify any doubts regarding COVID-19 and related issues.

Going into overdrive

Though the State was prepared to tackle any outbreak, when the first positive case of COVID-19 in Kerala was detected, authorities went into overdrive. All the health personnel in the State were asked to undertake surveillance, monitoring and contact-tracing exercises. The State had learned the importance of contact tracing during the Nipah virus outbreak of 2018.

The second sample that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on February 1 belonged to a friend and fellow traveller of the girl student from Thrissur. The boy’s father recalls the sheer horror with which the family watched the news about the first positive case of COVID-19 in Kerala. “I was trembling. I immediately drove my son to the Alappuzha Medical College hospital. The scenes at the isolation ward were terrifying. Alien-like figures in full protective gear and face masks took my son inside. It sort of felt like a final goodbye,” he says. The father is quarantined at home at present. His son, who has recovered well, has been discharged.

The third positive case was confirmed on February 3. This patient too was a student from Wuhan and was kept under isolation at a district hospital in Kanhangad in Kasargod district.

“It is true that we were doing a bit of an overkill, focusing on all the Wuhan returnees and isolating them immediately,” says R. Aravind, Head of Infectious Diseases, Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College. “But the additional measures we took paid off because all the three people who tested positive were already in isolation when we detected the virus. We would have missed these cases if we had not isolated the Wuhan returnees right away because their symptoms were very mild. They would not have been admitted in hospitals in the normal course.”

Aravind says an aggressive surveillance and quarantine strategy had been evolved following reports that even asymptomatic patients could spread the disease. “Asymptomatic transmission could have been a game changer. That would have thrown all our control strategies out of gear. Given the huge number of potential returnees from China to the State and the high density of population here, we were willing to err on the side of caution,” he says.

The approach may not have been evidence-based, but the situation called for the State to always be one step ahead. The guidelines prepared by the team of clinicians were more elaborate and stringent than those of the WHO. The guidelines were also constantly revised. While the Centre suggested an incubation period of 14 days, the State extended it to 28 days. Test samples were required only of those admitted in hospitals with symptoms. But as the debate about possible asymptomatic transmission raged, Kerala authorities decided to collect test samples from everyone who had returned from Wuhan after January 15.

In the initial days, it was difficult to conduct surveillance and impose quarantine, says V. Meenakshy, Additional Director of Health Services, Public Health: “Most people thought our response was exaggerated. We appealed to people to voluntarily report to us if they had any travel history to China because surveillance is not always foolproof. But people were trying to evade us so that they would not be forced into quarantine. Everything changed after the first positive case of COVID-19 surfaced. Suddenly self-reporting increased. Our helplines were inundated with calls.”

A nightmare called contact tracing

Surveillance officers had to undertake the painstaking exercise of contact tracing. According to the WHO, people in close contact with someone who is infected with a virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, are at higher risk of becoming infected themselves, and of potentially further infecting others. The patient’s contact with friends, co-travellers, taxi drivers, cleaning staff in hotels, people on the streets and so on had to be traced by the authorities. Needless to say, the list of contacts was endless. For the first positive case in Thrissur, 82 contacts were identified; for the infected person in Alappuzha, 52 contacts were traced.

But it was tracking the contacts of the third patient in Kasargod that turned out to be an exercise in patience and tenacity, Meenakshy says. “The patient had gone to Kolkata from Wuhan and then taken a flight to Bengaluru. He travelled in a taxi and stayed at a hotel. The next day he took another taxi to the airport and boarded a flight to Kochi. From the airport he took an auto rickshaw to Angamaly, stayed at a hotel, and later caught a train to Kanhangad. His friend and his uncle met him at the railway station and dropped him home. Retracing his route and identifying possible contacts was really a nightmare,” she says. Flory Joseph, the epidemiologist leading the surveillance team at the Kasargod district hospital, says they managed to track down 186 persons who might have come in contact with the patient. “With each person, we had to explain the situation, allay their fears, and call them daily to ensure that they were fine,” she says. This is not an unfamiliar exercise for the Health Department of Kerala which tracked over 2,500 people during the 2018 Nipah virus outbreak.

Banking on the Nipah experience

In fact, the entire framework of Kerala’s response to the threat of a possible public health emergency due to COVID-19 is based on its experience in managing the Nipah outbreak. The Nipah outbreak took the State health system by surprise. With a high case fatality rate of 88.9%, the virus created a lot of panic. By the time the outbreak was contained, 17 people had died.

Though the State identified the infectious agent with the second case and launched control measures, Nipah had already spread to multiple sites from the index case (the patient in an outbreak who is first noticed by the health authorities). Epidemiological investigations later revealed that the index case was a “super spreader”; he had transmitted the infection to 19 people. The lesson from the episode was stark: simple and universal infection control protocols in hospitals would have prevented human-to-human transmission and saved lives.

“Following this there was a heightened sense of awareness in hospitals that simple infection-control measures such as washing hands and using personal protective equipment could ensure the safety of healthcare personnel. Nurses in all our hospitals underwent intensive training in infection-control protocols in the post-Nipah period,” says Aravind.

As part of improving disease surveillance, outbreak monitoring units were set up in all the medical colleges in the State last year. These units scrutinised patients in emergency wings and isolated those with acute respiratory symptoms as soon as they come in. Nipah struck again in 2019, but this time the health authorities managed to immediately spot the index case, isolate him, and treat him. No one else was infected.

When the COVID-19 alert was sounded, all these baseline preparations fell into place. The rest of the measures concerned logistics and management, which the State health administration managed well. Overnight, the State Control Cell set up 18 sub-divisions (for surveillance, training and awareness, sample tracing, transportation and ambulance, etc.), charted out the roles and responsibilities of each team, and micromanaged nearly everything, right down to roping in local self-government bodies for assistance and ensuring that families quarantined at home had adequate food and supplies delivered to them.

Stigma and fear

On the ground, though, the families of those who had tested positive went though trying times. “We were already worried about our son, but what really hurt us was the lack of support from the local community,” says the father of the boy in Alappuzha. Soon after he tested positive, the boy’s image in a family photograph began to circulate on social media. Not only was he accused of spreading the virus, but people even began avoiding his grandfather’s store, causing him big losses in business. The Nooranad police have since arrested two persons in connection with the social ostracism the family faced. The antagonism displayed by the local community towards the family only died down when the Health Department began organising awareness campaigns at the grassroots. The department also mobilised its district mental health teams to offer psycho-social support over the phone to the stressed families that had been quarantined for 28 days.

News about the virus has also affected local businesses. Parassini Prakashan, a bus conductor, says he is struggling to run the service from the Kanhangad bus stand via the district hospital as no one wants to travel by that route any more. Almost all the small and medium businesses in the locality of the district hospital have been affected. COVID-19 has also spelled bad news for Kerala tourism, already impacted by two consecutive floods and the Nipah outbreaks. There were mass cancellations of tour packages after SARS-CoV-2 was reported.

Too soon to celebrate

On February 3, when the third positive case of COVID-19 was flagged, the government declared the virus a State-specific calamity. The declaration, which raised many eyebrows, was hastily withdrawn four days later when there were no more positive cases. Kerala remains on high alert and surveillance is still on. But the State rapid response team, which met on Wednesday, decided to relax the quarantine guidelines and relieve over a thousand people from their ordeal.

There is elation now. Some say there is overconfidence at having “got everything in control” and having successfully managed to limit the outbreak in the State to just three cases with no case of human-to-human spread. However, epidemiologists and public health experts warn that it is too early for the State to blow its own trumpet as the situation surrounding COVID-19 is still fluid and evolving. The epidemic continues to spread in China and beyond, but there is a lot that remains unknown: What are the virus reservoirs? What are the transmission dynamics? What is the period of infectiousness?

“We need to watch closely the recovery of the patients who tested positive. We need to watch them and their contacts for four weeks and make sure that they are not developing any new illnesses. How sure are we that we have only three positive cases or that there are no cases in the rest of India? We have no idea about the impact of environmental factors on virus behaviour. For Kerala, it is early days yet,” says E. Sreekumar, a senior scientist at the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology, Thiruvananthapuram.

A long way to go

No surveillance is ever foolproof. The crucial question is whether the State is accounting for the gaps in surveillance and ready with a Plan B if the scenario changes and local transmission of the disease does happen. “Kerala has a very responsive health system which has jumped into fire-fighting mode. It has mobilised all its resources to detect and contain COVID-19. But this is not a sustainable model; soon the system will wear itself out. The real strength of a health system is in its ability to keep its regular disease surveillance system alive and active through the year, pick up unusual disease trends and undiagnosed deaths, and analyse data meticulously so that it is equipped to deal with surprises without taxing the entire system,” says G. Arunkumar, Director, Manipal Institute of Virology. Both the Nipah episodes in Kerala were not picked up by the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, which means that the State has a long way to go, he says.

“While rejoicing over the ‘success’ of having contained the Nipah outbreak to the lone index case in 2019, we must understand that not every case of Nipah becomes a ‘super spreader’,” he says. In 2019, the index case did not lead to further infections because the patient had encephalopathy and not respiratory symptoms. Arunkumar, who led the epidemiological investigation that unravelled Kerala’s first Nipah encounter, cautions the State against relying too much on its Nipah strategy while dealing with COVID-19. “Drawing upon the experience of fighting Nipah is fine, but it is crucial to understand that Nipah and COVID-19 do not share the same epidemiology. The surveillance and control strategies for each are different. Nipah is not capable of sustained transmission and disappears when the virus runs its natural course. But COVID-19 is a multi-focal outbreak with a potential for sustained transmission. The odds that it is going to be a long-term problem requiring long-term engagement are quite high. Kerala would do well to be prepared for it,” he warns. Also, because of the mild nature of the illness caused by COVID-19, it is unlikely that the system will pick up low-level community transmission of the virus right now. In China too, the outbreak was picked up only when a sudden cluster of viral pneumonia cases appeared in hospitals, he says. The next step for Kerala would be to set up a surveillance mechanism for detecting viral pneumonia clusters, especially among older individuals, in hospitals, Arunkumar suggests. Testing all X-ray-positive viral pneumonia cases in hospitals for COVID-19 would help the State pick up the first case of the viral illness if the virus is active in the community, he says.

While Kerala rejoices, it would do well to prepare for the long haul as China continues to report more deaths due to COVID-19.

434,2020/02/15,How small regulatory molecules are generated in plants,"All growth and development in plants are regulated at various levels in the cell, and mediated by proteins

Researchers from National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bengaluru, and SASTRA University, Thanjavur, have discovered how small molecules called microRNAs are made in plants. This finding makes it much easier for studying processes in plants. MicroRNAs are small molecules, about 21 nucleotides long, and help in controlling the levels of proteins in the cell. The research was published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research.

All aspects of growth and development of plants, whether it is initiation of flowering or control and distribution of hormones in response to external stress, are regulated at various levels in the cell. Such regulation is always mediated by proteins – the work horses of the cells. At one level, regulation of the processes is about controlling the amount of specific proteins being made in the cells. This is achieved by the microRNAs.

In order to decrease the level of a particular protein in specific cells, the microRNAs destroy the messenger RNA molecules that help with the production of that specific protein in the cell. The microRNA molecules do this by cutting down that particular messenger RNA thereby destroying it. This process is called the silencing of the messenger RNA. The microRNA that achieve this silencing are evolutionarily conserved – that is, they are found in all flowering plants, whether they are mosses or roses.

Similarly, the best way to study the effect of a gene in the DNA is to silence or “knockout” the gene. Knocking out a gene does not mean removing the entire gene. In knocking out processes, those RNA that induce the gene to produce proteins are destroyed or their levels are reduced by the microRNA as described earlier.

MicroRNA structure

In this new research, the team has found that microRNAs have a high occurrence of the bases G and C and this helps their formation and abundance in the cells. Further, there is a position-specific bias for these bases in the microRNAs. This is recognised by a specific RNA-binding protein. As N. Anushree of NCBS, who is the first author of the paper clarifies, “We see more G or C in specific positions [across the length of the microRNA consisting of say, 21 nucleotides]. Such a preference is essential to make these molecules at an optimal level in the cells.”

The present way to silence genes is by introducing artificial microRNA which binds to the messenger RNA of interest and prevents the production of protein. This is done in a deliberate process of trial and error.

“Researchers try out several artificial microRNAs, introduce them into plants one by one in a cumbersome process and then pick the best one which can remove most messenger RNAs of the gene of interest. Our results can help anyone to choose the one candidate that is sure to work,” says P.V. Shivaprasad from NCBS, who led the study.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ide757/article30830594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TH-SCILEAF,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-small-regulatory-molecules-are-generated-in-plants/article30830595.ece
435,2020/02/15,Convalescent plasma therapy tested on critically ill COVID-19 patients,"Patients showed an improvement in clinical symptoms 12–24 hours after plasma infusion

In the absence of any preventive vaccine or specific antivirals for treating COVID-19 patients infected with the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pharmaceutical company in China has turned to plasma taken from people who have recovered from the infection to treat critically ill patients.

Convalescent plasma

Convalescent plasma has been listed as a therapeutic method by China’s National Health Commission.

People who have recovered from COVID-19 disease would have antibodies against the virus. Infusing the antibodies to critically ill patients is expected to improve the chances of survival. The plasma that is transfused contains the antibodies.

The company had collected plasma from some recovered patients to prepare therapeutic products including convalescent plasma and immune globulin.Plasma taken from recovered patients in Wuhan since January 20 has been given to more than a dozen patients. Initially, three critically ill patients in a hospital in Wuhan received plasma treatment on February 8. An additional 10 patients have received the treatment since then. According to Xinhua, patients who received plasma therapy showed an improvement in clinical symptoms 12-24 hours after being given the therapy. Improvement in clinical symptoms includes key indicators such as blood oxygen saturation and significant reduction in inflammatory indicators.

This is not the first time that plasma from recovered patients has been used to treat people infected with certain viruses for which drugs are not available. When Ebola struck Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia in 2014, the World Health Organization prioritised the evaluation of treatment with convalescent plasma derived from patients who have recovered from the disease.

Earlier trials

There was hardly any benefit seen in 84 patients treated with convalescent plasma in a trial carried out in Ebola patients in Guinea between mid-February and early August 2015. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

“The transfusion of up to 500 ml of convalescent plasma with unknown levels of neutralizing antibodies was not associated with a significant improvement in survival,” the authors write.

Time-tested method

“Treatment with convalescent plasma is a classical, time-tested method. It has been used against measles, chickenpox, and rabies. In the case of rabies, it is acts as passive immunisation after dog bite and before disease develops,” says virologist Dr. Jacob John.

Timing is crucial

“Best time to give convalescent plasma containing antibodies is before disease develops. In the case of COVID-19, by the time pneumonia is diagnosed it is too late. That is the reason why therapy using convalescent plasma is not popular for other viral diseases,” Dr. John adds.

According to him, as the disease develops, the body has already begun developing antibodies against the virus. Infusing convalescent plasma is essentially like topping with more antibodies hoping that increased amount of antibodies will dampen the disease progression. “Antibodies in the plasma bind to the virus and prevent them from entering the cells. But by the time it is given, many cells have already been infected. Hence, convalescent plasma therapy is not very effective,” says Dr. John.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/upn8zv/article30830584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TH-SCICOV,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/convalescent-plasma-therapy-tested-on-critically-ill-covid-19-patients/article30830585.ece
436,2020/02/15,Urban heat islands in India,"Why are our cities warmer than their suburbs and rural areas?

A recent study from IIT Kharagpur called “Anthropogenic forcing exacerbating the urban heat islands in India” noted that the relatively warmer temperature in urban areas, compared to suburbs, may contain potential health hazards due to heat waves apart from pollution. Arun Chakraborty an author of the study said, “Our research is a detailed and careful analysis of urban heat islands in India. We study the difference between urban and surrounding rural land surface temperatures, across all seasons in 44 major cities from 2001 to 2017.” He further said, “For the first time, we have found evidence of mean daytime temperature of surface urban heat island (UHI Intensity) going up to 2 degrees C for most cities, as analysed from satellite temperature measurements in monsoon and post monsoon periods.” Other researchers from elsewhere have also noticed similar rise in daytime temperatures in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai.

Understanding urban heat island effect

We know of urban water lakes (as in Bhopal, Hyderabad, Bengaluru or Srinagar) which add pleasure and coolness, but an urban heat island? An urban heat island (abbreviated as UHI) is where the temperature in a densely populated city is as much as 2 degrees higher than suburban or rural areas. Why? This happens because of the materials used for pavements, roads and roofs, such as concrete, asphalt (tar) and bricks, which are opaque, do not transmit light, but have higher heat capacity and thermal conductivity than rural areas, which have more open space, trees and grass. Trees and plants are characterised by their ‘evapotranspiration’— a combination of words wherein evaporation involves the movement of water to the surrounding air, and transpiration refers to the movement of water within a plant and the subsequent lot of water through the stomata (pores found on the leaf surface) in its leaves. Grass, plants and trees in the suburbs and rural areas do this. The lack of such evapotranspiration in the city leads to the city experiencing higher temperature than its surroundings.

UHI s also decrease air quality in the cities, thanks to pollution generated by industrial and automobile exhaust, higher extent of particulate matter and greater amounts of dust than in rural areas. Due to this higher temperature in urban areas, the UHI increases the colonisation of species that like warm temperatures, such as lizards and geckos. Insects such as ants are more abundant here than in rural areas; these are referred to as ectotherms. In addition, cities tend to experience heat waves which affect human and animal health, leading to heat cramps, sleep deprivation and increased mortality rates. UHIs also impact nearby water bodies, as warmer water (thanks to the pavements, rooftops and so on) is transferred from the city to drains in sewers, and released into nearby lakes and creeks, thus impairing their water quality.

It is painful to realize that Bengaluru, once known for its salubrious climate, now has UHIs, even in places like Koramandala and Jayanagar. The rapid expansion of buildings, industrial parks and associated high-rise apartments in suburbs, such as Electronic City and Whitefield, has made the city insalubrious (read: <urba-heat-island-effect-report>, prepared by The Energy and Resources Institute, India). Some of its praiseworthy lakes are dirty and diseased. Likewise, when my family and I moved to Hyderabad in 1977, we were told that we do not need air conditioning or even ceiling fans at night. Now, we have UHIs, again due to reckless expansion of industrial parks, factories and associated buildings in what was once a vast suburb, which has now become the third city called Cyberabad. These have not only led to formation of UHI but also the associated pollution due to a drastic reduction in the Air Quality Index (AQI), thanks to the exhausts from industries and automobiles. The ‘safe’ AQI is thought to be between 61-90 units (when particles from the air enter the human and animal bodies causing discomfort and illness), but in places like Delhi it has gone to very poor–to-dangerous levels of about 323. Fortunately, it is still on the safe side in Hyderabad and Bengaluru, but it is time to take steps to keep it low.

Control of UHIs and mitigation

Industrialisation and economic development are vital to the country, but the control of UHIs and their fallouts are equally vital. Towards this, several methods are being, and can be, tried. One of them is to use greener rooftops, using light-coloured concrete (using limestone aggregates along with asphalt (or tar) making the road surface greyish or even pinkish (as some places in the US have done); these are 50% better than black, since they absorb less heat and reflect more sunlight. Likewise, we should paint rooftops green, and install solar panels there amidst a green background.

The other is to plant as many trees and plants as possible. It is interesting to realise how beneficial trees are to us. The organisation Treepeople lists as many as 22 benefits from trees and plants (see <Tree people .org/tree-benefits>). Relevant to the present context are: they combat climate change; clean the surrounding air by absorbing pollutant gases (NXOy, O3, NH3, SO2, and others) and trapping particulates on their leaves and bark; cool the city and the streets; conserve energy (cutting air-conditioning costs by 50%); save water and help prevent water pollution; help prevent soil erosion; protect people and children from UV light; offer economic opportunities; bring diverse group of people together; encourage civic pride by giving neighbourhoods a new identity; mask concrete walls, thus muffling sounds from streets and highways, and eye-soothing canopy of green; and the more a business district has trees, more business follows. So, plant as many trees and plants as you can around and between your buildings, schools, houses and apartment complexes. But, ‘token’ planting will not do, nurturing them year after year is vital!

437,2020/02/15,Researchers decode how malaria parasite multiplies,"Two large protein complexes help the parasite proliferate

With over 4,00,000 deaths in 2018, according to the WHO, malaria still remains one of the biggest killer infections globally, concentrated mainly in Africa and India. The disease is caused by the parasite Plasmodium and transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito. To understand in detail how this parasite multiplies within a mosquito, an international team of researchers spent years studying different proteins in the parasite. Their study published in Cell Reports has found two important proteins essential for proliferation. These finding can help develop new drugs and thus pave way for malaria eradication.

The team found that two large protein complexes (condensins) called SMC2 and SMC4 played essential roles in the parasite proliferation. One of the co-authors Prof. Rita Tewari in an email to The Hindu says: “It means that these molecules are required for every stage of parasite multiplication, and even in the cyst-like structure in the mosquito (oocyst) where the infective stage of the parasite develops. It is at this stage that it is injected into humans through mosquito bite.” She is from the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nottingham.

The team showed that when genes behind these proteins were deleted, the number of oocysts in the mosquito gut significantly reduced and were smaller in size compared to the normal ones.

Adaptable parasite

Prof. Tewari adds in a release: “This malaria parasite is very adaptable. Even if you kill it in the human bloodstream, some of these sex cells taken in by the mosquito during a bite can develop and multiply further in the mosquito. Over time, it [the parasite] has adapted to survive and multiply using different modes, which is why it is difficult to control the disease.”

The malaria parasite has different models of multiplication in different stages of its life cycle, and it is essential to track down all the important proteins behind it for developing a new effective drug. “We are now studying the novel modes of parasite cell division and the crucial regulatory molecules which are involved in the success of the parasite cell division,” adds Prof. Tewari.

“With the increase in drug-resident malaria cases, it is essential and urgent to find new drug targets. These two proteins are conserved across all Plasmodium species and were found to be important for parasite multiplication. This adds a step towards exploring new drug targets” adds Dinesh Gupta, leader of the Translational Bioinformatics Group from the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi.
